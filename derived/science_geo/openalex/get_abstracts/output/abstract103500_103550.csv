https://openalex.org/W2055492254,"The avian skeletal α-actin gene was used as a template for construction of a myogenic expression vector that was utilized to direct expression of a human IGF-I cDNA in cultured muscle cells and in striated muscle of transgenic mice. The proximal promoter region, together with the first intron and 1.8 kilobases of 3'-noncoding flanking sequence of the avian skeletal α-actin gene directed high level expression of human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in stably transfected C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myoblasts and transgenic mice. Expression of the actin/IGF-I hybrid gene in C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> muscle cells increased levels of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor and contractile protein mRNAs and enhanced myotube formation. Expression of the actin/IGF-I hybrid gene in mice elevated IGF-I concentrations in skeletal muscle 47-fold resulting in myofiber hypertrophy. IGF-I concentrations in serum and body weight were not increased by transgene expression, suggesting that the effects of transgene expression were localized. These results indicate that sustained overexpression of IGF-I in skeletal muscle elicits myofiber hypertrophy and provides the basis for manipulation of muscle physiology utilizing skeletal α-actin-based vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2109662937,"The cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and the growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are known to induce early response genes such as c-fos and c-jun in various cell types. Activation of AP-1, a heterodimeric complex of Fos and Jun proteins, is required for matrix metalloproteinase production and cell proliferation. However, the signaling pathways by which these two factors influence the expression and activities of AP-1 remain currently poorly characterized. Several studies have shown that cytokines induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, but growth factor induction of ROS has not been reported. In the present study we demonstrate that both TNFα and bFGF induce ROS production, and that this is a common signaling event involved in the stimulation of c-fos gene expression in chondrocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first report directly demonstrating ROS production upon stimulation with a growth factor. TNFα and bFGF induction of ROS production is mediated through flavonoid-containing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the ROS nitric oxide is not responsible for the induction of c-fos expression by TNFα and bFGF. In addition, the inhibitory effects of antioxidants on c-fos expression may account for their protective roles against proliferative and inflammatory diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2166431178,"The pathologic picture in ischemic tissue injury shares features with the inflammatory response, including production of proinflammatory cytokines. Hypoxia-mediated induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties, could set in motion mechanisms limiting inflammation in ischemia. Exposure of cultured endothelial cells (ECs) to H (pO2 ≍12–16 torr) increased transcription of IL-6, elevated levels of IL-6 mRNA, and induced elaboration of IL-6 antigen in a time-dependent manner. Exposure of mice to hypoxia increased IL-6 transcripts in the lung, and immunostaining revealed a striking increase in IL-6 antigen in pulmonary vasculature. Transfection of ECs with deletion chimeric IL-6 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs showed hypoxia-mediated 9–11-fold induction with –1200/+13, –596/+13, and –225/+13 but no induction with –111/+13. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using –225/–111 as the labeled probe demonstrated enhanced binding activity in nuclear extracts of hypoxic ECs and lung; the appearance of the gel shift band was prevented by excess unlabeled probe (–225/–111), and hypoxia-mediated enhancement of the band was blocked by a probe corresponding to the nuclear factor (NF)-IL-6 site (–158/–145). The hypoxia-enhanced band on EMSA displayed a supershift with antibody to CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBP-β), but antibody to C/EBP-α or -δ was without effect. Transfection of ECs with a construct comprising thymidine kinase promoter, –225/–111 in either the 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ orientation, and the reporter CAT showed this region to be an enhancer (≍8-fold) under hypoxia. EMSA with the NF-IL-6 probe revealed a prominent induction of binding activity with nuclear extracts from hypoxic ECs and whole lung. Constructs with –158/–145 and the CAT reporter gene showed induction when transfected into hypoxic ECs, whereas a similar construct with the NF-IL-6 motif mutationally inactivated failed to display hypoxia-induced expression. Furthermore, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene, whose product contributes to ischemic pathology and contains a putative regulatory NF-IL-6 site, demonstrated enhanced binding activity for its NF-IL-6 motif and induction of TNF mRNA based on analysis of hypoxic lung. These data indicate that hypoxia induces expression of IL-6, most likely a result of hypoxic activation at the NF-IL-6 site, and suggest that other genes with regulatory NF-IL-6 sites may also be induced by a similar mechanism.

In view of parallels between the pathologic picture in ischemia and that associated with inflammation (1Granger D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1269-H1275PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mullane K. Smith C. Pathophysiology of Severe Ischemic Myocardial Injury. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1990: 239-267Google Scholar), recent studies have focused on ischemia-related induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; EC(s), endothelial cell(s); NF, nuclear factor; C/EBP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s); bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; TK, thymidine kinase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor.)-α, interleukins (IL)-l and -8 by endothelial cells (ECs), and mononuclear phagocytes (3Shreeniwas R.

Nowygord R. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Such cytokines induce endothelial expression of leukocyte adherence molecules, stimulate directional cell migration, and thus target polymorphonuclear leukocytes to sites of ischemic injury and lead to their activation (7Pober J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 426-433PubMed Google Scholar). These mediators have also been shown to induce changes in vascular permeability and thrombogenicity, further contributing to vascular dysfunction. The potential pathologic significance of cytokines in ischemic settings is emphasized by the protective effect of blocking antibody to TNF in hepatic ischemia (8Colletti L. Remick D. Burtch G. Kunkel S. Strieter R. Campbell D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) and antibody to IL-8 in lung ischemia (9Sekido N. Mukaida N. Harada A. Nakanishi I. Watanabe Y. Matsushima K. Nature. 1993; 365: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that affects multiple cell types. The contribution of IL-6 to inflammation has been the subject of many studies. The proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 both elicit IL-6 synthesis in a range of target cells, including ECs, and stimulation by IL-6 results in expression of acute phase hepatic proteins, such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen (10Kishimoto T. Hirano T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 485-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Recent studies have addressed another facet of IL-6 activity: the role of this mediator as an anti-inflammatory agent (11Barton B. Jackson J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 6: 1496-1499Crossref Google Scholar, 12Aderka D. Le J. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3517-3523PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schindler R. Mancilla J. Endres S. Ghorbani R. Clark S.

Yi E. Remick D. delCastillo J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1097-1101PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 suppresses the generation of IL-1 and TNF in macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide in culture and in mice infused with lipopolysaccharide (12Aderka D. Le J. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3517-3523PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schindler R. Mancilla J. Endres S. Ghorbani R. Clark S. Dinarello C. Blood. 1990; 75: 40-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also attentuates the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide administered intratracheally (15Ulich T. Yin S. Guo K. Yi E. Remick D. delCastillo J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1097-1101PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of IL-6 to increase production of soluble TNF and IL-1 receptors, capable of preempting these proinflammatory ligands, also supports an anti-inflammatory role for this cytokine (25Grenett H. Danley D. Strick C. Otterness I. Fuentes N. Nesbitt J. Fuller F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 101: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In view of the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-6, we considered the hypothesis that hypoxia, a common denominator of ischemic microenvironments, might elicit IL-6 production in vascular cells, such as ECs and smooth muscle cells, thereby activating protective mechanisms. Our results indicate that IL-6 is induced in response to oxygen deprivation by hypoxia-mediated activation of nuclear binding activity for the nuclear factor (NF)-IL-6 motif. Activation of DNA-binding proteins, presumably in the C/EBP family, during oxygen deprivation could potentially regulate expression of other gene products relevant to ischemia, including IL-8, TNF, and granulocyte/colony-stimulating factor (8Colletti L. Remick D. Burtch G. Kunkel S. Strieter R. Campbell D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 16Akira S. Isshiki H. Sguita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y.

Consistent with this hypothesis, TNF transcripts were found to be elevated in hypoxic mouse lung. This indicates that activation of NF-IL-6 nuclear binding activity in hypoxic tissue has complex consequences, affecting both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Human umbilical vein ECs were prepared as described (3Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E. Brett J. Wolitzky B. Norton C. Plocinski J. Benjamin W. Burns D. Goldstein A. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2333-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). For experiments, human ECs were from passages 1–3 grown in medium 199 containing endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), heparin (90 µg/ml; Sigma), human serum (5%; Gemini, Calabasas, CA), and fetal bovine serum (15%; Gemini). Bovine pulmonary artery ECs were harvested by scraping pulmonary artery vessel segments obtained from the abattoir, and the cells were grown to passage 2–3 using minimal essential medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%; Gemini). ECs were subjected to hypoxia by placing them in an environmental chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI) which provided a controlled temperature (37 °C) and atmosphere with the indicated amount of oxygen, carbon dioxide (5%) and the balance made up of nitrogen (3Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E. Brett J. Wolitzky B. Norton C. Plocinski J. Benjamin W. Burns D. Goldstein A. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2333-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Use of this chamber for cell culture has been described previously (3Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E. Brett J. Wolitzky B. Norton C. Plocinski J. Benjamin W. Burns D. Goldstein A. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2333-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The pH of the medium remained unchanged throughout experiments; pO2 in the medium was ≍12–15 torr (oxygen was leached continuously from the tissue culture plasticware during the course of the experiments). The glucose concentration fell by 35–50% (this degree of glucose depletion does not induce the described changes in IL-6 expression described in the studies below). Mouse ECs, generously provided by Dr. R. Auerbach (University of Wisconsin, Madison; 19), were grown in DMEM containing fetal bovine serum (10%) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cultured human smooth muscle cells were prepared from aortic segments within 12 h of explantation (20Colucci W. Brock T. Gimbrone M. Alexander R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 expression by ECs was studied by examining induction of IL-6 transcripts, using PCR analysis and Southern blotting, changes in IL-6 transcription, using nuclear run-on analysis, and production of IL-6 antigen, using a specific ELISA. PCR analysis was performed on total RNA extracted from normoxic or hypoxic EC cultures using the acid-guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (Stratagene Inc., Torrey Pines, CA) using a reverse transcriptase-PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer and primers for IL-6 (mouse and human) and the housekeeping gene β-actin (obtained from Clontech, Palo Alto CA). Amplification by PCR was performed using the following thermocycling parameters for human EC and smooth muscle cell samples. Each cycle consisted of incubations at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for a total of 35 cycles for IL-6 and the housekeeping gene (cDNA was amplified simultaneously with primers for IL-6 and the housekeeping gene). Parameters for thermocycling on samples from mouse ECs were 95 °C for 2 min for one cycle, followed by 95 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles, and 60 °C for 7 min. Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under ultraviolet light, transferred to nylon membranes, and Southern hybridization was performed using 32P-labeled human or murine IL-6 cDNA (21; Clontech). The IL-6 cDNA did not contain the region included in the IL-6 primers. Nuclei were isolated, and in vitro transcription was performed as described previously (22Bartalena L. Fansetti A. Flink I.-L. Robbins J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Kasahana T. Mukaida N. Yamashita K. Yagisawa H. Akahoshi T. Matsushima K. Immunology. 1991; 74: 60-67PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled RNA was hybridized to linearized plasmid DNA (mouse IL-6 or β-actin) immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes for 48 h at 42 °C. Filters were washed first in 2 × SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C twice for 15 min each and then once in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C for 60 min followed by air drying, and exposure to Kodak x-ray film at –70 °C. ELISA for murine IL-6 antigen elaborated into culture supernatants was performed using a kit from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). The limit of detection in this assay is <8 pg/ml. Expression of IL-6 in the lungs of mice exposed to hypoxia was studied by PCR analysis and immunostaining. Mice (CD1) were subjected to oxygen deprivation as described previously (6Karakurum M. Shreeniwas R. Chen J. Pinsky D. Yan S.-D. Anderson M. Sunouchi K. Major J. Hamilton T. Kuwabara K. Rot A. Nowygord R. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) using a controlled environment chamber. Animals were placed in the chamber and allowed free access to food and water. The system parameters were adjusted to a final oxygen concentration of 6% oxygen with the balance of the gas mixture made up of nitrogen (6Karakurum M. Shreeniwas R. Chen J. Pinsky D. Yan S.-D. Anderson M. Sunouchi K. Major J. Hamilton T. Kuwabara K. Rot A. Nowygord R. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). At the indicated times, mice were sacrificed, and lung tissue was collected for extraction of total RNA using the acid-guanidinium method as described above. PCR utilized primers for murine IL-6, TNF-α, and for β-actin (all from Clontech) and was performed as described. For immunostaining, lung was rapidly harvested from normoxic or hypoxic animals, fixed overnight with formalin (3.5%) in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin by standard procedures (24Brett J. Schmidt A.-M. Zou Y.-S. Yan S.-D. Weidman E. Pinsky D.P. Neeper M. Przysiecki M. Shaw A. Migheli A. Stern D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies used sections that were rehydrated, incubated in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, exposed to affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse IL-6 IgG (25Grenett H. Danley D. Strick C. Otterness I. Fuentes N. Nesbitt J. Fuller F. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 101: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), washed again, and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin followed by peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Sigma). Localization of peroxidase conjugates was revealed using aminoethylcarbazole as the chromogen. Nonimmune rabbit IgG replaced the anti-IL-6 IgG for controls. Transient transfection was performed with deletion chimeric constructs of the IL-6 promoter with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene including: pIC1200 (–1200/+13), pIC596 (-596/+ 13), pIC225 (-225/+13) and pIC11O (–110/+13) as described previously (21Ray A. Tatter S. May L. Sehgal P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Ray A. Sassone-Corsi P. Sehgal P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5537-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27Ray A. LaForge K. Sehgal P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Two additional constructs, pTKCi (225/111) and pTKCi (111/225), consisting of the thymidine kinase basal promoter (pTKC; –80/+18) ligated to the indicated portion of the IL-6 promoter, as described (26Ray A. Sassone-Corsi P. Sehgal P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5537-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To analyze further the contribution of the NF-IL-6 site (–158/–145) to hypoxia-mediated induction of IL-6, a wild type and a series of mutationally inactivated constructs were made (termed the YSF series). The YSF series of oligonucleotides were annealed as follows.Tabled 1YSF-1 (for pYSF52)CACATTGCACAATCTGCCGGGTGTAACGTGTTAGACTTAAYSF-2 (for pYSF53)CACACTACACAATCTGCCGGGTGTGATGTGTTAGACTTAAYSF-3 (for pYSF54)CACATTGCAAACTCTGCCGGGTGTAACGTTTGAGACTTAAYSF-4 (for pYSF55)CACACTACAAACTCTGCCGGGTGTGATGTTTGAGACTTAA Open table in a new tab They contain flanking ApaI and EcoRI sites and were cloned into pGEM-7Zf(+) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter. The CAT fragment was inserted between HindIII and BamHI sites on pGEM-7Zf(+) to give pYSF52, pYSF53, pYSF54, and pYSF55. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of each of these constructs (see Fig. 7). These three mutations have previously been shown to render the NF-IL-6 site inactive (16Akira S. Isshiki H. Sguita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 8: 1897-1906Crossref Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 28Hensel G. Meichle A. Hizenmaier K. Kronke M. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 347-351PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate-mediated cotransfection procedure for adherent cells (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was employed with the following modifications. Briefly, the day before transfection, exponentially growing cells were harvested by trypsinization, replated at a density of 1.2 × 106/100-mm dish in DMEM containing fetal bovine serum (5 and 7% for HeLa and ECs, respectively), and cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitates were prepared by adding chimeric IL-6 promoter-reporter plasmid DNA (10–20 µg) and pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (2–10 µg) to deionized water (0.5 ml) with CaCl2 (0.25 m), mixing with an equal volume of Hepes-buffered saline, and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitate was added dropwise to plates, and the mixture was swirled to achieve uniform mixing and returned to the incubator. For ECs, after 8–12 h of transfection, cultures were washed twice with balanced salt solution, and then the medium was changed to DMEM containing 7% fetal bovine serum. After another 28 h at 37 °C, the medium from EC cultures was aspirated, cells were washed with balanced salt solution, and one of the indicated medium changes was made for each of the following experimental conditions. For hypoxic and normoxic conditions, serum-free DMEM was added; for serum induction, DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum as added. EC cultures were then incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in either normoxia or the hypoxia chamber. For HeLa cells, cotransfection was performed for 36 h; the change of medium was performed as described above for ECs, and cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for another 12 h in normoxia or hypoxia. After the incubation period, cell extracts were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles, followed by heating for 10 min at 60 °C, centrifugation, and harvesting supernatant for CAT assay (Promega, Madison WI) and protein determination (Bradford assay; Bio-Rad). To control for efficiency of transfection, β-galactosidase activity (Promega) was determined in cell extracts prior to heating (this was used to normalize CAT activity in samples). EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from normoxic or hypoxic ECs, HeLa cells, or lung tissue from animals exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 4 h by the method of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). These extracts were prepared in an environment with the same ambient oxygen tension as that in the experiment. Complementary 115-bp oligonucleotides representing –225/–111 bp from the IL-6 promoter were prepared from pTKCi225/111. In other experiments, complementary oligonucleotides representing a portion of the human IL-6 (–158/–145 bp) and the human TNF (-196/-183) promoters containing a putative NF-IL-6 site (16Akira S. Isshiki H. Sguita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 8: 1897-1906Crossref Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 28Hensel G. Meichle A. Hizenmaier K.

From IL-6 this included 5′-ACATTGCACAATCT-3′ (IL-6–1) and 5′-AGATTGTGCAAT-GT-3′ (IL-6–2). From TNF oligomers included 5′-AACTTTCCAAAT-CC-3′ (TNF-1) and 5′-GGATTTGGAAAGTT-3′ (TNF-2). Oliognucleotides were annealed and 5′-end labeled with [32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) with T4 polynucleotide kinase using standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed by preincubating nuclear extract protein (1–5 µg) in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 m EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitoln 2 µg poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by the addition of the double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (≍35 fmol) and a second incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Where indicated, antiserum to C/EBP-α, -β, or -δ (1 µl of 1:10 dilution; generously provided by Dr. S. McKnight, Tularik, South San Francisco, CA) was incubated with nuclear extract at room temperature for 1 h, and then the procedure was as above. Samples (5 µg of protein in each lane) were loaded directly onto nondenaturing polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (4% for the 115-bp probe; 8% for the 14-bp probe) prepared in 45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 0.1 m EDTA (0.5 × TBE). Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 1.5–2 h at 200 V. For competition studies, a 100-fold molar excess of one of the above unlabeled probes was employed or unlabeled 18-bp probe for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-l (32Semenza G. Wang G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar) was used. In the latter case the probe included 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′ (HIF-1–1) and 5′-TGAGA-CAGCCGTAGGGC-3′ (HIF-1–2). Oligonucleotide probes for Spl, used as controls for nonspecific binding, were as described previously (33Anderson M. Freytag S. Mol. Cell.

Exposure of cultured murine, human, or bovine ECs to hypoxia (pO2) ≍12–14 torr) did not alter cell viability as assessed by (i) continued incorporation of [3H]leucine into protein with a reduction of only ≍30% at the longest time points, 24 h of hypoxia; (ii) lack of release of intracellular contents, such as lactate dehydrogenase; (iii) continued exclusion of trypan blue; and (iv) maintenance of cell adherence to the growth substrate. This is consistent with results of previous studies (3Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E. Brett J. Wolitzky B. Norton C. Plocinski J. Benjamin W. Burns D. Goldstein A. Stern D. J.

Despite maintenance of cellular integrity, this degree of hypoxia has been shown to induce changes in EC expression of genes relevant to vascular homeostasis, such as IL-1 and -8 (3Shreeniwas R. Koga S. Karakurum M. Pinsky D. Kaiser E. Brett J. Wolitzky B. Norton C. Plocinski J. Benjamin W. Burns D. Goldstein A. Stern D. J. Clin.

Exposure of murine ECs to hypoxia resulted in time-dependent elaboration of IL-6 antigen into culture supernatants compared with normoxic controls (Fig. 1A). IL-6 increased by 2 h of hypoxia, continued to accumulate for up to 5 h, and then appeared to level off. PCR analysis of murine ECs exposed to hypoxia demonstrated induction of IL-6 transcripts by 2 h with sustained expression up to 4 h (Fig. 1BI). The identity of these amplicons was confirmed by Southern blotting with a human IL-6 cDNA (Fig. 1BII). Amplification of β-actin transcripts in the same samples did not show parallel induction of this housekeeping gene under these conditions (Fig. 1BIII). Consistent with these results, human ECs subjected to hypoxia also demonstrated enhanced levels of IL-6 transcripts in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1CI–II), without change in the level of transcripts for the housekeeping gene control (Fig. 1CIII). That induction of IL-6 transcripts in hypoxia was not limited to ECs was indicated by PCR analysis of hypoxic human vascular smooth muscle cells, which also demonstrated induction of IL-6 transcripts (Fig. 1D). In view of the previous association of hypoxia with increased transcription of certain genes relevant to vascular function, such as endothelin and IL-8 (6Karakurum M. Shreeniwas R. Chen J. Pinsky D.

Hannan R. Faller D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 86: 670-674Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar), we inquired whether increased levels of IL-6 transcripts could be due to an increased rate of transcription. Nuclear run-on analysis showed an ≍8-fold increase in IL-6 transcription in nuclei harvested from hypoxic ECs, compared with their counterparts in normoxia (Fig. 2A, IL-6), based on densitometry (Fig. 2B). Transcription of β-actin appeared to be unchanged under the same conditions (Fig. 2, β-actin). These data indicate that hypoxia increases transcription of the IL-6 gene compared with the housekeeping gene β-actin and suggest that this contributes, at least in part, to increased levels of mRNA observed in hypoxic cells by PCR (Fig. 1, B and C). To extrapolate these data to the in vivo setting, up-regulation of IL-6 was studied in vivo using"

Incubation of 50 nM HP-TR and 0.5 mM NADPH with 300 μM 15-HPETE for 5 min resulted in formation of 16.5 μM 15-HETE. After 60 min, 74.7 μM 15-HPETE was reduced. The rate of the reduction of 15-HPETE by the HP-TR/NADPH peroxidase system was increased 8-fold by the presence of 2.5 μM selenocystine, a diselenide amino acid. In this case, 15-HPETE was catalytically reduced by the selenol amino acid, selenocysteine, generated from the diselenide by the HP-TR/NADPH system. To a smaller extent, selenodiglutathione or human thioredoxin also potentiated the reduction of 15-HPETE by HP-TR. Hydrogen peroxide and 15-HPETE were reduced at approximately the same rate by HP-TR, thioredoxin, and selenocystine. In contrast, t-butyl hydroperoxide was reduced at a 10-fold lower rate.

Thioredoxin (Trx) is a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein with the conserved active-site sequence -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- located on a protrusion in its three-dimensional structure (6Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized thioredoxin with an active-site disulfide is reduced by NADPH and thioredoxin reductase (TR), and reduced thioredoxin is a powerful general protein disulfide reductase (6Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since its original isolation from Escherichia coli as a hydrogen donor for the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase essential for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides and DNA (8Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), many new functions have been discovered (6Holmgren A. Annu. Rev.

Thus, thioredoxin can regulate the activity of enzymes, receptors, or transcription factors via thiol-redox control (7Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 381-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductase is a FAD-containing dimeric enzyme that has been purified and characterized from a variety of species (10Williams C.H.J. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Mammalian TR has a broad substrate specificity and reacts not only with its homologous Trx but also with E. coli Trx (11Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selenium is an essential trace element that is known to have antioxidant properties. The most established mechanism behind the antioxidant function is the formation of selenocysteine from selenide and the incorporation of this amino acid in the active site of glutathione peroxidases (17Böck A. Forchhammer K. Heider J. Leinfelder W. Sawers G. Veprek B. Zinoni F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). These enzymes detoxify hydrogen peroxide, lipid hydroperoxides, and organic hydroperoxides (18Flohé L. Dolphin B. Poulson R. Avramovich O. GSH: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 644-729Google Scholar). Selenite and GS-Se-SG are both efficiently reduced directly by mammalian TR or the complete thioredoxin system (12Björnstedt M. Kumar S.

Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In these reactions selenide (HSe-) is formed and recycles with oxygen giving rise to a non-stoichiometric large oxidation of NADPH. Recently we showed that thioredoxin reductase with or without reduced thioredoxin is an electron donor to human plasma GSH-Px in the reduction of hydroperoxides (16Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin can reduce lipid hydroperoxides and if low molecular weight selenium compounds could act as charge transfer catalysts. This could be an important alternative pathway for the detoxification of hydroperoxides in addition to GSH-Px-mediated reduction. (15S)-HPETE (purity, in excess of 96%) was obtained by incubation of arachidonic acid (Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN) with soybean lipoxygenase at 0°C (19Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (15R,S)-HPETE was prepared by autoxidation of arachidonic acid followed by isolation by silicic acid chromatography and straight-phase HPLC (cf. Ref. 20Hamberg M. Lipids. 1989; 24: 249-255Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). (15S)-HETE was prepared in quantitative yield by reduction of (15S)-HPETE with triphenylphosphine in diethyl ether. t-Butyl hydroperoxide and yeast GR were from Sigma. DL-Selenocystine was from Serva. TR from human placenta and calf thymus was purified essentially as described by Luthman and Holmgren (14Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were standardized by using 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as a substrate (14Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). E. coli TR was a homogenous preparation as described previously (13Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Trx was prepared as described by Ren et al.(21Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and was reduced prior to use with dithiothreitol followed by desalting over a Sephadex G-25 column. GS-Se-SG was prepared as described by Björnstedt et al.(12Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8030-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of selenocystine was performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, with 200 μM NADPH. The reduction was followed at 340 nm as oxidation of NADPH using a mM extinction coefficient of 6.2. To both the reference and the sample cuvette was added HP-TR. The reactions were started by addition of selenocystine to the sample cuvette and an equal volume of buffer to the reference cuvette. The final volume was 0.50 ml. The reactions were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, with 500 μM NADPH. The reduction of hydroperoxides was followed as oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm. To the cuvettes were added HP-TR, Trx, and selenocystine to final concentrations of 50 nM, 2.0 μM, and 2.5 μM, respectively. The reactions were started by addition of peroxide (150 μM) to the sample cuvette and an equal volume of 99.5% ethanol to the reference cuvette. To a reaction mixture composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mM or 1 mM NADPH was added either TR, TR + Trx, TR + selenocystine, TR + GS-Se-SG, or GR. The reactions were started by addition of (15S)-HPETE to a final concentration of 300 μM. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min (if not otherwise indicated) the reactions were terminated by rapid freezing in dry ice/ethanol. Incubation mixtures of 15-HPETE (0.5 ml) were acidified to pH 4 and rapidly extracted with 7 ml of diethyl ether. The ether phase was washed three times with water and taken to dryness. The residue was analyzed by straight-phase HPLC using a column of Nucleosil 50-5 (250 x 4.6 mm; Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany)) and 2-propanol/hexane/acetic acid (1.5:98.5:0.02, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The absorbance at 235 nm of the effluent was monitored and the digitized signal integrated using a Macintosh SE/30. The retention volumes of (15S)-HETE and (15S)-HPETE were 10.2-10.9 and 12.8-13.5 ml, respectively. (15S)-HPETE (300 μM) incubated with HP-TR or CT-TR and NADPH was reduced to (15S)-HETE (Fig. 1). In order to investigate possible stereospecificity, (15R,S)-HPETE was incubated with CT-TR/NADPH and the 15-HETE produced (32% reduction) as well as the remaining 15-HPETE (68%) were subjected to steric analysis (22Zhang L.-Y. Hamberg M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 74: 151-161Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both compounds were found to be virtually racemic (ratio of S to R enantiomers, 49.9:50.1 (15-HETE) and 50.8:49.2 (15-HPETE)). Thus there was no discrimination between enantiomers in the CT-TR-promoted reduction of 15-HPETE. The initial part of the reaction was faster using CT-TR compared with HP-TR (Fig. 1). There was an almost linear relation between the concentration of (15S)-HPETE and product formed up to 500 μM concentration of (15S)-HPETE (Fig. 2). Addition of Trx to HP-TR increased the rate of the reduction of (15S)-HPETE by 60% (Fig. 3) indicating that both proteins of the human Trx system can reduce lipid hydroperoxides. In contrast, neither E. coli thioredoxin reductase nor yeast glutathione reductase had any significant peroxidase activity (Fig. 3).Figure 2:Reduction of (15S)-HPETE as a function of substrate concentration. (15S)-HPETE (0-500 μM) was added to 0.5 ml of HP-TR (50 nM), NADPH (0.5 mM), and EDTA (1 mM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and kept at room temperature for 30 min.

Addition of GS-Se-SG or selenite to mammalian TR results in redox cycling with oxygen and a large non-stoichiometric oxidation of NADPH (12Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8030-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the reaction between TR and selenocystine, especially at high concentrations of selenocystine, the oxidation of NADPH continued after oxidation of a stoichiometric amount (Fig. 4). This is consistent with redox cycling with oxygen. Thus, selenocysteine is autoxidized by oxygen, and the resulting selenocystine is again reduced by TR. The presence of selenocystine (2.5 μM) increased the peroxidase activity of HP-TR 8-fold (Fig. 3). After 15 min of incubation of HP-TR and selenocystine 72.5% of (15S)-HPETE (or 108.8 nmol) was reduced. Similar results were obtained with two other fatty acid hydroperoxides, i.e. the α-linolenic acid-derived (13S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z),(11E),(15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid and (9S)-hydroperoxy-(10E),(12Z),(15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (data not shown). The presence of Trx only marginally increased the rate of the selenocysteine-coupled reaction (Fig. 3). Even when used in 0.5 μM concentration, selenocystine approximately doubled the rate of the TR/Trx-dependent peroxidase reaction (data not shown). Hydrogen peroxide and (15S)-HPETE were reduced at approximately the same rate by HP-TR, Trx, and selenocystine (Fig. 5). However, the rate of reduction of t-butyl hydroperoxide was slower. Addition of GS-Se-SG (5 μM) to HP-TR increased the rate of the reaction by 60% (Fig. 3). GS-Se-SG will react with TR and form selenide (12Björnstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8030-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that selenide can act as a charge transfer catalyst between TR and hydroperoxides. As a control, selenocystine (2.5 μM) without TR and NADPH was added to (15S)-HPETE (300 μM). The extent of reduction (0.6%) of the hydroperoxide did not differ from that observed with buffer (Fig. 3). Our results show that lipid hydroperoxides can be reduced by TR. The mechanism of TR-dependent peroxidase activity is likely as shown in Fig. 6A. Trx has previously been shown to slowly reduce hydrogen peroxide and other non-disulfide reagents if coupled with NADPH and thioredoxin reductase (14Luthman M. Holmgren A.

In mammalian cells selenocysteine is incorporated in proteins by a selenocysteinyl-tRNAser that recognizes the nonsense codon UGA (27Lee B.J. Worland J.N. Davis J.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Knmof this enzyme is high (0.83 mM) (29Esaki N. Nakamura T. Tanaka H. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is important only at rather high concentrations of selenocysteine. In the present study it was shown that selenocystine was efficiently reduced by TR and NADPH. Experiments with low concentrations of TR indicated that the kinetic parameters for the reaction with selenocystine are similar to that of the natural substrate thioredoxin, i.e. a low Knmand a high turnover number.2 2M. Björnstedt, M. Hamberg, and A. Holmgren, manuscript in preparation. The very fast reduction of selenocystine by TR suggests that selenocystine is kept reduced intracellularly. Rotruck et al.(30Rotruck J.T. Pope A.L. Ganther H.E. Swanson A.B. Hafeman D.G. Hoekstra W.G. Science. 1973; 179: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar) in 1973 reported the presence of selenium as a component of GSH-Px. The field of selenium and antioxidant functions have expanded to include intracellular and extracellular GSH-Px (28Burk R.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2274-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as well as synthetic selenium compounds like ebselen (31Maiorino M. Roveri A. Coassin M. Ursini F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). GSH has been considered to be the only electron source for selenium-dependent hydroperoxide reduction, but human plasma contains essentially no free GSH (32Wendel A. Cikryt P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 120: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that the human Trx system is an efficient electron donor to human plasma GSH-Px (16Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this reaction TR or TR + Trx regenerates the charge of the active-site selenocysteine, which is oxidized during the peroxidase reaction. To investigate if this selenium-coupled peroxidase activity of TR was dependent on selenium inserted in a protein, i.e. GSH-Px, we added free selenocystine and GS-Se-SG to TR. The selenium-coupled reaction involves regeneration of Cys-Se- from Cys-SeOH (Fig. 6B), in accordance with the regeneration of the active-site charge of GSH-Px (16Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cys-Se- reduces hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohol. At high concentrations of selenocystine, reduction of Cys-SeOH by Cys-Se- and formation of Cys-Se-Se-Cys will occur. A possible mechanism for the potentiation of TR-dependent peroxidase activity by GS-Se-SG is the regeneration of HSe- from HSeOH. One explanation for the higher activity of selenocystine compared with selenide is that the nucleophilicity of the selenium atom in selenocysteine should be greater than that of selenium in selenide. Selenocystine was previously reported to have a low GSH-Px activity together with 2 mM GSH and GR (25Yasuda K. Watanabe H. Yamazaki S. Toda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, this activity is unlikely to be of physiological significance since the pH optimum for the reaction was 8.0 and the reaction was observed with 10.0 μM selenocystine and the maximum turnover based on the Vmax was only 0.01 x min-1(25Yasuda K. Watanabe H. Yamazaki S. Toda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In fact sodium selenite was found to be more active than selenocystine. In the present study we found that the turnover of the selenol with hydroperoxide in the reaction catalyzed by TR was 6 x min-1. Unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides serve as intermediates in the formation of biologically important compounds such as leukotrienes and lipoxins. In other situations, lipid hydroperoxides can accumulate in tissues and exert harmful effects. Specifically, 15-HPETE, the hydroperoxide used in the present study, can oxidatively modify low density lipoprotein and has been implicated in atherosclerosis (33Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfield M.E. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Sigal E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). One pathway for the elimination of lipid hydroperoxides involves reduction in the presence of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione. The present work gives evidence for another mechanism for detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides, i.e. the reduction into alcohols in the presence of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. This pathway and its high capacity when operating together with catalytic amounts of selenocysteine could serve as an important alternative to glutathione peroxidase."

The dystroglycan complex containing α- and β-dystroglycan also serves as an agrin receptor in muscle, where it may regulate agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering at the neuromuscular junction. β-Dystroglycan has now been expressed in vitro and shown to directly interact with Grb2, an adapter protein involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. Protein binding assays with two Grb2 mutants, Grb2/P49L and Grb2/G203R, which correspond to the loss-of-function mutants in the Caenorhabditis elegans sem -5, demonstrated that the dystroglycan-Grb2 association is through β-dystroglycan C-terminal proline-rich domains and Grb2 Src homology 3 domains. Affinity chromatography has also shown endogenous skeletal muscle Grb2 interacts with β-dystroglycan. Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that Grb2 associates with α/β-dystroglycan in vivo in both skeletal muscle and brain.

https://openalex.org/W2117811396,"Platelet stimulation by thrombin leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and to the production of the D3 phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PdtIns-3,4-P2) and 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PdtIns-3,4,5-P3). Because changes in the levels of these phosphoinositides correlate with the kinetics of actin assembly, they have been proposed to mediate actin assembly, causing cell shape changes. Wortmannin and LY294002, two unrelated inhibitors of PI 3-K, were used to investigate the role of PI 3-K in platelet actin assembly and aggregation. Both PI 3-K inhibitors abrogated the production of PdtIns-3,4-P2 and PdtIns-3,4,5-P3 in thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)-stimulated cells. However, neither wortmannin nor LY294002 altered the kinetics of actin assembly or the exposure of nucleation sites in TRAP-stimulated cells. In contrast, PI 3-K inhibitors showed a specific inhibitory pattern of cell aggregation, characterized by a primary phase of aggregation followed by progressive disaggregation. Flow cytometry analysis with the PAC1 monoclonal antibody or with FITC-labeled fibrinogen indicated that wortmannin inhibited the maintenance of the platelet integrin GPIIb-IIIa in its active state. Wortmannin also inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, platelet aggregation induced by the binding of the monoclonal antibodies P256 and LIBS-6 to GPIIb-IIIa. LIBS Fab-induced aggregation also led to the production of PdtIns-3,4-P2. Platelet secretion, as evidenced by the release of preloaded 14C-5-hydroxy-tryptamine secretion or P-selectin up-regulation, was not affected by PI 3-K inhibition. These results demonstrate that the generation of D3 phosphoinositides is not required for actin assembly in TRAP-activated platelets. However, PI 3-K stimulation is necessary for prolonged GPIIb-IIIa activation and irreversible platelet aggregation. PI 3-K stimulation downstream of GPIIb-IIIa engagement may provide positive feedback required to sustain active GPIIb-IIIa. Platelet stimulation by thrombin leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and to the production of the D3 phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PdtIns-3,4-P2) and 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PdtIns-3,4,5-P3).

PI 3-K stimulation downstream of GPIIb-IIIa engagement may provide positive feedback required to sustain active GPIIb-IIIa. The functional responses of platelets to agonist-induced activation are well characterized and include actin assembly, which results in platelet shape changes, secretion of granular contents, and platelet aggregation. The signal transduction mechanisms regulating platelet secretion and aggregation are well characterized (1Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling actin assembly in cells and the role of polyphosphoinositides are less clear. The removal from actin filament ends of capping proteins such as gelsolin and adseverin, referred to as uncapping, is thought to represent a critical step in initiating actin assembly (2Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar).

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, in vivo bulk levels of PdtIns-4,5-P2 drop initially after activation (4Bengtsson T. Rundquist I.

In contrast, the correlation of the time course of actin assembly with the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PdtIns-3,4,5-P3), which is produced in response to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activation in fMLP-treated neutrophils, has led to the conclusion that it is the D3 phosphoinositides that participate in filament uncapping, although they have not been available in suitable form for testing in vitro (7Traynor-Kaplan A. Harris A. Thompson B. Taylor P. Sklar L. Nature. 1988; 334: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Eberle M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Sklar L. Norgauer J. J. Biol.

On the one hand, membrane ruffling in fibroblasts in response to platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and insulin, which presumably requires actin assembly, is prevented after PI 3-K inactivation (10Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M. Kasuga M.

On the other hand, in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils, inhibition of PI 3-K by wortmannin fails to prevent actin assembly, although it does modify assembly such that temporal oscillations in the amounts of F-actin become readily observable (13Arcaro A. Wymann M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). PI 3-K phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol, PdtIns-4-P, and PdtIns-4,5-P2, producing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PdtIns-3-P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PdtIns-3,4-P2), and PdtIns-3,4,5-P3, respectively (14Auger K.R. Serunian L. Soltoff S. Libby P. Cantley L. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Two distinct forms of PI 3-K have been described: (i) a heterodimer consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (15Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B. Auger K. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is activated by receptors with intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinase activity (16Cantley L.C. Auger K. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kappeler R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar), and (ii) a βγ-sensitive form, found in cells of myeloid lineage, which is thought to be activated in platelets and in neutrophils, respectively, by thrombin and by formyl peptides via heterotrimeric G-protein pathways (17Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F. Jackson T. Sternweis P. Hawkins P. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Thomason P.A. James S. Casey P. Downes C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two PI 3-Ks appear to be immunologically distinct, although the βγ-sensitive form has not yet been characterized at the molecular level (17Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F. Jackson T. Sternweis P. Hawkins P. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Although PdtIns-3-P, PdtIns-3,4-P2 and PdtIns-3,4,5-P3 are thought to act as secondary messengers, since they are produced by PI 3-K activation and are not substrates for phospholipases, their molecular targets have not yet been defined. In vitro evidence suggests that nonconventional protein kinase C isoforms may be regulated by PdtIns-3,4-P2 and PdtIns-3,4,5-P3, but this mechanism has yet to be confirmed by in vivo studies (19Nakanishi H. Brewer K. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K. Falck J. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D. Balias L. Cantley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin activation of human platelets leads to PI 3-K activation, as assessed by the production of PdtIns-3,4-P2 and PdtIns-3,4,5-P3 (21Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H.

Lapetina E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2441-2445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant product is PdtIns-3,4-P2, which peaks 3–4 min following thrombin stimulation (21Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5345-5348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nolan R.D. Lapetina E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5345-5348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also detected a small peak of PdtIns-3,4,5-P3, which reached a maximum 30 s following activation. Both the βγ-sensitive isoform and the conventional form of PI 3-K have been detected in human platelets (18Thomason P.A. James S. Casey P. Downes C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang J. Fry M. Waterfield M. Jaken S. Liao L. Fox J. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of PI 3-K activity in response to thrombin stimulation is complex. PI 3-K activation in response to thrombin is dependent on a heterotrimeric G-protein (18Thomason P.A. James S. Casey P. Downes C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5345-5348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional requirement for PI 3-K activation is the small G-protein Rho, which is required for PI 3-K activation in the presence of GTPγS (25Zhang J. King W. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, PI 3-K activation is increased by protein kinase C stimulation (26King W.G. Kucera G. Sorisky A. Zhang J. Rittenhouse S. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and by GPIIb-IIIa engagement, since RGDS, which prevents aggregation, prevented thrombin-induced production of PdtIns-3,4-P2 by 60–70% (27Sorisky A. King W. Rittenhouse S. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G. Levy-Toledano S. Caen J. Chap H. J.

More recently, an unrelated synthetic compound, LY294002, has also been shown to inhibit selectively PI 3-K in vitro and in human neutrophils (33Vlahos C.J. Matter W. Hui K. Brown R. J. Biol.

We have taken advantage of these compounds to study the effect of PI 3-K inhibition on actin assembly and other cellular responses in thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)-stimulated platelets. In this report, we present data demonstrating that PI 3-K is not required for the initiation of actin assembly in human platelets but is necessary for the sustained exposure of GPIIb-IIIa and for irreversible platelet aggregation. Reagents—Human thrombin, prostaglandin El, wortmannin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), fibrinogen, phallacidin, and miscellaneous chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma; thrombin receptor-activating peptide, either the 14-residue (TRAP) or the 6-residue (TRAF) forms, from Bachem, King of Prussia, PA; AC1.2, an anti-P-selectin (CD62) mouse monoclonal antibody, and RUU-PL7F12, an anti-GPIIIa (CD61) mouse monoclonal antibody, from Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA; fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG from Tago Immunologicals, BioSource International, Camarillo, CA; 32P-orthophosphoric acid and l4C-5-hydroxytryptamine from DuPont NEN.

Briefly, human blood was drawn from volunteers who had not ingested aspirin for at least 10 days into 0.1 volume of Aster-Jandl anticoagulant and centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min. Platelet-rich plasma, to which 1 µm prostaglandin E1 was added, was gel-filtered over a Sepharose 2B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) preequilibrated with platelet buffer (10 mm Hepes, 145 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 0.3% BSA, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Gel-purified platelets were rested for 60 min at 37 °C before use. The platelet concentration determined on a Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL) was typically 2.5–3.0 × 108/ml. TRAP was used to activate directly the thrombin receptor (36Vu T.-K.H. Hung D. Wheaton V. Coughlin S. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). Both the 14-residue peptide (TRAP) and the 6-residue peptide (TRAF) (37Vouret-Craviari V. Obberghren-Schilling E.V. Rasmussen U. Pavirani A. Lecocq J. Pouysségur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Vassallo R.R. Kieber-Emmons T. Cichowski K. Brass L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6081-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) gave similar results (data not shown). Resting cells were also exposed to antibodies that activate the GPIIb-IIIa receptor. In these experiments, platelets were treated with 4 µm LIBS-6 Fab or 8 µg/ml P256 F(ab′)2 for 5 min prior to the addition of 500 µg/ml fibrinogen (39Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E. Ginsberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, platelets were activated by the addition of 25 µm TRAP after preincubation for 1 min with 500 µg/ml fibrinogen. In experiments involving labeling with 32P-orthophoshoric acid, platelets were first purified from plasma by two centrifugations at 800 × g for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 µm prostaglandin El; 32P-Labeled platelets were separated from unbound 32P by gel filtration over a Sepharose 2B column. A few experiments utilized platelets prepared over a metrizamide gradient, as described previously (40Bachelot C. Cano E. Grelac F. Saleun S. Druker B. Levy-Toledano S. Fischer S. Rendu F. Biochem. J. 1991; 284: 923-928Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and gave similar results (data not shown). Wortmannin and LY294002 were preincubated with platelets at 37 °C for 15 and 10 min, respectively, before the exposure of cells to TRAP or TRAF. Wortmannin and LY294002 were added to platelets from 10 mm and 5 mm stock solutions, respectively, in dimethyl sulfoxide (ME2SO). The final concentration of ME2SO did not exceed 0.1%. Phospholipid Labeling and Extraction—Platelets isolated by centrifugation (109/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 mCi/ml of 32P-orthophosphoric acid. Unbound 32P was separated from platelets by gel filtration over a Sepharose 2B column in the presence of 1 µm prostaglandin El. After activation under aggregating conditions, lipids were analyzed as described in Auger et al. (14Auger K.R. Serunian L. Soltoff S. Libby P. Cantley L. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In experiments studying TRAP-activated platelets, lipids were extracted after exposure to TRAP for 4 min. Phospholipids produced after exposure to LIBS-6 Fab for increasing lengths of time in the presence of fibrinogen were also analyzed. To analyze phospholipids, 1 ml of purified platelets were extracted in 3.75 ml of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HC1 (20v/40v/1v). To this extract 20 µg of crude brain phosphoinositides was added as a carrier. This mixture was vortexed vigorously, and 1.25 ml of chloroform was added to separate the phases. This solution was vortexed again and spun briefly to separate the phases. The lower chloroform phase was removed to a new tube and washed once with 2 ml of methanol, 1 m HC1 (1:1) and once with 2 ml of methanol, 0.1 m EDTA (1:1). The chloroform phase was then removed to a 15-ml glass scintillation vial and dried in preparation for deacylation and SAX HPLC analysis as described elsewhere. Lipids were quantitated using a Radiomatic A500 on-line radioactivity counter (Packard). Platelet Aggregation Studies—Gel-filtered platelets (3 × 108/ml) were preincubated with or without the indicated amounts of wortmannin or LY294002. They were added to an aggregation cuvette, and the reaction was started by the addition of 25 µm TRAP and 500 µg/ml fibrinogen under constant stirring conditions. The reaction was recorded on a Chrono-Log aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA) for at least 5 min. Aggregation induced by GPIIb-IIIa antibodies was initiated after preincubating the cells with the antibody for 5 min and then adding 500 µg/ml of fibrinogen in the presence or absence of 100 nm wortmannin or 30 µm RGDS peptide. Flow Cytometry Studies—Different protocols were used depending on the particular primary antibody or ligand analyzed. To detect total GPIIb-IIIa and P-selectin using the mouse monoclonal antibodies AC1.2 or RUU-PL 7F12, respectively, platelets were first fixed after activation by adding an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde in platelet buffer and washed twice by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g. Washed platelets (2 × 107/100 µl) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either AC1.2 or RUU-PL 7F12 at saturating conditions in Hepes buffer (5 nm Hepes, 140 nm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.3% BSA. To remove unbound primary antibody, platelets were washed twice and were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with FITC-labeled F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. To detect the activated form of GPIIb-IIIa, platelets were labeled with FITC-PAC1 using a modification of the technique described by Golden et al. (41Golden A. Brugge J. Shattil S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3117-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 platelets were mixed in 50 µl with 20 µg/ml of FITC-labeled PAC1 prior to activation with TRAP. Fifteen minutes after activation, the platelets were fixed by adding an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde. The platelets were washed once and resuspended in Hepes buffer. GPIIb-IIIa exposure was also measured using the binding of FITC-fibrinogen, using a modification of the technique of Faraday et al. (42Faraday N. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Dise K. Bray P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 728-740PubMed Google Scholar). FITC-fibrinogen (100 µg/ml) was added to 200 µl of gel-filtered platelets (2 × 107/ml) prior to activation with TRAP. Platelets were fixed 15 min after stimulation with 2% paraformaldehyde. Fixed FITC-labeled platelets were read in a Becton Dickinson FACScan (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). The samples were gated for platelets, and aggregates were excluded based on forward and side scatter profiles. 10,000 events were recorded, and the results were analyzed using Lysis II software. Platelet Actin Assembly—The ability of platelet lysates to stimulate pyrene actin polymerization in vitro was determined as described previously (35Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Platelets activated with 10 µm TRAP in the presence or absence of wortmannin or LY294002 were permeabilized with 1/10 volume of PHEM buffer (60 mM Pipes, 25 mM Hepes, 10 mM EGTA, and 2 mM MgCl2) containing 0.1 µm phallacidin and protease inhibitors. Detergent lysates were assayed for actin assembly by addition of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin using a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and an emission wavelength of 386 nm. The rate of actin assembly and the number of barbed end equivalent nucleation sites were determined as described (35Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A rhodamine-phalloidin-based flow cytometry assay was used to quantitate the actin filament content of platelets. The fluorescence of bound rhodamine-phalloidin is proportional to the total amount of F-actin. Platelets under resting or activating conditions were fixed by the addition of an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde in platelet buffer without BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Fixed platelets were then permeabilized with a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 and labeled with 10 µm rhodamine phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were immediately read in a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. The samples were gated for platelets based on their forward and side scatter profile. The results are expressed as percentage of F-actin. Platelet Secretion—Platelet secretion was monitored using a 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine release assay, as described previously (40Bachelot C. Cano E. Grelac F. Saleun S. Druker B. Levy-Toledano S. Fischer S. Rendu F. Biochem. J. 1991; 284: 923-928Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Platelets were purified from platelet-rich plasma that had been preincubatcd with 0.6 mM 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine for 30 min at room temperature. Platelet activation with 25 µm TRAP was performed in an aggregation cuvette under constant stirring and was stopped after 3 min by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold EDTA. The mixture was immediately centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min. 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine was measured in the supernatants by liquid scintillation counting. The results are expressed as percentage of release of total 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine in resting platelets. Wortmannin and LY294002 Inhibit TRAP-induced PdtIns-3,4-P2 and PdtIns-3,4,5-P3 Formation—We first determined the dose response of wortmannin’s inhibitory effect on the thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)-induced PI 3-K activation. 32P-labeled platelets were activated for 4 min under aggregating conditions before lipid extraction to allow optimal production of PdtIns-3,4-P2, the major lipid product of PI 3-K activation in response to thrombin (21Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol.

Lipids from 32P-labeled platelets preincubated with increasing doses of wortmannin and activated by 25 µm TRAP were extracted and analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 1). In the absence of wortmannin, the D3-phosphoinositides formed up to 3% of total phosphoinositides, and the lipid composition showed a profile similar to that of thrombin-activated platelets (21Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Kucera G.L. Rittenhouse S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2441-2445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), confirming that TRAP activates the same signaling pathway as thrombin (43Huang R. Sorisky A. Church W.R. Simons E.R. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18435-18438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moderate increases in 32PO4 incorporated into PdtIns-4-P (3-fold) and PdtIns-4,5-P2 (1.2-fold) over resting levels were detected; this rise follows the well characterized decreases in their contents immediately after activation (5Agranoff B. Murthy P. Seguin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2076-2078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Billah M. Lapetina E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12705-12708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, TRAP stimulation resulted in a 50-fold increase in PdtIns-3,4-P2, a 3-f"
https://openalex.org/W2049053107,"Pax3 is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor expressed in the lateral dermomyotome, a region that gives rise to limb muscle progenitors. Mutations in Pax-3 account for the mouse mutant Splotch which develops without limb musculature. We demonstrate that Pax3 can inhibit myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts normally induced by exposure to low serum. Specific missense mutations that affect the DNA binding characteristics of the two distinct DNA binding domains of Pax3 abolish this effect. Furthermore, we show that Pax3 can inhibit myogenic differentiation of 10T1/2 fibroblasts transfected with MyoD, but not of 10T1/2 cells transfected with myogenin. This anti-myogenic property is shared by a PAX3-forkhead fusion protein resulting from a t(2;13) chromosomal translocation found in pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. These results suggest that Pax3 may suppress the terminal differentiation of migrating limb myoblasts and that the PAX3-forkhead fusion may contribute to the phenotype of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma by preventing terminal differentiation.

These results suggest that Pax3 may suppress the terminal differentiation of migrating limb myoblasts and that the PAX3-forkhead fusion may contribute to the phenotype of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma by preventing terminal differentiation. The molecular events leading to myogenic differentiation have been the target of intensive recent investigation leading to the discovery of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixHAhemagglutininEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaysCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseSEAPsecreted alkaline phosphatase. family of transcription factors, including MyoD and myogenin. These gene products are capable of inducing some non-muscle cultured cells to form myotubes (1Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar) and are expressed in vivo during myogenesis. Nevertheless, additional factors involved in the myogenic pathway have been implicated, especially during the differentiation of certain muscle cell types. For example, homozygous Splotch mice develop without limb musculature, although axial muscles, which are of distinct embryological origin, are normal (2Franz T. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 371-377PubMed Google Scholar). None of the known myogenic bHLH factors are expressed during development in the limbs of these mutant animals (3Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 603-612PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic defect in Splotch is a mutated or deleted Pax-3 gene (4Epstein D.J. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and Pax-3 is normally expressed in the region of the somite that will give rise to limb myoblasts (3Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 603-612PubMed Google Scholar). In man, PAX3 mutations are responsible for Waardenburg's Syndrome, a dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities of neural crest derivatives and sometimes also by abnormalities of limb musculature (5Hoth C.F. Milunsky A. Lipsky N. Sheffer R. Clarren S.K. Baldwin C.T. Am. J. of Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar, 6Baldwin C.T. Hoth C.F. Amos J.A. da Silva E.O. Milunsky A.

The involvement of Pax3 in normal myogenesis has also been implicated by the recent discovery of a specific t(2;13) chromosomal translocation responsible for some alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas in human patients (8Barr F.G. Galili N. Holick J. Biegel J.A. Rovera G. Emanuel B.S. Nature Genet. 1993; 3: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). This translocation results in the fusion of the DNA binding domains of Pax3 to the transcriptional activating domain of a novel forkhead family member (9Shapiro D.N. Sublett J.E. Li B. Downing J.R. Naeve C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5108-5112PubMed Google Scholar, 10Galili N. Davis R.J. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Rovera G. Barr F.G. Nature Genet. 1993; 5: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Other forms of rhabdomyosarcoma express high levels of Pax3 (or a closely related family member, Pax7) compared with normal human myoblasts (11Shafer B.W. Czerny T. Bernasconi M. Genini M. Busslinger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4574-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pax-3 is a member of a gene family defined by the presence of a conserved 128 amino acid DNA binding domain termed the paired box (12Walther C. Guenet J.L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Some Pax genes also contain a second DNA binding domain, a paired type homeodomain, located C-terminal to the paired domain. Finally, a C-terminal transactivating domain has been demonstrated for several Pax gene products (13Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edwards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nature Genet. 1994; 7: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 14Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Pax-3 is first expressed at embryonic day 8.5 in the mouse and is identified in the dorsal neural tube and in the region that gives rise to the neural crest, as well as in the lateral dermomyotome of the condensing somites (16Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Pax-3 expression is seen in the mouse and chick along the migratory pathways followed by limb myogenic progenitor cells and is extinguished by embryonic day 14.5 (3Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 603-612PubMed Google Scholar, 17Goulding M. Lumsden A. Paquette A.J. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 957-971PubMed Google Scholar, 18Williams B.A. Ordahl C.P. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 785-796PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Pax3 might repress myogenic differentiation during limb myoblast migration and that deregulated Pax3 activity, as might be caused by chromosomal translocation, could contribute to the phenotype of some forms of rhabdomyosarcoma. We provide evidence to support this hypothesis by demonstrating that Pax3, or the PAX3/FKHR fusion protein produced by the t(2;13) translocation, can prevent myogenic differentiation of a cultured myoblast cell line and can prevent the myogenic differentiation normally induced by MyoD, but not by the downstream bHLH regulator myogenin. The murine Pax-3 cDNA, pBH3.2, was kindly provided by Dr. P. Gruss. A BamHI-EcoRI fragment encompassing the entire coding region was subcloned into pCMVβ (Clontech) by the addition of NotI linkers and replacement of the β-galactosidase coding region. This NotI insert was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and engineered by PCR to contain three copies of a seven amino acid C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA). PCR-derived sequences were confirmed by sequencing. pCMV-Pax2 and pCMV-Pax6 have been described (19Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Specific missense mutations or deletions were engineered in pCMV-Pax3 and pCMV-PAX3/FKHR using the Unique Site Elimination mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or by overlap extension PCR (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 7: 51-59Crossref Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Retroviral vectors were constructed by inserting cDNA inserts into the retroviral vector pSRα(ΔHindIII) (21Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Replication-deficient retroviral stocks were created by transiently transfecting COS cells with C-terminal HA epitope-tagged PAX3/FKHR constructs together with a ψ;2 packaging plasmid. Conditioned medium containing virus was harvested and used to infect puromycin-resistant 10T1/2 cells (see below). PAX3/FKHR-un-1 represents a glycine to serine mutation at position 48 of PAX3 mimicking the paired domain mutation in Pax1 responsible for the mouse mutant undulated(22Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch U. Goulding M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PAX3/FKHR-ΔHd lacks the PAX3 homeodomain (amino acids 219-289). C2C12 myoblasts and 10T1/2 fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). C2C12 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes at ~50% confluence with 5 μg of purified expression vector DNA (Quiagen) in 1.5 ml of serum-free medium with 12.5 μl of Transfectam (Promega) for 6 h, and the medium was then replaced with serum-containing growth medium. When pCMV based vectors were used, molar ratio of pMC1neo (Stratagene) was included. After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and replated at a 1:10 dilution in medium containing 500 μg/ml (active concentration) of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 10-14 days of selection, individual colonies were identified and cloned with the use of cloning rings or tested for the ability to form myotubes by changing the medium to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% heat inactivated horse serum) for 48 h prior to fixation in AFA (1Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar) and staining with anti-myosin monoclonal antibody (MF20, kindly provided by Dr. Jay Schneider) and a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody kit (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories). Positively staining colonies were defined as those with more than one positively staining cell within a colony of 100 or more cells and were identified by scanning the plate under low power light microscopy. 10T1/2 cells were cotransfected by the calcium phosphate method with MyoD or myogenin cDNAs (kindly provided by Drs. H. Weintraub and E. Olson) inserted in the mammalian expression vector pEMSVscribeα2 together with molar ratio of the puromycin resistance vector pPUR (Clontech) (1Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Individual puromycin-resistant clones exhibiting a high percentage of myosin-expressing cells upon exposure to differentiation medium were selected for infection by PAX3/FKHR retrovirus. Clones doubly selected in puromycin (5 μg/ml) and G418 (600 μg/ml) for 2 weeks were tested for the capacity to undergo myogenic differentiation. RNA was isolated from cultured cells with the use of RNAzol B (Biotecx). RNase protection assays were performed as described (23Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 313-324Google Scholar). The Pax-3-specific [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probe protects nucleotides 91-345 (GenBank™ number X59358). The MyoD probe protects nucleotides 1201-1787 (GenBank™ number M18779). The myogenin probe protects nucleotides 168-556 (GenBank™ number X15784). Whole cell lysates were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated in Blotto (5% powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with 1:200 dilution of HA.11 antiserum (Babco) in Blotto, washing, and incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h (Pierce, 1:5000 dilution). Developing was performed using ImmunoPure nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate kit (Pierce). EMSA were performed as described (24Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins expressed in bacteria from pGEX2T (Pharmacia)-derived vectors encoding wild type or mutated Pax3 homeodomain protein (amino acids 190-297) or a larger construct encompassing the paired domain as well (amino acids 34-297). The proteins were purified by affinity to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and aliquots stored at −80°C. EMSA reactions included 250 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and 104 cpm of gel-purified [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe. Probes e5 (5’-TCGGGCAGCACCGCACGATTAGCACCGTTCCGCTCAGGCTCGG (25Treisman J. Harris E. Desplan C.

P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 2 μg of reporter plasmid pG5ECP3Con2X (containing tandem Nf3’ binding sites), 1 μg of expression plasmid, 0.5 μg of MAP1-SEAP (27Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and 16.5 μg of sheared calf thymus DNA. After 48 h, the supernatant was assayed for secreted alkaline phosphatase activity (SEAP) and the cells lysed in 0.25 M Tris (pH 7.8) by three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles for determination of CAT activity by thin layer chromatography; percent acetylation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Transfection efficiency was normalized to SEAP. pG5ECP3Con2X was derived from pG5ECAT which contains five GAL4 binding sites upstream of CAT (28Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of pBXG2, which encodes the GAL4 DNA binding domain and activation region II, provided a positive control (29Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). pBXG1, which lacks an activation domain, served as a negative control. In order to test the ability of Pax3 to prevent myogenic differentiation, we transfected C2C12 myoblasts with expression vectors encoding murine Pax3 and neomycin resistance and selected for stable antibiotic resistant colonies. C2C12 cells can be induced to differentiate into myosin-producing cells that fuse to form multinucleated myotubes by growth in medium containing low serum. Differentiation can be readily observed after 48 h and can be objectively assessed by staining for myosin expression with a monoclonal myosin antibody. Eighty-seven percent of G418-resistant C2C12 colonies transfected with the expression vector alone expressed detectable myosin after exposure to low serum for 48 h (Table I). However, transfection with an expression vector encoding Pax3 resulted in only 43% of colonies able to express myosin. In addition, we tested the ability of PAX3/FKHR to inhibit myogenic differentiation. This fusion protein contains the intact paired domain and homeodomain of human PAX3, fused to a truncated forkhead DNA binding domain followed by an intact forkhead transactivating domain. After transfection with PAX3/FKHR, only 27% of G418-resistant colonies expressed myosin after exposure to low serum (Table I). Hence, both Pax3 and the PAX3/FKHR fusion protein can significantly inhibit myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Deletion of the truncated forkhead DNA binding domain did not alter this affect (205/823 (25%) of colonies stained positive for myosin.)Table IPax3 and PAX3/FKHR inhibit myosin expression by cultured myoblastsC2C12 cells were stably transfected with the indicated expresson plasmids (see text for explanation of specific paired and homeodomain mutations). After selection for G418 resistance and induction of differentiation, plates were stained for myosin expression. The anti-myogenic effect of transfecting Pax3 with or without a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag was indistinguishable, and the results of both forms of Pax3 transfections are combined. 10T1/2 cells stably expressing MyoD or myogenin were infected with retrovirus encoding Pax3, PAX3/FKHR, or derivatives as indicated, induced to differentiate, and myosin staining colonies were counted. Each entry represents the sum of at least two independent transfections. Open table in a new tab C2C12 cells were stably transfected with the indicated expresson plasmids (see text for explanation of specific paired and homeodomain mutations). After selection for G418 resistance and induction of differentiation, plates were stained for myosin expression. The anti-myogenic effect of transfecting Pax3 with or without a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag was indistinguishable, and the results of both forms of Pax3 transfections are combined. 10T1/2 cells stably expressing MyoD or myogenin were infected with retrovirus encoding Pax3, PAX3/FKHR, or derivatives as indicated, induced to differentiate, and myosin staining colonies were counted. Each entry represents the sum of at least two independent transfections. In order to assess the specificity of this anti-myogenic effect, we tested the activity of Pax2 and Pax6 in this assay. These paired box family members are closely related to Pax3 and are able in vitro to bind some of the same target DNA sequences, though not others (24Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Pax2 does not contain an intact homeodomain, and Pax6 does not contain the conserved octapeptide motif located between the paired and homeodomains of other Pax family members. Neither Pax2 nor Pax6 was capable of inhibiting myogenic differentiation in our assay (223/282 (79%) and 210/261 (80%) myosin-positive colonies, respectively). Further experiments indicated that both the intact paired domain and homeodomain of Pax3 are required for the anti-myogenic effect. Mutations were engineered either in the paired domain or in the homeodomain, and the ability of the mutated proteins to inhibit myogenic differentiation was assessed. We tested several missense mutations within the paired domain, either in the context of Pax3 (BU26) or PAX3/FKHR (BU35, un-1), and we tested a missense mutation in the homeodomain of Pax3 (S268A) or deletion of the Pax3 homeodomain of PAX3/FKHR (ΔHd). In each case, the mutant proteins were unable to inhibit myogenic differentiation (Table I). The BU-26 mutation in the paired domain results in a proline to leucine replacement of amino acid 50, a mutation responsible for Waardenburg's Syndrome in at least one family (6Baldwin C.T. Hoth C.F. Amos J.A. da Silva E.O. Milunsky A. Nature. 1992; 355: 637-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This mutation results in the inability of the isolated paired domain to bind DNA sequences normally recognized with high affinity (31Chalepakis G. Goulding M. Read A. Strachan T. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and alters an amino acid seen to contact DNA in the crystal structure of the Drosophila paired protein bound to an optimized binding site (32Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We show here (Fig. 1A) that a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein consisting of a portion of Pax3 that includes the paired domain and the homeodomain is able to bind Pax3 binding sites (e5 and Nf3’) forming two shifted complexes. This is consistent with previous reports demonstrating that truncated and full-length Pax3 proteins can dimerize upon binding DNA (11Shafer B.W. Czerny T. Bernasconi M. Genini M. Busslinger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4574-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31Chalepakis G. Goulding M. Read A. Strachan T. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). e5 contains both paired and homeodomain binding sites (25Treisman J. Harris E. Desplan C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and the BU26 paired domain mutation greatly reduces binding. Residual binding might be due to homeodomain/DNA interaction. The Nf3’ sequence contains only a paired domain binding site, and the BU26 mutation eliminates binding to this site. Pax3 is able to activate CAT activity from an appropriate reporter construct when the Nf3’ paired domain binding site is placed upstream of CAT, and the BU-26 mutation eliminates this activity (Fig. 1C), consistent with its effect on DNA binding. PAX3/FKHR is a somewhat more potent activator of transcription from this reporter than Pax3 (whether or not the truncated forkhead DNA binding domain is retained; data not shown). This is consistent with its more potent anti-myogenic effect. Other missense mutations (BU-35 and un-1) that would be expected to reduce the DNA binding activity of the paired domain (5Hoth C.F. Milunsky A. Lipsky N. Sheffer R. Clarren S.K. Baldwin C.T. Am. J. of Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch U. Goulding M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and also fail to inhibit myogenesis (Table I), reduce the ability of the PAX3/FKHR fusion to transactivate from this reporter (Fig. 1C). Results using a reporter containing the e5 sequence were similar (data not shown). The mutation we have introduced in the homeodomain results in a serine to alanine replacement at position 9 of the third “recognition” helix of the homeodomain (residue 268). Mutations in this position are known to alter sequence-specific DNA binding by paired-type (33Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and other classes of homeodomains (34Hanes S.D. Brent R. Cell. 1989; 57: 1275-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and result in altered dimerization of the isolated Drosophila paired protein homeodomain when binding a palindromic binding site (26Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The S268A mutation that we engineered in Pax3 has not been previously reported, and we demonstrate here that this alteration results in diminished dimerization of the isolated Pax3 homeodomain upon binding a palindromic binding site (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this mutation also seems to reduce dimerization of the paired domain and homeodomain containing glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein when binding to e5 and Nf3’ (Fig. 1A) and results in diminished activation of CAT activity from a reporter construct containing Nf3’, a paired domain binding site (Fig. 1C). The ability of C2C12 cells to express the proteins encoded by the Pax3 expression vectors was verified after both transient and stable transfections. Protein levels after transient transfection of wild type or mutant constructs were similar (Fig. 2A). After selection with G418, numerous clonal Pax3-transfected cell lines expressed detectable levels of Pax3 protein (examples shown in Fig. 2B). None of the Pax3-positive cell lines tested was able to efficiently form myotubes after exposure to low serum. In order to assess the ability of Pax3 to overcome the muscle-inducing effect of the myogenic bHLH factors, we tested the ability of Pax3 to inhibit myogenic differentiation of fibroblast cells (10T1/2 cells) stably transfected with MyoD or myogenin. C2C12 cells express MyoD under normal growth conditions and up-regulate myogenin expression only after exposure to low serum (35Braun T. Buschhausen-Denker G. Bober E. Tannich E. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 36Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In vivo, MyoD or myf-5 is thought to precede myogenin expression, and myogenin appears requisite for terminal differentiation (37Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nabeshima Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 38Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 39Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Both Pax3 and PAX3/FKHR were able to inhibit myogenic differentiation of MyoD-expressing 10T1/2 cells after exposure to low serum. In contrast, 10T1/2 cells expressing myogenin were relatively resistant to the anti-myogenic effect of Pax3 and PAX3/FKHR (Table I). This result was obtained with two independently derived 10T1/2 myogenin clonal lines. It is possible that the difference in anti-myogenic effect of Pax3 and PAX3/FKHR in MyoD- versus myogenin-expressing cells was due to elevated myogenic protein activity in the myogenin cell lines tested compared with the MyoD cell lines. However, these results suggested to us that the block in myogenesis imposed by Pax3 and PAX3/FKHR occurs upstream of myogenin. Support for this hypothesis comes from analysis of RNA expression of control and Pax3-transfected C2C12 cells before or after exposure to low serum. Fig. 3 shows that stable expression of Pax3 RNA is not altered by exposure to low serum and is present only in Pax3-transfected cells. MyoD RNA levels are similar in control and Pax3-transfected cells and remain constant or slightly increased with low serum exposure, as has been demonstrated previously (35Braun T. Buschhausen-Denker G. Bober E. Tannich E. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Myogenin RNA levels are greatly up-regulated in control cells upon exposure to low serum (36Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), but rise not at all (Fig. 3) or only slightly (as in other experiments not shown) in Pax3-transfected cells exposed to low serum. Thus, we have demonstrated that Pax3 expression in cultured myoblasts inhibits myogenesis normally induced by growth in low serum containing medium. This property is abrogated by a Waardenburg's Syndrome mutation in the paired domain that alters specific DNA binding and prevents transactivation of a reporter construct, including Pax3 binding sites. A homeodomain mutation that affects DNA binding and dimerization also destroys the anti-myogenic property. Taken together with the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Pax3 and the myogenic bHLH factors during development, these results suggest that Pax3 may suppress myogenic differentiation of migrating limb muscle progenitors. This inhibition occurs independent or downstream of MyoD and is overcome by forced expression of the downstream bHLH factor myogenin. It will be of interest to further specify the location of Pax3 in the molecular cascade of myogenesis as our understanding of this pathway continues to emerge. A fusion protein formed by the t(2;13) chromosomal translocation resulting in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma shares DNA binding properties with Pax3, since it includes the intact Pax3 paired and homeodomains. Compared with Pax3, it is a more potent activator of transcription and inhibitor of myogenic differentiation in our in vitro assays. We propose that deregulated Pax3-like activity prevents the terminal differentiation of muscle progenitor cells contributing to the rhabdomyosarcoma phenotype. This suggests that forms of Pax3 (and perhaps Pax7) deregulation other than chromosomal translocation will be identified as causes of rhabdomyosarcoma and/or abnormalities of limb muscle development.

https://openalex.org/W2044474149,"We demonstrate that DNA methylation in an adrenocortical tumor cell line, Y1, is controlled by the Ras signaling pathway. Forced expression of a cDNA encoding human GAP120 (hGAP), a down-modulator of Ras activity or ∂9-Jun a transdominant negative mutant of Jun, in Y1 cells reverts the transformed morphology of the cells and results in a reduction in the level of DNA methylation, DNA methyltransferase (MeTase) mRNA, and enzymatic activity. Introduction of an oncogenic Ha-ras into the GAP transfectants results in reversion to a transformed morphology and an increase in the levels of DNA methylation and DNA MeTase activity. Transient transfection CAT assays demonstrate that the expression of DNA MeTase promoter in Y1 cells is regulated by Ras and AP-1.

These results establish a molecular link between a major signaling pathway involved in tumorigenesis and DNA methylation. Many lines of evidence have established that activation of the Ras signaling pathway is one nodal point in many pathways leading to cellular transformation (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Recent data have suggested that one possible downstream effector of Ras-triggered cellular transformation is the AP-1 transcription transactivation complex (2Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). One candidate for playing a role in this pathway is the DNA methyltransferase (MeTase) 1The abbreviations used are: MeTase, methyltransferase; GAP, GTPase activating protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: MeTase, methyltransferase; GAP, GTPase activating protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s). which bears a number of consensus AP-1 sites in its 5′ regulatory region (3Rouleau J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The DNA MeTase is responsible for methylation of cytosine residues located in the dinucleotide sequence CpG (6Razin A. Riggs A.D.

The vertebrate genome is methylated at 80–90% of the CpGs (6Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 7Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar). The DNA MeTase activity is tightly regulated with the growth state of cells (10Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8653-8656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and previous models have suggested that the level of DNA MeTase activity can play an important role in determining the pattern of methylation (6Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 12Szyf M. Avraham-Haetzni K. Reifman A. Shlomai J. Kaplan F. Openheim A. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The fact that genes can be inactivated by methylation as well as that wide areas of the genome, such as CpG islands, are methylated in cancer cells is well established (14Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 15Antequera F. Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 62: 503-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). A CpG island-rich area on chromosome 17p, which is reduced to homozygosity in lung and colon cancer, as well as regions of chromosome 3p, that are consistently reduced to homozygosity in lung cancer, are hypermethylated (16Makos M. Nelkin B.D. Lerman M.I. Latif F. Zbar B. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1929-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these changes in the DNA methylation pattern of cancer cells is the dramatic elevation of DNA methyltransferase (DNA MeTase) activity observed in many cancer cells (17Kautiainen T.L. Jones P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1594-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Chih Yen R.-W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Issa J.P. Herman J. Bassett D. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8891-8895.28Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and we have shown that inhibition of DNA methylation by expression of a DNA MeTase antisense RNA results in reversion of the transformed phenotype of Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells (20MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). What is the molecular link between the known triggers of cellular transformation and DNA hypermethylation? This paper tests the hypothesis that the level of methylation of DNA in cancer cells is controlled by Ras. Y1 is an adrenocortical tumor cell line that was isolated from a naturally occurring adrenocortical tumor in an LAF1 mouse (21Yasumura Y. Buonsassisi V. Sato G. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar) which bears a 30- to 60-fold amplification of the cellular protooncogene c-Ki-ras (22Schwab M. Alitalo K. Varmus H.E. Bishop M. Nature. 1983; 303: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It stands to reason that c-Ki-ras plays an important role in triggering the transformed state of Y1 cells. This cell line expresses many adrenal specific genes but has specifically repressed, by a cis-modification event, the 21-hydroxylase gene (C21) (23Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This repression is associated with heavy methylation of the C21 gene locus and the cells still possess the capacity to specifically de novo methylate a transfected C21 gene (24Szyf M. Schimmer B.P. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Y1 can therefore serve as an excellent model system for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for hypermethylation and gene repression events that are associated with the oncogenic process. In this paper we demonstrate that down-regulation of Ras by forced expression of human Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) (25Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of Jun by expressing the Jun transdominant mutant ∂9-Jun (26Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylik B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) results in inhibition of DNA methylation. This inhibition is reversed when an oncogenic Ha-ras (27Sinn E. Muller W.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). To quantify the relative abundance of DNA MeTase mRNA, total RNA (3 µg) was blotted onto Hybond-N+ using the Bio-Rad slot blot apparatus. The filter-bound RNA was hybridized to a 32P-labeled 1.31-kb cDNA probe encoding the putative catalytic domain of the mouse DNA MeTase (3170–4480) (34Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and exposed to XAR film (Kodak). The relative amount of total RNA was determined by measuring the signal obtained after hybridization to an 18 S rRNA-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (23Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The autoradiograms were scanned with a Scanalytics scanner (one D analysis), and the signal at each band was determined and normalized to the amount of total RNA at the same point. Three determinations were performed per each RNA sample. DNA Analyses and Demethylation Assays—Two µg of DNA were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.1 unit of DNase, 2.5 µl of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol from Amersham), and 2 units of Kornberg DNA polymerase (Boehringer) were then added and the reaction was incubated for an additional 25 min at 30 °C (35Razin A. Feldmesser E. Kafri T. Szyf M. Razin A. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry and Biology of DNA Methylation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1985: 239Google Scholar). Fifty µl of water were then added to the reaction mixture, and the nonincorporated nucleotides were removed by spinning through a Microspin S-300 HR column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The labeled DNA (20 µl) was digested with 70 µg of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia) in the manufacturer’s recommended buffer for 10 h at 37 °C. Equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded on TLC phosphocellulose plates (Merck), and the 3′ mononucleotides were separated by chromatography in one dimension (isobutyric acid:H2O:NH4OH in the ratio 66:33:1). The chromatograms were exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak), and the autoradiograms were scanned by scanning laser densitometry (Scanalytics one-dimensional analysis). Spots corresponding to cytosine and 5-methylcytosine were quantified. To study demethylation of specific genes, genomic DNA (10 µg) was extracted from the transfected lines and subjected to digestion with BamHI (Boehringer Mannheim, 25 units) followed by digestion with either 25 units of MspI(M) which is insensitive to CC*GG methylation or Hpa II(H) which is sensitive to methylation, for 8 h at 37 °C. At least three different DNA preparations isolated from three independent passages were assayed per transfectant. Assay of DNA MeTase Activity—To determine nuclear DNA MeTase levels, cells were maintained at the exponential phase of growth and fed with fresh medium every 24 h for at least 3 days prior to harvesting, and DNA MeTase activity was assayed as described previously (11Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT Assays—Y1 cells were transiently transfected and CAT assays were performed on 50 µl of cellular extract (~10 µg of protein) using [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (0.5 pCi per assay (3.8 Ci/mmol)) essentially as described (36Neuman J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar) and modified as in Ref. 3Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol.

Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs bearing the two consensus AP-1 sites at –1744 and –1650 were described (5Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol.

TLC plates (polyethyleneimine, Brinkman) were prerun in distilled water before loading of samples. Samples were purified on Microcon columns (Amicon) before loading, and the chromatograms were developed in 1.3 m LiCl. Gel Retardation Assays—A double-stranded consensus AP-1 recognition sequence (5Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol.

Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-1 complexes formed were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described in Ref. 29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K.

Forced Expression of hGAP, ∂9-Jun, and Ha-Ras + GAP in Y1 Cells—To test the hypothesis that the hypermethylation of DNA in Y1 cells is controlled by the Ras signaling pathway, we generated Y1 transfectants expressing the human GAP120 (GAP) under the direction of cytomegalovirus regulatory sequences (28Lazaris-Karatzas A. Smith M.R. Frederickson R.M. Jaramillo M.L. Liu Y.-l. Kung H.-F. Sonenberg N. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1631-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or the transdominant mutant of c-Jun, ∂9-Jun (26Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylik B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To verify that the changes induced by GAP result from down-regulation of Ras, we cointroduced an oncogenic Ha-ras expression vector (27Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 49: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) into a GAP transfectant (clone number 7). Nontransfected Y1 cells and Y1 cells that were transfected with pUCSVneo only or with another expression vector (pZEM) (30Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) served as controls. The presence of hGAP, ∂9, and hGAP + Ha-Ras in these clones and its expression was determined using Southern (data not shown) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1, A, B, and C). Western blot analysis for hGAP (using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against hGAP) and Ha-ras (using a monoclonal antibody against v-Ha-Ras (Y13–259) was used to correlate the level of transfected protein with the levels of mRNA (by scanning the Western blot fluorograms). GAP and GAP + Ras transfectants showed a 3- (GAP 7, GAP 14, and G/R1) to 5-fold (G/R2) increase in GAP levels, and, as expected from the mRNA analysis (Fig. 1A), the total Ras protein in the Ras transfectants was 3-fold the level observed in the control Y1 and GAP transfectants (data not shown). All of the seven GAP positive clones showed distinct morphological changes, while none of the six controls Y1, Y1neo, or Y1 pZEM lines showed similar changes. We focused our attention on two clones that showed high levels of GAP expression. To determine the biological implications of hGAP expression in Y1 cells, the morphological and growth properties of the Y1 GAP transfectants were determined (Fig. 1). While control Y1 cells exhibit limited contact inhibition and form multilayered foci, the GAP transfectants exhibit a flat morphology and grow exclusively as monolayers (Fig. 1, right panel). The ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion is considered to be an indicator of tumorigenicity (32Freedman V.H. Shin S. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), the Y1 GAP transfectants demonstrate a distinct reduction in their ability to form colonies in soft agar. Whereas Y1 and Y1 pZEM formed large colonies on soft agar: 166, 153 for Y1, and 120;126 for Y1 pZEM, the GAP transfectants formed less colonies that contained only few cells: 39;45 for GAP 7 and 34;26 for GAP 14. The transcription factor Jun is an important downstream effector of the Ras signaling pathway (37Imler J.L. Schatz C. Wasylik C. Chatton B. Wasylik B. Nature. 1988; 332: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Sistonen L. Hoitta E. Makela T.P. Keski-Oja J. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Forced expression of the transdominant negative mutant of Jun, ∂9 in Y1 cell, results in similar changes in morphology to those observed with GAP (Fig. 1, right panel). Oncogenic ras is not modulated by GAP and should therefore restore Ras hyperfunction to GAP transfectants (25Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). All positive Ras transfectants exhibited a transformed morphology. Two lines bearing both GAP and Ha-ras were used for our study (Fig. 1, right panel). Modulation of the Ras Signaling Pathway—To determine whether the Ras signaling pathway was affected in the different transfectants, we measured two determinants of the Ras signaling pathway: guanine nucleotide binding to Ras and AP-1 DNA binding activity. Ras is biologically active when bound to GTP and inactive when it is bound to GDP (25Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The GTP/GDP ratio was determined following labeling of Y1 pZEM, Y1 GAP 7, and Y1 GAP + Ras (G/R1 and -2) transfectants with [32P]orthophosphate, immunoprecipitation of Ras, and analysis of GTP/GDP by thin layer chromatography (25Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 28Lazaris-Karatzas A. Smith M.R. Frederickson R.M. Jaramillo M.L. Liu Y.-l. Kung H.-F. Sonenberg N. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1631-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. The percentage of GTP bound(activated) Ras was determined by scanning. Whereas 15.9% of the guanine nucleotide bound to Ras is GTP in the Y1 pZEM controls, only 4.8% of total Ras is GTP-bound in the GAP 7 transfectants. Forced expression of Ha-Ras in the GAP transfectants results in a significant increase in GTP-bound Ras (29.1% and 29.7% for 1 and 2, respectively) (data not shown). To determine whether AP-1 activity was modulated in our transfectants, we performed gel retardation assays on nuclear extracts prepared from the different transfectants using a 32P-labeled oligomer bearing the consensus AP-1 recognition sequence (5Rouleau J. MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 2A, forced expression of GAP in Y1 cells results in reduction of total AP-1 binding activity as well as a change in the AP-1 complexes formed (complex A and B for pZEM versus complexes C, D, and E in GAP 7). Forced expression of Ha-Ras in GAP transfectants resulted in an increase in overall AP-1 binding activity and a change in the complexes formed (Fig. 2A, G/R1 and G/R2; complexes D and E similar to GAP and complex C). Forced expression of 59 results in a reduction in overall AP-1 binding activity and a change in the ratio of complex A/B to C (Fig. 2B). All complexes are specific to AP-1 since they are competed with excess of nonlabeled AP-1 oligomer (Fig. 2, A B). Whereas the composition of the different AP-1 complexes has to be determined in future experiments, this set of experiments demonstrates that AP-1 activity was significantly affected upon forced expression of GAP, ∂9, and Ha-Ras. Expression of hGAP and ∂9-Jun Results in Genome-wide Hypomethylation—To determine whether expression of GAP results in changes in the methylation status of Y1 DNA, Y1 (pZEM transfected) and two GAP transfectants’ DNAs were subjected to “nearest neighbor” analysis using [α-32P]dGTP as described previously (35Razin A. Feldmesser E. Kafri T. Szyf M. Razin A. Cantoni G.L. Biochemistry and Biology of DNA Methylation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1985: 239Google Scholar). This assay determines the relative level of each of the possible 5′ neighbors of G in the genome and thus enables us to quantify the relative abundance of nonmethylated and methylated CpG dinucleotide sequences. The level of nonmethylated cytosines in the genome of GAP transfectants 7 and 14 (35% and 45%) is 3- to 4-fold higher than in the controls pZEM 1 and 7 (8% and 9%). The 39 transfectants exhibit a 3- to 4-fold increase in the percentage of nonmethylated cytosines in CpG nucleotides in the genome versus the pZEM controls (58%, 60%, and 62% for ∂9 1, 2, and 6, respectively). In summary, this experiment demonstrates that forced expression of GAP or ∂9-Jun in Y1 adrenal carcinoma cells result in a genome-wide reduction in DNA methylation. The C21 and myoD Genes Are Hypomethylated in GAP and ∂9-Jun Transfectants—To further address the question of whether DNA hypomethylation is triggered by a general change in the DNA methylation capacity of the cell or whether it reflects only local changes in gene expression, specific gene sequences were studied. The C21 gene is specifically repressed and de novo methylated when it is exogenously introduced into Y1 cells (23Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Szyf M. Schimmer B.P. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6853-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The methylation state of the 5′ of the gene in four independent Y1 GAP transfectants, a Y1 neo transfectant, and a Y1 control was studied with a MspI/HpaII Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3A) using a 0.3-kb 5′ probe (see bottom panel for physical map). We have been analyzing this sequence in different Y1 populations as well as different transfectants in the last 5 years. We never observed demethylation of this region in Y1 cells. Additionally, we used four independent GAP lines for this Southern blot analysis to rule out the possibility that demethylation is a random event. While both Y1 and the Y1 neo transfectants are heavily methylated and show a diagnostic ~1.9-kb band following HpaII digestion (Fig. 3A, empty arrow), this band is dramatically reduced in all the GAP transfectants, and new lower molecular weight bands reflecting partial demethylation of the 5′ C21 gene sequence are observed (Fig. 3A, dark arrows). The fact that four independent transfectants bear a similar pattern of hypomethylation, for example, the relative abundance of the 0.52-kb partial HpaII fragment (Fig. 3A and bottom panel for map) which is completely absent in the HpaII digests of Y1 cells, and a Y1 neo transfectant demonstrates that this hypomethylation is a direct result of GAP expression rather than clonal variability among Y1 cells. Similar to the 5′ region, the body of the C21 gene exhibits distinct changes in DNA methylation (Fig. 3B). There is a relative diminution of the higher molecular weight fragment at 3.8 (open arrow) (the DNA was digested with BamHI following the MspI/HpaII analysis which should give a 3.8-kb fragment) and appearance of the 1- and 0.9-kb doublet (see physical map in bottom panel indicating the HpaII sites flanking the 1- and 0.9-kb fragments) (Fig. 3B). The state of methylation of the C21 gene in ∂9-Jun transfectants is presented in Fig. 4A. These results indicate that the HpaII sites flanking the the 1-kb HpaII fragment (see physical map, Fig. 3, bottom panel) which are almost fully methylated in Y1 cells and the pZEM controls, as indicated by the absence of the 1-kb HpaII fragment, are almost completely hypomethylated in the ∂9 transfectant (Fig. 4B, top empty arrow, 1-kb fragment in the HpaII lane). Other sites are less readily hypomethylated as implied by the absence of the lower molecular fragment at 0.8 and 0.4 kb. Some faint bands at this molecular weight range are present in the ∂9–6 transfectant suggesting that demethylation of the other sites also occurs in a subset of 39 transfectants.Fig. 4Demethylation of specific genes in ∂9 transfectants. A, the state of methylation of the C21 gene. Genomic DNA (10 µg) extracted from the indicated lines was subjected to MspI/HpaII followed by BamHI digestion, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization with a 32P-labeled DNA probe for the mouse C21 gene (3.8-kb BamHI fragment). The open arrows indicates the position of the demethylated HpaII fragments. B,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whereas Y1 cells contain the machinery needed for C21 gene expression (23Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the hypomethylation observed in the 5′ region of the gene might be a result of local changes in gene accessibility rather than a primary hypomethylation event that is centrally regulated. To address this question, we tested the pattern of methylation of other genes such as the gene for the 5HT1A receptor, a gene specifically expressed in the hippocampus and not in the adrenal or the ubiquitously expressed p53 gene. Demethylation was observed in both gene sequences (data not shown). Another locus that was studied is the myoD gene. This locus is heavily methylated in Y1 cells as indicated by the high molecular weight fragments ranging from 3.35 to 7 kb in the HpaII digest of the Y1 control transfectant (Fig. 4B, pZ1, empty arrow).

Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-raf-1 antibody and the Raf-1 C-terminal peptide were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against p42mapk, MKK1, and MKK2 were kindly provided by Michael Weber (Dept. of Microbiology, University of Virginia); pertussis toxin was a generous gift of Erik Hewlett (Dept. of Medicine, University of Virginia). Recombinant MKK1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (22Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and MAP Kinase AssaySwiss 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C to confluence. The confluent cells were washed two times with DMEM without serum and then incubated overnight (approximately 20 h) with DMEM/Way-mouth's medium (1:1) containing 0.1% dialyzed calf serum. The serum-starved cells were washed two times with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/Hepes (25Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/Hepes for 1.5 h before use. MAP kinase activity was determined by an immune complex kinase assay using a p42mapk-specific antibody TR12 as previously described (25Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The data shown are the means and standard deviations of triplicate determinations expressed as pmol of phosphate incorporated into myelin basic protein per min. Data shown are representative of multiple (two to five) experiments.MAP Kinase Kinase AssaysTotal MKK activity was determined by KR phosphorylation as described (25Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). To determine MKK1 and MKK2 activities separately, cell lysate supernatants were prepared from Swiss 3T3 cells using the buffer and methodologies described for rat1 cells (25Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Lysate supernatant protein (75 µg total protein each) were immunoprecipitated with saturating amounts (15 µl) of anti-MKK1 or anti-MKK2 antibodies (precoupled to protein A-agarose) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer (25Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) and once in lysis buffer without detergent. Washed complexes were incubated (30 °C, 15 min) with 40 µl of MKK reaction mix (1 µg of KR, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mn pNPP, 50 µm [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 cpm/pmol)), and processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The relative activities of MKK1 and MKK2 were compared by quantitating the phosphorylation of KR with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Raf-1 Activity DeterminationCell lysate supernatants (100 µg total protein each) were precleared with protein A-agarose (Pierce). Cleared supernatants were incubated (4 °C, 30 min) with 0.4 µg of affinity-purified anti-Raf-1 or with antibody preincubated with 4 µg of Raf-1 C-terminal peptide (approximately 1000-fold molar excess). Immune complexes were adsorbed (4 °C, 2 h) to protein A-agarose (20 µl of 50% slurry). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once omitting Triton X-100. Assays were initiated by addition of 30 µl of reaction mixture containing 33 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 14 mM MgCl2, 1.3 mM dithiothreitol, 53 mM pNPP, 30 µm [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/pmol), and 0.5 µg of recombinant MKK1 expressed in E. coli. After incubation (6 min, 30 °C), 1 µg of KR protein (in 10 µl of 25 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.5 (4 °C), 40 mM pNPP, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 37% (v/v) ethylene glycol) was added and incubated (30 °C, 6 min) before quenching with SDS sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.DNA SynthesisDNA synthesis was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (6Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar).RESULTSSphingosine 1-Phosphate Activates MAP Kinase in Swiss 3T3 CellsTo determine whether exogenous sphingosine 1-phosphate can stimulate MAP kinase activity in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with a mitogenic concentration of sphingosine 1-phosphate (5 µm) or PDGF (65 ng/ml) for 1–15 min, and p42mapk activities were assayed by a specific immune complex assay (25Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). MAP kinase was rapidly activated in cells treated with sphingosine 1-phosphate or PDGF. BSA vehicle added alone had no discernible effect on MAP kinase (Fig. 1).Activation of MAP kinase by sphingosine 1-phosphate was time and concentration dependent. Sphingosine 1-phosphate rapidly stimulated MAP kinase activity, reaching a maximal level within 2.5 min and declining thereafter (Fig. LA). The response to PDGF was similar, but MAP kinase activity remained elevated for at least 15 min (Fig. 1A). Half-maximal activation of MAP kinase was observed at approximately 1 µm sphingosine 1-phosphate (Fig. LB). This concentration dependence correlates closely with the concentration dependence for induction of DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig. 1B).Signaling Pathway for Activation of MAP Kinase by Sphingosine 1-PhosphateMAP kinases are activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues by MAP kinase kinases (MKKs or MEKs), which in turn are regulated by one of several potential upstream serine/threonine kinases including Raf-1 (18Dent P.

Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). To investigate the pathway(s) by which sphingosine 1-phosphate activates MAP kinase in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we measured MKK and Raf-1 activities in cells treated with sphingosine 1-phosphate. Both sphingosine 1-phosphate and PDGF significantly stimulated MKK activity in 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Similarly, sphingosine 1-phosphate and PDGF activated Raf-1 kinase activity in 3T3 fibroblasts approximately 2- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, Raf-1 appears to be an important MKK activator for the response to sphingosine 1-phosphate. Preliminary experiments have not revealed any direct effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate on Raf, MKK, or MAP kinase studied in vitro (data not shown), implying action(s) upstream of Raf-1.FIG. 2Activation of MEK and Raf-1 by sphingosine 1-phosphate and PDGF. Quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with 7.5 µm sphingosine 1-phosphate or 65 ng/ml PDGF and MKK (A), or Raf-1 kinase activities (B and C) were determined.

Phosphorylation of KR was incubated with MKK1 alone (lane 1). Lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11, assays with immune complexes in the absence of MKK1; lanes 3. 6, 9. and 12. assays with immune complexes plus MKK1; lanes 4, 7, 10, 13, immune complexes isolated in the presence of peptide antigen and assayed in the presence of MKK1.

To determine whether one or both MKKs are stimulated by sphingosine 1-phosphate in comparison with PDGF and EGF, specific antibodies 2M. Weber, unpublished data. to MKK1 and MKK2 were used to assay specifically each enzyme in immune complexes by phosphorylation of added KR substrate. MKK1 activity was found to be approximately six times higher than that of MKK2 in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells by Phosphorlmager analysis (data not shown). Both MKK1 and MKK2 were markedly activated by sphingosine 1-phosphate, PDGF, and EGF (Fig. 3). With each stimulus, MKK1 activity was about 6-fold greater than MKK2 activity.FIG. 3Both MKK1 and MKK2 are activated by sphingosine 1-phosphate and growth factors. MKK1 and MKK2 activities in Swiss 3T3 cells were determined by phosphorylating KR after inimunoprecipitation with anti-MKK1-(lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or anti-MKK2 (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8)-specific antibodies. Cells were treated with BSA (lanes 1 and 2), 10 µm sphingosine 1-phosphate for 2 min (lanes 3 and 4), 65 ng/ml PDGF for 3 min (lanes 5 and 6), or 100 ng/ml EGF for 3 min (lanes 7 and 8).

Olivera A. Carlson R.O. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 105-129PubMed Google Scholar) and action at intracellular target(s). LPA is a mitogenic phospholipid structurally similar to sphingosine 1-phosphate (26Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 249-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). LPA is thought to activate MAP kinase in Rat1 cells via a putative Grcoupled receptor inferred primarily from inhibition of the actions of LPA by pertussis toxin (27van Corven W.J. Hordijk P.L. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Moolenaar W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gi/Go subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins and has been used extensively to investigate the role of these G proteins in signal transduction. The modified serine residue is located in a domain that interacts with G protein-coupled receptors, uncoupling the activated G protein-coupled receptor to Gi/Go. To examine whether a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in the pathway utilized by sphingosine 1-phosphate to stimulate MAP kinase, Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 20 h before stimulation with sphingosine 1-phosphate, LPA, PDGF, or EGF. As shown in Fig. 4A, pertussis toxin inhibited the activation of MAP kinase by sphingosine 1-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid. In contrast, pertussis toxin had no apparent effect on the PDGF- or EGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation.FIG. 4Activation of MAP kinase by exogenous sphingosine 1-phosphate is sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. A, MAP kinase activities in Swiss 3T3 cells treated without or with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 20 h and stimulated with BSA carrier (“None”), 5 µm sphingosine 1-phosphate for 2.5 min (SPP), 20 µm lysophosphatidic acid for 3 min (LPA), 65 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min, or 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. B, MAP kinase activities in Swiss 3T3 cells pretreated with indicated concentrations of pertussis toxin for 20 h and stimulated with 5 µm sphingosine 1-phosphate for 2.5 min or 65 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)About 20% of the MAP kinase activity induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate appeared to be insensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin (Fig. 4A). To ensure that the pertussis toxin effect was a maximal one, its concentration dependence for inhibition of stimulation of MAP kinase by sphingosine 1-phosphate was studied (Fig. 4B). 70% inhibition of the sphingosine 1-phosphate-stimulated MAP kinase activation was observed at 10 ng/ml pertussis toxin. Higher concentrations (up to 400 ng/ml) of pertussis toxin had little effect in further increasing the extent of inhibition; these higher concentrations still had no significant effect on the response to PDGF. Thus, about 20% of the sphingosine 1-phosphate-stimulated MAP kinase activity is insensitive to pertussis toxin, an activity still representing a significant activation of MAP kinase over the basal activity. Therefore, sphingosine 1-phosphate can activate the MAP kinase pathway by both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive pathways.DISCUSSIONOur results showed that sphingosine 1-phosphate added to Swiss 3T3 cells rapidly activates the protein kinase cascade sequentially involving Raf-1, MAP kinase kinase, and MAP kinase. The ability of sphingosine 1-phosphate to stimulate MAP kinase activity has important implications for its mitogenic action. A requirement for MAP kinase for cell cycle progression in fibroblasts is supported by several lines of evidence. Expression of MAP kinase proteins rendered kinase-defective, by mutation of either the essential lysine or the sites of activating phosphorylation, blocks cell growth of Chinese hamster fibroblasts (28Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meleche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. V. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), as does expression of activation site mutants of its specific activator, MKK, in NIH 3T3 cells (29Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of kinase-defective MAP kinase inhibits the mitogenic effect of small t antigen in CV-1 cells (30Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Secondly, apparently specific pharmacologic MKK inhibitors have recently been identified that block the mitogenic but not the metabolic effects of insulin. 3A. Saltiel, personal communication. Finally, expression of MKP1, a highly specific MAP kinase phosphatase, blocks DNA synthesis induced by v-Ras (31Sun H. Tonks N.K. Barsagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Activation of MAP kinase by various mitogens in fibroblasts appears to be sufficient for stimulating cell growth of fibroblasts since expression of activated mutants of MKK causes proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells (29Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 32Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar).Recently, sphingosine 1-phosphate was shown to stimulate DNA binding of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complexes (10Su Y. Rosenthal D. Smulson M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16512-16517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that modulate expression of genes involved in growth regulation and neoplastic transformation. AP-1 complexes are composed of either homodimers of c-Jun or heterodimers of c-Jun and c-Fos, both of which are regulated at transcription and by phosphorylation (33Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar, 34Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-10135Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). MAP kinase phosphorylates ternary complex factor(s), which, in complex with serum response factor, enhance Fos transcription (35Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6219-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in AP-1 activity by sphingosine 1-phosphate previously observed may be explained by the data herein that establish sphingosine 1-phosphate as a potent activator of the MAP kinase pathway.The concentration dependence for activation of MAP kinase by sphingosine 1-phosphate correlated precisely with that for stimulation of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, sphingosine 1-phosphate-stimulated MAP kinase activation was largely sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. Additional data obtained 4K. A. Goodmote, M. E. Mattie, A. Berger, and S. Spiegel, manuscript in preparation. has demonstrated that sphingosine 1-phosphate-stimulated DNA synthesis is also sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. Thus, all of the available data suggest that the MAP kinase cascade mediates the mitogenic effect of sphingosine 1-phosphate.It was previously thought that sphingosine 1-phosphate was taken up by cells to exert all of its actions. Several pieces of evidence lend support to this notion. Sphingosine 1-phosphate can be formed intracellularly in response to sphingosine, PDGF, and serum, and inhibition of sphingosine 1-phosphate formation with a sphingosine kinase inhibitor inhibited cellular proliferation induced by these mitogens (5Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amount of sphingosine 1-phosphate formed intracellularly in response to these mitogens was nearly the same as that taken up by the cells after treatment with mitogenic concentrations of sphingosine 1-phosphate. However, data presented in this study demonstrated that a large proportion of the sphingosine 1-phosphate-stimulated MAP kinase activity was sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. This implies that the primary signaling mechanism of exogenous sphingosine 1-phosphate for activation of MAP kinase involves one or more pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, members of the Gi/Go families. This activation mechanism is similar in this regard to that demonstrated for LPA. Exogenous sphingosine 1-phosphate might activate a receptor coupled to Gi/Go or alternatively activate Gi/Go proteins in a receptor-independent fashion. Further studies of the cellular target(s) for sphingosine 1-phosphate are clearly warranted.Differences in physiologic responses to sphingosine 1-phosphate and LPA in Swiss 3T3 cells make it unlikely that these two agonists are simply redundant for the same receptor or G protein target. First, sphingosine 1-phosphate, in contrast to LPA, can release calcium from internal sources independent of an increase in intracellular concentrations of inositol triphosphate (7Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although sphingosine 1-phosphate increased inositol triphosphate, complete inhibition of formation of inositol phosphates by a brief treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate did not inhibit sphingosine 1-phosphate-mediated calcium responses, indicating that formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is not required for release of calcium by sphingosine 1-phosphate. In contrast and in agreement with previous studies (36van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells suppressed not only inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation but also calcium responses elicited by LPA (7Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, sphingosine 1-phosphate had no significant effect on the release of arachidonic acid in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts cells (7Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas LPA stimulated arachidonic acid release in these cells (7Mattie M."

Using cell-free degradation assays, we show that ubiquitinylation, along with other types of tagging, is not an absolute prerequisite for ATP-dependent degradation of c-Jun by the 26 S proteasome.

Several lines of evidence points to imply this protein as a positive regulator of cell proliferation. For example, (i) it is rapidly and transiently induced in quiescent embryonic fibroblasts stimulated by growth factors (2Quantin B. Breatnach R.

As a matter of fact, its knock-out is responsible for embryonic death most likely linked to abnormal hepatogenesis (9Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18278-18283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). c-Jun is a short-lived protein with an approximate half-life of 90 min in fibroblast cultures (11Lamph W.W. Wamsley P. Sassone-Corsi P. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Interestingly, at least two catabolic pathways seem to operate on this protein. First, two lines of evidence support the idea that calpains, which are abundant cytoplasmic calcium-dependent cystein proteases, can initiate degradation of c-Jun along with that of c-Fos: (i) both proteins have been shown to constitute actual substrates for these proteases in vitro either under purified form or in cytoplasmic extracts (13Hirai S.-L. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Susuki K FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Watt F. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5092-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) specific modulation of calpain activity in vivo modifies c-Jun- and c-Fos-dependent AP-1 transcription complex activity in a transient co-transfection assay (13Hirai S.-L. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Susuki K FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this situation, it must, however, be emphasized that other proteolytic systems must take over the action of calpains since the latter cleave their substrates only to a limited extent. Moreover, this pathway presumably concerns only cytoplasmic degradation of c-Jun and c-Fos because of the restricted intracellular distribution of calpains. Second, it has recently been demonstrated that c-Jun can be ubiquitinylated in vivo (12Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). However, although the correlation between the capability to be ubiquitinylated and rapid turnover is highly suggestive, the final demonstration that ubiquitinylation is actually responsible for the triggering of c-Jun protein breakdown is still missing. Characterization of the involved enzymatic activities and reconstitution of the proteolytic machinery is necessary for full understanding of the process by which c-Jun is broken down. As a first step toward this aim, we have developed in vitro assays using recombinant rat c-Jun and either rat liver extracts or purified proteasome, the latter being the major soluble neutral intracellular proteolytic activity that has been characterized so far and which is putatively responsible for degradation of most cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (for a review, see Refs. 16Rivett J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Peters J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 18Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). We report here that ubiquitinylation is not an absolute requirement for in vitro degradation of c-Jun by the 26 S proteasome. This points to the notion that c-Jun, and possibly other proteins, does not necessarily require tagging or co-factors of any sort for degradation by the 26 S proteasome but possesses intrinsic structural motifs allowing direct recognition and subsequent breakdown by the latter (see “Discussion”). Moreover, this also suggests the existence of an additional putative degradation pathway operating on c-Jun. For preparation of F2 extracts, rat livers were homogenized in 1 volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 0.1 mM soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Waring blender. Nuclei and tissue debris were eliminated through two steps of centrifugation at 4 °C (6,000 × g for 30 min and 70,000 × g for 2 h). Crude extracts were incubated in the presence of 20 mM deoxyglucose and 2 mM dinitrophenol for 1 h at room temperature to deplete ATP. DEAE-cellulose chromatography and concentration of proteins were carried out as described in Hershko et al. (19Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F2 extracts (20 mg/ml) were aliquoted and kept at –20 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT, 20% glycerol until use. Their activity was stable over months. Purification of 20 and 26 S proteasome was conducted as described by Sawada et al. (20Sawada H. Muto K. Fujimuro M. Akaishi T. Sawada M.T. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) through successive chromatography steps using Mono Q and Superose 6 columns (20Sawada H. Muto K. Fujimuro M. Akaishi T. Sawada M.T. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purified particles were kept at-20 “C in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP, and 50% glycerol. 26 S proteasome was used within a few days after purification because of rapid loss of activity. On the contrary, 20 S proteasome was stable at least for weeks. Proteins were fractionated through 15% Polyacrylamide gels containing SDS according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1990; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using the mini-Protean II system from Bio-Rad. Proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pores; Schleicher and Schuell) for 45 min at 0.8 mA/cm2 using the semidry transfer apparatus from LKB. Membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in 10% skimmed milk into PBS (0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate pH 7). Anti-protein antibodies were added for 2 h at room temperature at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS. A 1:1000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.) as a second antibody was then added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and 3 times with PBS. Immunodetected proteins were revealed using the ECL chemoluminescent system from DuPont NEN according to the specification of the supplier. c-Jun was detected using the SC45 anti-c-Jun from Santa-Cruz. Ubiquitin was detected using the Z148 rabbit antiserum from Dakko. Rabbit anti-p53 antibodies were a gift from Dr. L. Debüssche (Rhone-Poulenc-Rohrer, France). Anti-E1 antibodies were obtained by immunization of rabbits with E1 enzyme purified from Xenopus oocytes. Anti-whole proteasome and proteasome subunits were gifts from Drs. K. Tanaka and K. Scherrer, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) essentially as described in Harlow and Lane (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 100 μl of immune antiserum-purified immunoglobulins (approximately 10 mg/ml) were added to the same volume of F2 extract. Incubation was carried out for 2–4 h at 0–4 °C under agitation. 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (immunoglobulin binding capacity of 5 mg/ml), were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for several hours at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was eliminated through a centrifugation step (10,000 × g for 5 min). The process was repeated once and immunodepleted extracts were ajusted to 20% glycerol before being aliquoted and frozen until use. Purified ubiquitin and rabbit immunoglobulins are from Sigma. The recombinant wild-type human p53 protein was a kind gift from Dr. L. Debüssche. It as been affinity-purified from a Escherichia coli protein-soluble fraction using the pAb421 monoclonal antibody as described in Ref. 23Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar. Recombinant c-Jun (24Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from E. coli as follows. 400 ml of mid-exponential phase bacteria were induced for 3 h in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, centrifuged down, resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme and let on ice for 20 min. 4 mg of nadeoxycholate and 200 units of Benzon nuclease (Merck) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Inclusion bodies, which contain the bulk of c-Jun, were pelleted (7,000 × g for 15 min), resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and washed under agitation for 5 min at room temperature. The washing procedure was repeated twice, and the pellet was dissolved in 3 ml of denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 M urea) for 1 h at 37 °C. The solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 15,000 × g at room temperature, and the supernatant was either frozen or used for further processing. c-Jun, which represent more than 95% of proteins of inclusion body proteins as determined by electrophoretic analysis, was purified to homogeneity by electrophoresis through SDS-containing 12% Polyacrylamide gels using the Prep Cell apparatus from Bio-Rad. The renaturation protocol described is an adaptation of that of Chang et al. (25Chang L.M. Plevani P. Bollum F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5700-5706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proved reproducible. Electrophoresis-purified c-Jun, in a volume of approximately 50 ml of 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.1% SDS was concentrated to 1–2 ml using Macrosep filters (Filtron) at room temperature. The solution was then filtered through a 0.2-μm Minisart filter (Sartorius) and dialyzed for 16 h against 50 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 7 M guanidimum chloride in order to quantitatively precipitate c-Jun. Progressive redissolution was obtained through 5 cycles of 2-h dialysis against 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 20–25 °C. The solution was adjusted to 50% glycerol, and c-Jun was kept frozen at –20 °C at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml until use. 125I iodination of ubiquitin was performed using the chloramin T method exactly as described in Hershko et al. (19Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitinylation reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a volume of 50 μl in the presence of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM phosphocreatine (Sigma), 1 mg/ml creatine kinase (Sigma), 2 mM DTT, 5 μg of 12BI-labeled ubiquitin, and 2 mg/ml protein extract. Samples were electrophoresed through a 15% Polyacrylamide gel and then autoradiographed. Degradation experiments were performed at 37 “C in a volume of 100 μl in the presence of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 350 ng of recombinant rat c-Jun (or other proteins), and usually 40 μg of proteins from the different extracts (similar results were obtained with 10-fold less proteins). When needed, ATP and MgCl2 (5 mM each), ubiquitin (500 μg/ml), and the calpastatin peptide (160 ng/ml) were added. Aliquot fractions were sampled at various time points and immediately boiled for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were fractionated through 15% Polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunodetection was carried out as described above. The multiubiquitinylation of proteins involves multiple steps (18Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 26Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 27Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Free ubiquitin is first bound by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme, El. E2 ubiquitin-carrier proteins then catalyze the transfer of activated ubiquitin from E1 to protein substrates eventually bound to specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. To determine whether ubiquitinylation is necessary for the rapid breakdown of c-Jun, ubiquitinylation competent and incompetent rat liver-derived cell-free degradation assays were developed. Preparation of protein extracts was carried out as follows. In a first step, a protein fraction was purified by anion-exchange chromatography (F2) from a crude rat liver cytosolic extract according to Hershko et al. (19Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, two points are worth being emphasized. First, ATP was depleted from the cytosolic extract to allow deconjugation of ubiquitin, which, in its free form, is quantitatively eliminated during the chromatography step. Second, F2 still contains El, as well as most, but not all, of E2s and E3s together with major soluble proteolytic enzymes. To ensure the total absence of ubiquitinylation in further degradation assays, either of two additional treatments were applied separately to F2. In one case, residual ubiquitin, if any, was eliminated using an antibody-specific for both free and conjugated ubiquitin (F2ΔUb extract). In the other case, the ubiquitinylation pathway was inactivated by E1 immunodepletion (F2ΔE1 extract). Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1A) shows that free ubiquitin and intermediate molecular weight ubiquitin-protein conjugates were quantitatively eliminated from F2 and F2ΔUb. However, high molecular weight bands due to the detection system used (Fig. IB) are found in all types of extracts and may mask residual ubiquitin-protein conjugates in F2 and F2ΔUb extracts. The possibility of ubiquitin recycling during the time course of degradation experiments was, however, ruled out since, on one hand, incubation of F2 extracts for 2 h under degradation experiment conditions (see below) did not lead to any detectable modification in the pattern of bands and, on the other hand, in a comparable experiment carried out in the presence of anti-ubiquitin antibodies, we detected no release of free ubiquitin as assessed by Western blotting (not shown). F2ΔB1 extract does not allow ubiquitinylation, either, as tested by lack of conjugation of exogenous 12SI-labeled ubiquitin to proteins of the extract in contrast to both F2 and F2 processed with a preimmune serum (F2ΔPreI), which by the same test are shown to be competent for ubiquitinylation (Fig. 1C). For degradation experiments, E. coli-produced rat c-Jun (24Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 455-462PubMed Google Scholar), E. eoK-produced human wild-type p53 (23Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), and rabbit immunoglobulins were added in parallel experiments to the different extracts in the presence, or in the absence, of ATP, and aliquot fractions of the reaction mix were sampled at different time points for immunoelectroblotting analysis. Importantly, appropriate folding of c-Jun was controlled both by testing its ability to homodimerize and to bind specifically to AP-1 DNA motifs and to stimulate transcription in an in vitro assay and by analysis of calpain-generated cleavage products since this protease revealed a good topological probe due to both its specificity for tertiary structural determinants and its limited action on c-Jun (not shown) (13Hirai S.-L. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Susuki K FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Watt F. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5092-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar). c-Jun turned out to be degraded at a similar rate in all extracts in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. ID). On the contrary, immunoglobulins (Fig. IF) and p53 (Fig. IE) remained unaffected, in keeping with the observations that antibodies are very stable when expressed intracellularly, and, although p53 is very unstable and degraded through the ubiquitin pathway, the E2 enzyme specific for ubiquitinylation of p53 is absent from F2 (28Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of high amounts of exogenous ubiquitin to F2 did not accelerate c-Jun decay (Fig. ID). Moreover, calpains, which, as mentioned previously, are capable of cleaving c-Jun (13Hirai S.-L. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Susuki K FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Watt F. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5092-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar), did not interfere in degradation experiments since a highly specific inhibitor peptide (29Maki M. Bagci H. Hamaguchi K. Ueda M. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 254: 18866-18869Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) derived from calpastatin, which is the physiological inhibitor of calpains, does not stabilize c-Jun. Thus, selective degradation of c-Jun in F2 rat liver extracts is neither dependent on ubiquitinylation nor stimulated by the presence of ubiquitin. The 26 S proteinase complex(es) (26 S proteasome(s)) is the major soluble neutral proteolytic activity in the cell. Its proteolytic core, the 20 S proteasome, is perhaps never found free in cells and, in contrast to the 26 S particle, neither requires ATP for proteolysis nor usually degrades large proteins (16Rivett J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Peters J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 18Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). To determine whether the proteasome is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of c-Jun in rat liver extracts, F2 was proteasome-immunodepleted (F2Δprot) using an anti-proteasome antiserum already shown efficient for such a purpose (30Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S.-L. Tamura K. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Depletion was controlled as follows: (i) proteasome proteolytic activity was shown to be reduced >200-fold using the Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-NH-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin peptide substrate, which is reported to be a good substrate for the proteasome (31Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) removal of two peptide components of the proteasome was assayed using two specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2A). The latter are the cross-species reactive anti-duck p27K (IB5) antibody and anti-duck p31K (AA4 antibody) (32Grossi-de-Sa M.F. Sa C.M.D. Harper F. Coux O. Akhayat O. Florentin Y. Paul J.K. Scherrer K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 151-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Jun was no longer degraded in F2Δprot as compared with F2 and F2ΔpreI (Fig. 2S). Definitely establishing that c-Jun is a target for the proteasome, complementation of F2Δprot with purified rat liver 26 S proteasome (see below) restores quantitative degradation of c-Jun (Fig. 2B). To determine whether c-Jun is a target for the 20 S and/or the 26 S proteasome and whether a putative co-factor, present in F2, is necessary for c-Jun proteolysis, degradation experiments were conducted with comparable amounts of 20 and 26 S proteasome instead of F2 extracts. Peptide compositions of purified rat liver particles were similar to those published by others (30Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S.-L. Tamura K. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 33Ugai S.-L. Tamura T. Tanahashi N. Takai S. Komi N. Chung C.H. Tanaka K. Ishihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Under the conditions tested (50–500 ng/ml of purified particles; for experimental conditions, see legend to Fig. 3 and “Materials and Methods”), c-Jun was not degraded by the 20 S proteasome, whereas it was degraded by the 26 S proteasome, but only in the presence of ATP. As a support to the selectivity of the process, p53 and immunoglobulins revealed a resistance to both types of particles, even in the presence of ATP (Pig. 3, B and C). Importantly, (i) addition of calpastatin did not stabilize c-Jun, ruling out contamination by calpain (not shown), (ii) about 10% of c-Jun is consistently degraded without any addition of exogenous ATP, perhaps on account of 0.02 mu ATP present in the reaction mixture (since the 26 S proteasome is stored in the presence of 2 rasi ATP), (iii) c-Jun is susceptible to higher concentrations (above 5 μg/ml) of 20 S proteasome in an ATP-independent but selective manner since p53 and immunoglobulins remained insensitive under the same conditions (not shown), and (iv) c-Jun degradation is still selective and ATP-dependent at a higher concentration of 26 S proteasome (5 µg/ml of purified 26 S proteasome; not shown). The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is thought to account for the degradation of the bulk of short-lived and abnormal cellular proteins (18Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 26Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 27Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It has also been implied in antigen processing for subsequent presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (34Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1993; 363: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 35Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar) and protein processing as in the case of the pl05 NFKB1 precursor protein (36Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rock et al. (35Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar) have shown that the proteasome is involved in the degradation of the bulk of long lived intracellular proteins, whereas Gropper et al. (37Gropper R. Brandt R. Elias S. Bearer C.F. Mayer A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3602-3610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that inhibition of the £1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme does not affect their breakdown. This suggests that degradation of this class of proteins is likely proteasome-dependent but ubiquitin-independent. Finally, little information is available on the involvement of both the proteasome and of the ubiquitin pathway in the degradation of specific cellular proteins (16Rivett J.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Peters J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 18Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). We report here that c-Jun protein can be degraded in a selective and ATP-dependent manner involving the proteasome in rat liver extracts since immunoglobulins and p53 protein (along with bovine serum albumin; data not shown) are not degraded under the same experimental conditions. Thus, this adds one example to the very few characterized cellular substrates of the proteasome. Moreover, we also show that tagging by ubiquitin is not an absolute requirement for recognition and degradation of c-Jun by the 26 S proteasome. Ornithine decarboxylase, which is one of the most rapidly turned over proteins, is the only other example of such a situation. Using the reticulocyte lysate as a cell-free degradation assay, Bercovitch et al. (38Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that ornithine decarboxylase breakdown is ATP-dependent but ubiquitin-independent. More recently, using both different cell extracts and purified proteasome, Murakami et al. (30Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S.-L. Tamura K. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) have identified the 26 S proteasome as the protease responsible for ornithine decarboxylase degradation. It is worth emphasizing that if breakdown of ornithine decarboxylase does not require tagging by ubiquiting, triggering of proteolysis is dependent upon association of ornithine decarboxylase with a specific peptide co-factor, called antizyme. At variance, with ornithine decarboxylase, no specific co-factor is needed for degradation of c-Jun by purified 26 S proteasome. To our knowledge, c-Jun is thus the first demonstration that a cellular protein can bear intrinsic signal(s) for selective recognition and quantitative ATP-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This, of course, does not exclude that some co-factors may be involved in the regulation of c-Jun breakdown in vivo. c-Jun appears unique with regard to protein catabolism since several proteolytic systems have been proposed to operate on it. First, as mentioned in the introduction, in vitro and in vivo lines of evidence suggest that c-Jun degradation can be initiated in the cytoplasm by calpains (13Hirai S.-L. Kawasaki H. Yaniv M. Susuki K FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Watt F. Molloy P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5092-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.-M. Roux P. Etienne-Julan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar). However, since cleavage of c-Jun by calpains is limited, it is likely that other proteolytic activities are involved in the completion of degradation. Preliminary experiments by our group point to the involvement of the proteasome. Second, Trier et al. (12Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) have recently shown that (i) a small fraction of c-Jun is ubiquitinylated in vivo, (ii) a 27-amino acid domain (δ domain), located in the N-terminal part of c-Jun and which is deleted from the stabilized v-JmrASV17 protein, is determining for the conjugation of ubiquitin at multiple sites on the protein, and (iii) the capability to be ubiquitinylated correlates with rapid turnover since v-JunASV77 is not, or little, ubiquitinylated. However, the formal demonstration that degradation of c-Jun is actually triggered by conjugation of ubiquitin has not been brought, and the involvement of the proteasome has not been investigated. It cannot thus be ruled out that the δ domain is instrumental for rapid degradation of c-Jun through another mechanism. Third, we report here that c-Jun can be degraded by the 26 S proteasome in the absence of ubiquitinylation, at least in vitro. An important question to solve is obviously to determine whether ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent pathways actually act in vivo for c-Jun breakdown and whether they act synergistically or independently under different physiological conditions or in different cell types. To our knowledge, the possibility that an unstable protein can be degraded according to different pathways has not yet been reported. It is, however, worth noting that the situation has already been described at the RNA level since two destabilizers of the c-fos mRNA have been shown to exert their effects under different cell culture conditions (39Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Addressing the issue of the possible differential contributions of the different proteolytic machineries involved in c-Jun degradation in vivo will, however, be difficult. As a matter fact, little is known about the activation of calpains in vivo (40Croall D.E. De Martino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), on one hand, and the 26 S proteasome might have variable subunit structures according to its cellular origin and, perhaps, intracellular localization on the other hand. One can thus speculate that certain isoenzymes degrade c-Jun in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, whereas others act independently of ubiquitinylation. Purification and characterization of the different 26 S proteasomes will thus be necessary for solving this point. We thank Dr. K. Tanaka and K. Scherrer for the kind gift of anti-whole proteasome and monoclonal anti-prosome subunit antibodies, respectively. We also thank Dr. L. Debüssche for the kind gift of recombinant p53 and Drs. I.

A biochemical assay has been developed to quantitatively describe the interaction between both subunits. In vitro synthesized 35S-labeled β subunits specifically bind to a glutathione S -transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the α1a interaction domain (AIDA, located between the amino-acids 383 and 400 of the cytoplasmic loop between the hydrophobic domains I and II). Kinetic analysis demonstrates that the association of 35S-labeled β1b subunit to the AIDA GST fusion protein occurs with a fast rate constant at 4°C. The binding is almost irreversible as demonstrated by the absence of dissociation observed after an 8-h incubation with an 18-amino acid synthetic AIDA peptide. The α1-β binding site does not seem to be a target for cytoplasmic regulation. The interaction is mostly unaffected by changes in ionic strength, pH, and Ca2+ concentration or by protein kinase C phosphorylation. The specificity of subunit interaction in voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels was also followed by saturation analyses. The data obtained show that the AIDA GST fusion protein binds to a single site on the β1b with an apparent Kdof 5 nM. The affinities of AIDA GST fusion protein for various β subunits was measured and demonstrate that β subunits associate with different affinities to each α1 interaction domain. The rank order of AIDA affinity for each β subunit is as follows: β> > β> > β1b»β3. The binding of the β subunit to α1 subunit can be inhibited in vitro by the AIDA synthetic peptide with an apparent Kiof 285 nM. This interaction can also be prevented in heterologous Ca2+ channels by the injection of the AIDA GST fusion protein into Xenopus oocytes.

Digestion of reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL) prepared with apoAI and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine or palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine by chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase, and subtilisin generated a major fragment of 22 kDa. Under milder conditions proteolysis of lipid-free apoAI produced a fragment of similar size. The fragments shared the same N terminus as intact apoAI, and the chymotryptic fragment had a molecular weight of 22,384 as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Thus the fragment consists of the N-terminal 192 amino acid residues of apoAI, and the region around Tyr192 seems to be especially accessible to proteases.In aqueous solution the fragment, apoAI-(1–192), had an α-helix content similar to that of apoAI (~52%) but existed only as monomers and dimers.

Experiments with synthetic peptide analogues and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments have identified several lipid-binding regions in apoAI (e.g. residues 66–120, 147–168, 165–185, and 195–243) (for a review see Ref. 3Segrest J.P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23886-23892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Natural and genetically engineered mutants of apoAI have also been studied in attempts to correlate specific amino acid residues and sequences with lipid binding and LCAT activation functions (5Jonas A. von Eckardstein A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13205-13209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in fact the C-terminal region of apoAI has been implicated in the interaction of HDL with cell membranes (14Morrison J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18780-18785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a complex of this fragment with phospholipid binds to hepatic membranes with high affinity similar to that of an apoAI-phospholipid complex. Using monoclonal antibodies they further demonstrated that the region between residues 205 and 220 is most important for membrane binding (15Allan C.M. Fidge N.H. Morrison J.R. Kanellos J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In binding studies with truncated forms of apoAI, Dalton and Swaney (16Dalton M.B. Swaney J.B. J. Biol.

Limited proteolysis has proven to be a powerful tool in elucidating the domain structure and the structure-function relationships of many proteins (17Creighton T.E.

The earliest studies on the digestion of HDL with proteases provided limited information about the structure of apoAI in HDL (20Camejo G. Biochim. Biophys.

More recently, limited proteolysis was used to study the structure of apoAI in rHDL as well as in native HDL (16Dalton M.B. Swaney J.B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1151: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal region of apoAI in lipid complexes is susceptible to proteolysis, Dalton and Swaney (16Dalton M.B. Swaney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19274-19283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the N-terminal region is resistant to proteolytic digestion and that there exists a susceptible site in the central region. Therefore, the location of the most susceptible site(s) to proteolysis remains controversial. In addition, results on the limited proteolysis of lipid-free apoAI have not been reported. Here we report our studies of the limited proteolysis of apoAI in well characterized rHDL and in aqueous solution. We also describe some of the interesting properties of an N-terminal chymotryptic fragment, apoAI-(1–192). Human apoAI, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and LCAT were prepared by the routine methods used in our laboratory (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wald J.H. Krul E.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20037-20043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from blood plasma purchased from the Champaign County Blood Bank Regional Health Resource Center. The purity of the apoAI and LCAT preparations (>95%) was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver or Coomassie Blue staining, using the Pharmacia Phast System. The L-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), L-α-palmitoyloleoyl PC (POPC), L-α-dimyristoyl PC (DMPC), sodium cholate, crystalline cholesterol, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated bovine pancreatic trypsin (Type XIII), l-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK)-treated bovine pancreatic α-chymotrypsin (Type VII), insoluble bovine pancreatic α-chymotrypsin attached to carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC-chymotrypsin), subtilisin Carlsberg, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. Porcine pancreatic elastase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Radiolabeled [4-14C]cholesterol was purchased from DuPont NEN. Ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was obtained from Pierce. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm) were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Preparation of rHDL—The rHDL complexes were prepared by the original sodium cholate dialysis method (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wald J.H. Krul E.S. Jonas A. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) with only minor modifications. Briefly, the DPPC rHDL was prepared from a molar ratio of 100:1:100 DPPC:apoAI:sodium cholate. After removal of sodium cholate by extensive dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.01% EDTA (Tris-salt buffer), the complex was incubated at 50 °C for 24 h to enhance the homogeneity of rHDL particles. The POPC rHDL was prepared from a molar ratio of 80:4:1:80 POPC:cholesterol:apoAI:sodium cholate (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of sodium cholate, the rHDL complex was incubated with LDL (rHDL to LDL protein, 1:1 (w/w)) at 37 °C for 18 h. LDL was removed by ultracentrifugal flotation, and homogeneous 78- and 108-Å POPC rHDL particles were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 column (60 × 1.8 cm) using the Pharmacia FPLC System. Similarly POPC rHDL particles were prepared with the main chymotryptic fragment of apoAI (residues 1–192) (see below) instead of the intact apoAI, using a molar ratio of 80:4:1:160 POPC:cholesterol:fragment:sodium cholate. The particles were isolated by gel filtration as described above but without incubation with LDL. The size and purity of rHDL particles were determined by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) on 8–25% gradient gels using the Pharmacia Phast System. After Coomassie Blue staining and appropriate destaining, the gels were scanned with a Pharmacia UltroScan XL laser densitometer. The size of rHDL particles was then determined by their mobility as compared with that of protein standards of known Stokes radii, which were supplied by Pharmacia. Limited Proteolysis of ApoAI and rHDL—ApoAI or rHDL was diluted with the Tris-salt buffer to get a final concentration of 1 mg/ml apoAI. The proteases were added and mixed well to start the digestion at 25 °C in a shaking water bath. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine optimal digestion time and appropriate enzyme:substrate ratios. For time course experiments, the following enzyme:substrate ratios (w/w) were used to digest rHDL and apoAI, respectively: TLCK-chymotrypsin, 1:100 and 1:200; TPCK-trypsin, 1:200 and 1:500; elastase, 1:100 and 1:200; and subtilisin, 1:2000 and 1:5000. At various time intervals, aliquots were removed, SDS was added to obtain a final concentration of 4%, and samples were boiled for 2 min to terminate the reaction. The digestion products were stored at –20 °C until analyzed by electrophoresis. A pure chymotryptic fragment of apoAI was prepared by the digestion of apoAI using insoluble CMC-chymotrypsin (490 units/g). After being appropriately washed in the Tris-salt buffer, the CMC-chymotrypsin suspension was mixed with apoAI (10 mg of CMC-chymotrypsin/mg of apoAI) and reacted on a tilted rotator at room temperature for 2 h. CMC-chymotrypsin was then removed by centrifugation, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added (0.2 M, final concentration) to the supernatant to inactivate any residual chymotrypsin. Finally solid GdnHCl was added to attain a final concentration of 3 M, and the digestion products were transferred to dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 12,000–14,000 and dialyzed exhaustively against 3 M GdnHCl and the Tris-salt buffer in sequence in order to remove small peptides. Analysis of Proteolytic Products—The digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a discontinuous Tris-Tricine system (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). A 16.5% T, 3% C resolving gel and a 4% T, 3% C stacking gel were used. After electrophoresis, the peptide bands in the gels were either visualized with Coomassie Blue or electrophoretically transferred to membranes. The membranes were then stained, and the bands of interest were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation analysis (Genetic Engineering Facility, University of Illinois Biotechnology Center). At least five reaction cycles were performed. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a VG Quattro instrument was employed to determine the molecular weight of the main chymotryptic fragment of apoAI (Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Illinois School of Chemical Sciences). The samples were dialyzed exhaustively against 5% HOAc before mass spectrometry analysis. Chemical Composition and Cross-linking—Protein concentration, phospholipid content, and cholesterol content in rHDL were measured as described previously (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of apoAI or fragment self-association and the number of apoAI or fragment molecules per rHDL particle were determined by cross-linking the proteins with BS3 (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DMPC Binding Studies—The binding of apoAI and the chymotryptic fragment to DMPC multilamellar liposomes were studied by kinetic turbidimetric methods as described by Pownall et al. (28Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ApoAI or the fragment was added to a DMPC suspension in the Tris-salt buffer (adjusted to d = 1.062 g/ml with NaCl to prevent settling of the liposomes) at a DMPC:protein ratio of 2.5:1 (w/w) (0.2 mg/ml of protein). The experiments were performed at 24 °C, and the absorbance at 325 nm was monitored at 5-min intervals with a Kinetics Soft-Pac™ module on a Beckman DU60 spectrophotometer. After incubation for 8 h, the density of the reaction mixture was adjusted with NaBr to 1.22 g/ml, and the mixture was fractionated by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm and 24 °C for 24 h. After removal of excess salt by dialysis the protein content in the top and bottom portions was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Experiments—Uncorrected tryptophan fluorescence spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer MPF-66 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a 280-nm excitation wavelength and 4-nm excitation and emission slit widths at room temperature. All samples were adjusted to an A280 of 0.100. For the GdnHCl denaturation experiments, solid GdnHCl was added to 0.7 ml of sample in a sequential manner to give a range of GdnHCl concentrations from 0.72 to 6.37 M. Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of Illinois. Prior to the measurements all samples were adjusted to an A280 of 0.100, and CD spectra were measured in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Ten scans from 250 to 200 nm were collected and averaged. The mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm was calculated from the following relationship: [θ]222 = MRW·θ222/10·l·c, where θ222 is the observed ellipticity at 222 nm in degrees, l is the cuvette path length in cm, and c is the protein concentration in g/ml. A mean residue weight (MRW) of 115.4 and 116.4 was used for apoAI and the chymotryptic fragment, apoAI-(1–192), respectively. The percentage of α-helicity was estimated from the empirical expression of Chen et al. (30Chen Y-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar): [θ]222 = –30,300fH – 2,340. LCAT Reaction Kinetics—The rHDL complexes containing apoAI or the chymotryptic fragment were incubated with aliquots of [14C]cholesterol (~4 × 104 cpm) dispersed in 4% defatted bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight and then at 37 °C for 2 h to label the substrate particles (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stokke K.T. Norum K.R. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1971; 27: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture contained 4% defatted bovine serum albumin, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 ng of pure LCAT, and various concentrations of rHDL particles containing from 10−7 to 10−6 M apoAI or fragment in 0.5 ml of the Tris-salt buffer. The reaction was carried out for 20–30 min, and the conversion of [14C]cholesterol to cholesterol ester was less than 10%, ensuring that the initial velocity was being measured (32Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear least squares fit of the data to the expected hyperbola using the KaleidaGraph program (33Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The size and homogeneity of the apoAI rHDL particles to be subjected to limited proteolysis were examined by nondenaturing GGE. The reaction of apoAI with DPPC originally gave a closely spaced doublet (96 and 94 Å in diameter) (10Wald J.H. Krul E.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20037-20043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but after incubation at 50 °C for 12 h, a single band corresponding to 94 Å was obtained (data not shown). POPC-apoAI rHDL particles with diameters of 78 and 96 Å were also isolated and characterized as previously reported (9Jonas A. Kézdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L.H. Krul E.S. Kézdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis of apoAI and Its rHDL—Limited proteolysis was employed to study the structure of apoAI molecules in rHDL complexes as well as in lipid-free form. Four proteolytic enzymes with different specificities were chosen for the study: chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase, and subtilisin. It had been previously observed that free apoAI was much more susceptible to proteolysis than apoAI in rHDL (16Dalton M.B. Swaney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19274-19283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lins L. Piron S. Conrath K. Vanloo B. Brasseur R. Rosseneu M. Baert J. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); thus in order to attain a similar extent of hydrolysis the digestion time and enzyme:substrate ratios were decreased for lipid-free apoAI relative to rHDL. The digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE. In Fig. 1, A-D, we show the time course of proteolysis of the 94-Å DPPC rHDL (left of the standard (Std.) lane) and lipid-free apoAI (right of the standard lane). All four digestions produced a relatively stable intermediate of approximately 22 kDa. This fragment appeared immediately after the digestion started and accumulated to a significant amount during the course of hydrolysis. Lipid-free apoAI was more susceptible to proteolytic digestion than its lipid-bound forms as indicated by its extensive degradation at shorter times and lower enzyme: apoAI ratios. In contrast, apoAI in rHDL was much more resistant to proteolysis, and there was intact apoAI left after prolonged digestion. While the 22-kDa fragment was the major intermediate in rHDL digestion, some smaller fragments of about 12, 10, and 3 kDa were also observed during the degradation of lipid-free apoAI (Fig. 1, A–C). Similar results were obtained from the digestion of 78-Å and 96-Å POPC-apoAI rHDL. However, while apoAI in 78-Å rHDL was more susceptible to proteolysis, apoAI in 96-Å rHDL exhibited similar susceptibility to digestion as the 94-Å DPPC rHDL. This result agrees with our previous observations that apoAI in the 78-Å rHDL denatures more readily than either the 96-Å POPC (34Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill K.L.H. Krul E.S. Kézdy K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22123-22129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the 94-Å DPPC rHDL (10Wald J.H. Krul E.S. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20037-20043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all digestion reactions produced a relatively stable 22-kDa fragment (data not shown). Of particular interest is the limited digestion of lipid-free apoAI by chymotrypsin (Fig. 1A). When treated with chymotrypsin at a 1:200 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio for 1 h, all intact apoAI was transformed into a 22.4-kDa fragment along with a 3-kDa product. After mixing with GdnHCl and dialysis in a tubing with molecular weight cut-off of 12,000–14,000 against 3 m GdnHCl, the 3-kDa fragment was removed, and the 22.4-kDa fragment was recovered pure (>95%) for further characterization. Identification of Cleavage Sites—The N-terminal sequencing results of tryptic and chymotryptic fragments from free apoAI and rHDL are summarized in Table I. The results indicate that all large fragments contain the N terminus of apoAI. Thus proteolytic cleavage must have occurred in the C-terminal region. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of the large chymotryptic fragment gave an apparent molecular weight of 22,384 and confirmed its purity. From the known amino acid sequence of apoAI (1Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1277-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a fragment encompassing Asp1–Tyr192 would have a molecular weight of 22,385, which is very close to the experimental result. The identification of a 3-kDa chymotryptic fragment that starts at His193 (Table I) confirms that the 22.4-kDa chymotryptic fragment has a C terminus at Tyr192.Table IN-terminal sequence analysis of proteolytic fragments of apoAIProteaseSubstrateSizeaApproximate molecular weight estimated from the mobility of fragments on 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a discontinuous Tris-Tricine system (27).N-terminal sequencebThe amino acid sequence of intact apoAI is: Asp1-Glu2-Pro3-Pro4-Gln5-Ser6-Pro7- ···-Tvr192-His193-Ala194-Lys195-Ala196-Thr197-Glu198-His199- ···-Gln243 (l).kDaTLCK-chymotrypsinfree apoAI22Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···94-Å DPPC rHDL3His-Ala-Lys-Ala-Thr-Glu ···22Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···3His-Ala-Lys-Ala-Thr-Glu ···TPCK-trypsinfree apoAI22Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···94-Å DPPC rHDL22Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···78-Å POPC rHDL20Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···22Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···10Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···96-ÅPOPC rHDL7Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln-Ser ···22Asp-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gln ···a Approximate molecular weight estimated from the mobility of fragments on 16.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a discontinuous Tris-Tricine system (27).b The amino acid sequence of intact apoAI is: Asp1-Glu2-Pro3-Pro4-Gln5-Ser6-Pro7- ···-Tvr192-His193-Ala194-Lys195-Ala196-Thr197-Glu198-His199- ···-Gln243 (l). Open table in a new tab Self-association and Lipid Binding Properties of ApoAI-(1–192)—The 22.4-kDa N-terminal fragment, apoAI-(1–192), was used in the following experiments for structural and functional studies. Cross-linking experiments were conducted to study the self-association of apoAI-(1–192) in aqueous solution in comparison with apoAI. As shown in Fig. 2, apoAI formed several oligomers, including dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, etc. in addition to monomers (lane 1). In contrast, apoAI-(1–192) gave almost exclusively monomers and dimers (lane 4). The dimer formation appeared to be concentration-dependent in the range of 0.5–2.5 mg/ml; however, even at 2.5 mg/ml, no higher oligomers were seen on the SDS gel. The ratio of dimer to monomer for apoAI-(1–192) was estimated to be 1:2 at 2.5 mg/ml (Fig. 2, lane 4) when the gel was scanned and the area under each peak was measured. Evidently the C-terminal region of apoAI plays a critical role in the oligomerization of the protein in aqueous solution. DMPC binding experiments were performed to study the effect of the loss of the C-terminal region on the initial interaction of apoAI with phospholipid bilayers. As illustrated in Fig. 3, intact apoAI bound and solubilized DMPC rapidly as indicated by the dramatic decrease in the turbidity of DMPC dispersions. In contrast, apoAI-(1–192) at the same concentration as apoAI interacted very slowly with DMPC. When the reaction mixtures were fractionated by ultracentrifugation at 1.22 g/ml after incubation at 24 °C for 8 h, ~80% of apoAI was recovered from the top fraction in DMPC-bound form, while for apoAI-(1–192) only ~35% of the protein was recovered in the top fraction. Apparently the loss of the C-terminal region diminishes the ability of the apolipoprotein to bind to lipid and to spontaneously form rHDL. Preparation and Chemical Composition of ApoAI-(1–192) rHDL—Fig. 4A shows a representative preparation of POPC-apoAI-(1–192) rHDL. At a POPC:cholesterol:protein molar ratio of 80:4:1, the major rHDL species were 77, 100, and 115 Å in diameter with some minor species about 120 A and larger.

By use of this assay system, we purified here bovine REKS to near homogeneity from the cytosol fraction of bovine brain by successive chromatographies of Mono S, Mono Q, GTPγS-glutathione S-transferase-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose, and Mono Q columns. It was composed of three proteins with masses of about 95, 32, and 30 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 95-, 32-, and 30-kDa proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis to be B-Raf protein kinase, 14-3-3 protein, and 14-3-3 protein, respectively. Moreover, the REKS activity was specifically immunoprecipitated by an anti-B-Raf antibody. Bovine REKS was activated by lipid-modified GTPγS-Ki-Ras far more effectively than by a lipid-unmodified one. Lipid-modified GDP-Ki-Ras was inactive. Exogenous addition of 14-3-3 proteins stimulated further the REKS activity both in the presence and absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras.

Moreover, MAP kinase is activated by B-Raf, but not by c-Raf-1, in intact PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor (13Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MEK activating activity is accompanied with B-Raf, but not with c-Raf-1, in bovine brain or chromaffin cells (15Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. Weber M.J. J. Biol.

However, it has not been demonstrated that GTP-Ras directly activates these MEK kinases in a cell-free assay system.To identify the direct target of Ras, we have previously developed a cell-free assay system in which GTP-Ras activates MEK (27Itoh T.

By use of this assay system, we have identified a protein factor that is essential for Ras-dependent MEK activation and tentatively named it REKS (Ras-dependent ERK Kinase Stimulator) (27Itoh T.

We have also shown that post-translationally lipid-modified Ras is far more effective on the activation of REKS than lipid-unmodified Ras (28Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3025-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, lipid-modifications of Ras are essential for the Ras-dependent activation of c-Raf-1 in insect cells overexpressing Ras and c-Raf-1 (29Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

We have found that bovine brain REKS is composed of B-Raf complexed with 14-3-3 proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of REKSBovine brains were obtained from the heads of freshly slaughtered cattle. All the purification procedures were performed at 0-4°C. Gray matter of cerebra (about 1.6 kg, wet weight) were homogenized in a Waring blender with 1.7 volumes of Homogenizing Buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.9, 2 mM EDTA, 5 μM APMSF, 1 mg/l leupeptin, and 1 mg/l pepstatin A). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. After one-ninth volume of Buffer A (200 mM Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 100 mM EGTA, and 50 mM MgCl2) was added to the supernatant, one-ninth volume of ethylene glycol was added to give the final concentration of 10%. The supernatant was then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.Bovine brain cytosol (200 ml, 1.4 g of protein) was thawed on ice, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was sequentially filtrated through 2.0-, 0.8-, 0.45-, and 0.2-μm filters. The filtrated supernatant (160 ml, 1.1 g of protein) was then applied to a Mono S column (1.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 80 ml of Buffer B (20 mM HEPES/NaOH at pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 μM APMSF). After the column was washed with 80 ml of Buffer B, elution was performed with a 240-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-1.0 M) in Buffer B and fractions of 4 ml each were collected. REKS appeared in fractions 80-90 (Fig. 1A). After 1.5 M Tris was added to 160 ml of the active fractions of Fig. 1A to adjust pH to 7.5, the active fractions were diluted with an equal volume of Buffer C (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10 μM APMSF) and applied to a Mono Q column (1.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 80 ml of Buffer C. After the column was washed with 80 ml of Buffer C, elution was performed with a 240-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.125-0.5 M) in Buffer C and fractions of 4 ml each were collected. REKS appeared in fractions 118-122 (Fig. 1B). GTPγS- or GDP-GST-Ha-Ras (15 nmol each) was separately applied to a glutathione-agarose column (0.6 ml) pre-equilibrated with 9 ml of Buffer D (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EGTA), and the column was washed with 15 ml of Buffer D. Forty ml of the active fractions of Fig. 1B was applied to this column and washed sequentially with 6 ml of Buffer D, 6 ml of Buffer D containing 0.25 M NaCl, and 6 ml of Buffer D. Elution was performed with 1.8 ml of Buffer D containing 20 mM reduced glutathione (Fig. 1C). The active eluate fractions of Fig. 1C were applied to a Mono Q column (0.16 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 1 ml of Buffer D. After the column was washed with 2 ml of Buffer D, elution was performed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.5 M) in Buffer D. At 190 mM NaCl, however, the gradient was placed on hold for 4 ml to remove REKS-unbound GST-Ha-Ras and then continued. Fractions of 100 μl each were collected (Fig. 2A). REKS appeared in fractions 93-100.Figure 2:Second Mono Q column chromatography of the affinity-purified REKS. Each fraction (1 μl) was assayed for the REKS activity. Another aliquot (60 μl) of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and immunoblot analysis. A, REKS activity. B, silver staining.

Anti-c-Raf-1, anti-A-Raf, and anti-B-Raf polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

REKS activity was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by recombinant GST-ERK2 in the presence of recombinant GST-MEK as described (35Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B.

SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal.

The second peak was enhanced by GTPγS-Ki-Ras, but not by GDP-Ki-Ras, whereas the first peak was not affected by GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Moreover, the second peak was dependent on MEK, whereas the first peak was not (data not shown). Therefore, the second peak was a bovine counterpart of Xenopus REKS. When the active fractions of Fig. 1A were subjected to a Mono Q column chromatography and each fraction was assayed for the REKS activity, three peaks appeared (Fig. 1B). The first peak was enhanced by GTPγS-Ki-Ras, whereas the second and third peaks were not. All peaks were dependent on recombinant MEK (data not shown). Therefore, the first peak was REKS and the other peaks were unknown MEK kinases. The active fractions of Fig. 1B were applied to a GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column chromatography. About 45% of the total REKS activity was adsorbed to the column and was eluted by reduced glutathione (Fig. 1C). About 70% of GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras was also eluted by reduced glutathione (data not shown). Any REKS activity was not adsorbed to the GDP-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column. When the active eluate fractions of Fig. 1C were subjected to a Mono Q column chromatography, the REKS activity was detected as a single peak (Fig. 2A). When each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining, the peak of REKS was accompanied with four proteins and most GST-Ha-Ras was recovered in other fractions (Fig. 2B). The masses of these proteins were about 95, 49, 32, and 30 kDa. The protein with a mass of 49 kDa was GST-Ha-Ras itself. The proteins with masses of 95, 32, and 30 kDa were identified by immunoblot analysis to be B-Raf, 14-3-3 protein, and 14-3-3 protein, respectively (Fig. 2C).To further confirm that REKS includes B-Raf, we examined the immunoprecipitation of REKS with an anti-B-Raf antibody. After the REKS sample of Fig. 1B was incubated with or without an anti-B-Raf antibody, its activity was measured in the supernatant and precipitate (Fig. 3A). In the presence of the antibody, the REKS activity was recovered in the precipitate, whereas, in the absence of the antibody, the REKS activity was recovered in the supernatant. Moreover, the REKS activity was not immunoprecipitated by any of the antibodies against A-Raf and c-Raf-1 and no immunoreactivities against A-Raf and c-Raf-1 were detected in the REKS sample of Fig. 1B (data not shown). It may be noted that the recovery of the REKS activity in the precipitate was about 500% (Fig. 3A). To clarify the reason for this increase in the recovery, the REKS activity was measured in the presence or absence of the anti-B-Raf antibody. The REKS activity increased about 5-fold in the presence of the antibody compared to that in the absence of the antibody (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Immunoprecipitation of REKS by an anti-B-Raf antibody and effect of an anti-B-Raf antibody on the REKS activity. A, immunoprecipitation of REKS by an anti-B-Raf antibody. The first peak of Fig. 1 B (100 μl) was incubated with or without an anti-B-Raf antibody (40 μl) for 1.5 h at 4°C. After Protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl) were added, the immunocomplex was precipitated and washed sequentially with Buffer C containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and with Buffer C. The precipitate (1 μl) or supernatant (1 μl) was assayed for the REKS activity in the presence or absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Open bar, in the absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Closed bar, in the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6, without an anti-B-Raf antibody; lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8, with an anti-B-Raf antibody. Lanes 1-4, supernatant; lanes 5-8, precipitate. B, effect of an anti-B-Raf antibody on the REKS activity. After the REKS sample of Fig. 1 B (100 μl) was incubated with or without an anti-B-Raf antibody (5 μl) for 1.5 h at 4°C, the mixture (1 μl) was assayed for the REKS activity in the presence or absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Open bar, without GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Closed bar, with GTPγS-Ki-Ras. Lanes 1 and 2, without an anti-B-Raf antibody; lanes 3 and 4, with an anti-B-Raf antibody. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have shown previously that lipid-modified Ras is far more effective than lipid-unmodified Ras on the activation of Xenopus REKS (28Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3025-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, lipid-modified GTPγS-Ki-Ras activated bovine REKS, whereas lipid-unmodified GTPγS-Ki-Ras was nearly inactive (data not shown). The Kavalue for lipid-modified GTPγS-Ki-Ras, giving a half-maximum activation, was about 20 nM. We have reported previously that 14-3-3 proteins and GTPγS-Ki-Ras synergistically stimulate Xenopus REKS (35Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins purified from rat brain markedly stimulated the REKS activity in the absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, whereas 14-3-3 proteins slightly stimulated it in the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras (data not shown). However, the maximal levels activated by the addition of 14-3-3 proteins were almost the same in the presence and absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. The Kavalues for 14-3-3 proteins were also the same in the presence and absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras and were about 100 nM.DISCUSSIONWe have purified here REKS from bovine brain cytosol and shown that bovine brain REKS is composed of at least three proteins with masses of about 95, 32, and 30 kDa. The 95-, 32-, and 30-kDa proteins have been identified to be B-Raf, 14-3-3 protein, and 14-3-3 protein, respectively. These results are consistent with the earlier observations that MAP kinase is activated by B-Raf in response to nerve growth factor in PC12 cells (13Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that association of MEK with immobilized Ras is dependent on B-Raf in rat brain (14Moodie S.A. Paris M.J. Kolch W. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and that MEK activating activity is accompanied with B-Raf in bovine brain or chromaffin cells (15Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30014-30021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we have purified here REKS by the GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column chromatography, the purified REKS is likely to be complexed with GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras and to be converted to an active form. Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that an inactive form of REKS contains a component other than B-Raf and 14-3-3 proteins.14-3-3 proteins interact directly with c-Raf-1 in in vivo and in vitro systems and enhance its activity (31Freed E.

Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The present result that REKS is B-Raf complexed with 14-3-3 proteins is consistent with these earlier observations (31Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 32Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Errede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We have described previously that 14-3-3 proteins slightly activate Xenopus REKS in the absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, whereas they synergistically activate it in the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras (35Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, 14-3-3 proteins markedly stimulated bovine REKS in the absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras and slightly stimulated it in the presence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras, although the maximal levels activated by the addition of 14-3-3 proteins were almost the same in the presence and absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. This present result is not consistent with our earlier observation for Xenopus REKS, but this discrepancy may be due to the difference of the properties between Xenopus REKS and bovine REKS. Furthermore, to examine whether 14-3-3 proteins are essential for the Ras-dependent activation of bovine REKS, we have attempted to separate 14-3-3 proteins from B-Raf but have not yet succeeded. It remains to be clarified whether 14-3-3 proteins are essential for the Ras-dependent activation of B-Raf.We have found here that the REKS activity immunoprecipitated by the anti-B-Raf antibody is enhanced by the antibody irrespective of the presence or absence of GTPγS-Ki-Ras. The N-terminal domain of c-Raf-1 inhibits its kinase activity presumably by masking its kinase domain (42Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell.

It is possible that the association of an anti-B-Raf antibody with B-Raf relieves it from the inhibitory action of the N-terminal domain, resulting in the activation of REKS. This result has raised a possibility that there may be another factor that mimics the action of the antibody.We have previously identified a possible protein of Xenopus REKS with a mass of 98 kDa, immunologically distinct from B-Raf (30Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Imazumi K. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2460-2465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, Xenopus REKS and bovine REKS share the similar properties. They are adsorbed to the GTPγS-GST-Ha-Ras-coupled glutathione-agarose column. They have similar minimum molecular sizes on SDS-PAGE. Lipid modifications of Ras are critical for their activation. These observations suggest that the 98-kDa protein of Xenopus REKS is the counterpart of the 95-kDa protein of bovine REKS. The reason why the 98-kDa protein of Xenopus REKS was not recognized by an anti-B-Raf antibody is not known, but it is possible that the amino acids of the C terminus of the Xenopus 98-kDa protein are different from those of the bovine 95-kDa protein, namely B-Raf, against which the anti-B-Raf antibody was generated.A-Raf, B-Raf, and c-Raf-1 are expressed in brain (45Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified here REKS as B-Raf, but not A-Raf or c-Raf-1, in brain. On the other hand, c-Raf-1 directly interacts with GTP-Ras in cell-free assay systems (19Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A.

Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar), and c-Raf-1 preactivated in intact cells activates MEK in cell-free systems (8Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A.J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Although these earlier observations suggest that c-Raf-1 activated by GTP-Ras activates MEK, no direct evidence has thus far been obtained that GTP-Ras activates c-Raf-1 or A-Raf in cell-free assay systems. The failure that bovine brain A-Raf or c-Raf-1 is not activated by GTPγS-Ki-Ras in our system may be due to the contamination of some interfering materials in the A-Raf or c-Raf-1 fractions, or to the absence of a certain factor necessary for the Ras-dependent MEK activation. B-Raf is expressed only in cerebrum, spinal cord, and testis (45Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar). If A-Raf or c-Raf-1 is not responsible for the Ras-dependent MEK activation, another B-Raf isoform or another MEK kinase may be present and responsible for the Ras-dependent MEK activation in other tissues.

Nature. 1993; 363: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, MAP kinase is activated by B-Raf, but not by c-Raf-1, in intact PC12 cells in response to nerve growth factor (13Jaiswal R.K. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Landreth G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Association of MEK with immobilized Ras is dependent on B-Raf, but not on c-Raf-1, in rat brain (14Moodie S.A. Paris M.J. Kolch W. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MEK activating activity is accompanied with B-Raf, but not with c-Raf-1, in bovine brain or chromaffin cells (15Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30014-30021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated that GTP-Ras directly activates these MEK kinases in a cell-free assay system.To identify the direct target of Ras, we have previously developed a cell-free assay system in which GTP-Ras activates MEK (27Itoh T.

By use of this assay system, we have identified a protein factor that is essential for Ras-dependent MEK activation and tentatively named it REKS (Ras-dependent ERK Kinase Stimulator) (27Itoh T.

We have also shown that post-translationally lipid-modified Ras is far more effective on the activation of REKS than lipid-unmodified Ras (28Itoh T. Kaibuchi K. Masuda T. Yamamoto T. Matsuura Y. Maeda A. Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3025-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, lipid-modifications of Ras are essential for the Ras-dependent activation of c-Raf-1 in insect cells overexpressing Ras and c-Raf-1 (29Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20054-20059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently highly purified REKS from Xenopus eggs and identified a possible protein of REKS with a mass of 98 kDa, which is immunologically distinct from c-Raf-1, Mos, and mSte11 (30Kuroda S.

ET-18-OCH3 inhibited choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine as well as total phospholipid synthesis. Exposure to ET-18-OCH3 at the G1/S boundary led to the accumulation of cells in G2, whereas the addition of ET-18-OCH3 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle prevented entry into the S phase. In both cases, ET-18-OCH3 treatment triggered DNA fragmentation and morphological changes associated with apoptosis within 10 h. The addition of lysophosphatidylcholine provided an exogenous source of cellular phospholipid and prevented ET-18-OCH3-dependent accumulation of cells in G2 and apoptosis. However, lysophosphatidylcholine did not overcome the ET-18-OCH3-dependent Gx block, although the growth-arrested cells remained viable. These data indicate that restoring phosphatidylcholine synthesis by supplementation with lysophosphatidylcholine overrides the cytotoxic but not the cytostatic activity of ET-18-OCH3.

There is a growing interest in antineoplastic ether-linked phospholipid analogs because they do not directly target DNA and could potentially complement existing DNA-directed anticancer treatment regimens.

Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the effectiveness of several antineoplastic ether-linked phospholipid analogs against a variety of cancers (for review see Ref. 11Berdel W.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and one example of encouraging clinical research with ET-18-OCH3 is its use in purging leukemic bone marrow for autologous bone marrow transplantation (12Vogler W.R. Berdel W.E. J. Hematotherapy. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Many biological processes have been suggested as primary targets for ET-18-OCH3 action (for review see Ref. 13Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R. Cancer Chemotherapy. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd, Oxford1993: 146-178Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 has detergent properties, spontaneously transfers between membrane systems (14Vallari D.S. Record M. Smith Z.L. Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and will lyse cells at high concentrations (15Noseda A. White J.G. Godwin P.L. Jerome W.G. Modest E.J. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1989; 50: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the detergent action of the compound does not account for its biological activity because cell growth is not affected by exposure to the same concentrations of similar detergents such as LPC. The possibility that ET-18-OCH3 functions as an analog of platelet-activating factor has also been ruled out (16Salari H. Dryden P. Howard S. Bittman R. Biochem.

Protein kinase C is a definite target for ET-18-OCH3 inhibition in vitro (for review see Ref. 13Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R. Cancer Chemotherapy. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd, Oxford1993: 146-178Google Scholar), and several protein kinase C-regulated functions are blocked by ET-18-OCH3 in vivo (19Parker J. Daniel L.W. Waite M. J.

Lipids. 1987; 22: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, protein kinase C activation is not thought to be an obligatory component in growth factor signal transduction in hematopoietic cells, and, in the BAC1.2F5 cell system, protein kinase C activation is not involved in CSF-l-dependent cell cycle progression (23Xu X.X. Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 blocks the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides initiated by platelet-derived growth factor receptor stimulation in fibroblasts, and it inhibits the activity of phos-pholipases C in vitro (24Seewald M.J. Olsen R.A. Sehgal I. Melder D.C. Modest E.J. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4458-4463PubMed Google Scholar, 25Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C. Melder D. Riebow J. Modest E.J.

Recent work has established that ET-18-OCH3-treated cells undergo apoptosis (31Mollinedo F. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer. 1993; 53: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and this key finding accounts for the cytotoxic activity of the ether lipid. In 1979, Modolell et al. (33Modolell M. Andreesen R. Pahlke W. Brugger U. Munder P.G. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 4681-4686PubMed Google Scholar) reported that ET-18-OCH3-treated cells had reduced levels of PtdCho. Subsequently, several groups showed that ET-18-OCH3 blocks choline incorporation into PtdCho (34Vogler W.R. Whigham E. Bennett W.D. Olson A.C. Exp.

Commun. 1991; 176: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 inhibition of PtdCho synthesis arises from the inhibition of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity where ET-18-OCH3 is thought to act as a LPC analog (38Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline and is the rate-controlling step in de novo PtdCho synthesis (39Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 40Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 225-239Google Scholar). CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity is necessary for cell survival (41Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not only because PtdCho is the major membrane constituent but also because PtdCho is a precursor to the two other most abundant membrane phospholipids, sphingomyelin (42Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylethanolamine (43Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis is blocked in vivo by LPC and its analogs (38Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whether the inhibition of PtdCho synthesis plays a determinant role in the cytotoxic action of ET-18-OCH3 or whether it is an unrelated metabolic effect that does not contribute to ET-18-OCH3 action remains an open question. LPC can circumvent the requirement for CDP-choline production by its uptake and acylation to PtdCho (44Jamil H. Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4332-4339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The addition of LPC to the culture medium restores the proliferative capacity of a CHO cell line with a conditional defect in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity (46Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have examined the effects of LPC on ET-18-OCH3 toxicity to elucidate the role of inhibiting membrane phospholipid synthesis in the action of this antineoplastic agent. Sources of supplies were: DuPont NEN, [32P]orthophosphate (carrier free), phospho[14C]choline (specific, activity 50 mCi/mmol), [3H]choline (specific activity, 86.6 Ci/mmol); CDP-[14C]choline (specific activity, 58 mCi/mmol), [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 87.7 Ci/mmol), and 125I-protein A (specific activity, 30 mCi/mg); Analtech, Silica Gel G thin-layer plates; Hyclone Inc., fetal calf serum; Life Technologies, Inc., Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, choline-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and other tissue culture supplies; and Sigma, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CDP-choline, lactate dehydrogenase assay kit, leupeptin, CTP, and aprotinin. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against purified rat CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase were the same as described by Jackowski (47Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant CSF-1 was kindly provided by the Genetics Institute. All other materials were reagent grade or better. The cell line used in this work was BAC1.2F5, a macrophage-like, CSF-l-dependent clone derived from the BACI line (48Morgan C. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that originated from transfection of splenic adherent cells from a (BALB/c × A.CA)F, mouse with simian virus 40 origin-defective DNA (49Schwarzbaum S. Halpern R. Diamond B. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1158-1162PubMed Google Scholar). The BAC1.2F5 line exhibits many properties of macrophages, including production of lysozyme, collagenase, and esterase. BAC1.2F5 cells have an absolute requirement for CSF-1 for both proliferation and survival (50Tushinski R.J. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). BAC1.2F5 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 25% LCM, 1% glutamine, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3. Human recombinant CSF-1 was added at a concentration of 200 units/ml (90 ng/ml). The human growth factor was as effective as murine CSF-1, and stimulation of the cells with 25% LCM was equivalent to the addition of 300 ng/ml CSF-1. BAC1.2F5 cells were arrested in G1 by the removal of CSF-1 for 18 h and stimulated to traverse the cell cycle by the readdition of either recombinant CSF-1 or LCM. The timing of the BAC1.2F5 cell cycle under these conditions has been determined (51Rock C.O. Cleveland J.L. Jackowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). BAC1.2F5 cells were seeded into 12-well cluster dishes at 6 × 104/well in 2.5 ml of complete medium on day 1. On day 2, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. On day 3, the medium was replaced with medium without CSF-1 to synchronize the cells in Gx. On day 4, the starvation medium was replaced and conditions were as described in the figure legends with the addition of [3H]thymidine (15 μCi/ml). 24 h later, the medium was removed, and the cells in the medium were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. The adherent cells were washed twice with PBS and released from the dish by a short (∼1 min) treatment with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA in Hanks’ balanced salt solution, Life Technologies, Inc.). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined in duplicate aliquote from each sample by liquid scintillation counting. BAC1.2F5 cells were seeded at 0.5 × 106/dish in 100-mm dishes in complete LCM on day 1. On days 2–4, conditions were as described in the figure legends. The number of viable cells was determined on days 2–5 by trypan blue exclusion. The data are expressed as the mean number of viable cells/dish ± S.E. BAC1.2F5 cells were incubated in complete LCM for 48 h. The medium was replaced with choline-depleted complete LCM, and, 24 h later, fresh choline-depleted medium was added. Conditions were as described in the figure legends with the addition of [3H]choline (final concentrations, 2 μΜ and 1.5 μCi/ml). After the intervals indicated, the adherent cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The incorporation of label into the aqueous and organic soluble phases was determined after lipid extraction (52Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43126) Google Scholar). Total phospholipid accumulation was quantitated by equilibrium labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (47Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAC1.2F5 cells were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 25% LCM for 2 days, starved for CSF-1 for 18 h, and restimulated with LCM as the source of CSF-1. Thus, the phosphate-deficient medium contained 25% of the total inorganic phosphate found in normal growth medium. All media contained 3 μCi/ml. [32P]orthophosphate. 24 h after the readdition of growth factor, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of cold methanol. The lipids were extracted (52Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43126) Google Scholar), and the incorporation of label into phospholipids was quantitated by scintillation counting. We confirmed that ET-18-OCH3 inhibited PtdCho synthesis in the BAC1.2F5 cell system. Cells were labeled with [3H]choline, and the effect of 12 μΜ ET-18-OCH3 on the incorporation of label into phospholipid over a 6-h time course was determined (Fig. LA). A concentration of 12 μΜ ET-18-OCH3 maximally inhibited [3H]choline incorporation into phospholipid (38Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 reduced PtdCho synthesis as early as 1 h in BAC1.2F5 cells (Fig. 1A). This inhibition was not due to the inability of the cells to take up choline, because the accumulation of label in the soluble pool was the same in treated and untreated cells at 2 h. Also, thin-layer chromatography of the soluble pool at 2 h showed that the principal component was phosphocholine, which was present in equal amounts in both treated and untreated cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the exposure of BAC1.2F5 cells to LPC did not reverse the inhibition of PtdCho synthesis by ET-18-OCH3 (Fig. LA), because LPC itself inhibits PtdCho synthesis at the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase step (38Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because PtdCho is a precursor to the other two major membrane phospholipids in BAC1.2F5 cells, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine, the inhibition of PtdCho synthesis should block total membrane phospholipid accumulation. To verify this point, we labeled BAC1.2F5 cells to equilibrium with a constant amount of [32P]orthophosphate for 2 days prior to the experiment, during CSF-1 starvation, and throughout the cell cycle following CSF-1 stimulation. The indicated cultures received ET-18-OCH3 at the time of CSF-1 readdition, and the total [32P]phospholipid accumulation over a 24-h period (one cell cycle) was measured (Fig. 1B). In the absence of the drug, the phospholipid content increased within 24 h as reported previously (47Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with ET-18-OCH3 blocked the increase in cellular phospholipid content, and the amount of total phospholipid remaining at 24 h was actually less than the amount present at the start of Gx. Both PtdCho synthesis and degradation are operative during the G1 phase, resulting in rapid turnover of the PtdCho pool (47Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower phospholipid content in the presence of ET-18-OCH3 is consistent with continued PtdCho degradation in the absence of new synthesis, resulting in a smaller pool of phospholipid. Addition of ET-18-OCH3 at the G1/S Boundary Inhibits Completion of the Cell Cycle—BAC1.2F5 cells increase their phospholipid mass during the S phase (47Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so we first determined the effect of ET-18-OCH3 inhibition of phospholipid synthesis on progression through the S and G2/M phases by adding the drug at the G1/S boundary (10 h). As expected, untreated control cells traversed the cell cycle and returned to G1 phase 24 h after the readdition of CSF-1 (Fig. 2A, panel I). As another control, cells were treated with nocodazole, a cell cycle blocker known to arrest cells in the M phase, which led to the accumulation of cells containing 4 n DNA (Fig. 2A, panel II). CSF-1 starvation is an excellent cell synchronization technique, but growth factor deprivation results in a loss of cell viability between 15 and 25% (51Rock C.O. Cleveland J.L. Jackowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cells remaining in G1 in nocodazole-treated cells represent the population of nonviable cells (in this case 15% of the total) that did not recover from CSF-1 starvation and lost the capacity to traverse the cell cycle. The addition of ET-18-OCH3 at 10 h resulted in the accumulation of the cells in the G2/M phase (Fig. 2A, panel III). An additional feature of the flow cytofluorometry profile of ET-18-OCH3-treated cells was the appearance of cells with DNA contents less than 2 n (Fig. 2A, panel III) showing that ET-18-OCH3 treatment led to DNA fragmentation. DNA degradation likely occurred in 4 n as well as 2 n cells, obscuring a clear view of the number of cells in the S phase, but the lack of a significant accumulation of S phase cells indicated that DNA replication was largely completed, whereas phospholipid synthesis was inhibited by ET-18-OCH3. This observation is in agreement with earlier results that demonstrated the independence of the two processes (47Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained cytospins revealed that the ET-18-OCH3-treated cells either had apoptotic morphology or maintained intact nuclear membranes (data not shown). The absence of mitotic figures suggested that the cells were primarily accumulating in G2. Maximum accumulation in the G2/M phase occurred at 12 μΜ ET-18-OCH3 (Fig. 2B), the same concentration required to maximally inhibit PtdCho synthesis (38Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Thus, ET-18-OCH3 addition at the G1/S boundary inhibited progression beyond the G2 phase, whereas S phase progression was relatively unaffected. Addition of ET-18-OCH3 in G1 Prevents Progression to S Phase—A more comprehensive set of experiments was performed to determine the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on cell cycle progression. BAC1.2F5 cells were synchronized in G1; and the growth factor was added back to initiate the cycle. The drug was added at different times during the Gx or S phase, and the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on the cell cycle parameters at 24 h was determined (Fig. 3). First, the addition of ET-18-OCH3 at the same time as CSF-1 resulted in a Gx profile and the appearance of a large fragmented DNA signal (Fig. 3G). Fragmented DNA was detected as less than 2 N DNA content in the histograms. These data are consistent with ET-18-OCH3 preventing the cells from exiting the G1 phase. Although the flow cytofluorometry profile could be interpreted to mean that ET-18-OCH3-treated cells traversed the entire cell cycle and returned to the G1 phase as was the case with untreated control cells (Fig. 3K), further experiments showed that the addition of ET-18-OCH3 at the same time as CSF-1 blocked [3H]thymidine incorporation, demonstrating that ET-18-OCH3-treated cells did not enter the S phase (see below). After the addition of ET-18-OCH3 at 6 h, the majority of the cells remained in the G1 phase, although a population of cells were blocked in the G2/M phase, and fragmented DNA was evident (Fig. 3if). The addition of ET-18-OCH3 at 10 h gave the highest percentage of cells in the G2/M phase and lower levels of fragmented DNA (Fig. 3I). The addition of ET-18-OCH3 at 18 h (late S phase) (Fig. 3D) did not arrest the cells in the G2/M phase as indicated by the approximate doubling of viable cell counts. Fragmented DNA was not detected 6 h later when the cells were harvested (Fig. 3J). Again, the population of cells in G1 in Fig. 3D represents those cells that did not recover from CSF-1 starvation and were not able to enter the cell cycle. Finally, the addition of ET-18-OCH3 to an asynchronous population of cells for 24 h showed the accumulation of fragmented DNA and cells arrested in both Gt and G2/M phases (Fig. 3L). These data suggest the working hypothesis that ET-18-OCH3 inhibits cell cycle progression in the gap phases. Furthermore, the longer the exposure to ET-18-OCH3 the greater the accumulation of fragmented DNA, regardless of whether the cells accumulated in the Gx or G2 phase. These data also indicated that the cytotoxic action of ET-18-OCH3 was associated with apoptosis. The acylation of LPC to form PtdCho is a mechanism for the synthesis of PtdCho that circumvents a requirement for the CDP-choline pathway. We reasoned that if a block in PtdCho synthesis was responsible for the cytotoxic effects of ET-18-OCH3, then the addition of LPC might enable the cells to overcome ET-18-OCH3 inhibition of membrane synthesis during the cell cycle and perhaps the associated DNA fragmentation and cell death. We first determined whether LPC addition affected the accumulation of cells in the G2 phase when ET-18-OCH3 was added at 10 h at the Gt/S boundary (Fig. 4). These data clearly demonstrate that the presence of LPC allowed the cells to overcome the ET-18-OCH3-dependent accumulation of 4 N cells and prevented the accumulation of fragmented DNA (less than 2 N DNA content) (Fig. 4). LPC did not relieve the ET-18-OCH3 inhibition of the CDP-choline pathway for membrane PtdCho synthesis (Fig. 1A) but rather was incorporated into the membrane phospholipid fraction and rapidly acylated to yield PtdCho (38Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), thus providing an alternate route for PtdCho production and maintenance of membrane mass. These experiments suggested that inhibition of membrane PtdCho synthesis contributed to the inhibition of cell growth and the induction of apoptosis. We next tested whether the addition of LPC could overcome the ET-18-OCH3 block in the G1 phase. Cells were synchronized, CSF-1 with or without LPC was added along with the indicated concentration of ET-18-OCH3, and the ability of the cells to incorporate [3H]thymidine was measured (Fig. 5). LPC did not alter the pattern of ET-18-OCH3 inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation, demonstrating that LPC did not allow the cells to overcome the block in the G± phase. However, flow cytofluorometry of cells treated for 24 h in the presence of ET-18-OCH3 plus LPC revealed that LPC prevented ET-18-OCH3-dependent DNA fragmentation (data not shown and Fig. 4). These data suggested that, although BAC1.2F5 cells would not divide and proliferate in the presence of ET-18-OCH3, the addition of LPC would protect the cells from the cytotoxic effects of the drug, and they would remain viable. To test this idea, we performed a series of long term growth experiments to provide additional information on how LPC modulates the effects of ET-18-OCH3. Exponentially growing cells were treated on day 2 with 4 μΜ ET-18-OCH3 either in the presence or absence of 50 μΜ LPC, and the viable cell number was measured over the next 3 days (Fig. 6). Cells treated with ET-18-OCH3 alone quickly lost viability. LPC had little effect on the growth of control cells but prevented the ET-18-OCH3-treated cells from dying. These data are consistent with the previous experiments where LPC was shown to override G2/M inhibition and prevent the accumulation of fragmented DNA (Fig. 4); but the LPC was unable to overcome the G1 block (Fig. 5), and the cells remained in growth stasis. The exposure of BAC1.2F5 cells to ET-18-OCH3 resulted in progressive morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 7, B and C). The first noticeable change in the cell population was the appearance of cells with condensed and fragmented nuclei (Fig. IB). This was followed by the accumulation of enucleated “ghosts,” which contained only scattered remnants of condensed nuclei (Fig. 7C). These morphological changes were consistent with ET-18-OCH, triggering apoptosis in BAC1.2F5 cells and were consistent with the findings made in other cell lines (27Downing J.R. Margolis B.L. Zilberstein A. Ashmun R.A. Ullrich A. Sherr C.J. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3345-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Whetton A.D. Monk P.N. Consalvey S.D. Downes C.P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3281-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another important result from microscopic examination of ET-18-OCH3-treated cells inhibited in progression through the G2/M phase (Fig. 7B) was the presence of an intact nuclear membrane and the absence of mitotic figures in those cells that did not yet show evidence of apoptosis, consistent with accumulation in the G2 rather than the M phase. BAC1.2F5 cells treated with ET-18-OCH3 plus LPC were not morphologically distinguishable from control cells (Fig. 7, compare A and D) indicating that LPC abrogated the cytotoxicity of ET-18-OCH3 (Fig. 6) by preventing programmed cell death. Our data are consistent with the inhibition of membrane PtdCho synthesis, accounting for the cytotoxic but not the cytostatic activity of ET-18-OCH3. Earlier research established that ET-18-OCH., blocks PtdCho synthesis (29Hamilton J.A. Veis N. Bordun A.M. Vairo G. Gonda T.J. Phillips W.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Imamura K. Dianoux A. Nakamura T. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2423-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Mollinedo F.

The significance of these observations of the action of the drug was not clear previously, because ET-18-OCH3 also inhibits other key enzymes, such as protein kinase C and phospholipase C (13Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R. Cancer Chemotherapy. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd, Oxford1993: 146-178Google Scholar, 19Parker J. Daniel L.W. Waite M. J. Biol.

Lipids. 1987; 22: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, providing an exogenous source of PtdCho by adding LPC to the medium prevents ET-18-OCH3-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2 phase as well as the onset of apoptosis (FIG. 4, FIG. 6), thereby supporting the conclusion that the inhibition of de novo PtdCho synthesis is a determining factor in the cytotoxic action of ET-18-OCH3. However, the biochemical target for ET-18-OCH3 inhibition of cell growth in G1 remains to be resolved. The presence of LPC does not shift the dose-response curve for ET-18-OCH3 (Fig. 5), indicating that LPC does not act by preventing the accumulation of ET-18-OCH3 by the cells. CSF-1 triggers rapid and sustained degradation of PtdCho throughout the G1 phase (46Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PtdCho degradation is implicated as an important component of the signal transduction pathway based on the finding that degradation of PtdCho by exogenous PtdCho-specific phospholipase C mimics the mitogenic action of CSF-1 (23Xu X.X. Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase may also be an ET-18-OCH3 target in the G1 phase if the inhibition of PtdCho resynthesis interrupts the PtdCho turnover cycle and prevents signal transduction through PtdCho-specific phospholipase C. Other enzymes that interact with lysophospholipid substrates, like the 85-kDa phospholipase A2 (for review see Ref. 54Leslie C.C. Adi;. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), should also be considered as potential ET-18-OCH3 targets. Our results suggest that other members of the cytotoxic ether-linked phospholipid family also inhibit PtdCho synthesis and function by inhibiting the progression of cells through the gap phases and triggering apoptosis. Other biologically active ether lipids such as BM41.440 and hexadecylphosphocholine have a high degree of structural similarity to ET-18-OCH3 (for review see Ref. 13Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R. Cancer Chemotherapy. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd, Oxford1993: 146-178Google Scholar). Hexadecylphosphocholine blocks choline incorporation into PtdCho (55Geilen C.C. Wieder T.

J. 1993; 291: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is implicated as the target based on the partial inhibition of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity in crude cell extracts (58Haase R. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Reutter W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). BM41.440 arrests CA46 cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (59Hofmann J. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Schubert C. Ueberall F. Kohn K.W. Grunicke H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), thus mimicking our findings with ET-18-OCH3 (Fig. 2). It will be important to determine whether LPC also overrides the cytotoxic effects of these drugs. Our results also suggest that membrane phospholipid content may be monitored by the mammalian cell cycle apparatus. The arrest of BAC1.2F5 cells in the G2 phase when phospholipid accumulation is blocked during the S phase is reminiscent of the response of cells to S phase DNA damage. Cells irradiated in the S phase delay in G2 to allow DNA repair before the cells commit to mitosis (60O'Conner P.M. Kohn K.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, the G2 arrest of cells with insufficient phospholipid would provide a mechanism to ensure complete membrane formation prior to cell division. Hartwell and Weinert (61Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar) coined the term “checkpoint” to define the process in G2 that monitors completion of DNA replication and DNA damage before allowing progression into the M phase. Research on the biochemical mechanism for G2 arrest in response to DNA damage has focused on the regulation of the cyclin B/cdc2 kinase complex, because the formation and activation of this complex are necessary for entry into the M phase (61Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 62Lock R.B. Ross W.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3761-3766PubMed Google Scholar, 63Lock R.B. Ross W.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8298-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells delayed in G2 accumulate the hyper-phosphorylated, inactive form of the cdc2 kinase subunit. ET-18-OCH3 and other cytotoxic ether lipids may not arrest cells by exactly the same mechanism, because they do not directly damage DNA (11Berdel W.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R. Cancer Chemotherapy. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd, Oxford1993: 146-178Google Scholar). A unique biochemical mechanism for G2 arrest by antineoplastic lipids is suggested by the finding that, in cells arrested in the G2 phase with BM41.440, the cdc2 kinase is dephosphorylated; however, cyclin B protein levels are significantly reduced (59Hofmann J. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Schubert C. Ueberall F. Kohn K.W. Grunicke H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additional experiments are needed to determine if the regulation of cyclin B levels is a direct or indirect consequence of the inhibition of PtdCho synthesis.

Efficient transcription through these sites requires elongation factor SIL In addition to the sequence-specific features of the DNA, we show that the acquisition of SII-dependence is a function of its “dwell-time” at an arrest site. This temperature-dependent decay in elongation potential appears irreversible, implying that factor-dependent and factor-independent elongation complexes are not mutually interconvertible at this position. TFIIF and NH4C1 are known to increase the elongation rate of pol II. Both agents preempt arrest, consistent with the idea that elongation dwell time influences the process.

They are probably instrumental in facilitating the efficient transcription of large eukaryotic genes in vivo. RNA polymerases are processive enzymes. In general, they cannot extend pre-existing RNA chains, hence RNA release from the template is a terminal event in RNA synthesis (reviewed in Kane, 1994Kane C.M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 279-296Google Scholar). It is especially detrimental for RNA polymerase II (pol II) 1The abbreviation used is: pol IIRNA polymerase II to terminate prematurely since it transcribes the longest nuclear transcription units, some of which can exceed millions of base pairs. Furthermore, chain elongation is a regulated process that controls gene expression (Kane, 1994Kane C.M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 279-296Google Scholar) and embryonic development (Thummel, 1992Thummel C.S. Science. 1992; 255: 39-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In vivo, processing of the primary transcript for polyadenylation is coupled to termination by pol II (Logan et al., 1987Logan J. Falck-Pederson E. Darnell J.E. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; Connelly and Manley, 1988Connelly S. Manley J.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, pol II has evolved to be extremely processive once it becomes template engaged, and a specialized release signal is required for termination. RNA polymerase II At specific sites within genes, pol II becomes unable to continue chain elongation but does not release its nascent RNA. This loss of elongation competence is referred to as arrest, the molecular mechanism of which is poorly understood. Some arrest sequences are coincident with a bend in the DNA (Kerppola and Kane, 1990Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Template sequence and structure is an important component of the arrest signal since randomly halting transcription by nucleotide starvation does not typically result in arrest. Arrested complexes are not inactive; they resume transcription through the action of elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS). SII, a pol II-binding protein, associates with the elongation complex and activates nascent RNA cleavage (Reines, 1992Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Izban and Luse, 1992bIzban M.G. Luse D.S.

Transcript shortening precedes, and appears required for, SII-mediated readthrough (Reines et al., 1992Reines D. Ghanouni P. Li Q-q. Mote J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15516-15522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Izban and Luse, 1992bIzban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Multiple rounds of nascent RNA cleavage and re-extension are required to achieve full readthrough (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol.

The acquisition of factor dependence is a first-order decay of the elongation potential of pol II that is temperature dependent and irreversible in the absence of RNA cleavage. We have analyzed the effect of NH4Cl and elongation factor TFIIF, which are known to reduce the average time pol II spends between nucleotide incorporation events, on the arrest process. Although mechanistically distinct, SII and TFIIF probably cooperate in enabling pol II to transcribe lengthy eukaryotic genes. Proteins and Reagents—RNA polymerase II, SII, and initiation factors were isolated from rat liver or recombinant sources as described (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol.

Formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]CTP was obtained from Amersham Corp. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription was reconstituted as described (Reines, 1991Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of plasmid pAdTerm-2 (Reines et al., 1989Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar cut with EcoRI and PstI were incubated with rat liver RNA polymerase II (0.5 μg) and fraction D (TFIID and TFIIH, 2 μg) in 20 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2.2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% (v/v) glycerol for 30 min at 28 °C. The same buffer (lacking KCl) containing liver TFIIE/F (1 µg) and rTFIIB were added and incubation continued for 20 min. A 14-nucleotide transcript was synthesized by incubation at 28 °C for 20 min with MgCl2 (7 mM), ATP, UTP, and CTP (20 μΜ each). Where indicated, RNA was labeled at the 5′-end with ≍0.6 μΜ[α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol). Chain elongation followed the addition of heparin to 10 μg/ml and ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP to 800 μΜ each. After 15 min, complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-RNA IgG and fixed S. aureus (Eilat et al., 1982Eilat D. Hochberg M. Fischel R. Laskov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3818-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Reines, 1991Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 3′-end labeling of the RNA and walking experiments complexes were washed three times by microcentrifugation and resuspension in reaction buffer (60 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 3% (v/v) glycerol). Rat liver SII (phosphocellulose) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 28 °C for 1.5 min in the presence of 7 mM MgCl2 for nascent RNA cleavage. After two washings, RNA was labeled with 20 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 400 μΜ GTP (unless otherwise indicated) and 7 mm MgCl2 at 28 °C for 10 min. These complexes were washed again and manipulated as described in the text. RNA was prepared for electrophoresis and separated on 5% Polyacrylamide gels as described (Reines, 1992Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitation, gels were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To examine the arrest process under conditions that allow us to control elongation, we employed RNA polymerase “walking” experiments. Elongation is restricted by providing a limited subset of the four nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), removing them, and repeating the process with the next appropriate NTP(s) to assemble elongation complexes bearing sequentially larger RNA chains. Similar approaches have been exploited effectively in the study of bacterial and viral RNA polymerase elongation and termination (Carpousis and Gralla, 1985Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. J. Mol.

A portion of the human histone H3.3 gene arrest site studied here is shown in Fig. 1. Transcription was initiated from the adenovirus major late promoter with partially purified rat liver initiation factors, enabling us to study SII-dependent transcription (Reines et al., 1989Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Upon encounter with a well-characterized site called Ia, pol II becomes arrested with ≍50% efficiency at positions +205, 206, and 207 relative to the transcription start site (+1) (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. In the presence of SII, pol II quantitatively resumes elongation from this site after the arrested RNA is shortened at its 3′-end and re-extended (Reines et al., 1989Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Arrested complexes were precipitated with a monoclonal antibody against RNA and washed free of NTPs (Reines, 1992Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the addition of MgCl2 and SII, the nascent transcripts (205–207 nt) were cleaved to a specific 198-nucleotide transcript terminating in an A residue (Fig. 1, lane 2 versus lane 3; Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. We refer to this as an A198 complex using the conventional notation citing the identity of the last base and its position in the RNA chain. Unlabeled A198-RNA was extended and uniquely labeled at position 199 with [α-32P]CTP (C199; Fig. 1, lane 4). This RNA could be extended by a single base when GTP was added (G200; lane 5). Addition of varying concentrations of UTP to G200 complexes after removal of CTP and GTP by another round of washing resulted in extension of the chain by an additional 1–7 bases through a tract of seven template A residues (U201-U207 lanes 6–11). Complexes A198 through U204 were stable and each remained elongation competent, i.e. they did not require SII for the resumption of elongation when UTP was restored (Fig. 2, lane 1 versus lane 8, lane 2 versus lane 3, lane 4 versus lane 5, and lane 6 versus lane 7). Since CTP (required at position 208) was not added during this chase period, RNAs were extended no further than position 207 (Ia; Fig. 2, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 8). If CTP was supplied at the same time as UTP, half of these complexes readthrough site Ia in a factor-independent manner and stop at position 216 due to the lack of GTP (Fig. 3A, lane 6). This confirmed prior work demonstrating that the readthrough efficiency in the absence of SII is ≍50% for both the first and second encounter of pol II with site Ia (Fig. LA, lane 1 and Fig. 3B, lane 1; Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The complexes arrested at site Ia can be quantitatively chased to runoff length by the addition of SII (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Hence, two types of complexes bearing a 207-base transcript can be identified after transcript cleavage and walk-back; one group that can extend the 207-base RNA when CTP is present (U216; Fig. 3A, lane 6), and another that requires CTP and the assistance of SII (Ia; Fig. 3A, lane 6). We will show below that this former class can be converted rapidly into the latter class. The reciprocal conversion has not been observed.Fig. 3Effect of the next nucleotide upon transcription arrest. A, A198 complexes were labeled and extended with [α-32P]CTP alone (lane 1), with GTP (lanes 2–6), or with GTP and UTP (lane 7). Complexes extended with [α-32P]CTP and GTP were either stopped (lane 2) or washed to remove NTPs (lanes 3–6). Aliquots were incubated with 800 μΜ UTP (lane 4) or 400 μΜ each of UTP and CTP (lane 6) for 10 min and stopped. One aliquot (lane 5) was incubated with 800 μΜ UTP for 10 min then washed and incubated with 400 μΜ UTP and 400 μΜ CTP for 10 min. Some G200 complexes (lane 3) were washed a second time and provided with 400 μΜ each of UTP and CTP for 10 min. Elongation took place in the presence of 0.25% Sarkosyl and 7 mm MgCl2. Readthrough is monitored by accumulation of RNA at position U216. B, labeled G200 complexes (arrowhead; lane 2) were washed and provided with 7 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Sarkosyl, 800 μΜ UTP, and the indicated concentration of CTP for 15 min. One sample receiving 8 μΜ CTP (as in lane 4) was chased with 800 μΜ CTP for an additional 10 min (lane 8). Washed G200 complexes incubated with SII and MgCl2 lose their label (lane 9). Lane 1, 5′-end labeled Ia and runoff RNA markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transcript cleavage restores factor-independence to ≍50% of the elongation complexes (Reines et al., 1992Reines D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. This alteration is stable for complexes at position 200 since they could be washed repeatedly by immunoprecipitation and resuspension and upon providing them with CTP and UTP, their RNAs were elongated through site Ia to the same extent as unwashed (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar or doubly washed complexes (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). These RNAs remained associated with pol II since they could undergo cleavage resulting in a loss of 32P-label (Fig. 3B, lane 9) and extend their RNA chains in an SII-dependent manner. 2W. Gu, unpublished results. If G200 complexes were incubated with UTP but not CTP, all RNA chains could be extended back to the arrest site (Fig. 3A, lane 4) but none could respond to CTP added at a later time (Fig. 3A, lane 5), i.e. they had all become arrested. This suggested that poor availability of the next nucleotide could convert complexes that were elongation competent into an SII-dependent form as reported for a viral arrest site (Wiest and Hawley, 1990Wiest D.K. Hawley D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5782-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Wiest et al., 1992Wiest D.K. Wang D. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7733-7744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. This was only the case for complexes walked downstream to the arrest site since upstream complexes (A198 to U204) did not display the arrest phenotype when their next nucleotide was absent (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). These results indicated that we were observing pol II molecules in the process of becoming arrested and that we should be able to track the time course of this event. A simple way to alter the complex’s dwell time at the arrest site was to limit the concentration of the next nucleotide. Indeed, there was a clear relationship between the CTP concentration and transcription through site Ia (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–7). Readthrough was half-maximal at ≍160 μΜ CTP and reached a plateau at 800 μΜ CTP (lower curve, Fig. 4). Complexes that were unable to pass site Ia at low CTP (Fig. 3B, lane 4) were refractory to a high CTP chase (Fig. 3B, lane 8) showing that they had become arrested. This suggested that the length of time pol II spent between incorporation events or its “dwell” time (von Hippel and Yager, 1991von Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was a critical factor in attaining the arrested phenotype. The time course of acquisition of the arrested phenotype was measured by providing UTP to the G200 complex for varying lengths of time and testing for elongation competence with a challenge of 800 μΜ CTP. Pol II progressively lost its ability to escape from site Ia as the time interval between UTP addition and CTP addition increased (Fig. 5A, diamond symbols). This decay was rapid and essentially complete by 5 s at 28 °C. We repeated this experiment at 15 °C to facilitate a more accurate measurement of the decay and to assess its temperature dependence. A similar profile was observed showing a longer half-life (120 s; Fig. 5, A and B) at 15 °C. The data can be plotted as a first-order process with an apparent rate constant of 0.008 s−1 (Fig. 5A, inset). This measurement includes the time pol II takes to reach Ia from G200 as well as that required to assume the arrested phenotype or achieve readthrough to position 216. An independent measurement revealed that half of the G200 complexes extended their chains to position 207 in 75 s.2 Hence, the decay in elongation potential displayed a half-life of approximately 50 s at 15 °C which was at least 10-fold slower than that observed at 28 °C. Note that maximal readthrough efficiency varied as a function of temperature (Fig. 5A, t = 0: 44% at 15 °C versus 57% at 28 °C). This demonstrated that the relative partitioning of Ia complexes between the alternatives of chain extension and arrest was temperature-dependent.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar are known to increase the average elongation rate and thus reduce the dwell time of pol II. To strengthen the argument that dwell time at site Ia is a determinant of arrest, we measured the effect of TFIIF and NH4C1 on readthrough at different CTP concentrations. Consistent with this idea, both agents increased the efficiency of readthrough at low CTP levels in the absence of added SII (Fig. 4, upper versus lower curve and Fig. 6, lane 5 versus 6). The maximal extent of readthrough at saturating CTP (800 μΜ) was also higher in the presence of either NH4C1 (Fig. 4, upper versus lower curves) or TFIIF (Fig. 6, lane 3 versus lane 4). Neither NH4Cl2 nor TFIIF (Fig. 6, lane 1 versus lane 2) rescued pol II after it had become arrested, in accordance with the work of others (Bengal et al., 1991Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A.

We take this as additional evidence that the longer pol II dwells at an arrest site the more likely it is to assume the arrested configuration. RNA polymerases located at a single template position can assume more than one state due to the partitioning of complexes between different functional pathways (Yager and von Hippel, 1991Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H.

The pathway choice can be influenced by transcription elongation or termination factors and is an important point of regulatory control in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Roberts, 1992Roberts J.

The options for an elongation complex include: 1) insert the next nucleotide, 2) terminate transcription via RNA release, or 3) cease elongation without RNA release. The length of time at which RNA polymerases dwell at a specific template position contributes to the efficiency of termination by E. coli RNA polymerase (reviewed in von Hippel and Yager, 1991von Hippel P.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7733-7744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Dwell time can be modulated by template sequence, auxiliary transcription factors, availability of nucleotide substrates, the structure of nascent RNA, translation (in prokaryotes), and perhaps co-transcriptional processing of the primary transcript in eukaryotes. The influence of substrate availability on elongation by pol II was elucidated by experiments where the dependence of arrest was altered from GTP to CTP or UTP when the template base downstream from an arrest site was mutated from C to G or A, respectively (Wiest et al., 1992Wiest D.K. Wang D. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7733-7744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Here, we have observed and measured the rate at which RNA polymerase II assumes the arrested conformation. Arrest efficiency is determined in part by a kinetic competition between the rate at which pol II incorporates the next nucleotide and the rate at which its elongation potential decays. Partitioning is temperature dependent with more arrest at lower temperature. This is congruent with observations that the extent of DNA bending is accentuated at lower temperature (Marini et al., 1984Marini J. Effron P. Goodman T. Singleton C. Wells R. Wartell R. Englund P.

Cell. 1986; 46: 717-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and supports the idea that a bend in this template is causally involved in arrest (Kerppola and Kane, 1990Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Reines, 1992Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation complexes at most template positions cannot be forced into an SII-dependent form since pol II held at a variety of template positions by nucleotide starvation or lac repressor remains elongation competent even after dwell times of >1 h (Reines and Mote, 1993Reines D. Mote Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The arrest pathway is apparently a site-specific option for pol II, i.e. there is a thermodynamic “well” found at intrinsic arrest sites. If so, the absence of arrest at most template locations is not necessarily due to kinetic escape via rapid insertion of the next base which outcompetes a pathway to arrest. Instead, there may not be an accessible arrest conformation for pol II under these conditions. Similar conclusions have been drawn for termination by E. coli RNA polymerase (von Hippel and Yager, 1992von Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Science. 1992; 255: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Termination by E. coli RNA polymerase and RNA polymerase I has been described as a two-step process, a slowed rate of next-nucleotide insertion and a template location where elongation capacity can be lost (Yager and von Hippel, 1987Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H.

Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar. The efficiency of pol II arrest seems to involve similar steps. The features that determine these requirements are not known but may be related to the number of template A residues that encode the U-rich 3′ termini characteristic of many arrested RNAs (Izban and Luse, 1993bIzban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a bend in or near the arrest site (Kerppola and Kane, 1990Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A U-rich RNA terminus and/or the unusual structure of the DNA helix at this site or in the transcription bubble could serve to both reduce polymerization step time and potentiate the rapid decay in elongation potential identified here. Additional signals or factors may be needed for pol II to terminate transcription perhaps in conjunction with processing events such as polyadenylation (Logan et al., 1987Logan J. Falck-Pederson E. Darnell J.E. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8306-8310Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar; Connelly and Manley, 1988Connelly S. Manley J.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the absence of NTPs, factor-dependent and factor-independent complexes carry out SII-activated nascent RNA cleavage. Dinucleotides or 7–14 base oligonucleotides are liberated from SII-independent and SII-dependent complexes, respectively (Izban and Luse, 1993aIzban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12864-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Izban and Luse, 1993bIzban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Luse and co-workers have suggested that this difference in cleavage increment is indicative of a structural distinction between the two states. The difference between SII-dependent and independent elongation complexes may be the loss of proximity of the polymerization catalytic site relative to the 3′-end of the RNA (Izban and Luse, 1993bIzban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Borukhov et al., 1993Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A.

The decay of elongation competence measured here may reflect in part the rate of this presumptive conformational change. A covalent modification of one or more components of the elongation complex cannot be ruled out, although any such modification is not expected to involve the carboxyl-terminal domain of pol II which does not affect arrest or SII-activated readthrough in vitro (Christie et al., 1994Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Exonuclease III footprinting reveals a subtle, 1 base pair downstream movement of the arrested complex after nascent RNA cleavage (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. There is a large difference between SII-dependent and independent complexes with respect to the position of the RNA 3′-end relative to the downstream boundary (Gu et al., 1993Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Arrested complexes have 3′-ends which lie closer to the leading edge than do factor-independent complexes. Similar structural differences have been observed between elongation-competent and arrested E. coli RNA polymerases (Krummel and Chamberlin, 1992bKrummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Borukhov et al., 1993Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A.

Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar. The defining features of arrest sites in general have not been thoroughly elucidated. The locations and frequencies of occurrence of such sites in bacterial or eukaryotic genomes are not known. It has been suggested that SII and TFIIF act by different means to influence elongation by pol II. TFIIF only affects readthrough if present before RNA polymerase encounters an arrest site, whereas SII is effective even after the encounter (Bengal et al., 1991Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Izban and Luse, 1992aIzban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SII works via arrested RNA cleavage which resolves the fate of those enzymes that do succumb to arrest and can only take place after arrest (Reines, 1994Reines D. Conaway R. Conaway J. Transcription. Raven Press, New York1994: 263-278Google Scholar). Both TFIIF and NH4C1 enhance the ability of pol II to use a limiting level of NTPs (Fig. 4, Fig. 6) as has recently been described for a new elongation factor, SIII (Bradsher et al., 1993bBradsher J.N. Tan S. McLaury H.-J. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25594-25603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The kinetic step accelerated by these agents is unknown. The ability of TFIIF (and NH4+ ions) to support high elongation rates and to reduce dwell time, is a possible explanation for how it reduces the probability that pol II will acquire factor dependence at an arrest site and why it is required before pol II arrives at an arrest site. We cannot exclude the possibility that these agents alter the configuration of the elongation complex such that it is less prone to arrest in a manner that is independent of dwell time. Two RNA polymerase-binding proteins, greA and greB, have been described that enable E. coli RNA polymerase to readthrough arrest sites (Borukhov et al., 1993Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar; Nudler et al., 1994Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M.

Like TFIIF, greA must be present prior to arrest to enable readthrough while greB, like SII, can reactivate arrested complexes via RNA cleavage (Borukhov et al., 1993Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar. Unlike greA, however, TFIIF has not yet been reported to activate nascent RNA cleavage. These and perhaps other factors (Bengal et al., 1991Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2089908364,"PTP2C, an SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is recruited to the growth factor receptors upon stimulation of cells. To investigate its role in growth factor signaling, we have overexpressed by approximately 6-fold the native PTP2C and a catalytically inactive mutant of the enzyme in 293 human embryonic kidney cells. The native PTP2C was located entirely in the cytosol, while the inactive mutant was nearly equally distributed in cytosolic and membrane fractions. Expression of the latter caused hyperphosphorylation on tyrosine of a 43-kDa protein, which was co-immunoprecipitated and co-partitioned in the plasma membrane fraction with the inactive PTP2C mutant. This protein may represent a physiological substrate of PTP2C. Overexpression of the native PTP2C enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase activity by 30%, whereas expression of the inactive mutant reduced the stimulated activity by 50%. Similar effects were observed for the activation of MAP kinase as determined by activity assay, gel mobility shift, and tyrosine phosphorylation. The data suggest that the phosphatase activity of PTP2C is partly required for MAP kinase activation by EGF and that PTP2C may function by dephosphorylating the 43-kDa membrane protein.

INTRODUCTIONExternal signals, such as growth factors, initiate their signals by binding to ligand-specific growth factor receptors on the cellular membrane (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Receptor autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosyl residues, as a result of ligand binding, provides high-affinity binding sites for specific cellular proteins containing SH21 1The abbreviations used are: SH2src homology 2PTPprotein- tyrosine phosphataseMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorMBPmyelin basic proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. domains. These SH2 domain-phosphopeptide interactions recruit other signaling molecules to the receptors where they can be phosphorylated by the receptors and/or recruit still other proteins (2Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Among the SH2 domain-containing proteins recruited to the growth factor receptors is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) designated as PTP2C (also termed as SH-PTP2, SH-PTP3, PTP1D, and Syp) (3Ahmad S.

Hui C.-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). PTP2C is a widely expressed enzyme. It shares high homology with corkscrew, which is required for normal development of Drosophila by playing a positive role in the transduction of the torso signal acting in concert with D-Raf (8Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The parallel nature of the torso signal transduction pathway to MAP kinase activation in mammalian cells suggests that PTP2C may play a similar role in mammalian systems. Recent studies indeed suggest that PTP2C is involved in growth factor signaling and in MAP kinase activation. First, PTP2C binds to EGF and PDGF receptors (6Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, phosphorylation of PTP2C at its C terminus couples GRB2 to PDGF receptor, providing a mechanism for PDGF-induced activation of Ras (12Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Third, overexpression of catalytically inactive forms of PTP2C blocks insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation (14Milarski K.L.

A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Fourth, as a feedback reaction, PTP2C is phosphorylated and inhibited by MAP kinase (17Peraldi P. Zhao Z. Filloux C. Fischer E.H. Van Obberghen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5002-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).MAP kinase activation via the Ras signaling pathway in mammalian cells has been well defined (18Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 19Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). GRB2, an SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein, works as an adaptor by binding directly or indirectly via another protein such as SHC to upstream autophosphorylated growth factor receptors or their substrates and to downstream nucleotide exchange factor mSOS, thus activating Ras. GTP-bound Ras facilitates the recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, resulting in its activation followed by activation of MAP kinase kinase. MAP kinase kinase, in turn, activates MAP kinase which requires phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine residues.To investigate the role of PTP2C in growth factor signaling, we have expressed the native PTP2C and a catalytic inactive form of the enzyme in 293 human embryonic kidney cells. Our study demonstrated that expression of the mutant of PTP2C had a profound impact on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the cells. Furthermore, while overexpression of the native enzyme increased EGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation, expression of the catalytically inactive mutant decreased such activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Polyclonal anti-PTP2C (serum 1263) and anti-MAP kinase (serum 7884) were raised in rabbits against an SH2 domain-truncated form of PTP2C expressed in Escherichia coli (20Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and against a 22-amino acid peptide derived from the subdomain XI of MAP kinase (21Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine and polyclonal sheep-anti-EGF receptor antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Myelin basic protein (MBP) and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Sigma and Amersham, respectively.Buffer A: 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3) and 2 mM EDTA. Buffer B: 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. Both buffers were also supplemented with 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 μM microcystin, 1.0 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin.Construction and Expression of PTP2C in 293 CellsA catalytically inactive form of PTP2C, designated as PTP2C(C-S), was generated by substituting the highly conserved cysteine 459 with a serine in a polymerase chain reaction. The site of mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNA inserts corresponding to the native and the Cys-to-Ser mutant were constructed into the pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen). Transfection was carried out according to the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. To obtain stable cell lines, cells were selected in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml geniticin (G418 sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc.), and single colonies expressing high level PTP2C or PTP2C(C-S) were obtained after 2-3 weeks. Wild type 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. The transfected cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418.Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and PTP AssayConfluent 293 cells were lysed in Buffer A supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 M NaCl. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at full speed in a microcentrifuge. For immunoprecipitation with anti-PTP2C antibody, the extracts were preincubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 2 h at 4°C. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose overnight. The beads were washed three times with the cold lysis buffer. For Western blot analyses, samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and detected using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's protocol.For PTP activity assay, sodium vanadate was omitted from all the buffers used. Assays were performed with anti-PTP2C immunoprecipitates using 1 μM32P-labeled ENDpYINASL peptide (800 cpm/pmol) as the substrate at pH 5.0 as described (20Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Daum G. Solca F. Diltz C.D. Zhao Z. Cool D.E. Fischer E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Fractionation of Cell ExtractsCells were collected, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in Buffer B. Lysis was performed by nitrogen cavitation for 20 min at 350 p.s.i. Nuclear pellets were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 20 min. The postnuclear extract was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to give a clear cytosolic supernatant and a pelleted membrane fraction. The latter pellet, washed once with Buffer B and then dissolved in Buffer B supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, was referred to as the membrane extract. Further fractionation of the membrane fraction was performed by employing a 17.5% Percoll density gradient. The postnuclear extract (1 ml) was loaded on the top of a 9-ml Percoll suspension made in buffer B. Sedimentation was performed for 1 h at 18,000 rpm with a Beckman 50 Ti rotor. A total of 20 fractions were collected from bottom to top.Stimulation of Cells and Assays for MAP Kinase and MAP Kinase KinaseCells (80-90% confluency) were starved at 0% serum for 24 h and then stimulated with EGF for various periods of time. The reactions were stopped by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then collected and lysed in Buffer A by brief sonication. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 25 min. For protein kinase activity assay, samples were passed through a DEAE 52 minicolumn equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with 0.3 M NaCl. The flow-through was collected for MAP kinase kinase assay and the elute for MAP kinase assay. The activity of MAP kinase kinase was determined by the ability of the enzyme to stimulate the MBP kinase activity of recombinant ERK2 in a coupled assay system as described (21Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAP kinase was assayed with MBP as substrate in the presence of PKI peptide and calmidizolium (21Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blanks were run without ERK2 and MBP for MAP kinase and the kinase kinase assays, respectively.To immunoprecipitate ERK1 and ERK2 with anti-MAP kinase antibody, cell extracts were brought to 0.5% SDS and then boiled for 10 min. After cooling down, samples were diluted 5-fold with the extraction buffer and incubated with anti-MAP kinase serum 7884 overnight. The cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS gel. Western blotting was carried out as described above.RESULTSOverexpression of PTP2C and PTP2C(C-S) in 293 CellsConstructs containing PTP2C or the mutant PTP2C(C-S) and the pRC/CMV vector alone were used to transfect 293 cells. Clonal cell lines were isolated by G418 selection. Most of the clones selected an overexpressed substantial level of exogenous PTP2C or PTP2C(C-S) as compared with the vector control and the parental cells. Typically, about 6-8-fold overexpression was obtained as determined by Western blot with anti-PTP2C serum (Fig. 1) followed by densitometric analyses. The activity of PTP2C in the transfected cells was measured following immunoprecipitation of the cell extract with anti-PTP2C serum. To precipitate approximately equal portions of enzyme, extracts from cells overexpressing PTP2C or PTP2C(C-S) were diluted 6-fold with the extraction buffer while that from the vector control cells was undiluted. Upon incubation of an equal volume of cell extracts with anti-PTP2C serum and protein A-Sepharose, each immunoprecipitate gave about an equal amount of anti-PTP2C cross-reactivity in Western blotting analyses (data not shown). PTP activity in the immunoprecipitates was then assayed by employing the 32P-labeled peptide substrate ENDpYINASL in a liquid-solid phase reaction mixture (Table I). As expected, nearly equal amounts of activity were detected in the immunoprecipitates from the control cells and cells over-expressing PTP2C, corresponding to an approximately 6.5-fold total increase of PTP2C activity in the transfected cells. This suggests that the exogenously expressed PTP2C possessed the same activity as the endogenous enzyme. In contrast, the activity per mg of cell extract from the cells overexpressing PTP2C(C-S) was similar to that obtained from the control cells, indicating that the Cys-to-Ser mutant of PTP2C is totally inactive. Control experiments with preimmune serum showed essentially no PTP activity (data not shown).Table IActivity of PTP2C in 293 cell extracts Open table in a new tab Effects of the Altered PTP2C Expression on the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Proteins in 293 CellsProtein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting analyses employing anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as shown in Fig. 1. Overexpression of the native PTP2C showed essentially no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation at the basal level. No significant effect was observed in serum-stimulated cells either (data not shown). However, overexpression of PTP2C(C-S) resulted in changes of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the cells. In particular, a protein of approximately 43 kDa (designated as p43) was hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine. This protein ran as a rather broad band on SDS gel, probably due to differing degrees of phosphorylation on multiple sites. Note that tyrosine phosphorylation of another protein of approximately 100 kDa slightly increased also. Stimulation of the cells with serum did not cause significant change in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (data not shown).Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins caused by expression of the catalytically inactive mutant of PTP2C has also been observed by others. In one study, hyperphosphorylation of a 120-kDa protein which associated with PTP2C was observed in insulin-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells (14Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa focal adhesion kinase was demonstrated in CHO cells, but the phosphorylation of this protein decreased upon insulin treatment of the cells (16Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the 43-kDa and 100-kDa proteins we observed are related to the 120-kDa protein and focal adhesion kinase.Co-fractionation and Co-immunoprecipitation of PTP2C(C-S) with p43Cytosolic and membrane fractions of postnuclear extracts were separated by high speed centrifugation. While almost all the PTP2C in the control cells and cells overexpressing the native PTP2C distributed in the cytosolic fraction, nearly 50% of the enzyme was associated with the membrane fraction in cells expressing PTP2C(C-S) (Fig. 2). PTP assays following immunoprecipitation of the membrane fraction with anti-PTP2C serum yielded essentially no activity, indicating that the anti-PTP2C cross-reactivity detected in the membrane fraction represents the mutant enzyme only. For all cases, almost no PTP2C was found in the nuclear fraction (data not shown). The hyperphosphorylated p43 was also found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2). In addition, it was co-immunoprecipitated with PTP2C(C-S), which might indicate a direct association of these two proteins. Separation of the postnuclear extract from cells overexpressing PTP2C(C-S) on a Percoll density gradient was shown in Fig. 3. Nearly half of the anti-PTP2C cross-reactivity was detected on the top of the gradient (fractions 16-20), which presumably represent the cytosolic fraction. Most of the rest was found in the middle of the gradient (fractions 6-12) where p43 was also detected. The distribution pattern of p43 and associated PTP2C(C-S) followed that of the EGF receptor, a plasma membrane marker, but differed from that exhibited by the endoplasmic reticulum maker ribophorin II (23Crimaudo C.M. Hortsch H. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The data indicate that PTP2C(C-S) and the hyperphosphorylated p43 were partitioned in the plasma membrane fraction. Based on the results, one can postulate that PTP2C(C-S) caused the hyperphosphorylation of p43 by preventing its dephosphorylation by the endogenous native enzyme and that tyrosine-phosphorylated p43, in turn, serves as an anchor for PTP2C(C-S) on the plasma membrane.Figure 2:Distribution of PTP2C, PTP2C(C-S), and the hyperphosphorylated p43 in cell fractions. Lanes V, N, and M represent 293 cells transfected with the vector alone, native PTP2C, and mutant PTP2C(C-S), respectively. Cytosolic (lane 1) and membrane (lane 2) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g.

Fig. 4 illustrates the time courses of MAP kinase and MAP kinase kinase activation. The activity profile of both kinases followed a typical biphasic pattern with peak activity occurring at 5 min. Altered PTP2C expression did not affect the time course of activation significantly. However, there was a small but significant impact on its magnitude. Overexpression of the native PTP2C increased the peak of EGF-stimulated MAP kinase kinase activity by about 30% while the expression of the catalytically inactive mutant decreased it by approximately 50% (Fig. 4A). Similar effects were observed for the activity of MAP kinase (Fig. 4B). These results were reproduced in other clonal cell lines selected.Figure 4:Activation of MAP kinase kinase (A) and MAP kinase (B) in 293 cells transfected with vector alone (■–■), PTP2C (▲- - -▲), and PTP2C(C-S) (●- - -●). Serum-starved cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for the indicated time. MAP kinase activity was determined by incubating 5-μg samples with MBP and [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) for 10 min. MAP kinase kinase was analyzed by incubating 2-μg samples with ERK2 and cold ATP for 10 min followed by the addition of MBP and 32P-labeled ATP and further incubating for 10 min. See “Experimental Procedures” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of the altered PTP2C expression were also apparent in MAP kinase gel shift assays and Western blot analyzed with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 5). Mobility shifts of MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) on SDS-gel reflect the phosphorylations on the enzyme, which are required for its activation. As shown in Fig. 5A, 5- and 10-min stimulation of cells with EGF resulted in a significant portion of both ERK1 and ERK2 shifted in cells with the vector control and the native PTP2C, while much less was observed in the cells expressing the mutant PTP2C. Although the gel shifts were not perfectly correlated with the activity as has been reported (21Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data indicate that the decreased MAP kinase activity in cells with PTP2C(C-S) was due to reduced phosphorylation. Further supporting this were the results from Western blot analyses of the immunoprecipitated MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. EGF stimulated transient tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Compared with the cells containing the vector alone, a higher level of phosphotyrosine was observed for the cells overexpressing the native PTP2C, while a lower level was obtained with cells expressing the mutant PTP2C. At basal level, neither significant gel shift nor tyrosine phosphorylation was detected, suggesting that the basal MBP kinase activity at zero time (see Fig. 4B) was probably due to protein kinases other than MAP kinase. Additional experiments indicated that the altered PTP2C expression had essentially no effect on the dose response of 293 cells to EGF and autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor upon stimulation (data not shown).Figure 5:Gel mobility shift (A) and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase (B). Serum-starved 293 cells transfected with the vector control, native PTP2C, and mutant PTP2C(C-S) were stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for the indicated time. Cell extracts (A) or anti-MAP kinase immunoprecipitates (B) were separated on 10% SDS gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with polyclonal anti-MAP kinase antibody (A) or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (B).

The remaining activation observed in the latter case could be attributed to endogenous PTP2C in the cells and/or a parallel activation pathway independent of PTP2C. In any case, the data suggest that the phosphatase activity of PTP2C is at least partly required for MAP kinase activation. These results are consistent with the recent reports on the positive role of corkscrew in Drosophila torso signaling (8Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and the blockage of insulin-induced MAP kinase activation by catalytically inactive forms of Syp and SH-PTP2 in 3T3 and CHO cells (14Milarski K.L.

A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which PTP2C regulates the MAP kinase activation pathway is unknown. Binding of PTP2C to growth factor receptors, including the EGF receptor, has been well documented (6Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 7Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether PTP2C can specifically dephosphorylate the autophosphorylated receptors. If it does, overexpression of PTP2C might reduce phosphorylation of the receptor and thus down-regulate MAP kinase activation. Conversely, expression of the inactive mutant of PTP2C should stabilize such phosphorylation and thus potentiate the signaling pathway. Opposite effects were observed in this study, with the native enzyme increasing the signal and the mutant decreasing the signaling. Therefore, it is unlikely that the PTP2C acts at the receptor level but instead probably functions downstream of the receptor. Recent studies demonstrated that PTP2C can couple GRB2 to the PDGF receptor by binding to the PDGF receptor via its SH2 domains and to GRB2 via its tyrosine-phosphorylated C-terminal segment. The GRB2-SOS complex would activate Ras and finally turn on the MAP kinase pathway (12Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, according to this model, one should expect that the Cys-to-Ser mutation of PTP2C, which diminishes auto-dephosphorylation of the enzyme and thus increases its phosphorylation (24Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), should enhance MAP kinase activation. Therefore, the present results suggest a more complicated role for PTP2C than serving as an adaptor for GRB2 binding. PTP2C might play a more important role in the aforementioned signaling pathway by dep"

Insulin induces the formation of a complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and heteromeric PI 3-kinase via the SH2 domain of p85 and thereby activates the enzyme (Backer et al., 1992Backer J.M.

Effect of Insulin on Glycogen Synthase Activity in CHO-IRC/S 46 and CHO-IR/Δp85 Cells—To elucidate the role of the Ras-MAP kinase cascade in insulin activation of glycogen synthase, we investigated the effect of insulin on glycogen synthase activity in CHO-IR-C/S 46 cells. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of insulin for 30 min, and glycogen synthase activity was measured. Although the formation of the Ras-GTP complex and activation of MAP kinase in response to insulin are markedly decreased in CHO-IR-C/S 46 cells (Noguchi et al., 1994Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K.

Wortmannin also inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity in CHO-IR cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). At a concerntration of 50 nM, wortmannin abolished the activation of glycogen synthase in response to insulin at all doses tested in CHO-IR cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, 50 nM wortmannin abolished 10−7 M insulin-stimulated activation of glycogen synthase not only in CHO-IR cells but also in CHO-IR/Δp85 and CHO-IR-C/S 46 cells (Fig. 2D). Effect of Wortmannin or Transient Overexpression of Δp85 on Insulin Activation of Glycogen Synthase in Rat1-IR Cells—The Δp85 protein was transiently overexpressed in intact cells with the use of the vaccinia virus expression system. We found that Rat1 cells and Hela cells, but not CHO cells, were good target cells for vaccinia virus. Rat1 cells overexpressing human insulin receptors (Ratl-IR cells) were infected with wild-type vaccinia virus (LCmO) or a recombinant vaccinia virus (LC Δp85) that encodes Δp85 (Rat1-IR/mO cells and Ratl-IR/Δp85 cells, respectively). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of Δp85 in Ratl-IR/Δp85 cells 7 h after infection was ~10–15 times the amount of endogenous p85α in Ratl-IR cells (Hara et al., 1995Hara K. Yonezawa K.

As with CHO-IR cells, treatment of Ratl-IR cells or Rat1-IR/mO cells with 50 nM wortmannin for 10 min before insulin stimulation resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of PI 3-kinase activity associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 3A). Wortmannin also induced a further decrease in PI 3-kinase activity associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in insulin-stimulated Rat1-IR/Δp85 cells (Fig. 3A). No differences in the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS-1 were detected among Ratl-IR, Rat1-IR/mO, and Ratl-LR/Δp85 cells by immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (data not shown). The basal activity of glycogen synthase in both Rat1-IR/Δp85 cells and Rat1-IR/mO cells did not differ from that in noninfected Ratl-IR cells. Insulin stimulated glycogen synthase activity approximately 2-fold in all three cell lines (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with those from CHO-IR/Δp85 cells and indicate that the transient overexpression of Δp85 did not inhibit insulin activation of glycogen synthase. Wortmannin (50 nM) markedly inhibited insulin activation of glycogen synthase in Ratl-IR, Rat1-IR/mO, and Rat1-IR/Δp85 cells (Fig. 3B). Effect of Rapamycin on the Activation of Glycogen Synthase by Insulin in CHO-IR Cells—To examine the possible participation of the p70 S6 kinase pathway in insulin activation of glycogen synthase, we exposed CHO-IR cells to various concentrations of rapamycin for 30 min before stimulation with insulin and assay of glycogen synthase activity. At all concentrations tested, rapamycin did not inhibit the activation of glycogen synthase induced by 10−7 M insulin (Fig. 4A). Rapamycin (20 ng/ml) completely abolished the activation of p70 S6 kinase induced by 10−7 m insulin (Fig. 4B) We have investigated the mechanism of insulin activation of glycogen synthase. Because Ras is a key element in signal transduction for many growth factors, we first examined the possible participation of this protein in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activation. Whereas insulin-induced Ras activation and the consequent stimulation of MAP kinase are almost completely abolished in CHO cells overexpressing insulin receptors and a catalytically inactive SH-PTP2 (CHO-IR-C/S 46 cells) (Noguchi et al., 1994Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, we showed that insulin fully activated glycogen synthase in these cells. It is possible that insulin activation of glycogen synthase is normally Ras-dependent, but was somehow rescued by overexpression of the catalytically inactive SH-PTP2 in these cells. However, this possibility is unlikely, given that insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activation is also normal in CHO-IR/ΔSOS cells, in which insulin-induced Ras activation is markedly impaired by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant Sos (Sakaue et al., 1995Sakaue M. Bowtell D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. These results indicate that the activation of Ras is not required for activation of glycogen synthase. This conclusion appears inconsistent with the observation that an insulin-stimulated protein kinase, originally designated ISPK but later found to be p90rsk (Sutherland et al., 1993Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, phosphorylates and activates PP1G, the glycogen-bound form of type 1 protein phosphatase (Dent et al., 1990Dent P.

Although we cannot exclude the possibility that glycogen synthase is regulated differently in muscle cells and other types of cells (CHO-IR cells), the activation of MAP kinase by epidermal growth factor does not result in stimulation of glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Robinson et al., 1993Robinson L.J.

Taken together, these observations indicate that MAP kinase activation may not be required or sufficient for the activation of glycogen synthase. We next investigated the potential role of PI 3-kinase, another key element in signal transduction for many growth factors, in the activation of glycogen synthase in response to insulin. We previously established a CHO cell line (CHO-IR/Δp85) that overexpresses insulin receptors and a dominant negative mutant of the PI 3-kinase p85 adaptor subunit that does not bind the p110 catalytic subunit (Hara et al., 1994Hara K.

PI 3-kinase activity in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated CHO-IR/Δp85 cells was markedly decreased, as was the insulin-induced cellular accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Moreover, insulin-stimulated translocation of the glucose transporters GLUTI, but not Ras activation, was markedly inhibited in CHO-IR/Δp85 cells (Hara et al., 1994Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H.

A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar. In the present study, we showed that insulin fully activates glycogen synthase in CHO-IR/Δp85 cells. To exclude the possibility that our stably transfected CHO-IR/Δp85 cells had acquired somatic mutations that affected the cellular activity under investigation, we also transiently overexpressed Δp85 in Ratl-IR cells with the use of a recombinant vaccinia virus. Transient overexpression of Δp85 in Ratl-IR cells markedly decreased PI 3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates prepared from insulin-treated cells with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-IRS-1 antibodies, but did not affect insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase activity. Thus, normal activation of glycogen synthase by insulin in CHO-IR/Δp85 cells does not appear to be attributable to somatic mutations acquired during cloning and culture. Therefore, neither stable overexpression (CHO-IR/Δp85 cells) nor transient overexpression (Ratl-IR/Δp85 cells) of dominant negative Δp85-inhibited insulin stimulation of glycogen synthase, even though the insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase activity was markedly reduced. However, wortmannin abolished the activation of glycogen synthase by insulin in both CHO-IR/Δp85 cells and Rat/IR/Δp85. One interpretation of our data is that insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity is not required for insulin activation of glycogen synthase and that wortmannin inhibits the activation of glycogen synthase independently of its inhibitory effect on the heteromeric PI 3-kinase. This interpretation appears reasonable, given that the specificity of wortmannin is not clear. For example, wortmannin inhibits other enzymes related to the heteromeric PI 3-kinase such as the G protein βγ subunit-sensitive PI 3-kinase (Stephens et al., 1994aStephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar and phosphatidylinositol-specific PI 3-kinase (Stephens et al., 1994bStephens L. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Jackson T. Volinia S. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar. Thus, wortmannin may inhibit an unknown enzyme that is an upstream regulator of glycogen synthase. Another interpretation is that a small increase in PI 3-kinase activity is sufficient for the activation of glycogen synthase but not for glucose uptake. Thus, the dominant negative p85 mutant does not completely block the association of PI 3-kinase activity with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, whereas wortmannin inhibits p110 catalytic activity completely. For example, wortmannin decreased the small amount of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in CHO-IR/Δp85 cells (data not shown) and Rat 1-IR/Δp85 cells. A third interpretation is that the stably or transiently overexpressed Δp85 may interact with other proteins that bypass PI 3-kinase activity and rescue the signal transduction pathway from the insulin receptor to glycogen synthase. If this is the case, wortmannin must inhibit enzymes other than heteromeric PI 3-kinase, because this agent completely blocked the activation of glycogen synthase in cells overexpressing Δp85. Insulin fully stimulates p70 S6 kinase in CHO-IR/Δp85 and Ratl-IR/Δp85 cells, whereas wortmannin completely inhibits insulin-dependent activation of p70 S6 kinase in these cells. Furthermore, both p90rsk and p70 S6 kinase phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a kinase thought to have a major role in regulating glycogen synthase activity, in a cell-free system (Sutherland et al., 1993Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. These data prompted us to examine the role of p70 S6 kinase in the insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase in intact cells. We examined the effects of the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which blocks the activation of p70 S6 kinase by insulin and many growth factors, but does not inhibit MAP kinase or p90rsk (Chung et al., 1992Chung J.

A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar. We showed that rapamycin completely inhibited insulin activation of p70 S6 kinase at a concentration of 20 ng/ml, whereas no significant decrease in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity was observed when CHO-IR cells were treated with rapamycin at concentrations up to 200 ng/ml. These observations suggest that the p70 S6 kinase pathway may not be important in the activation of glycogen synthase, consistent with data from rat adipocytes (Lin and Lawrence, 1994Lin F.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21255-21261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, rapamycin was shown to be without effect on the inactivation of GSK-3 by insulin in CHO cells (Welsh et al., 1994Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and the rat skeletal muscle cell line L6 (Cross et al., 1994Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Vanddenheeden J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar. These studies also suggested that GSK-3 activity is regulated by a cascade involving MAP kinase and p90rsk and that wortmannin only partially blocks MAP kinase activation by insulin but almost completely blocks the effects of insulin on GSK-3 (Welsh et al., 1994Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavare J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar: Cross et al., 1994Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Vanddenheeden J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar. We also showed that wortmannin inhibited insulin activation of MAP kinase by only 20% (data not shown), whereas it abolished the insulin-induced activation of glycogen synthase in CHO-IR cells. As previously pointed out (Cross et al., 1994Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Vanddenheeden J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, these observations can be explained in two ways. First, only a small degree of activation of p90rsk may be required for maximal inhibition of GSK-3, because of the large potential of protein kinase cascades for amplification. Second, GSK-3 may be inhibited by a distinct insulin-stimulated protein kinase whose activation is also blocked by wortmannin. Given that activation of p90rsk appears insufficient to activate glycogen synthase (Lin and Lawrence, 1994Lin F.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21255-21261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter explanation may be more reasonable. Although it is possible that a small increase in heteromeric PI 3-kinase activity associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in a specific compartment of cells is sufficient for the activation of glycogen synthase but not for glucose uptake, we favor the notion that a wortmannin-sensitive molecule other than the heteromeric PI 3-kinase is an upstream regulator of glycogen synthase. In conclusion, we demonstrated that neither Ras-MAP kinase cascade nor PI3-kinase may be required for insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activation in CHO cell lines and p70S6 kinase is not likely to be involved in this event. However, the present studies do not exclude the possible role of these molecules on glycogen synthase activation in other tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle. We thank Drs. A. Ando, H.

https://openalex.org/W2028848827,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) regulates gene expression and growth of vascular cells by triggering signals that link its cognate, G protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane to transcriptional activation of immediate early genes in the nucleus. To define the nature of these signals, we asked whether Ras proteins contribute to activation of the c-fos serum response element (SRE) by ET-1 in mesangial cells, a microvascular cell from the renal glomerulus. ET-1 stimulated Ras by increasing Ras GTP loading. Addition of ET-1 or transfection with a plasmid expressing v-Ha-Ras stimulated SRE-dependent transcription. Activation of the c-fos SRE by ET-1 was blocked by a dominant negative Asn-17 c-Ha-Ras mutant. Expression of v-Ha-Ras reversed inhibition of ET-1-stimulated SRE transcriptional activity by Asn-17 c-Ha-Ras. ET-1 also stimulated kinase activity of c-Raf-1, a downstream effector in Ras signaling cascades. Activation of the c-fos SRE by transfection with a plasmid expressing constitutively activated ARaf-1 was consistent with a role for Ras-Raf-1 in ET-1 signaling. Interestingly, Ras-dependent SRE activation in cells treated with ET-1 was blocked by point mutations in the SRE CArG DNA sequence, which binds the serum response factor, but not by mutations that inhibit binding of ternary complex factors (p62TCF) to the Ets DNA sequence of the SRE. Thus, Ras contributes to a nuclear signaling cascade linking ET-1 receptors to transcriptional activation through the CArG cis-element of the c-fos SRE."

However, there is a growing appreciation that this gene also is expressed in a variety of non-muscle tissues including a specialized cell type termed a “myofibroblast” (1Skalli O. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. Henson P.M. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1988: 373-401Crossref Google Scholar). Although the origin of stromal myofibroblasts remains unclear, they may express a variety of smooth muscle markers and are closely associated with proliferative processes such as wound healing and non-malignant fibromatoses (2Sappino A.P. Schürch W. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 144-161PubMed Google Scholar), and desmoplastic stromal responses to a variety of neoplasias including carcinomas of both the breast (3Schürch W.

Little is known of the mechanisms which regulate VSM α-actin expression in myofibroblasts but the proliferative nature of the pathological conditions associated with the appearance of these cells suggests an involvement of peptide growth factors. Similarly, vascular injuries that are accompanied by the release of growth factors such as transforming growth factor type β1, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor represent a clinical situation where subpopulations of smooth muscle cells arise in the blood vessel wall which exhibit novel phenotypic properties and vary in the ability to express VSM α-actin (5Nabel E.G.

Mechanisms involved in the modulation of VSM α-actin transcriptional activity as a consequence of smooth muscle injury or in specialized cell types such as myofibroblasts may share similarities with strategies utilized during normal development of the vascular system (9Bochaton-Piallat M.-L.

Thromb. 1993; 13: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasticity of VSM α-actin gene expression may represent one adaptation acquired by a variety of non-muscle and muscle cell types to manipulate intracellular contractile protein levels necessary for repairing tissue injuries or remodelling of the contractile apparatus. For this reason, identifying and characterizing the genetic elements involved in the modulation of VSM α-actin gene transcription in both myoblast and fibroblast lineages may provide some insight into molecular mechanisms that govern this plasticity and provide for better recognition of potentially useful clinical control points. As a first step toward understanding more about the mechanisms involved in transcriptional activation and repression of the VSM α-actin gene, we have identified and compared protein factors in mouse BC3H1 myogenic cell and AKR-2B embryonic fibroblast extracts that specifically interacted with its proximal promoter region. BC3H1 myoblasts are unique among muscle tissue culture cells in that they reproducibly demonstrate sustained activation of the VSM α-actin gene in response to the accumulation of cytodifferentiation permissive, extracellular matrix macromolecules (11Strauch A.R. Berman M.D. Miller H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Lee S.H. Yan H. Reeser J.C. Dillman J.M. Strauch A.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of this gene in differentiated BC3H1 myocytes can be rapidly and selectively repressed (12Lee S.H. Yan H. Reeser J.C. Dillman J.M. Strauch A.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 13Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) which indicates the advantage of this line in elucidating the essential positive and negative components of VSM α-actin transcriptional plasticity. In contrast, while the VSM α-actin gene is not expressed in AKR-2B embryonic fibroblasts, transient activation can be achieved by exposing quiescent cells to serum growth factors (13Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this regard, AKR-2B fibroblasts represent a convenient model for examining aspects of smooth muscle actin regulation in transient myofibroblasts that may be difficult to study biochemically in the context of normal wound healing processes (14Darby I. Skalli O. Gabbiani G. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). Several nuclear protein factors that bound to closely-positioned regions of the VSM α-actin gene promoter involved in transcriptional activation and repression were identified in BC3H1 myogenic cells, AKR-2B fibroblasts, and several smooth muscle tissues. One factor, characterized in this report as a protein resembling the SV40-enhancer binding protein TEF-1, binds an inverted M-CAT consensus sequence previously identified in other muscle-specific contractile protein genes (15Mar J.H.

Recent reports suggest that the TEF-1 protein may represent one member of a family of related transcriptional regulators that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (18Farrance I.K.G. Mar J.H.

TEF-1 activity was enriched in AKR-2B fibroblasts and undifferentiated BC3H1 myoblasts, but absent in mature myocytes cultivated in serum-free medium. An additional sequence-specific, double-stranded DNA binding activity also was detected in extracts prepared from whole BC3H1 myoblasts or isolated nuclei but not fibroblasts. This factor, designated vascular actin repressor factor 1 (VAC-RF1), bound specifically to DNA probes that overlapped a strong silencing element previously shown to be responsible for transcriptional repression in undifferentiated BC3H1 myoblasts (21Foster D.N.

Finally, we describe the binding properties of two sequence-specific proteins, designated VAC-ssBF1 and -BF2 in both fibroblast and myoblast extracts, that exhibited preferential affinity for single-stranded DNA. The binding site for both of these factors resided in a region of the promoter that contained an inverted repeat sequence with high potential to form cruciform structures. The sequence specificity, tissue distribution, and developmental regulation of these factors suggested that they may play an essential role in cell stage-specific transcriptional regulation of the VSM α-actin gene. We describe a model for transcriptional regulation which implicates multiple protein-DNA interactions that may involve alterations in DNA topology around the closely-linked positive and negative control elements within the mouse VSM α-actin promoter. Cell Culture and Transfection Methods—Mouse BC3H1 myogenic cells and AKR-2B embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in culture and transfected as described previously (13Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J.

Full differentiation of quiescent BC3H1 myoblasts into highlyelongated myocytes was accomplished by exposing postconfluent cells to serum-free, N2 differentiation medium for a period of 4–5 days (21Foster D.N.

Oligonucleotide primers with a 5′ SalI restriction site, which anchor deletions or create transversion mutations of certain nucleotides, were made on an Applied Biosystem model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and desalted over a Sephadex™ G-25 NAP column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) in distilled water. In polymerase chain reaction amplifications, each of these primers was paired with Bam27, the 3′ primer with a BamHI restriction site. Briefly, primers were annealed to 0.1–1 μg of template DNA (VSMP4) and amplified 30–35 cycles in a Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT) DNA Thermacycler™ using polymerase chain reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) reagents and reaction times (94 °C × 1 min; 50 °C × 2 min; 72 °C × 3 min). Polymerase chain reaction products were purified from 1–2% agarose gel slices using Costar (Cambridge, MA) Spin-X™ columns. Promoter fragments then were digested with SalI/BamI and ligated into the promoter-less reporter plasmid pBLCAT3 (22Luckow B. Schutz G.

Recombinant plasmid p99βAc-CAT was constructed for use as a positive control in primer extension assays by making a 99-base synthetic copy of the mouse β-actin proximal promoter region (-92 to +7) and its complement. Gel-purified oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, annealed, and inserted between the SalI and BamHI site of pBLCAT3. All cloned sequences described in this paper were confirmed by double-stranded dideoxy sequencing using a Sequenase™ kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Primer extension assays were performed as described previously (4Lazard D. Sastre X. Frid M.G. Glukhova M. Thiery J.-P. Koteliansky V.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, 1–2 × 106 AKR-2B cells were plated in 162 cm2 peel-top culture flasks (Costar) and grown to 70–80% confluence in McCoys 5A (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, Grand Island, NY) medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were harvested, sedimented at 300 × g, and rinsed several times in ice-cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Whole cell extract was prepared from the frozen pellet by thawing and gently pipetting with a Pasteur pipette in 5 volumes of whole cell extract buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) until the suspension was visually homogeneous. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –81 °C until used in EMSAs. Nuclear and cytosolic (S-100) fractions were prepared from BC3H1 cells essentially as described by Ausubel et al. (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.L. Struhl K.

Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 1.5 packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF. The cells were allowed to swell for 20 min on ice and then lysed by 35 strokes with a type-B Dounce homogenizer pestle. The cell lysate volume was measured and supplemented with 1.67 volumes of high salt buffer containing 1.6 M KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 20% glycerol. Lysate aliquots were gently agitated on a tilt shaker for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The upper lipid layer was discarded and the clear supernatant dialyzed against a large excess of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 20% glycerol. Tissue extracts were prepared from 7–9-day-old mice following a modification of the procedure described by Taylor (26Taylor M.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2669-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Tissues were removed, rinsed several times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and quick frozen with liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues initially were ground to a fine powder and then processed by 30 strokes with a a type-B pestle in a Dounce homogenizer using 2 volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 25% glycerol. The homogenate was first clarified at 3000 × g for 30 min and the resulting supernatant immediately centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to yield the final supernatant which was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –81 °C. Oligonucleotide Probes and Competitors—Five overlapping 30-bp oligonucleotides spanning the region of the VSM α-actin 5′-flanking region between –224 and –155 (Fig. 2), as well as six other double-stranded oligonucleotides used for binding and competition analysis (Table I), were synthesized and purified as described above. In some cases reverse and forward sets of oligonucleotides were labeled both separately and after annealing to allow analysis of both single- and double-stranded DNA-binding proteins in cell and tissue extracts. One additional 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing mutations in the CArG-like element (CCATAACGAGCTGAGCTGCCTAAAGGCCTA, mutated sequence is underlined) was obtained from a commercial source (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA).Table INucleotide sequence of synthetic oligonucleotide probesProbeSequencePrM305′–tcqacGCAGAACAGA GGAATG CAGTGGAAGAGACCcg −3′mPrM303′–qCGTCTTGTCT CCTTAC GTCACCTTCTCTGGcctaq–5′5′–tcqacGCAGAACAGA TTAATG CAGTGGAAGAGACCq −3′cTNT3′–qCGTCTTGTCT AATTAC GTCACCTTCTCTGGcctaq–5′5′–tcqacGGCGCCCAGAG AGGAATG CAACACTTGTGAq −3′GT-IIC3′– qCCGCGGGTCTC TCCTTAC GTTGTGAACACTcctaq–5′5′–CCGAGAGAC ACATTCCA C ACATTCCA CTGC −3′3′–CTCTG TGTAAGGT G TGTAAGGT GACGGGCT–5′SphI-II5′–CCGAGAGAT GCATGCTT T GCATACTT CTGC −3′3′–CTCTA CGTACGAA A CGTATGAA GACGGGCT–5′PrMI-II5′–TCTTCCACTG CATTCC TCT CATTCC TCTGT −3′3′– GGTGAC GTAAGG AGA GTAAGG AGACAAGAC–5′ Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed according to the method of Fried and Crothers (27Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9 (abstr.): 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) except in some cases whole cell extracts were used in place of nuclear extract. Reactions typically contained 1.5–10 μg of protein extract, 0.5–2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1–12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, or 105–340 mm NaCl, 0.3–0.9 mm DTT, 0.12–0.5 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm PMSF, 3.5–12% glycerol, and either 15,000 or 20,000 cpm (approximately 0.05–1 ng) of 32P-labeled probe in a 20-μ1 reaction volume. Probes were labeled with Klenow fragment (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL) and [α-32P]dNTP (ICN Biomedical, Costa Mesa, CA) or with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc./BRL) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). In some cases, labeled probes were purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and precipitated with ethanol before use. EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before subjecting samples to electrophoretic analysis for approximately 1.5–2.5 h at 150 V in either 0.25 or 0.5 × TBE (0.5 × = 0.045 M Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) on 4–5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For antibody supershift experiments, TEF-1 antiserum (3 μl, obtained from I. K. G. Farrance and C. P. Ordahl, University of California San Francisco) was added to reactions during the last 10 min of incubation prior to gel electrophoresis. Polyclonal TEF-1 antisera was prepared from a rabbit immunized with a mixture of three synthetic peptides derived from the chicken TEF-1 cDNA sequence. 2I. K. G. Farrance, personal communication. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Sterling XR-100, BioWorld, Dublin, OH) for various periods. UV Cross-linking of DNA-Protein Complexes—Determination of the molecular weight of proteins bound to nucleic acid in EMSAs was performed essentially as described by Williams et al. (28Williams M. Brys A. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20 (abstr.): 4935-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) except for some minor modifications. DNA probes labeled using Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dNTP were used in EMSAs as described above except that protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 0.75-mm thick 5% polyacrylamide gel. The wet gel was irradiated under a 254-nm reflected UV lamp (Fotodyne Inc., New Berlin, WI) at 15–20 cm for 10 min and then exposed to x-ray film overnight at 4 °C to visualize mobility shifted complexes. DNA-protein complexes then were excised and denatured by boiling gel slices for 5 min in sample buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 3 mm DTT, and 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. A 5-µg aliquot of prestained protein molecular weight marker (high range mixture, Life Technologies, Inc./BRL) was precast into a 0.75-mm thick 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel slice (0.1% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.25 × TBE) and denatured in parallel. After denaturation, the gel slices were placed at the top of a 10 × 11.5-cm glass gel plate; 0.75-mm spacers were then fitted and a second plate clamped to the first. A 10% SDS-polyacryamide separating gel mixture was poured into the mold and allowed to polymerize, leaving about 0.5–1.0 cm between the bottom of the gel slices and the top of the separating gel. A stacking gel then was poured into the mold to fill the remaining volume between the two plates. Following electrophoresis at 200 V, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography for 4 days at –81 °C using intensifying screens. A Purine-rich Motif Is Essential to VSM α-Actin Promoter Activity—In previous studies we constructed a series of deletion mutants of the mouse VSM α-actin promoter and tested their ability to activate a linked CAT reporter gene following transfection into either BC3H1 myoblasts or AKR-2B fibroblasts (13Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggested the presence of a strong transcriptional silencing element mapping, in part, between –224 and –191 relative to the start of transcription. The size of this element appeared to be cell-type dependent since retention of a GGGA motif between –195 and –192 was sufficient to maintain a fully-repressed transcriptional state in AKR-2B fibroblasts, whereas it was only partially able to do so in subconfluent BC3H1 myoblasts. Full repression of myoblasts required an intact CArG-like element located between –203 and –194 (21Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S. Sun S. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of the 33-base pair silencing region, transcriptional activation in both cell types was found to require both a CArG motif at position –120 and –111 and an unidentified element positioned between –191 and –150. To further localize the activating element, a series of transversion (TV) mutations were introduced within the transcriptionally-active truncated promoter construct previously designated VSMP4 (13Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K. Stoflet E.S.

As shown in Fig. 1, mutations within a 6-bp GGAATG sequence completely abolished VSM α-actin promoter activity in fibroblasts. This purine-rich motif (PrM) maps between–181 and –176 and is 100% conserved at the identical coordinates in the human, rat, and chicken VSM α-actin promoters (29Min B. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16667-16675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blank R.S. McQuinn T.C. Yin K.C. Thompson M.M. Takeyasu K. Schwartz R.J. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 984-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations within the PrM partially impaired promoter activity in undifferentiated subconfluent BC3H1 myoblasts but, interestingly, had no statistically significant effect in more developmentally advanced, postconfluent myoblasts (Fig. 1). Other mutations, with the exception of those encompassing the PrM (TV 181, TV 179, TV 177), were largely ineffective in reducing VSMP4 promoter activity in subconfluent BC3H1 myoblasts (data not shown). In an attempt to identify protein factors that interacted with the activating PrM, as well as with sequences immediately upstream which contributed to transcriptional silencing, whole cell protein extracts were prepared from AKR-2B fibroblasts and BC3H1 myoblasts and used in EMSAs. Individual double-stranded 30-bp oligonucleotides (designated ol-o5) from the overlapping set shown in Fig. 2 and spanning –224 to –155 of the VSM α-actin promoter were used as probes for these studies. A single shifted complex designated oligonucleotide 4-binding protein (o4BP) was detected in both fibroblast and myoblast extracts when probed with the oligonucleotide spanning from –194 to –165 that encompassed the PrM activating element (Fig. 2). However, a second distinctly shifted complex, designated oligonucleotide 1 binding protein (o1BP), was detected only in myoblast extracts in combination with probes spanning from –224 to –194 (o1) and from –215 to –185 (o2). The o1 and o2 probes overlapped in a region which contains a CArG-like element that previously was shown to impart musclerestricted transcriptional activity (21Foster D.N. Min B. Foster L.K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11995-12003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). o4BP and the SV40 Enhancer Binding Protein TEF-1 have Similar DNA-binding Site Recognition Properties—The 6-bp VSM α-actin PrM is contained within a larger sequence (GAGGAATGC) which bears close similarity to the recognition sequences for two unrelated transcription factors.

https://openalex.org/W1977741635,"A series of monoclonal antibodies has been generated against an hexapeptide of sequence IRGERA corresponding to the C-terminal residues 130-135 of histone H3 and three analogues of this model peptide. The analogues correspond to the D-enantiomer, containing only D-residues, and two retro-peptides containing NH-CO bonds instead of natural amide peptide bonds. The chirality of each residue was maintained in the retro-peptide and inverted in the retro-inverso-peptide. Monoclonal antibodies were generated from mice immunized with the analogues coupled to neutral small unilamellar liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A as adjuvant. The reactivity of antibodies with the four analogues and with the parent protein H3 was studied in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in a biosensor system. The equilibrium affinity constant (Ka) toward the retro-inverso-peptide of two out of three antibodies of IgG1 isotype induced against the L-hexapeptide was 7-75-fold higher than toward the homologous L-peptide.

Furthermore, antibodies to the L- and retro-inverso-peptides cross-reacted strongly (in some cases better than with the homologous peptide) with the parent histone H3 and with chromatin subunits containing H3. The results are thus promising in respect to the potential use of retro-inverso-analogues, which are particularly stable, in the design of much more potent synthetic vaccines or to generate antibody probes.

Studies of the relationship between peptide conformation and activity have shown that the introduction of backbone modifications into biologically active peptides affects potency, enzymatic stability, and conformation properties, which, in some cases, leads to the production of analogues with advantageous properties (1Leban J.J.

For instance, pseudopeptides containing reduced peptide bonds ψ-(CH2-NH) or retro-inverso modifications ψ-(NH-CO) have been particularly investigated both in biological and structural studies (2Shemyakin M.M.

In view of recent progress toward the preparation of pseudopeptides and peptide mimetics for obtaining useful drugs structurally related to their parent peptides, the design of such structures to replace natural peptides in immunology may be promising. However, in contrast with intense research developed in the domain of peptide drug design, very few studies have been performed with peptidomimetics in immunology. Potential applications of pseudopeptides and peptidomimetics cover many aspects of basic immunology including synthetic vaccines, immunodiagnostics, and the development of new generations of immunomodulators. Recently, we have analyzed the antigenic and immunogenic properties of an all D-, a retro- and a retro-inverso-analogue of the model hexapeptide of sequence IRGERA corresponding to the COOH-terminal residues 130-135 of histone H3 (8Benkirane N.

Both retroanalogues contained NH-CO bonds instead of the CO-NH peptide bonds; the chirality of each residue was maintained in the retro-peptide, and inverted in the retro-inverso-peptide. It was found that the three analogues induced in mice IgG antibodies of various subclasses. While IgG3 antibodies reacted similarly with the four analogues (L-, retro-inverso-, D-, and retro-peptides), antibodies of the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes showed a strong conformational preference for certain analogues. Thus, regarding IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies, the retro-inverso-peptide was found to mimic the antigenic activity of the natural L-peptide but not of the all D- and retro-peptides. Conversely, the retro-peptide mimicked the D-peptide but not the L- and retro-inverso-peptides. The finding that a retro-inverso-peptide can mimic and thus replace a natural L-peptide was confirmed by the reactivity of a particular monoclonal antibody (mAb)1 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyMPLAmonophophoryl lipid AELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayEDCN-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimidePDEA2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethane amine. induced against the L-peptide (mAb 4×11), which recognized the retro-inverso-peptide (equilibrium affinity constant Ka, 2 × 108M-1) much better than the parent L-peptide (Ka, 3 × 106M-1). Furthermore, we have also shown that the retro-inverso-peptide was much more resistant to proteolysis than the L-peptide. Its half-life in the presence of trypsin was at least 7 times longer. monoclonal antibody monophophoryl lipid A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethane amine. In order to assess the potential use of retro-inverso-peptides as immunogens useful for vaccination or for eliciting antibody probes for immunotherapy, it was necessary to analyze in more detail the capacity of antibodies generated against these peptide analogues to react with the parent protein and particularly with assembled complex structures. The model peptide studied in the present investigation is particularly interesting to study cross-reaction of anti-peptide antibodies since the region 130-135 of H3 is accessible at the surface of chromatin core particles, constituted by two copies of each core histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 and 145 base pairs of DNA. In the present study, we describe the properties of a set of murine mAbs against the L- and the all D-IRGERA peptides and, for the first time, against two types of analogue, namely the retro-inverso- and retro-peptides. These antibodies were generated from mice immunized with the analogues coupled to neutral small unilamellar vesicles containing a nontoxic derivative of lipid A, monophophoryl lipid A (MPLA), as adjuvant. We have measured the equilibrium affinity constants of these antibodies in the BIAcore toward the four analogues, the parent protein H3, and core particles. The results present the first unequivocal example for the potential application of retro-inverso peptidomimetics in the generation of strongly cross-reactive antibodies. Core particles and histone H3 were isolated from chicken erythrocytes and purified as described previously (10Muller S. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The four peptide analogues were synthesized by the solid phase methodology on a multichannel peptide synthesizer (11Neimark J. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). For retro-inverso- and retro-peptides, the end group-modified retro- and retro-inverso-isomers were assembled in t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry on a p-methyl benzhydrylamine resin (Applied Biosystem, Roissy, France). Protected amino acids were from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Assembly of the protected peptide chain was carried out on a 200-μmol scale using the in situ neutralization protocol described previously (11Neimark J. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). The (R,S)-2-methyl malonic acid monobenzyl ester obtained by alcoholysis of 2,2,5,-trimetyl-1,3-dioxane-4-6-dione (12Chorev M. Rubini E. Gilon C. Wormser U. Selinger Z. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was incorporated into the peptide chain as a racemate. The coupling was monitored with the ninhidrin test. After this last coupling, the peptide resin was washed twice with ether and dried under vacuum in a dessicator. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by treatment with anhydrous HF containing 10% (v/v) anisol and 1% (v/v) 1,2-ethanedithiol. After removal of HF in vacuo, the peptides were extracted from the resin and lyophilized. The crude peptides were then purified on a C18 column using a middle pressure apparatus (Kronwald Separation Technology, Sinsheim, Germany) by elution with a linear gradient of 5-50% (v/v) acetonitrile in aqueous 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of each fraction was assessed by analytical runs on a Novapack C18 column 5 μm (3.9 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient of 7-32% (v/v) acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1 M triethylammonium phosphate buffer. Runs were performed with a Waters apparatus (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The fractions containing the pure diastereomeric mixture were pooled and lyophilized. Mass spectra were obtained on a VG analytical ZAB-2SE double focusing instrument and recorded on a VG 11-250 data system (VG Analytical, Manchester, United Kingdom) as described previously (13Briand J.P. Van Dorsselaer A. Raboy B. Muller S. Peptide Res. 1989; 2: 381-388PubMed Google Scholar). To allow the coating of peptides in a direct solid phase ELISA test, IRGERA analogues were conjugated to bovine serum albumin using N-succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]propionate (SPDP) as described previously (14Muller S. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Muller S. Plaué S. Synthetic Polypeptides as Antigens. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1988: 95-130Google Scholar). For immunization of mice, peptides were covalently coupled to preformed small unilamellar vesicles containing MPLA (8Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J.

For mAb production, BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with the four small unilamellar vesicles preparations containing 1 μmol of lipid, 2 μg of MPLA, and 100 μg of peptide/injection/animal. Mice received three injections at intervals of 3 weeks. Booster injections were given at days 105, 106, 107, and 108, i.e. −4, −3, −2, and −1 before fusion. mAbs were prepared by standard fusion protocols (16Muller S. Isabey A. Couppez M. Plaué S. Sommermeyer G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Spleen lymphocytes were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with nonsecreting PAI myeloma cells (17Stocker J.W. Foster H.K. Miggiano V. Stahli C. Staiger G. Takacs B. Staehelin T.H. Disclosure. 1982; 217: 155-157Google Scholar). The cells were distributed in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Starting 7 days after the fusion, culture supernatants were tested by ELISA for the presence of specific antibodies reacting with peptide analogues and H3. Positive cultures were recloned twice in agar in the presence of 105 macrophages/ml as feeder cells. Positive clones were amplified by in vitro culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.). Antibodies (in 370-1000 ml of culture medium) were subsequently precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. Some of them were further purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Their purity was checked by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The antibody concentration was determined by optical density measurement at 280 nm using an absorption coefficient of 1.4. Protein concentration was also determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The ELISA procedures (direct binding experiments and determination of mAb isotypes) were as described previously (8Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.P. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26279-26285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For real time binding experiments, a BIAcore biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor, AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used. Reagents including sensor chips CM5, surfactant P20, and coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethane amine (PDEA) and ethanolamine HCl were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor AB. To immobilize peptides to the sensor chip, the carboxyl-dextran matrix was first activated with 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 MN-hydroxysuccinimide. It was further modified by injecting PDEA thiol coupling reagent (15 μl of 80 mM PDEA in 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.5) allowing the thiol reactive group of peptide analogues to be coupled to the activated matrix. After the peptide immobilization run, remaining reactive groups on the sensor surface were deactivated by a 4-min pulse of 50 mM cysteine in 1 M NaCl, pH 4.3. Histone H3 was immobilized by the conventional procedure using EDC and N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated dextran matrix. Core particles were immobilized by trapping them on sensor chips containing covalently bound rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc and a purified murine mAb directed against histone H2B (mAb LG11-2; a gift of M. Monestier, Philadelphia, PA) as a second layer. mAbs were then allowed to interact with sensor chips on which the four peptide analogues, H3, or core particles had been immobilized. 6-10 concentrations of each mAb ranging from 50 to 800 nM in HBS, pH 7.4 (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.05% BIAcore surfactant P20) were used in each test.

Four groups of two BALB/c mice were injected with the L-, retro-inverso-, D-, and retro-IRGERA analogues coupled to small unilamellar vesicles containing MPLA as adjuvant, and four fusion experiments were performed with the spleen cells of these mice. Characteristics of retro-inverso- and retro-analogues, which contain reversed peptide bonds (i.e. NH-CO instead of CO-NH) have been described previously (Fig. 1) (9Guichard G. Benkirane N.

The four peptides contain a cysteine and two additional glycine residues at the NH2-terminal end to allow selective conjugation of the peptides to bovine serum albumin and liposomes, and to enhance their accessibility when bound to carriers. ELISA reaction with peptide analogues and with H3 of polyclonal mouse antisera raised against these four peptides have been described previously (8Benkirane N. Friede M. Guichard G. Briand J.P.

Hybridomas secreting antibodies to peptide analogues and H3 were screened by ELISA using antigens adsorbed to plastic of microtiter plates, and positive cultures were recloned twice in agar. A total of 67 stabilized specific hybridomas were obtained from the four fusions (Table I). A number of these clones were of the IgG3 isotype. Since the reactivity of IgG3 antibodies in regard to their recognition of peptide analogues appeared quite different from that of antibodies of the IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b subclasses (8Benkirane N.

Nine positive clones secreting IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies (Table I) were amplified in vitro, purified, and tested for their ability to cross-react with the parent IRGERA peptide, peptide analogues, the parent protein histone H3, and chromatin subunits. Between 35 and 63 mg of each mAb were available for these measurements.Table ISummary of results obtained in fusion experiments of splenocytes from mice immunized against the L-parent IRGERA hexapeptide and peptide analogues Open table in a new tab The capacity of the nine mAbs to react in ELISA with IRGERA peptides and H3 is summarized in Table II. In most cases, mAbs to the L- and retro-inverso-peptides cross-reacted more or less strongly with the L- and retro-inverso-peptides as well as with the parent protein H3, while mAbs generated from mice immunized with the D- and retro-peptides cross-reacted with the D- and retro-peptides but not with the L- and retro-inverso-peptide and with H3. These results are thus in complete agreement with those described previously with mouse antisera raised against the four IRGERA peptides (9Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The only exception was found with mAb 13×13 (anti-retro-inverso) which did not react with the parent L-peptide while, intriguingly, it recognized the whole histone H3 (Table II).Table IIReactivity in ELISA of mAbs induced against IRGERA and IRGERA analoguesMicrotiter plates were coated with 2 μM peptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (carrier to peptide molar ratio 1:10) or with 100 ng/ml H3 and allowed to react with 4 μg/ml mAb.

The capacity of mAbs to recognize the four peptide analogues and H3 was measured in the BIAcore using antigens covalently linked to the dextran matrix through the free SH group introduced in peptides for this purpose or through amino groups of histone H3. Several concentrations of each mAb were allowed to react with the various immobilized antigens. Kinetic rate constants and equilibrium affinity constants of mAbs for the four peptide analogues and H3 are shown in Table III. As described above for ELISA, mAbs to the L- and retro-inverso-peptides bound preferentially the L- and retro-inverso-peptides in the BIAcore system. The only striking exceptions concerned mAb 13×13 which, as in ELISA (Table III), did not bind the parent L-peptide and mAb 4×8, which, in addition to binding the L- and retro-inverso-peptide, also recognized the D- and retro-peptide. The latter cross-reaction was not seen in ELISA (Table II). Interestingly, mAbs 4×8 and 4×11 (anti-L) both had a higher equilibrium affinity value Kafor the retro-inverso-analogue compared with Kavalues for the homologous peptide. In the case of mAb 4×11, this was due to a lower dissociation rate constant. Association and dissociation rate constants of mAbs 13×12, 13×14, and 13×18 with respect to the L- and retro-inverso-peptides were very similar for each mAb. mAbs 11×4 (anti-D-peptide) and 12×10 (anti-retro-peptide) presented similar kaand kdvalues with respect to the retro- and D-peptides.Table IIIKinetic rate constants and equilibrium affinity constants of mAbs induced against IRGERA and IRGERA analoguesNB, no binding.

The seven anti-L- and retro-inverso-peptide mAbs reacted with H3. Depending on the mAbs, equilibrium affinity values Kawere between 0.3 and 6.5 109M-1. mAbs 4×8 and 4×11 (anti-L-peptide) showed a much higher affinity for H3 than for the parent L-peptide (54 and 76 times, respectively). As expected, mAbs 11×4 (anti-D-peptide) and 12×10 (anti-retro-peptide) used as control antibodies did not recognize H3. Since several mAbs generated against IRGERA and the retro-inverso-analogue recognized the parent histone H3, their capacity to recognize H3 in more complex structures such as core particles was further studied. Core particles are the basic repeating structural subunits of eukaryotic chromatin and are composed of two molecules of each histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 surrounded by 145 base pairs of DNA. When adsorbed to a solid surface, a part of the conformation of these subunits may be affected. Likewise, the conformation of core particles may be considerably altered when they are covalently bound to the dextran matrix of the sensor chip via primary groups, particularly because histone tails, which are very basic, play an important role in the stabilization of the edifice. To overcome this problem, isolated core particles were captured by a first mAb directed against histone H2B, which was presented by rabbit anti-mouse IgG Fc immobilized on the sensor chip. Anti-H2B mouse mAb LG11-2 was shown in independent experiments to specifically recognize peptide 1-25 of H2B.2 2M. Monestier and S. Muller, unpublished results. A typical immobilization plot of presenting antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse IgG and mAb LG 11-2) and the binding of core particles is shown in Fig. 2. This figure also shows an example of interaction between mAb 4×11 and core particles. As shown in Table IV, six of the seven mAbs induced against the L- and retro-inverso-peptide reacted with core particles. The equilibrium affinity constants Kaof mAbs 4×8, 4×10, and 4×11 (anti-L-peptide) for core particles were 1.2 × 109M-1, 5.9 × 109M-1, and 1.2 × 109M-1, respectively. Kavalues of mAbs 13×12, 13×14 and 13×18 (anti-retro-inverso-peptide) for core particles were 1.7 × 109M-1, 1.9 × 108M-1, and 2.2 × 109M-1, respectively. mAb 13×13 did not recognize core particles in the BIAcore system. As expected, the mAbs induced against D- and retro-peptides did not react with core particles.Table IVKinetic rate constants and equilibrium affinity constants of mAbs induced against IRGERA and IRGERA analogues with respect to core particlesFor details, see the legend of Table III. Open table in a new tab For details, see the legend of Table III. The IRGERA peptide provides an excellent model for the study of antigenic and immunogenic properties of pseudopeptides. It is known to be non-immunogenic in the absence of a carrier protein and particularly sensitive to proteases, and because this region of H3 is exposed at the surface of nucleosome in chromatin (22Muller S. Himmelspach K. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), anti-peptide antibodies are interesting probes to study antibody interaction with complex nucleoprotein particles. In this study, we have investigated the specificity and affinity of mAbs induced against the natural L-hexapeptide and analogues containing reversed amide bonds. The retro-inverso transformation has been used by numerous bioorganic chemists to convert biologically active peptides into more stable compounds (2Shemyakin M.M. Ovchinnikov Y.U. Ivanov V.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1969; 8: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Goodman M. Chorev M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1979; 12: 1-7Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 6Chorev M. Goodman M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 266-273Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (9Guichard G. Benkirane N. Zeder-Lutz G. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Briand J.P. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that the retro-inverso IRGERA peptide was much more resistant to trypsin than the corresponding natural peptide. The most important finding in this work was to show that three of the four mAbs to the retro-inverso IRGERA peptide bound equally well the retro-inverso and the natural peptide (with Kavalues ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 × 109M-1). The four mAbs reacted with the cognate protein (Kavalues, 0.3-2 × 109M-1), and three of them reacted with chromatin core particles presented toward the liquid phase by the N-terminal end of histone H2B (Kavalues, 0.2-2.2 × 109M-1). In contrast, mAbs induced against the all D-peptide and the retro-analogues, used as control antibodies in this series of experiments, did not recognize the natural peptide, histone H3 and H3 within isolated core particle. In terms of structural and functional consequences in antibody-antigen reaction of specific modifications of peptidic bonds in a peptide, the results indicate that in our system, antibody specificity is not affected when the backbone of the IRGERA peptide is changed. In contrast, we show evidence that antibody interaction does not occur when, instead of presenting naturally-oriented side chains, the IRGERA peptide contains side chains with the same charge but a mirror orientation. The mechanism of IgG3 antibody interaction is apparently different. The fact that IgG3 Mabs induced against the D-enantiomer react with the L-peptide and H3 and, conversely, that IgG3 Mabs induced against the L-peptide react with the all D-peptide (8Benkirane N.

A. 1994; 91: 9765-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) supposes that for this class of antibodies, the orientation of side chains is not important. Understanding the details of fine mechanisms of this interaction should be gained by further structural and dynamic studies by x-ray crystallography and NMR. In the context of vaccine design, the demonstration that antibodies to a retro-inverso-peptide can cross-react particularly well with the cognate nucleoprotein structure is very important and promising for further development. The antibodies described in this study have been generated against the peptide analogue covalently bound to liposome containing the nontoxic adjuvant MPLA. Since the present study was performed with the C-terminal region of H3, which is known to be highly accessible and probably particularly mobile, the results should be confirmed with other exposed protein domains, which correspond to internal sequences in the primary structure of the protein. However, collectively, the strategy is encouraging in respect to the potential use of retro-inverso-peptides in the design of much more potent synthetic vaccines. We are currently investigating the immunogenicity of retro-inverso-peptides corresponding to neutralization epitopes, and other types of peptide bond modification are also under investigation (23Guichard G. Benkirane N. Graff R. Muller S. Briand J.P. Peptide Res. 1994; 7: 308-321PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretically, a vaccine consisting of such modified peptides in combination with T-epitopes associated with immunosomes may be effective in producing neutralizing antibodies against complex infectious structures. We thank Dr. M. Monestier for the gift of mAb LG11-2, Dr. M. Friede for the preparation of liposomes, and G. Sommermeyer for skilled technical assistance in the preparation of mAbs."
https://openalex.org/W2079457084,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein activates NF-κB transcription factors from preformed cytoplasmic pools, including those pools that are retained by the IκB-α inhibitory protein. Degradation of IκB-α is enhanced by Tax, resulting in the liberation of some NF-κB, which then translocates into the nucleus. Here we have investigated the mechanism by which Tax causes degradation of IκB-α. Two IκB-α mutants defective in extracellular signal-induced degradation of IκB-α also blocked Tax-mediated κB-dependent transactivation when cotransfected into Jurkat T cells. Cotransfected wild-type IκB-α or an irrelevant mutant did not significantly effect transactivation induced by Tax. The signal-defective IκB-α proteins are mutated at either of two closely spaced serines in the N terminus of the protein (Ser<sup>32</sup> and Ser<sup>36</sup>). In wild-type IκB-α, one or both of these serines are inducibly phosphorylated with extracellular stimuli, and such phosphorylation appears necessary for subsequent degradation and thus activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that Tax triggers IκB-α degradation and thus NF-κB activation by a mechanism that converges with that induced by extracellular stimulation such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin or tumor necrosis factor α. A role for Tax in activating signal transduction pathways upstream of IκB-α is implied."
https://openalex.org/W2085432989,"Small GTPases of the Rab family are key regulators of intracellular transport. They are associated with the cytoplasmic surface of distinct exocytic and endocytic organelles and with transport vesicles connecting these compartments. Rab proteins are also present in the cytosol in the GDP-bound conformation complexed to Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (RabGDI). Upon membrane association, RabGDI is released, and the Rab protein is converted into the GTP-bound form. In this paper we have investigated whether Rab5, which regulates the clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated pathway of endocytosis, can directly associate with the membrane of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) purified from bovine brain in vitro. We found that RabGDI can specifically deliver Rab5 but not Rab7, which is localized to late endosomes, to CCV. Furthermore, CCV contain a heat- and trypsin-sensitive activity that stimulates the dissociation of GDP from Rab5, but not from Rab7, and the subsequent binding of GTP. The activity was found to be associated with the CCV membrane but not with the coat components. CCV weakly stimulated GDP release from either post-translationally modified or unmodified Rab5 alone. However, maximal GDP dissociation stimulation required the presence of RabGDI, suggesting that the factor(s) responsible for the membrane association and GDP/GTP exchange of Rab5 recognize the protein complexed to RabGDI. These data demonstrate that CCV are competent for acquiring Rab5 and for converting the molecule into the GTP-bound active form."

To examine the signaling mechanisms involved, free of complications associated with mixed receptor populations, we have established a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing both Y1-NPY and α1b-adrenergic receptors. Occupation of either receptor species, with 100 nM peptide YY (PYY) or 10 μM phenylephrine (PE), respectively, resulted in a rapid increase in the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) as assessed with Fura-2/AM. The rise due to PYY, but not that due to PE, was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Both responses were largely maintained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, but abolished by prior depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools with either thapsigargin or 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone. Using cells prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol, PE promoted a rapid (5 s) rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) as analyzed by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography, whereas the response to PYY (first significant at >15 s post-stimulation) was too slow to play a causative role in Ca2+ mobilization. Combination of PE and PYY resulted in increases in [Ca2+]iwhich were at best additive, whereas they promoted a clearly synergistic rise in Ins(1,4,5)P3 at both 15 and 60 s. Co-stimulation also resulted in a synergistic activation of both protein kinase C (PKC) and [3H]arachidonic acid release. In either instance PYY alone was without effect. The potentiation of arachidonic acid release was abolished by depletion of cellular PKC following chronic treatment with phorbol esters. It is suggested that the ability of PYY to mobilize Ca2+ in an Ins(1,4,5)P3-independent fashion minimizes the functional importance of the capacity to potentiate PE-stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation. Instead the major conseqences of the synergistic activation of phospholipase C are mediated via PKC, the other route of the signaling pathway.

Together with the related inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), the RyR isoforms represent a distinct family of ligand gated ion channels.The skeletal muscle RyR has been shown to be a high molecular weight homotetramer (12Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol.

The primary sequence of the rabbit skeletal muscle isoform (RyR1) has been deduced from cDNA cloning (15Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 16Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit of the RyR is composed of 5037 (or 5032) amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ~565-kDa, making it one of the largest catalytic polypeptides yet identified. Recent studies suggest that each high molecular mass subunit may be tightly associated with a 12-kDa subunit identified as FK506 binding protein, an immunophilin (17Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.M. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Erdjument B.H. Tempst P. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9474-9477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The identification and structural characterization of the membrane spanning segments of the RyR are central to understanding the mechanisms of channel action and regulation. The ion conduction pathway is expected to be formed by the membrane-associated portion of the protein. Studies of the IP3R have also implicated the membrane-associated domain as an important region for tetramer formation (18Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Structural studies and sequence analysis of the RyR have suggested that only a small region of the protein is integral to the SR membrane. It can also be estimated that approximately 15% or less of the total protein mass contributes to the transmembrane assembly, based on the low resolution three-dimensional structure determined from electron microscopy (20Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Serysheva I.I. Orlova E.V. Chiu W. Sherman M.B. Hamilton S.L. van Heel M. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The most hydrophobic regions of the sequence, which may correspond to membrane spanning segments, are clustered in a domain of approximately 1000 residues near the C terminus. The pattern of hydrophobic segments in the C-terminal domain is well conserved among the three mammalian RyR isoforms (22Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and across species from mammals to arthropods (23Takeshima H. Nishi M. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Hosoya T. Masai I. Hotta Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The absence of any identifiable signal sequence at the N terminus implies that the large, hydrophilic N-terminal domain is localized in the cytoplasm. This is consistent with the distribution of mass on the cytoplasmic face of the SR observed in electron micrographs (24Ferguson D.G. Schwartz H.W. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Costello B. Chadwick C. Saito A. Chu A. Maurer A. Fleischer S. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several sites in the N-terminal domain have been identified as cytoplasmic. Serine 2843 has been shown to be the site of phosphorylation by several kinases (27Suko J. Maurer F.I. Plank B. Bertel O. Wyskovsky W. Hohenegger M. Hellmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Arginines 426, 1508, 2401, 2840, and 3119 have been identified as sites of trypsin cleavage in closed SR vesicles (28Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K.J. Needleman D.H. Cantu III, C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An antibody recognizing residues 2–15 at the N terminus was also shown to bind to the cytoplasmic face of SR vesicles (29Marty L. Villaz M. Arlaud G. Bally I. Ronjat M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The membrane topology for the RyR is not yet well defined. On the basis of hydrophobicity plots, predictions for the number of membrane spanning segments range from four (15Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) to 12 (16Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) segments. All of the published models predict an even number of membrane spanning segments. Consequently, the extreme C terminus is predicted to be cytoplasmic. The cytoplasmic localization of the extreme C terminus is supported by antibody binding studies of the RyR (29Marty L. Villaz M. Arlaud G. Bally I. Ronjat M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the IP3R (30Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. Miyawaki A. Sem. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other sites in the C-terminal domain identified as cytoplasmic include a putative regulatory site in the sequence 4489–4499 identified by antibody binding (31Chen S.R. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13414-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tryptic cleavage sites at arginine 4475 and arginine 4756 (28Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K.J.

Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we have used site-directed antibodies to derive evidence for the topological location of several segments of the ryanodine receptor, in particular in the region predicted to be membrane-associated. The differential binding of the antibodies to intact and permeabilized SR vesicles was used to assign cytoplasmic or lumenal localization. We show evidence for two lumenal segments in the C-terminal domain of the RyR and confirm the cytoplasmic localization of the C terminus. In addition, we provide evidence that the C terminus is folded in an inaccessible conformation in the native receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Vent Polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The protease inhibitor Pefabloc, restriction endonucleases and other DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. pATH vectors and Escherichia coli strain RR1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Trypsin (Type III) and the catalytic subunit of calpain II (rabbit skeletal muscle) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-TrpE antibody was obtained from Oncogene Science Inc. (Uniondale, NY) and anti-β-galactosidase antibody was obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime Inc (Boulder, CO). Anti-calsequestrin (chicken) antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Dennis O. Clegg, University of California at Santa Barbara (32Choi E.S.H. Clegg D.O. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Immobilon-P was obtained from Millipore Inc. (Bedford, MA).Preparation of Heavy SR Vesicles, Junctional Face Membranes, and Purification of Ryanodine Receptor—Heavy SR vesicles were prepared from the back and leg muscle of rabbits in the presence of protease inhibitors as described previously (33Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2365-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were rapidly frozen and stored at –80 °C and then thawed immediately prior to use. Junctional face membranes (JFM) were prepared by incubating heavy SR vesicles in 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, pelleting at 90,000 revolutions/min in a Beckman TL100.3 rotor followed by extraction of calsequestrin in 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.9 (25Costello B. Chadwick C. Saito A. Chu A. Maurer A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Purified RyR was prepared from heavy SR vesicles as described previously (12Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All preparations were carried out in the presence of 20 µm leupeptin and either 0.1 mm DIFP or 1 mM Pefabloc. Leupeptin was omitted from the final steps of purification in preparations subsequently subjected to calpain digestion.JFM and SR vesicle protein content was determined by BCA assay (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18427) Google Scholar) and purified RyR protein content by the Amido Black assay (35Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Constructs for Expression of Fusion Proteins—All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out by standard procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Fragments of the RyR1 cDNA in pBluescript vectors were prepared by antibody screening of a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library or by reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction of rabbit skeletal muscle mRNA. Clone CRC6 was provided as a generous gift by Dr. Andrew Marks, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. The trpE fusion construct pATH(2804–2930) was produced by ligation of a BglII-PstI fragment of clone CRC6, corresponding to RyR1 sequence 8539–8919, to PstI digested pATH1 (37Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Constructs pATH(4581–4640), pATH(4860–4886), and pATH(4941–5037) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of RyR1 cDNA fragments from positions 13872–14052, 14709–14790, and 14951–15245, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction primers for each sequence included additional sequences at the 5′ end to generate an EcoRI site (forward primers) or HindIII site (reverse primers) to facilitate in frame ligation to pATH10 ((4581–4640)) or pATH3 ((4860–4886), (4941–5037)). The construct pATH-(5006–5037) was prepared by digestion of the EcoRI-HindIII insert from pATH(4941–5037) with HaeIII. The gel purified 103-base pair product, corresponding to ryr1 sequence 15147–15245, was ligated to SmaI-HindIII digested vector pWR-590–2 (38Guo L.H. Stepien P.P. Tso J.Y. Brousseau R. Narang S. Thomas D.Y. Wu R. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The resulting lacZ fusion construct, pWR(5006–5037), was digested with EcoRI-HindIII and insert was ligated to EcoRI-HindIII digested pATH1. The sequences and reading frames of all the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52338) Google Scholar). The lacZ fusion construct pWR(2804–2930) was constructed by EcoRI-HindIII digestion of pATH(2804–2930) followed by ligation of the gel purified fragment into EcoRI-HindIII digested pWR-590–2. Constructs pWR(4581–4640), pWR(4860–4886), pWR-(4860–4917), and pWR(4941–5037) were similarly constructed by ligation of EcoRI-HindIII inserts from the corresponding pATH plasmids to pWR-590 (38Guo L.H. Stepien P.P. Tso J.Y. Brousseau R. Narang S. Thomas D.Y. Wu R. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of TrpE Fusions—The TrpE fusion proteins were prepared by expression in E. coli strain RR1 as described (37Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures grown in M9 + glucose media containing tryptophan were diluted 10-fold into the same media without tryptophan and then further induced after 1 h growth by the addition of 5 µg/ml indoleacrylic acid. Cells were washed in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Inclusion bodies were prepared from cultures expressing TrpE(2804–2930), TrpE(4581–4640), and TrpE(4941–5037). Cleared lysates were prepared from cultures expressing TrpE′ (no insert DNA), TrpE(4860–4886), and TrpE(5006–5037) by sonication on ice in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material at 300,000 × g for 15 min. All preparations were carried out at 4 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The identity of each expressed protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-TrpE monoclonal antibody.Gel purification of fusion proteins was carried out by preparative SDS-agarose electrophoresis (ProSieve, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The band corresponding to the fusion protein was identified by Coomassie Blue staining of a parallel lane of the gel and excised. The excised band was melted at 65 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0, frozen at –70 °C, thawed at 0 °C, and spun at 14,000 revolutions/min to remove the agarose. The supernatant containing fusion protein was concentrated with a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA).β-Galactosidase fusion proteins were prepared by expression from pWR constructs in E. coli strain MV1189. Overnight cultures of the appropriate recombinants were diluted 10-fold in LB media and grown for 2 h followed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-l-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells were washed in 10 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5 and extracted by boiling in SDS denaturing buffer. The expression of the lacZ fusion protein was confirmed by 8% SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody.Synthetic Peptides and Conjugates—Peptides corresponding to the ryrl sequences (148–162) and (4965–4979) were prepared by solid-phase synthesis by Dr. D. Klapper, University of North Carolina. The peptides were prepared with an additional N-terminal cysteine to facilitate coupling. Peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Immuno-Dynamics Inc. (La Jolla, CA).Preparation of Site-directed Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody against the entire rat skeletal muscle RyR has been previously described (40Meissner G. Rousseau E. Lai F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1715-1722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized by intramuscular injection of antigenic peptides in complete Freund’s adjuvant. When the antigens were fusion proteins, 300–800 µg of either gel-purified fusion protein or bacterial inclusion bodies containing approximately 50% of the desired fusion protein were injected. For synthetic peptide antigens, 1 mg of each keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide was injected. Booster injections were made intradermally and subcutaneously with equal amounts of protein in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant after 4–6 weeks and then at 10–14 day intervals. Antisera were collected 10–14 days post-injection.Antisera to fusion proteins were affinity purified by absorption to immobilized fusion protein by the method of Lillie and Brown (41Lillie S.H. Brown S.S. Yeast. 1987; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bacterial inclusion bodies (TrpE(2804–2930), TrpE(4581–4640), TrpE(4941–5037)) or cleared cell lysates (TrpE(4860–4886), TrpE-(5006–5037)) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (42Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44699) Google Scholar). The position of the fusion protein band was determined by staining a portion of the blot and a strip of the blot at that location was cut out from the blot. The strip was blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS and a 0.5–1-ml aliquot of antisera applied to the strip for 1–2 h at 25 °C. Nonspecific antibodies were removed by washing in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20). Bound antibodies were eluted in 0.5–1 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, which was immediately neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Antisera against synthetic peptides were affinity purified using a peptide-agarose column prepared using Sulfo-Link gel from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Approximately 10 mg of each peptide was coupled to a 2-ml column.Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SR protein samples (20–50 µg) were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min and separated in 3–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205922) Google Scholar). The following molecular mass standards (kDa) were used: myosin (205,000), β-galactosidase (116), phosphorylase b (97.4), bovine serum albumin (66), ovalbumin (45Otter T. King S.M. Witman G.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and carbonic anhydrase (29Marty L. Villaz M. Arlaud G. Bally I. Ronjat M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The proteins were either stained by the colloidal Coomassie Blue method (44Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar) or transferred to Immobilon-P membranes at 400 mA at 12 °C for 1–3 h followed by 1 A for 16 h (45Otter T. King S.M. Witman G.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk, PBS, and then incubated with specific antibodies in 1% milk dissolved in PBS-T. After washing in PBS-T, the bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG and visualized by incubation with 3,3-diaminobenzidine and H2O2.To the serial dilutions of either control or treated SR vesicles was added an equal volume of antibody solution in 2% dry milk, 25 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. In some experiments 5% normal goat serum or 50 µg/ml of cleared bacterial lysate from E. coli expressing the TrpE’ protein was included in the incubation. These additional blocking reagents resulted in a small reduction in the background of the ELISA assay but did not significantly change the results of the binding assays. The antibodies were incubated with vesicles for 12–16 h at 4 °C. Antigen-coated wells were prepared by drying 0.3 µg/well of purified RyR from deionized water in polystyrene microtiter plates (Falcon) followed by fixation with methanol. Alternatively, 5 µg/well of JFM were incubated for 3 h at 23 °C in 50 mM NaCO3, pH 9. Coated plates were blocked by incubation with 5% dry milk in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The antibodies not bound to vesicles were detected by adding 100 µl of antibody-vesicle mixture to antigen-coated microtiter wells for 2 h at 23 °C. The wells were washed thrice with PBS-T and then the antibodies bound to the wells were quantitated using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by color development with o-phenylenediamine. The dilution of each anti-RyR antibody was adjusted such that the free antibody concentration in the absence of added vesicles produced a signal of approximately 0.05–0.10 OD(490 nm), within the linear range for detection with the antigen-coated plate. The fraction of free antibody was calculated as the ratio of OD(490 nm) for antibody incubated with and without SR vesicles.Calpain II Digestion of Purified RyR—Calpain II digestions were carried out in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium PIPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 4 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µm pepstatin, 0.1 µm aprotinin at 23 °C. Calpain II (1 unit/ml) was preactivated by incubation for 10 min at 0 °C in 1 mM Ca2+ before addition of purified RyR (100 µg/ml). Reactions were terminated after 0–60 min by the addition of 100 µm leupeptin and excess EGTA. The preparation of rabbit muscle calpain used in this study (Sigma) had a specific activity of 20 units/mg protein. In addition to the 80-kDa catalytic subunit of calpain II, the enzyme preparation exhibited significant contamination by a protein at ~95 kDa.Trypsin Digestion of Heavy SR Vesicles—SR vesicles were incubated with trypsin at varying SR protein/trypsin ratios in 0.3 M sucrose, 1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM potassium PIPES, pH 7.0, for 30 min at 23 °C. The digestion was stopped by addition of 1.01 volume of 100 mM Pefabloc, 200 µm aprotinin, 200 µm leupeptin, 15 mM EGTA. The digested vesicles were then pretreated with 0.1% CHAPS or at pH 8.5 for 10 min at 23 °C followed by incubation with antibodies as described above at a final concentration of 300 µg/ml SR protein. The unbound antibody was detected as above. Parallel aliquots of trypsin-digested vesicles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.RESULTSPreparation and Characterization of Site-directed Antibodies—The analysis of membrane protein topology based on antibody binding relies on the specificity of the antibodies used. For this study, polyclonal antibodies were raised against peptides whose sequences were identical to segments of the deduced amino acid sequence of the rabbit skeletal muscle RyR (15Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The antigenic peptides used in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The peptide sequences were selected as potential antigens based on the predicted location of transmembrane segments (16Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each sequence has a high calculated surface probability and antigenic index according to the algorithms of Emini et al. (46Emini E. Hughes J. Perlow D. Boger J. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Jameson and Wolf (47Jameson B.A. Wolf H. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Each antibody was affinity purified by absorption with the appropriate peptide antigen. Ab(4941–5037) was further purified to higher specificity by absorption to fusion protein TrpE(5006–5037) to give Ab(5006–5037).The peptide-directed antibodies specifically recognize the RyR as indicated by immunoblot analysis of SR proteins (Fig. 2). The regional specificity of the antibodies was evaluated by examining their reactivity with other RyR fusion proteins and proteolytic fragments of the RyR. Four antibodies raised against TrpE fusion proteins (Ab(2804–2930), Ab(4860–4886), Ab(4941–5037), and Ab(5006–5037)) and anti-peptide antibody Ab(4965–4979) reacted specifically on immunoblots with β-galactosidase fusion proteins expressing the cognate RyR sequence (data not shown).Fig. 2Immunoblot analysis of site-directed antibodies. SR vesicles (10 µg/lane) were solubilized in SDS denaturing buffer, separated on 3"
https://openalex.org/W1986867749,"Phospholipase Cγ-catalyzed inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, a critical step in B cell antigen receptor signaling leading to second messenger generation and proliferation, depends upon tyrosine kinase activation. The B cell antigen receptor-associated tyrosine kinases p53/56lyn, p59fyn, p55blk, and p72syk are assumed to participate in receptor-initiated signaling. It is unknown, however, which of these kinases is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation and resulting activation of phospholipase Cγ in response to antigen receptor cross-linking. We have used a fusion protein containing the tandem src homology-2 (SH2) domains of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) to identify B cell kinases which associate with PLCγ1. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we demonstrate SH2-dependent association of tyrosine kinase activity from anti-μ-stimulated B cells. The PLCγ1 SH2 domains associate with a prominent 70-72-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein from anti-μ-stimulated, but not resting, B cells. Immunoblotting and secondary immunoprecipitation studies definitively identify this protein as p72syk. These results imply a physical interaction between PLCγ1 and p72syk in antigen receptor-stimulated B cells. This conclusion is confirmed by our ability to co-immunoprecipitate p72syk and PLCγ1 from lysates of anti-μ-stimulated B cells. These results implicate p72syk in the activation of phospholipase Cγ1 during B cell antigen receptor signaling."

Lysine residues in proteins such as hemoglobin have been implicated as target structures for acetaldehyde adducts resulting from ethanol consumption. Although the presence of both stable and unstable acetaldehyde-hemoglobin adducts has been established, the structural characterization of the adducts has received relatively little attention. As a model for such adduct formation, we studied the peptide pentalysine in vitro. Pentalysine has several potential sites for adduct formation. The amino-terminal amine group as well as the ∈-amine groups of each lysine side chain can serve as potential sites for modification by acetaldehyde.

The development of more effective forms of treatment for alcohol use and abuse has been hampered by the lack of a firm biochemical basis with which to explain the observed physiological conditions pertaining to alcoholism. A large step toward understanding the relevant biochemistry occurred with the discovery that hemoglobin and other proteins react with acetaldehyde, the major oxidation product of ethanol in vivo, to form a number of stable and labile protein-acetaldehyde adducts (1Stevens V.J.

Res. 1981; 6: 260-266Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These adducts not only have been implicated in some of the resulting complications of alcoholism but also may serve as useful markers of ethanol intake (3Halvorson M.R. Noffsinger J.K. Peterson C.M.

The posttranslational modification of proteins has been recognized as playing a role in the subsequent pathology of many diseases. For example, cyanate, from the breakdown of urea in persons in renal failure, can lead to neuropathy associated with demyelination and protein carbamylation (8Peterson C.M. Tsairis P. Ohnishi A. Lu Y.S. Grady R. Cerami A. Dyck P.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1974; 81: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Complications of diabetes mellitus have been attributed to nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins (9Monnier V.M. The Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes, and Nutrition. Alan R. Lis, New York1989: 1-22Google Scholar). Glycation of hemoglobin in diabetes has been shown extensively and provides a useful clinical marker of glucose control (10Koenig R.J. Peterson C.M. Jones R.L. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 295: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Maillard products also have been implicated in the aging process (9Monnier V.M. The Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes, and Nutrition. Alan R. Lis, New York1989: 1-22Google Scholar). Recent experiments indicate that acetaldehyde forms stable adducts with several biomolecules including hemoglobin (11Nguyen L.B. Peterson C.M. Collins M.A. Aldehyde Adducts in Alcoholism. Alan R. Lis, New York1985Google Scholar), plasma proteins and albumin (12Donohue Jr., T.M. Tuma D.J. Sorrell M.F. Arch. Biochem.

The clinical use of these potential markers of ethanol exposure and their pathological implications would be aided by a complete structural characterization of the putative protein-acetaldehyde adducts. Tuma et al. (20Tuma D.J. Newman M.R. Donohue Jr., T.M. Sorrell M.F. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1987; 11: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) used [14C]acetaldehyde in reactions with proteins such as albumin and polylysine. The radiolabeled hydrolysis products contained similar ratios of stable to unstable adducts for both albumin and polylysine, suggesting that lysine was the primary residue involved in acetaldehyde binding in vivo. Ding and co-workers (21Ding A. Ojingwa J.C. McDonagh A.F. Burlingame A.L. Benet L.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3797-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) showed that lysine residues of serum albumin were the positions where modification by tolmetin glucuronide formed stable adducts via an imine intermediate. Also using 14C-labeled acetaldehyde adducts of hemoglobin, San George and Hoberman (22San George R.C. Hoberman H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6811-6821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that a tetrahedral imidazolidinone derivative was formed for nonborohydride-reducible adducts. Additional experimental evidence suggests, however, that several different adducts may be formed in addition to the imidazolidinone structure (23Gross M.D. Hays R. Gapstur S.M. Chaussee M. Potter J.D. Alcohol Alcohol. 1994; 29: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar). A complete structural analysis of acetaldehyde adducts similar to those thought to form in vivo has not been undertaken. We therefore initiated structural studies with a model compound, pentalysine. Chemicals—Pentalysine was purchased from Bachem Bioscience. Cyclohexanedione (CHD) 1The abbreviations used are: CHDcyclohexanedioneHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometry was purchased from Aldrich. [1,2-13C]Acetaldehyde was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). NMR solvents were obtained from Aldrich. Materials were used as received from the manufacturer with no additional purification except where noted. cyclohexanedione high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry Purification of Pentalysine—The model peptide pentalysine was purified first by passing the compound through a C18 Bond-Elut Pak with 10% acetonitrile, followed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The solvent system consisted of acetonitrile and water in a linear gradient from 10 to 60% acetonitrile over 15 min. Acetic acid (0.1%) was added to aid peak resolution. Determination of Acetaldehyde Concentration—Acetaldehyde concentration was determined using the method of Peterson and Polizzi (24Peterson C.M. Polizzi C. Alcohol. 1987; 4: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the procedure of Stahovec and Mopper (25Stahovec W.L. Mopper K. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 298: 399-406Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for quantification of aldehydes. A 1-ml solution of peptide (1 mm) was incubated with 1.5, 5, or 8 mm acetaldehyde for 1 h at 37 °C. Residual free acetaldehyde was removed by ultrafiltration in 3 volumes of 1.5 ml of H2O and a YC05 500 Mr cutoff membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) prior to analysis. CHD solution was prepared by dissolving 400 mg of 1,3-cyclohexanedione, 10 g of NH4COOCH3, and 3.2 ml of concentrated HCl in 30 ml of H2O. Contaminants were removed by heating the solution in a sealed bottle at 70 °C for 1 h and passing the cooled solution through a Cl8 Bond-Elut cartridge (Analytichem, Harbor City, CA). The CHD reagent was calibrated with acetaldehyde by the measurement of prepared acetaldehyde standards as follows. 1 ml of cleaned reagent was added to 1 ml of varying concentrations of acetaldehyde (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 8, or 16 μΜ) in a 1.5-ml screw cap centrifuge tube (Sarstedt) and allowed to react for 1 h at 70 °C. The reaction was stopped by placing the sample in an ice bath until analyzed by HPLC. Chromatography was performed on a Gilson system equipped with a 250 × 4.6-mm C-18 column (ultrasphere ODS) and pellicular guard. Chromatograms were obtained by isocratic elution with H2O/acetonitrile (70:30) (v/v) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peaks were detected by measurement of fluorescence with a 305–395-nm excitation filter and a 450 ± 3.5-nm emission filter. Peak integration was accomplished with a Gilson system 715 peak integrator. Results were read as micromolar acetaldehyde as determined from the standard curve of acetaldehyde concentrations. Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray ionization spectra were obtained using a mass spectrometer (SX505, JEOL, Peabody, MA) equipped with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) electrospray apparatus. A minimum mass of 2000 atomic mass units was used. Each sample (see above) was diluted 1:1 with acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (75:25:1). For some spectra, direct injection onto the mass spectrometer was used, bypassing the liquid chromatography apparatus. Α 2-μl injection of sample was eluted into a 600 μl/min stream of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (75:25:1) split 150:1 into the electrospray interface. Drying gas was maintained at 200 °C. Data were acquired over a range of 100–600 atomic mass units with a scan threshold of 50 atomic mass units. Fast atom bombardment spectra were obtained on a model HX110 mass spectrometer with forward geometry and a double focusing 6-kV xenon primary beam and an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Scans from 0 to 2200 atomic mass units were made in 18 s. Additional electrospray ionization spectra were obtained on a model SX102 mass spectrometer with a source-accelerating voltage of 5 kV, a reverse geometry double focusing mass spectrometer, and a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The sample was diluted 1:1 with H2O/methanol and 2% acetic acid. The ion source was operated at room temperature. Nitrogen drying gas was heated to 180 °C and introduced at a flow rate of 5 liters/min. Tandem MS/MS spectra were obtained by infusing the sample in electrospray ionization solvent (acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (75:25:1)) at 1 μl/min. Doubly charged precursor ions were selected and attenuated to approximately one-third of the original abundance by the addition of helium to the collision cell. Linked scans were accomplished by dividing the accelerating voltage by 2 so that the doubly charged ions had a total of 10 kV of kinetic energy. NMR Spectroscopy—Proton-decoupled 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker AC-300 spectrometer operating at a spectral frequency of 75.47 MHz and a temperature of 25 °C. A 45° pulse and 5-s delay between acquisitions were used at a resolution of 1.1 Hz/point. Water with 5% D2O was used as solvent. A total of 6500 scans was acquired for each peptide sample, and 98 scans were acquired for the acetaldehyde sample. Chemical shifts were reported based on an internal reference of N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide. Raman Spectroscopy—Raman spectra were acquired using a Spex 1401 double monochromator (Metuchen) equipped with 1000-μm slits, a coherent argon ion laser tuned to 514.5 nm, and an average of 80 scans/sample. All spectra were obtained on neat sample or aqueous solution in glass capillary tubes. Both acetaldehyde-treated and nontreated peptides were analyzed to provide a basis for comparison. Acetaldehyde Concentration—Acetaldehyde from pentalysine adducts stable to ultrafiltration conditions (see “Materials and Methods”) was quantified by the fluorimetric assay. The sample prepared with 0 mm acetaldehyde contained no measurable CHD-reactive acetaldehyde, the sample prepared with 1.5 mm acetaldehyde was determined to contain 0.95 mm CHD-reactive acetaldehyde, and the 5 and 8 mm samples were both determined to contain 3.3 mm CHD-reactive acetaldehyde. Incubation acetaldehyde concentration versus concentration of recovered acetaldehyde after adduct formation and ultrafiltration is demonstrated in Fig. 1. The relationship between added acetaldehyde and recovered acetaldehyde is linear for all acetaldehyde concentrations except the highest value (8 mm), indicating that no additional sites on the pentalysine molecule are modified with the higher concentrations of acetaldehyde. Moss Spectrometry—When a 1.5:1 mole ratio of acetaldehyde to peptide was used, a monoadduct is observed (data not shown). Likewise, the mass spectrum of the model peptide pentalysine following incubation with 20 μΜ acetaldehyde showed a single acetaldehyde adduct at a mass of 684 atomic mass units. However, when an excess of acetaldehyde was used, the number of adducts observed increased. For the 8:1 mole ratio acetaldehyde/peptide mixture, five different adducts are observed with masses of 684, 710, 736, 762, and 788 atomic mass units. The difference in mass in each case indicates a structure consistent with a Schiff base (a difference of 26 atomic mass units as shown in Fig. 2, peaks A–E). Of particular interest is the decreasing relative abundance of adduct with the increasing number of Schiff base adducts/molecule. In the sample shown, 40% of the peptide sample molecules have at least 1 acetaldehyde adduct, approximately 25% of the sample molecules have at least 2 adducts, 20% of the molecules have at least 3 adducts, and less than 10% of the sample molecules have 4 or 5 adducts. Tandem MS/MS spectra were obtained to ascertain the point(s) of acetaldehyde adduct formation (Table I). For these experiments, pentalysine-acetaldehyde adducts were generated by the addition of acetaldehyde in an 8:1 mole ratio (acetaldehyde to peptide). The pattern of y- and b-type fragment ions (y4 + 26 and b1 + 26 atomic mass units) is strongly suggestive of modification at the first and second positions at the amino terminus of the peptide. Weak b and y fragments for residues 3, 4, and 5 suggest but do not confirm the presence of modifications on those side chains.Table IObserved ion fragments from MS/MS analysis based on theoretical calculations of expected fragmentsResidueb ionb ion adducty″ iony″ ion adduct1129.10155.08147.112257.20282.97275.213385.29403.30429.414513.39531.40557.375641.48659.49 Open table in a new tab NMR Spectroscopy—In order to confirm the Schiff base structure, [1,2-13C]acetaldehyde was used to generate adducts with pentalysine. NMR spectra of the peptide-acetaldehyde adduct show the presence of signals at 155-156 ppm consistent with Schiff base structures between the lysine side chain amino groups and the 13C-labeled acetaldehyde. Comparison of the spectra of acetaldehyde alone to the peptide-acetaldehyde adduct shows that the aldehyde resonance at 202 ppm disappears, and the resonances at 155-156 ppm appear in the adduct sample (see Fig. 3), consistent with a Schiff base product. Raman Spectroscopy—The Raman spectra were obtained to provide further proof of the imine structure (Fig. 4). The spectrum shows a strong peak at approximately 1640 cm−1. This peak is consistent with literature values for imine C=N structures (26Sandorfy C. Patai S. The Chemistry of the Carbon-Nitrogen Double Bond. Interscienc, New York1970Google Scholar). The peak at approximately 1450 cm−1 is presumably due to C-H deformation modes that originate from all amino acid residues (27Lord R.C. Yu N.-T. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 50: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Our study confirms a Schiff base adduct of pentalysine and acetaldehyde that is stable to our preparative and analytical procedures. The identification of stable Schiff bases in bioactive molecules is currently of great interest, and the role of the imine is often critical to bioactivity (21Ding A. Ojingwa J.C. McDonagh A.F. Burlingame A.L. Benet L.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3797-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22San George R.C. Hoberman H.D. J. Biol.

For example, enzyme-substrate intermediates such as that formed between porphobilinogen synthase and 5-aminolevulinic acid incorporate a Schiff base linkage that is stable to analysis (30Jaffe E.K. Markham G.D. Rajagopalan J.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8345-8350Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although much interest in the structural features of acetaldehyde-blood protein adducts has been expressed in the literature, attention has generally focused on borohydride-reduced adducts. This approach is due in part to the complicated chemistry of acetaldehyde adduct formation. Several possibilities for subsequent reaction after initial adduct formation exist (31Tuma D.J. Sorrell M.F. Collins M.A. Acetaldehyde Adducts in Alcoholism. Alan R. Lis, New York1985: 3-17Google Scholar). For example, after Schiff base formation, subsequent reaction with another reactive group such as a thiol can result in addition across the double bond to form a stable product. Either inter- or intramolecular cross-linking of protein chains via acetaldehyde adducts can occur, although this would occur through a different mechanism from the Amadori rearrangement of glycated proteins (31Tuma D.J. Sorrell M.F. Collins M.A. Acetaldehyde Adducts in Alcoholism. Alan R. Lis, New York1985: 3-17Google Scholar). Other reaction schemes are possible; suggestions have been made that at least two different types of acetaldehyde adducts are formed at the amino termini of proteins and digest peptides (23Gross M.D. Hays R. Gapstur S.M. Chaussee M. Potter J.D. Alcohol Alcohol. 1994; 29: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar). Our study supports the formation of stable Schiff bases with lysine residues at physiological as well as superphysiological concentrations of acetaldehyde. Additional studies of the model peptide incorporated acetaldehyde in a physiologically relevant (20 μΜ) concentration. Mass spectra obtained with electrospray ionization and fast atom bombardment techniques showed a single acetaldehyde-peptide adduct (mass, 684 atomic mass units; native peptide, 658 atomic mass units) with relative peak heights in a ratio of 11:1 for the native peptide versus adduct (data not shown). The spectrum of the 1.5:1 mole ratio acetaldehyde-peptide showed a monoadduct (mass, 684 atomic mass units) as well, with relative peak heights of native peptide to adduct of 1:1.3. The mass difference between native and adduct molecules in both cases is consistent with a Schiff base between an amine and acetaldehyde. None of the data are consistent with cross-linking of the peptide adducts even at the highest concentrations of acetaldehyde used to generate adducts. Mass spectra show no masses consistent with fragments from either intra- or interpeptide cross-linking. In addition, the modified peptide chromatographs as a single peak on a C-18 reversed phase column, where cross-linking of some of the molecules would change chromatographic behavior sufficiently to generate an additional peak (data not shown). The identification of these Schiff base adducts has several implications for the study of ethanol oxidation products in vivo. We have demonstrated that stable Schiff bases can occur between acetaldehyde and amino acids such as lysine. The spectroscopic data presented here suggest that these Schiff bases are stable, preferred structures for adduct formation in systems such as our model peptide. We cannot eliminate the possibility of the subsequent formation of a structure consistent with that proposed by San George and Hoberman (22San George R.C. Hoberman H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6811-6821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the α-amino terminus of the peptide. When San George and Hoberman generated acetaldehyde adducts of hemoglobin peptides and other model peptides, they used longer incubation periods (72 h) than we used in our experiments (1 h). In addition, they used higher concentrations of reactants for incubation (up to 100 mm acetaldehyde with 6 mm peptide) than were used in the present study. San George and Hoberman noted in their proposed mechanism for formation of the detected imidazolidinone adducts that a Schiff base intermediate product would be formed. The absence of Schiff base adducts in the final reaction mixture after purification would lead to the conclusion that any Schiff base structures formed were rapidly converted into the imidazolidinone derivatives. In addition, the high concentration (45 mm) of acetaldehyde used might have generated cross-linking in the globin chains during the incubation. In the generation of adducts for the present study, samples were exposed to 37 °C temperatures only for the length of incubation (1 h). After incubation, the sample was stored at 4 °C prior to spectroscopic analysis. The stability of the Schiff base acetaldehyde-pentalysine adducts suggests that some of the deleterious effects of acetaldehyde after ethanol consumption may be linked to stable Schiff base alterations in the structures of biologically important molecules. These structural changes may in turn affect the conformational properties of the protein or other bioactive molecules, thereby disrupting function in vivo. The biological picture of acetaldehyde-protein adducts is a complicated one. Although the existence of stable Schiff base acetaldehyde-lysine adducts has been established here, it is not expected that these are the only adducts formed in vivo. Therefore, we plan to extend our analysis to blood proteins such as hemoglobin and albumin in order to determine the structural alterations of these molecules after reaction with acetaldehyde. The demonstration of Schiff base adducts with lysine and acetaldehyde supports the use of the CHD-based fluorimetric assay as a measure of quantifying drinking behavior. The conditions of the assay (low pH, 70 °C) would be expected to facilitate the CHD reaction with Schiff base-derived acetaldehyde in whole blood. The acetaldehyde measured in our assay must be either free in the blood or it must be labile enough to be liberated during the assay. Therefore, it is less likely that we are measuring acetaldehyde from such structures as the imidazolidinone, although these structures may in fact be present in the blood sample. The CHD fluorimetric assay has proven useful in discriminating between ethanol-consuming and -nonconsuming mice, pigs, and humans (32Peterson C.M. Alcohol. 1993; 10: 327-332Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In summary, our observations documenting that relatively stable Schiff base adducts occur following incubation of acetaldehyde with pentalysine in vitro are consistent with site and concentration specificity of these reactions. Further studies of larger molecules both in vitro and in vivo should provide insight into the molecular pathology of acetaldehyde-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2026393575,"In the present study, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) catalyzed esterification of oxysterols was investigated by using discoidal bilayer particles (DBP) containing various oxysterols, phosphatidylcholines, and apolipoprotein A-I. The esterified oxysterols were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry. LCAT esterified all oxysterols tested that are known to be present in human plasma. The esterification yields in almost all cases were relatively high, often as high as the yield of cholesterol esterification. When DBP preparations containing 27-hydroxycholesterol and various phosphatidylcholines were used for the LCAT reaction, both monoesters and diesters were produced. The mass spectrometry analysis showed that the monoester was produced by the esterification of the 3β-hydroxyl group and not the 27-hydroxyl group. The diesters were apparently produced by the esterification of the 27-hydroxyl group only after the esterification of the 3β-hydroxyl group. Phosphatidylcholine containing a saturated acyl group at sn-1 position and an unsaturated acyl group at sn-2 position gave generally high esterification yield. The esterification of various oxysterols was compared by using DBP containing dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine and individual oxysterols. All oxysterols produced 3β-oleoyl monoesters. Unlike 27-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, or cholestanetriol did not produce diesters. Various factors influencing the formation of the monoesters and diesters from 27-hydroxycholesterol were investigated. When dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine was used as the acyl donor, prolonged dialysis of DBP preparations and increase in the ratio of the enzyme concentration to substrate particle concentration increased the diester formation. Significant amounts of diesters were also produced by using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine and other phosphatidylcholines as the acyl donors. By analyzing the conditions of monoester and diester formation, a scheme for the LCAT reaction pathway was proposed."

In the presence of MgATP the 110-kDa protein incorporated phosphate into itself and into the heavy chain, but not the light chain, of MyoD. Phosphorylation to 0.5 mol of Pi/mol increased the MyoD actin-activated MgATPase rate from 0.2 to 3 μmol/min/mg.

Autophosphorylation to 1 mol of Pi/mol enhanced the rate at which the 110-kDa protein kinase phosphorylated MyoD by 40-fold. The rate of autophosphorylation was strongly dependent on the 110-kDa protein kinase concentration, indicating an intermolecular reaction. Synthetic peptides of 9-11 residues corresponding to the heavy chain phosphorylation site of Acanthamoeba myosin IC and the homologous sites in Dictyostelium myosin IB (MyoB) and MyoD were poor substrates for the 110-kDa protein kinase.

INTRODUCTIONMyosins comprise a superfamily of motor proteins characterized by a conserved amino-terminal ∽80-kDa head domain that binds to actin filaments in an ATP-dependent manner. Phylogenetic analysis based on a sequence comparison of the head domains divides the currently known myosins into at least nine classes (1Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Cheney R.E. Riley M.A. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The members of the myosin I class are single-headed and have been identified in organisms ranging from amoebae to mammals. Myosin I isozymes are monomeric and do not assemble into filaments but have non-helical tail domains that can interact with phospholipids and, in some cases, actin filaments in an ATP-independent manner (3Hammer III, J.A.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Five genes coding for myosin I isozymes (myoA-E) have so far been identified in the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and the complete sequences of four of these isozymes (A, B, D, and E) have been reported (6Titus M.A. Warrick H.M.

Acta. 1993; 1173: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests additional Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes probably also exist (8Jung G. Fukui Y. Martin B.

The myosin I isozymes from Dictyostelium can be divided into two subfamilies; MyoB,1 1The abbreviations used are: MyoA-EDictyostelium myosins IA-IETesN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MyoC, and MyoD have heavy chains of ∽125 kDa in size (7Jung G. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Hammer III, J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), while MyoA and MyoE are smaller with heavy chains of ∽115 kDa (6Titus M.A. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Cell Reg. 1989; 1: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Urrutia R.A. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The tail regions of MyoB, MyoC, and MyoD contain a basic domain (TH1) at the head/tail junction that is implicated in membrane binding (12Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a domain consisting of a repetitive GPX motif (TH2) that is responsible for ATP-independent actin binding (11Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and a domain with homology to SH3 domains (TH3) (14Hammer III, J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 50-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The shorter MyoA and MyoE tails consist of only the TH1 membrane-binding domain.It has been proposed that the Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes may be involved in vesicle movement and in the extension and contraction of pseudopods and filopodia (16Fath K.R. Burgess D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Coudrier E. Durrbach A. Louvard D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent studies have shown that MyoB, MyoC, and MyoD are localized mainly in the actin-rich regions at the leading edge of migrating cells (8Jung G. Fukui Y. Martin B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Fukui Y. Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) but similar studies for MyoA and MyoE have not yet been performed. Attempts have been made to directly ascertain the role of the myosin I isozymes by analysis of cells in which myosin I genes have been rendered nonfunctional by homologous recombination. Cells lacking a functional myoA or myoB gene exhibit normal morphology and can complete development but display subtle abnormalities including slower translocation rates, an increase in the frequency of turning and lateral pseudopod formation and a slight delay in chemotactic aggregation (19Titus M.A. Wessels D. Spudich J.A. Soll D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. J.

Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A preliminary analysis of MyoD null cells similarly did not reveal any striking behavorial defects (8Jung G. Fukui Y. Martin B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation of these results is that there is considerable functional overlap between the multiple Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes, so that deletion of any one isozyme has only a minimal effect on cellular processes.At present, little is known concerning the mechanisms that regulate the motile activities of the Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes in vivo. Some evidence is available, though, to suggest that heavy chain phosphorylation, which stimulates the actin-activated MgATPase activity of the Acanthamoeba myosin I isozymes (22Maruta H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8329-8332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Miyata H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19333-19339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is required for these enzymes to support movement in in vitro motility assays (24Albanesi J.P. Fujisaki H. Hammer III, J.A. Korn E.D. Jones R. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8649-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zot H.G. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), may also play a role in regulating the properties of some of the Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes. The strongest direct evidence is derived from a study showing that the purified Acanthamoeba myosin I heavy chain kinase (26Hammer III, J.A. Albanesi J.P. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10168-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can stimulate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of one of the Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes (27Cô té G.P. Albanesi J.P. Ueno T. Hammer III, J.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4543-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (later identified as MyoB (8Jung G. Fukui Y. Martin B. Hammer III, J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The studies described in this paper were undertaken in order to identify and isolate an endogenous Dictyostelium factor that could promote the actin-activated MgATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin I. By assaying fractions for their ability to stimulate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD we have purified a protein with a molecular mass of 110 kDa that displays intrinsic protein kinase activity, is activated by autophosphorylation, and phosphorylates the MyoD heavy chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsATP (grade I), Tes, diisopropylfluorophosphate, bovine serum albumin, and histone 2A were obtained from Sigma; pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain were supplied by Peptides International; and okadaic acid was from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP was from DuPont NEN. The PC9 peptide was a gift from H. Brzeska (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and the MyoB peptide was a gift from M. A. L. Atkinson (University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler, TX). Dictyostelium myosin II (28Cô té G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle actin (29Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously.Purification of Dictyostelium Myosin I IsozymesMyoD and MyoB were purified as described previously (30Lee S.F. Cô té G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the actin-MyoD precipitate was resolubilized in 0.25 M KCl, 4 mM MgATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tes, pH 7.5. Soluble material obtained following centrifugation was immediately loaded onto an FPLC Mono S HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotech Inc.) and eluted with a 30-ml linear KCl gradient (0.25-0.55 M). The peak of MyoD activity was pooled, dialyzed against 30% glycerol, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tes, pH 7.5, and stored at −20°C. Under these conditions MyoD was stable in terms of enzymatic activity and SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) profile for several months. The MyoD was routinely >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 6A) and displayed a K+EDTA-ATPase of 0.5 μmol/min/mg when assayed as described (30Lee S.F. Cô té G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MgATPase activity of the MyoD used in these studies was in the range of 0.06-0.07 μmol/min/mg and increased to no more than 0.20 μmol/min/mg in the presence of 10 μM F-actin.Purification of the 110-kDa Protein KinaseApproximately 200 g of D. discoideum AX-3 was grown and harvested as described (32Medley Q.G. Lee S.F. Cô té G.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All subsequent procedures were performed at 0-4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of extraction buffer consisting of 12 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 mM Tes, pH 7.5, and disrupted by 20 strokes in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer (Kontes). Diisopropylfluorophosphate and solid KCl were then added to give final concentrations of 1 and 100 mM, respectively. The homogenate was stirred for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman type Ti-60 rotor). The clear supernatant was collected, diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer A (1 mM EGTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Tes, pH 7.5), adjusted to pH 7.5 with 1 M Tris, pH 11, and mixed with 200 ml of packed P-11 phosphocellulose (Whatman BioSystems) previously equilibrated with Buffer A containing 40 mM KCl. The slurry was gently stirred for 2 h, packed into a 5-cm diameter column, washed extensively with Buffer A containing 40 mM KCl and 0.4 mM ATP, and eluted using a 1.5-liter linear KCl gradient (0.04-0.85 M) in Buffer A containing 0.4 mM ATP (Fig. 1). Fractions were assayed for the ability to stimulate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD (as described below), and the most active fractions, eluting at a KCl concentration of 0.2 M, were pooled. The pooled material was immediately applied to a 2.5 × 4-cm column of hydroxylapatite HT (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 5% sucrose, 0.15 M KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM KPO4, pH 7.0. The column was washed extensively with equilibration buffer and eluted with a 200-ml linear KPO4 gradient (0.002-0.3 M, pH 7.0) in the equilibration buffer (Fig. 2). The peak of activity eluting at 50 mM KPO4 was pooled, dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of 5% sucrose, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and loaded onto an FPLC Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with the same buffer. After extensive washing with the equilibration buffer the column was eluted with a 35-ml linear KCl gradient (0.04-0.2 M) (Fig. 3). The most active fractions, eluting at 0.13 M KCl, were immediately pooled and stored in liquid nitrogen in 50-μl aliquots.Figure 1:Phosphocellulose chromatography of the initial high speed supernatant. A high speed supernatant obtained from 200 g wet weight packed Dictyostelium was chromatographed over a phosphocellulose P-11 column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The flow rate was 80 ml/h and fractions of 13 ml were collected. The presence of ATP in the column buffer required that the elution of protein be monitored using the Bradford assay (...). Salt concentration was determined by conductivity measurements (Δ). Aliquots of 2 μl from every second fraction were assayed for the ability to stimulate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD (.) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The basal actin-activated MgATPase of the MyoD used in these experiments was 0.15 μmol/min/mg. In the absence of added MyoD, none of the column fractions displayed significant actin-activated MgATPase activity.

Aliquots of 1 μl taken from 10 × diluted fractions were assayed for the ability to activate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD (.) as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

Unless stated otherwise, actin-activated MgATPase assays were performed in the same buffer with 10 μM F-actin. Assays were carried out for 20 min at 25°C and ATPase activity was measured by the release of 32Pi from the [γ-32P]ATP (33Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays designed to measure the ability of fractions to stimulate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD were performed as follows. First, the fractions were dialyzed against 20 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 mM Tes, pH 7.5, by spotting 10-μl samples of the fractions onto a 0.025-micron type VS filter (Millipore) floating on the dialysis solution. After 1 h an aliquot of the dialyzed sample was removed and added to a tube containing 10 μl of 0.25 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 nM okadaic acid, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mM Tes, pH 7.0. In most cases a preincubation for 20 min at 25°C was performed and then a 10-μl sample of MyoD (0.5-1 μM) was added and incubation allowed to proceed for another 20 min at 25°C. At the end of this time 180 μl of MgATPase buffer containing actin was added and the MgATPase rate determined as described above. The volume of the column fractions to be assayed was chosen so that the most active fraction always produced less than the maximum possible MyoD actin-activated MgATPase (∽3 μmol/min/mg). Specific activities were determined by varying the length of time (from 1 to 20 min) that MyoD was incubated with the fractions. A linear relationship between the time of incubation and the percent enhancement of the MyoD actin-activated MgATPase activity was observed so long as MyoD was stimulated to less than 50% of its maximal activity. This result indicates that addition of the actin-containing MgATPase assay buffer essentially terminated further activation of MyoD. Activities determined by this assay are presented in units, with 1 unit being arbitrarily defined as the activity required to cause a 100% increase in the basal actin-activated MgATPase rate of MyoD.Protein Kinase and Phosphoamino Acid AssaysAssays were carried out by addition of substrate to an equal volume of 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tes, pH 7.0, and 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mol) followed by addition of the 110-kDa protein kinase to initiate the reaction. Kinase and substrate concentrations for each experiment are provided in the figure and table legends. When substrate concentrations were varied, the final ionic strength was kept constant by addition of the appropriate buffer. Autophosphorylation of the 110-kDa protein kinase was performed by diluting the kinase into 2 volumes of 0.4 mM [γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mol), 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15 mM Tes, pH 7.0. All reactions were performed at 25°C. Protein phosphorylation or autophosphorylation activities were determined by removing aliquots of 10-20 μl from the assays at time intervals and immediately adding them to a one-fifth volume of boiling hot SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 30% sucrose, 2.5%β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the gel stained with Coomassie Blue and the appropriate protein band excised and counted in liquid scintillation fluid in a scintillation counter. Kinase activity assays were carried out such that less than 0.1 mol of Pi was incorporated per mole of protein. Under these conditions the incorporation of 32P into substrate was linear with time and proportional to the amount of kinase. Phosphate incorporation into the synthetic peptides was determined by spotting 10-μl aliquots of the assay mixture onto squares of P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) that were then washed in 0.1% phosphoric acid as described (34Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed essentially as described (35Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).Renaturation Following SDS-PAGEThe 110-kDa protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and renatured in the polyacrylamide gel following incubation in 6 M guanidine HCl as described (36Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The gel was then equilibrated in 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM Tes, pH 7.5, and incubated for 1 h at 25°C in 3 ml of the same buffer containing 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (200 Ci/mol). Radioactivity was removed by washing the gel extensively in 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography.Miscellaneous MethodsProtein concentrations were determined by the colorimetric assay of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). In some cases the concentrations of MyoD and the 110-kDa protein kinase were determined following SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, scanned at 596 nm using a laser densitometer (LKB 2202 Ultro), and the areas of the peaks calculated. For both methods bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. For autoradiography dried gels and thin layer sheets were exposed at −80°C to x-ray Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.) with an intensifying screen (Du Pont, Cronex Lightning Plus).RESULTSPurification of a 110-kDa Protein That Stimulates the Actin-activated MgATPase Activity of MyoDAs isolated, MyoD displays an actin-activated MgATPase activity of less than 0.2 μmol/min/mg, which is considerably below the 2-8 μmol/min/mg actin-activated MgATPase rates reported for other Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes (23Lynch T.J.

Initial experiments in which MyoD was incubated with crude Dictyostelium homogenates were unsuccessful in detecting any stimulation of the MyoD actin-activated MgATPase activity. The crude homogenates exhibited a high background level of actin-activated MgATPase activity (perhaps resulting from the presence of myosin II) that tended to obscure any activity contributed by the added MyoD. However, following chromatography over a phosphocellulose P-11 column fractions that were capable of stimulating the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD were readily detected (Fig. 1). Control assays demonstrated that the column fractions alone displayed negligible actin-activated MgATPase activity and that the observed activity was dependent on the addition of both MyoD and actin. The most active column fractions were capable of stimulating the actin-activated MgATPase of MyoD greater than 10-fold, to a rate approaching 2.5 μmol/min/mg. It should be noted that in order to obtain this high degree of activation it was found necessary to preincubate the column fractions with MgATP prior to the addition of MyoD.The pooled material from the phosphocellulose column was subsequently chromatographed over a hydroxylapatite column (Fig. 2) and then a Mono Q column (Fig. 3). In both cases single peaks of an activity capable of greatly stimulating the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD were obtained. An SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions collected throughout the purification procedure (Fig. 4) indicated that the hydroxylapatite pool consisted primarily of two proteins with molecular masses of 110 and 55 kDa (Fig. 4, lane d). Chromatography over Mono Q removed the 55-kDa protein, which eluted in the flow-through, while the 110-kDa protein bound to the column and eluted with those fractions capable of stimulating the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD (Fig. 4, lane e). The approximate degree of purification of the 110-kDa band at each chromatographic step in the purification procedure was estimated by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels (Table I). The 110-kDa band represented less than 1% of the total protein in the phosphocellulose pool and about 10% of the total protein in the hydroxylapatite pool. The recovery of the 110-kDa protein from the Mono Q column was quite low (about 10%) and reflects, in part, the fact that the Mono Q column was pooled very narrowly. Usually only the two most active fractions from the column were retained for further study. The 110-kDa band comprised 95% of the total protein in the Mono Q pool (average of five separate preparations), while no other band represented more than 1% of the total protein.Figure 4:SDS gel analysis of fractions obtained during purification. Samples were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.

Chromatography over hydroxylapatite resulted in an ∽50-fold elevation in specific activity and a 2-fold rise in total activity. The last step in the purification yielded a 1350-fold increase in specific activity, despite the fact that the purity of the 110-kDa protein increased less than 10-fold. The total activity at this step jumped to 72,000 units/min. It is apparent that some factor that acts to prevent stimulation of the actin-activated MgATPase activity of MyoD is removed as the purification procedure proceeds.Gel filtration chromatography of the 110-kDa protein on a Bio-Gel A-0.5m column resulted in the elution of the protein at a Stokes radius es"

Each of the PLCβ isoforms behaved similarly in these analyses, which indicated the involvement of at least two binding events. Interfacial Michaelis constants were calculated to be between 0.1-0.2 mol fraction for all three enzymes, and K8(the equilibrium dissociation constant of PLC for lipid) ranged between 100-200 μM. The apparent multiple interfacial binding events did not appear to result from lipid-induced PLCβ oligomerization implying that PLCβ monomers possess more than one lipid-binding site. Surface dilution of PLC-catalyzed PtdIns (4, 5) P2 hydrolysis was assessed in the presence of increasing concentrations of various nonsubstrate phospholipids, which profoundly reduced PLC activity, suggesting that these lipids may inhibit enzyme action.

PLCs, like all lipid-metabolizing enzymes, act on substrates which form a lipid-water interface, an arrangement which complicates kinetic analyses of enzyme catalytic activity. However, a detailed kinetic model of the activity of small molecular weight PLA2s has been developed (Deems and Dennis, 1975Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Subsequent binding of a second phospholipid molecule at the active site of the enzyme results in the hydrolysis of substrate to product. Thus, two phospholipid binding events are required for enzyme activity. Stable attachment of an enzyme at the interface is an idea which has been extended further in kinetic analyses of the scooting behavior of phospholipases (Berg et al., 1991Berg O.G. Yu B-Z. Rogers J. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7283-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar; Jain and Gelb, 1991Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), where multiple catalytic cycles can be performed by the enzyme before it detaches from the interface and redissolves in the aqueous environment. More recent studies have suggested that the dual substrate/scooting models may be applicable to a wide range of lipid-metabolizing enzymes including secretory PLA2 (Hendrickson and Dennis, 1984Hendrickson H.S.

Using the β-isoform of PLC from turkey erythrocyte cytosol assayed with lipid monolayers, we have established that enzyme activity is influenced by factors such as monolayer lipid composition and interfacial surface pressure (James et al., 1994James S.R. Demel R.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We now report kinetic analyses and vesicle-binding studies for turkey erythrocyte PLC (TEPLC) and recombinant forms of mammalian PLCβ1 and PLCβ2 in which separate lipid binding events can be discerned. Analysis of data according to the Hill equation indicates that PLCβ isoforms may operate with an ordered sequential mechanism in which PtdIns (4, 5) P2 occupancy of the active site is secondary to binding at the interface. The experiments reported here were performed in the absence of the physiological G protein activators of PLC so that a clear idea of the enzyme-lipid interactions could be established as a prelude to investigations into the molecular basis of G protein-mediated activation of the PLCβs. Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) were from Sigma. Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Polyphosphoinositides were purified from Folch fraction type I (Sigma) as described previously (James et al., 1994James S.R. Demel R.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Non-ionic detergents were of the highest grade available and were from Calbiochem (octyl glucoside), Boehringer Mannheim (Triton X-100 purified for membrane research), Fluka (dodecylmaltoside), Bio-Rad (Tween 20), and Merck (Brij-35 as a 30% solution by mass). All other chemicals were AnalaR grade or better. [3H]PtdIns (4, 5) P2 was prepared by labeling inositol-depleted 1321N1 astrocytoma cells with 1 mCi of [3H]inositol (Amersham Corp.) for 2 days and subsequent high performance liquid chromatography purification of labeled lipids (James et al., 1994James S.R. Demel R.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 30 μCi of [3H]PtdIns (4,5)P2 was recovered at a specific radioactivity of 7-15.5 Ci/mmol. Q-Sepharose FF, Sephacryl S-300 SF, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, and the Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column were purchased from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol. The Bio-Gel HPHT (100 × 7.8 mm) column, Bio-Gel HPHT (4 × 50 mm) precolumn and Bio-Gel HPT hydroxylapatite media were from Bio-Rad. Biosensor coupling reagents and CM5 sensorchips were from Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden. TEPLCβ was purified from the cytosol of turkey erythrocytes by the method detailed by Waldo et al.(1990). Washed turkey erythrocytes were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and the supernatant collected after centrifugation (36,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C). Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 226 g/liter and the precipitate collected by centrifugation (36,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The washed precipitate was resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the solution clarified by centrifugation (36,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C) and the TEPLCβ purified by sequential chromatography of the clarified solution on Q-Sepharose FF, Bio-Gel HPT (hydroxylapatite), heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephacryl S-300 SF, and Mono Q ion-exchange. Both rPLCβ1 and rPLCβ2 were purified after expression in Sf9 cells, as described in more detail elsewhere (Paterson and Harden, 1994Paterson A Harden T.K. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 6 (in press)Google Scholar). In brief, monolayers of 3 × 108 Sf9 cells were infected with 3 × 108 plaque-forming units recombinant baculovirus encoding either rat PLCβ1 or human PLCβ2 and the cells incubated at 27°C in Graces medium supplemented with 3.3 g/liter yeastolate, 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Forty-eight h after infection, the cells were collected, resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer, and homogenized in a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Either recombinant PLCβ isoform was then purified from the high speed supernatant prepared by centrifugation (105,000 × g, 65 min, 4°C) of the whole cell lysate. rPLCβ1 was isolated by sequential chromatography of the high speed supernatant on Q-Sepharose FF and heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, while rPLCβ2 required chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, and Bio-Gel HPHT. [3H]PtdIns (4, 5) P2 enzyme assay stock solutions were prepared using unlabeled and labeled lipid (sufficient for 15,000 disintegrations/min/assay) which were dried to a film from chloroform stock solutions under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, by sonication. Dodecylmaltoside was added from stock solutions to individual assay tubes at concentrations giving the desired mole fraction calculated as (PtdIns (4, 5) P2)/((PtdIns (4,5)P2) + (detergent)). Assays were performed in buffer A (comprising 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2), and sufficient calcium to give a free ionic concentration of 1 μM (calculated using a Ksof EGTA for calcium of 5.17 X 106M-1). Assays (100 μl volume) were started by addition of enzyme (10-25 ng) to tubes containing all other constituents prewarmed to 37°C. Assays proceeded for up to 15 min (under which conditions <20% PtdIns (4, 5) P2 was utilized and assays were linear) and were stopped by addition of 750 μl chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (40:80, 1 v/v), 100 μl of H2O, 250 μl of chloroform, and 250 μl of 0.1 M HCl, followed by centrifugation. [3H]InsP3 was measured by liquid scintillation counting of 500 μl upper phase. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were produced by extrusion through 100-nm polycarbonate membranes using a phospholipid extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 15 mg of lipid of various compositions (PtdCho/PtdSer/PtdIns (4, 5) P2 (70:27:3 by molarity); PtdCho/PtdIns (4, 5) P2 (97:3); PtdCho alone; PtdCho with increasing masses of PtdSer) were dried to a film, resuspended by vortexing in buffer B comprising 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mM sucrose, 3.4 mM EDTA, 20 mM KCl, followed by repeated freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen/40°C water bath. Lipids were extruded with >10 passes through the polycarbonate filters, and LUVs were stored at 4°C. For PLC-binding studies, vesicles were diluted to 100 μM with respect to PtdIns (4, 5) P2 in buffer C (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.4 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl) and used as a stock for all lower concentrations required in the binding studies. Binding was performed in buffer C in 100 μl volumes, with 50 ng of TEPLC/tube. Calcium was omitted to eliminate PLC-catalyzed PtdIns (4,5)P2 hydrolysis. Enzyme was incubated with vesicles for 10 min on ice (better reproducibility of data was observed at this temperature), followed by ultracentrifugation (60,000 rpm, 30 min at 4°C, TLA 100 rotor, Beckman TL100 centrifuge), and PLC activity remaining in the supernatant was assayed against 25 μM [3H]PtdIns (4, 5) P2 as above. Real time intermolecular interaction between PLC molecules and lipids were determined using the BIALite system (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden). PLC was immobilized to a CM5 biosensor chip by amine coupling, using the manufacturer's recommended procedures with certain modifications. The hydrogel matrix on the sensor chip was activated by a 6-min injection (5 μl/min flow rate) of a 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N’-[3-(diethylamino)propyl] carbodiimide. PLC was immobilized by a 7-min injection of between 5-25 μg/ml protein at either pH 4.2 (in sodium acetate buffer) or pH 7.2 (in buffer C which was also used as the flow-through buffer) and any free unreacted sites on the matrix were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine chloride. Immobilization at pH 4.2 captured between 9-11 ng of PLC/mm2 sensorchip surface (9,000-11,000 RUs increase) whereas only 0.15-0.2 ng/mm2 PLC (150-200 RUs) was immobilized at neutral pH, approximated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Subsequent assessments of PLC and/or lipid vesicle binding to immobilized enzyme were performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Experiments were performed at pH 7.2 in buffer C and some measurements were made at pH 4.2 in sodium acetate buffer. Analytes were injected for various times (at least 4 min), and dissociation was allowed to progress for at least 450 s. After injections of PLC, the chip surface was regenerated by injection of a 2-μl pulse of 1 M NaOH; a pulse of 0.12% (w/v) SDS was used to regenerate the chip after injections of phospholipid vesicles. Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software version 2.0 supplied by the manufacturer and are presented without subtraction of control bulk refractive index changes because of the markedly different optical properties of vesicle preparations compared to enzyme dilutions. PtdIns (4, 5) P2 hydrolysis by all three PLCβ isoforms was determined under three conditions previously described for secretory PLA2 (Hendrickson and Dennis, 1984Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Case I involves determination of PLC activity with increasing bulk concentrations of PtdIns (4,5)P2 and a single substrate mole fraction. Since initial binding to the interface is thought to be dependent on the bulk substrate concentration, this allows the determination of Ks, the equilibrium dissociation constant in bulk concentration terms. Case II allows determination of the interfacial Michaelis constant (Km) for PLC by determining PLC activity with a single bulk concentration of PtdIns (4, 5) P2 and increasing mole fractions. Case III involves measuring PLC activity when bulk PtdIns (4, 5) P2 concentration and surface PtdIns (4,5)P2 concentrations are varied simultaneously. Data from all three cases were fitted to the Hill equation (Equation 1) using the curve fitting programme Ultrafit: v=Vmax[S]nK'+[S]n(Eq. 1) For case I experiments, Equation 1 reduced to the Henri Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2), from which values for the equilibrium dissociation constant (Ks) were derived: v=Vmax[S]Ka+[S](Eq. 2) Hill coefficients from case II data were similar to those derived from logarithmic transformations of case III experiments (Table I). Subsequently, double-reciprocal plots were made from case II velocity curves, where the ordinate was raised to the power of the Hill number. This yields a straight line (Segel, 1976) and the ordinate intercept is equal to (−1/Km)n.Table IKinetic constants derived for three isoforms of PLCβ from case I and case II catalytic assaysPLC assays were performed for all three PLCβ isoenzymes under the three case kinetic analysis described under “Experimental Procedures” and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Ka), interfacial Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), and Vmax were calculated.

Data points are the means of duplicates with a range of ≤10%. PtdIns (4,5)P2 hydrolysis by PLCβ was analyzed according to a bireactant model to test whether interface binding and PtdIns (4,5)P2 hydrolysis represent independent steps required for catalysis as has been proposed for PLCδ (Rebecchi et al., 1993Rebecchi M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10447-10456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of three PLCβ isoforms was examined using a three case kinetic analysis in which PtdIns (4, 5) P2 bulk and surface concentrations were varied independently and concurrently, as established by Hendrickson and Dennis, 1984Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Enzyme activity was measured using PtdIns (4,5)P2/dodecylmaltoside mixed micelles as substrate. These conditions induce submaximal PLC activity due to the absence of cholate which facilitates PtdIns (4, 5) P2 hydrolysis and would compromise the kinetic analyses undertaken. Under the conditions used, dodecylmaltoside appeared to behave as a true neutral diluent of PtdIns (4,5)P2 and did not appear to bind to the enzyme or inhibit PLC activity. This was judged by assaying PLC activity using a fixed mole fraction of PtdIns (4.5)P2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of dodecylmaltoside. Activity was linear with respect to increasing bulk lipid concentration despite increases in dodecylmaltoside (data not shown). Thus, dodecylmaltoside did not appear to inhibit PLC activity. The effects of dodecylmaltoside on phospholipid vesicle structure was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. 100 μM PtdIns (4, 5) P2 sonicated into 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (stock assay lipid), resulted in heterogeneous unilamellar vesicles whose diameters varied between 40-280 nm. Addition of 150 μM dodecylmaltoside (to give a mole fraction of PtdIns (4, 5) P2 of 0.4) did not affect vesicle lamellarity, but reduced the size heterogeneity, with vesicles between 30-120 nm diameter (data not shown). Several other non-ionic detergents were tested as diluents in PtdIns (4,5)P2 mixed micelles including octyl glucoside, Triton X-100, Brij 35, and Tween 20. Triton X-100 profoundly inhibited PLC activity at concentrations above 25 μM, and all other detergents exerted inconsistent effects on PLC activity such that the relationship between PLC activity and increasing detergent concentration was not linear (data not shown). These effects were independent of the critical micellar concentrations for each detergent. Because dodecylmaltoside was the only detergent which did not inhibit PLC, it was used to dilute surface concentrations of PtdIns (4,5)P2. To investigate whether PLCβ activity involves multiple binding events due to interactions with the bulk lipid interface and subsequent substrate binding within the interface, the bulk concentration and mole fraction of PtdIns (4,5)P2 were increased simultaneously and InsP3 production was measured. This was achieved by assays using a single concentration of dodecylmaltoside and increasing concentrations of PtdIns (4, 5) P2 (case III in the protocols described under “Experimental Procedures”) The relationship betwen PLCβ activity and bulk and surface concentrations of substrate was sigmoid (Fig. 1, showing results for PLCβ2). Similar results were obtained for PLCβ1 and TEPLC. The solid line on Fig. 1 is a fit of the data to Equation 1. The sigmoidicity of this relationship is strong evidence that PLC-mediated PtdIns (4, 5) P2 hydrolysis involves at least two distinct binding events (Hendrickson and Dennis, 1984Hendrickson H.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5734-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A logarithmic Hill plot of the data gave a straight line, from which the slope (equal to the Hill coefficient, n) was determined and was found to range between 1.4-1.8 for the three enzymes (Table I). These values of n confirmed that the interactions of PLCβ isoforms with lipid surfaces involves at least two lipid-binding sites. Lipid-metabolizing enzymes are considered to bind to and sometimes penetrate lipid interfaces with subsequent further substrate binding within the interface as component parts of their catalytic mechanism. The initial interaction with the interface is dependent on the bulk lipid concentration while binding within the interface is dependent on the substrate mole fraction. The separate steps can be examined independently of each other by variation of bulk lipid concentration at a fixed mole fraction and vice versa. The equilibrium dissociation constant for interface binding by PLCβ was determined by assaying PtdIns (4, 5) P2 hydrolysis as a function of bulk concentration at a fixed mole fraction of PtdIns (4,5)P2 of 0.2 (case I). This was achieved in practice by varying both bulk PtdIns (4, 5) P2 and dodecylmaltoside concentrations proportionately, maintaining the mole fraction constant. This value was chosen because at mole fractions greater than 0.25-0.3, the kinetics of PtdIns (4, 5) P2 hydrolysis deviated from linearity whereas below 0.25, reactions were linear, a phenomenon which is not understood at present. PLC activity showed a hyperbolic relationship with PtdIns (4, 5) P2 bulk concentration (Fig. 2). The data shown are for TEPLC and were similar to those obtained for both recombinant PLCβ1 and PLCβ2. The solid line on Fig. 2 is the curve obtained by fitting the data to Equation 1. The Hill number obtained was close to 1, indicating that binding of PLC to the lipid interface likely involved a single site of interaction. Case I data therefore fitted Equation 2 from which values for the equilibrium dissociation constant (Ks) were obtained (Table I). This relationship between substrate bulk concentration and PLCβ binding was further investigated using a non-catalytic vesicle binding assay, as described previously for PLCδ (Rebecchi et al., 1992bRebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). TEPLC was incubated with sucrose-loaded vesicles of differing phospholipid compositions, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the amount of TEPLC in the supernatant was determined by assay after ultracentrifugation. When incubated with vesicles composed of PtdCho/PtdSer/PtdIns (4, 5) P2 (70:27:3 mol/mol), TEPLC was depleted from the supernatant and bound to the LUV pellet in a manner which depended on the total vesicle concentration (Fig. 3A). The relationship appeared hyperbolic in agreement with that found for case I experiments and the solid line resulted from fitting the data to a single site binding model from which Ksvalues of between 2.5 and 5 μM were calculated. An apparent equilibrium association constant (Ka) was determined using the model proposed by Rebecchi et al., 1992bRebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, Equation 4), assuming 1:1 interaction between PLCβ and vesicles in these conditions (Fig. 3A, inset). The Kavalue for TEPLC was 5 ± 1 X 105M-1 with respect to bulk PtdIns (4,5)P2 concentration (mean ± S.D., five experiments). Stable binding of PLC to vesicles was influenced by the lipid composition of the vesicles. Thus, when PtdSer was omitted and PtdCho was increased to 97% of the lipid, Kawas decreased by one order of magnitude to 0.4 X 0.1 X 105M-1 (mean ± S.D., three experiments). In addition, binding was absolutely dependent upon the presence of PtdIns (4, 5) P2 in the vesicles under the chosen lipid proportions. When TEPLC was incubated with vesicles lacking Ptd"

This included changes in the proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. After 3 days of muscle stimulation, there was down-regulation of fast-twitch Ca-ATPase (SERCA1a) mRNA and induction of slow-twitch Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) mRNA; most changes in both mRNAs were nearly complete after 14 days of stimulation. Although the induction of phospholamban mRNA began after 3 days of muscle stimulation, its up-regulation was not completed until the muscle had been stimulated for 42 days. The time course of expression of SERCA2a protein was very different from that of SERCA2a mRNA, suggesting that SERCA2 gene expression is regulated at the translational as well as the transcriptional level. The time course of expression of phospholamban protein closely followed that of phospholamban mRNA, suggesting that this gene is under transcriptional control. Thus coordinated expression of SERCA2a and phospholamban proteins is achieved via translational control of the SERCA2 gene and transcriptional control of the phospholamban gene.

Chronic low frequency electrostimulation of fast-twitch muscle induces a switch to the slow-twitch phenotype (1Salmons S. Sreter F.A.

The first step in the induction of the SERCA2a and phospholamban genes is transcription. The time course of the up-regulation of these transcripts during discontinuous stimulation in rabbits have been described by Leberer et al. (5Leberer E. Hartner K. Brandl C.J. Fujii J. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mRNA must be translated in to complete the expression of these genes. Leberer et al. (5Leberer E. Hartner K. Brandl C.J. Fujii J. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) did not measure the protein products of these genes, so the time of onset of translation of these transcripts is unknown. Although eukaryote gene expression is usually regulated primarily at the transcriptional level, there are a number of exceptions (6Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Here we report changes in SERCA and phospholamban mRNAs and proteins during muscle transformation and consider the control of these genes during the process. The latissimus dorsi muscles were stimulated indirectly at 1 Hz via the three major branches of the thoracodorsal nerve for 3–70 days as described (4Ohlendieck K. Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.S. Camphell K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At the end of the stimulation period the animals were sacrificed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The latissimus dorsi, cardiac, and vastus intermedius muscles were rapidly removed, washed, chilled in ice-cold saline, and cleaned of superficial connective tissue and fat. Samples were then removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. The left and right muscles were the experimental and control, respectively. Conditioning of the left muscle had no effect on the expression of SERCA or phospholamban genes of right muscle (data not shown). The number of animals studied at each time period ranged from 4 to 9. A microsomal fraction containing vesicles derived from longitudinal and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, transverse tubules, and sarcolemma was isolated as described by Ohlendieck et al. (4Ohlendieck K. Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.S. Camphell K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from 1.0 g of fresh chilled or frozen muscle by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (7Chomcyzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). SERCA1a and SERCA2a mRNAs were detected by Northern blots as described in Sambrook et al. (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Thirty μg of total RNA was size fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with a SERCA probe randomly labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Slot-blot and Northern blot membranes were washed with 2 × SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0 solution) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 55 and 42 °C, respectively, for 30 min. The different sizes of the SERCA1a and SERCA2a mRNAs (9Arai M. Otsu K. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allow separation and quantification on Northern blots. Total SERCA mRNA was measured on slot-blots using the same probe. Phospholamban mRNA was measured by slot-blot analysis. The mRNA levels were measured densitometrically from x-ray film using a Pharmacia UltraScan XL densitometer. The film was exposed for periods of time that gave linear responses to the amount of radioactivity on the blots. The phospholamban cDNA, obtained from a cardiac λgt 10 library (10Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Larry R. Jones at the University of Indiana. It is a 604-base pair fragment that starts 191 base pairs 5′ to the coding region, includes the coding region and extends into the 3′ region. The SERCA probe, a 1.7-kb SERCA cDNA, nucleotides 1,798–3,594 (11MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), was a gift from Muthu Periasamy at the University of Cincinnati. It cross-hybridizes with SERCA1 and SERCA2 mRNAs (9Arai M. Otsu K. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins of the membrane fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE on linear 7–15 % Polyacrylamide gels with 4% stacking gels as described (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G and scanned with a Pharmacia UltroScan XL densitometer. The SERCA1 monoclonal antibody IIH11, and SERCA2 monoclonal antibody IID8, were gifts from Dr. Kevin P. Camphell at the University of Iowa and are described (13Jorgensen A.O. Arnold W. Pepper D.R. Kahl S.D. Mandel F. Camphell K.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 9: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The phospholamban monoclonal antibody 2D12 was a gift from Dr. Larry Jones at the University of Indiana and is described in detail 114). Western blots for SERCA1a and SERCA2a were carried out as described (2Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Feher J.J. Wechsler A.S. Ohlendieck K. Camphell K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). and the phospholamban immunoblots were as described in (3Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.S. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two modifications of the methods were made: 1) gelatin was used as a blocking protein, and 2) the immunoblots were visualized using 12r’I-antimouse IgG as secondary antibody. Radioautographs were made from transblots and scanned with a Pharmacia UltroScan XL densitometer. Proteins were measured by the method of Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Multiple comparisons were evaluated statistically with one way analysis of variance (ANOVAI or ranked ANOVA, depending on the data. Dunnet's test was used for normally distributed data and Dunn's test for ranked data. Differences were accepted at the ρ < 0.05 level. Pearson product-moment correlation was used to measure the strength of association between pairs of variables; e.g. changes in protein versus changes in mRNA. The value, r, is a measure of the strength of the correlation; Ρ is the probability of the correlation arising by chance. Pette (16Pette D. Med. Sci. Sports Exer. 1984; 16: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that 14 days of stimulation of rabbit fast-twitch muscle induced a 3-fold rise in total RNA, mostly due to an increase in ribosomal RNA. With continued stimulation the total RNA level fell to twice that of the control muscle. Pette did not report mRNAs changes. In the canine latissimus dorsi muscle the level of SERCA (SERCA1a + SERCA2a) mRNA did not change during the 70 days of stimulation, Fig. 1, whether it was measured as a ratio to a-actin or to the control muscle. To switch from the fast to the slow-twitch phenotype requires down-regulation of the SERCA1 gene and induction of the SERCA2 gene. Typical Northern blots showing changes in the expression of SERCA1a and SERCA2a mRNAs are shown in Fig. 2. The changes in SERCA1a mRNA and SERCA2a mRNAs for all muscles are shown in FIG. 3, FIG. 4. The pattern that emerges is change in both mRNAs starting after 3 days of muscle stimulation. By 14 days of muscle stimulation the down-regulation of SERCA1a was 70% complete (Fig. 3) and the up-regulation of SERCA2a 75% complete (Fig. 4).FIG. 3Effect of chronic conditioning on muscle SERCA1a mRNA and membrane SERCA1a protein.

The decline in SERCA1a mRNA starts after 3 days of stimulation, as does the decline in SERCA1a protein. Although the down-regulation of mRNA and protein start simultaneously and show identical profiles, the magnitude of the decline in protein was not as great as that in mRNA until the muscle had been stimulated for 42 days. The parallel decline in mRNA and protein suggests that the expression of the SERCA1 gene is under transcriptional control during the change to slow-twitch phenotype. The changes in SERCA2a mRNA and SERCA2a protein in response to chronic muscle stimulation are recorded in Fig. 4. The increase in SERCA2a mRNA was 60% complete by 7 days and 75% complete by 14 days of stimulation. SERCA2a protein increased continuously between 7 and 42 days of stimulation, while the level of SERCA2a mRNA remained unchanged, suggesting that SERCA2a protein expression is under translational control. The rises in SERCA2a protein and mRNA were not significantly correlated. Briggs et al. (3Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.S. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that chronic electrostimulation of the canine latissimus dorsi induces the expression of phospholamban protein, a sarcoplasmic reticulum protein found in some slow-twitch but not fast-twitch muscles (3Briggs F.N. Lee K.F. Wechsler A.S. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation induced expression of phospholamban mRNA and protein in the canine latissimus dorsi is shown in Fig. 5. The phospholamban mRNA began to rise with 3 days and phospholamban protein with 7 days of stimulation. The correlation between the rises in protein and in mRNA was highly significant. Although the up-regulation of SERCA2a and phospholamban mRNAs have distinctly different patterns, the patterns of expression of the two proteins are very similar, Fig. 6. It is clear that the two proteins are coexpressed during transformation of fast-twitch to slow-twitch muscle. The Pearson product-moment correlation gave a coefficient of 0.970 and a ρ value < 0.001. In the transforming canine skeletal muscle SERCA2a and phospholamban proteins were expressed simultaneously (Fig. 6). The mRNAs of these two genes were not coordinately expressed during the transformation, Fig. 4 versus 5. The induction and up-regulation of SERCA2a mRNA was completed before that of phospholamban mRNA. The delay between expression of SERCA2a mRNA and expression of SERCA2a protein, Fig. 4, requires translational control. The parallel increase in phospholamban mRNA and protein suggests that this gene is regulated at the transcriptional level. Thus, to achieve the coordinate expression of SERCA2a protein and phospholamban during transformation of skeletal muscle phenotype the expression of these genes were regulated at different levels; the SERCA2a gene at the translational and the phospholamban gene at the transcriptional level. To get such precise regulation of gene expression using two levels of control must require some mechanism to coordinate the expression of SERCA2a and phospholamban proteins. The data recorded in Fig. 6, showing that phospholamban expression precedes that of SERCA2a, may mean that phospholamban stimulates the translation of the SERCA2a transcript. A number of physiological interventions induce switches in muscle fiber type. In the unweighted rat soleus muscle (18Schulte L.M. Navarro J. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1308-C1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increases in SERCA1a mRNA and protein proceeded with similar time courses, suggesting that up-regulation of the SERCA1a gene is transcriptionally regulated. Denervation of the rat extensor digitorum longus produces a rapid down-regulation in SERCA1a mRNA and a much slower and less marked down-regulation of SERCA1a protein. This slow decline in SERCA1a protein was attributed to the stability of the SERCA1a protein (19Kirchberger M.A. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 725-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and not to translational control, an alternative interpretation. In the stimulated canine latissimus dorsi the fall in SERCA1a mRNA was paralleled by a fall in SERCA1a protein, suggesting that in this model SERCA1a protein expression is under transcriptional control. The down-regulation of SERCA1 gene expression appears to be under transcriptional control. Twenty-eight days after unloading the rat soleus muscle (18Schulte L.M. Navarro J. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1308-C1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SERCA2a mRNA increased and SERCA2a protein decreased, indicating that under this condition SERCA2 gene expression is under translational control. This response is similar to that observed in the canine latissimus dorsi, which also showed that SERCA2a mRNA and SERCA2a protein levels do not change in close concert and suggests that for these two types of muscle stimulation the expression of SERCA2a protein is under translational control. The expression of SERCA2a and phospholamban can be differentially regulated. For example, SERCA2a is expressed before phospholamban during skeletal muscle development (9Arai M. Otsu K. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholamban is expressed in the slow-twitch muscles of the rabbit (9Arai M. Otsu K. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kirchberger M.A. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 725-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dog (3Briggs F.N.

Periasamy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2966-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), there is an increase in cardiac muscle SERCA2a mRNA and a decrease in phospholamban mRNA, indicating that thyroid hormone produces opposite effects on cardiac SERCA2a and phospholamban gene expression. In contrast to the studies in the dog reported here, where SERCA2a and phospholamban mRNA rose with different time courses, Leberer et al. (5Leberer E. Hartner K. Brandl C.J. Fujii J. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have reported (for the one animal showing the greatest transformation at each time point) that SERCA2a and phospholamban mRNA increased with similar time courses, indicating that in the rabbit undergoing discontinuous stimulation the transcription of these two genes may be under a common control mechanism. The studies cited above indicate that SERCA2a and phospholamban can undergo independent regulation. On the other hand under some circumstances the transcription of these two genes can be coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W2069032252,"Abstract Hydrocortisone decreases major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression in rat thyroid cells and counteracts increases induced by interferons. Using FRTL-5 cells transfected with class I promoter- reporter gene chimeras, we show that hydrocortisone action is transcriptional and mediated by an element located between 180 and 170 base pairs upstream of the start of transcription. Gel shift assays reveal that hydrocortisone causes the decrease of a specific protein- DNA complex; this same complex, referred to as Mod-1, is increased by interferon. Oligonucleotide competition assays reveal that the Mod-1 complex is associated with enhancer A of the class I gene, −180 to −170 base pairs (5′-GGGGAGTCCCC-3′), immediately upstream of the interferon response element. Antibodies to fra-2, a fos family member, and to the p50, but not the p65, subunit of NF-kappa B supershift the Mod-1 complex. We suggest that hydrocortisone decreases MHC class I gene expression by reducing the formation of Mod-1, which contains both p50 and fra-2; interferon reverses the hydrocortisone effect and increases Mod-1 formation. These observations are relevant to the molecular basis of hydrocortisone therapy in autoimmune thyroid disease and to the actions of interferon to exacerbate or induce autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2042563963,"Thyroid hormone 3,5,3’-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) is required for normal brain development in vertebrates. T3 acts through two classes of nuclear receptors (TRα and TRβ) that have distinct developmental spatial and temporal distributions suggesting different functions during neuronal development. One possibility is that TRα, which is expressed early in embryogenesis, is involved in neuroblast proliferation. To test this hypothesis we used the embryonic chick optic lobe, as we found that T3 stimulates [3H]thymidine incorporation in this tissue both in vivo and in vitro during embryonic days 6-9. We applied oligonucleotides (ODNs) against TRα and TRβ to primary cultures of chick optic lobes. By employing a cationic lipid vector we could use very low ODN concentrations (<150 nM). Antisense ODNs against TRα significantly inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation, whereas antisense TRβ had no significant effect. However, both ODNs inhibited expression of TRs, as they blocked transcription from a T3-activated reporter gene. Random ODNs used as controls had no significant effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation or on T3-dependent transcription. These observations suggest that TRα is implicated in neuroblast proliferation and add credence to the hypothesis that the multiplicity of nuclear receptors allows for specific actions of T3 during development.

TRs are transcription factors that modulate gene expression by binding as dimers to specific DNA sequences known as T3 response elements, thereby regulating the transcription of target genes (6Glass C.K.

In the chick, as in other species, two related genes encode TRs, TRα and TRβ (3Sap J. Munoz A. Damm K. Goldberg Y. Ghysdael J. Leutz A. Beug H. Vennström B. Nature. 1986; 324: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Both genes are expressed in the developing chick brain (7Forrest D. Sjöberg M. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1516-1528Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but as in the rat (8Bradley D.J. Young III, W.S. Weinberger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vennström B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting they have different developmental roles. Moreover, TRs bind to the TRE sequences in target genes as homodimers or heterodimers (12Andersson M.L. Nordström K. Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennström B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Forman B.M. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Heterodimers can be composed of either TRα and TRβ, or of a TR receptor with another class of nuclear factor, particularly the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors, the RXRs (14Bugge T.H. Pohl J. Lonnoy O. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 15Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Frogione M. Umeda P.K. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

These multiple possibilities generate great potential for diversity of signal response. Cellular response depends on the expression of a given set of receptors at a given time and the presence or absence of the respective ligands. Interestingly, in the case of the T3 and the retinoic acid systems, expression of different receptor classes and production of ligands are both developmentally regulated processes. Many morphological, biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral defects result from hypothyroidism during development, especially if it occurs during a hormone-sensitive period. Thyroid hormone requirements have been implicated in differentiation of neuronal and glial populations, affecting cell migration, myelination, and synaptogenesis (1Dussault J.H. Ruel J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nicholson J.L. Altman J. Brain Res. 1972; 44: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, little is known about specific target cells for hormone action nor of the roles of the different receptors. In particular, there are virtually no data on the requirements for T3 and its actions during the proliferative stages of neurogenesis. Given that TRα is expressed during the early mitotic phases of development, one hypothesis would be that this receptor has a specific role to play in regulating entry into the cell cycle. To test the hypothesis we used the positive effect of thyroid hormones on division of neuroblasts from embryonic chick optic lobe as a model system to measure the actions of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) directed specifically against chick TRα or TRβ. T3 increased proliferation of neuroblasts both in vivo and in vitro. However, we tested the actions of the TRs in vitro, since an in vivo approach would require homogenous, highly efficient delivery of the ODNs to the whole of the neuro-epithelium population, which is not yet technically feasible. Moreover, the use of ODNs to modify gene expression is limited by their low cellular uptake and their rapid degradation by extracellular nucleases. To protect the ODNs and enhance uptake, we complexed ODNs with a cationic lipid, dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine (Transfectam™, DOGS). DOGS compacts the DNA and neutralizes the anionic charges carried by the ODN that interfere with its crossing of the plasma membrane (18Behr J.P. Demeneix B.A. Loeffler J.P. Perez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6982-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Some recent reports have shown that cationic lipids do improve uptake of ODNs by cell lines (19Cappaccioli S. Pasquale G.P. Mini E. Mazzei T. Quattrone A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 818-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Betram J. Killian M. Brysch W. Schlingensiepen K.H. Kneba M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but no demonstration of their usefulness for introducing ODNs into primary neurons has appeared. By using this approach we found that we could introduce ODNs (at nanomolar concentrations) into primary cultures of embryonic neurons prepared during the proliferative phase and examine their biological effects. Our findings show that TRα is implicated in neuronal proliferation, a result which conforms with the expression of this gene during the early stages of development. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation in Vivo Fertilized white Gallus domestic eggs (Haas, Kaltenhouse, France) were incubated at 38°C ± 0.5°C. In one experimental series, eggs were injected at embryonic day 5 with 100 μl of NaCl (8.6%) containing 0.9 MBq [3H]thymidine ([5’-3H]thymidine, specific activity 488 GBq, Amersham, Les Ulis, France) with or without T3 (3 μg). This amount of T3 increases embryonic tissue levels of T3 5-fold, from 48 pg/g in saline-treated controls to 243 pg/g with T3 treatment (values determined by radioimmunoassay on pools of six embryos).2 2I. Seugnet, unpublished observations. Injections were made through the shell into the yolk sac. On embryonic day 8 embryos were fixed in Carnoy's solution (1 h) dehydrated through alcohol then embedded in paraffin. Coronary sections (7 μm) mounted on gelatin-coated slides were left to dry (37°C, 3 days) then deparaffinized in xylene (three times), followed by 95% alcohol (three times), and dried overnight at room temperature. Slides were placed in contact with 3H-sensitive film (Hyperfilm-3H, Amersham, Les Ulis, France) for 6 weeks. The films were analyzed with a densitometer. In a second series of experiments eggs were injected at embryonic day 5 with 100 μl of saline (NaCl 8.6%) ± T3 (3 μg). On embryonic day 8, [3H]thymidine (0.9 M Bq in 100 μl of saline) was deposited on the extra-embryonic circulation. Embryos were sacrificed 2 h later, fixed, and sections cut as described above. Slides dipped in autoradiographic emulsion (NTB-2, Kodak, Les Ulis, France) were developed 6 days later. Labeled cells in the internal and external layers of the optic tectum were counted, using a × 100 objective on a Leitz microscope. For standardization, a 90-μm wide strip within the ventrolateral area of a median section (i.e. at the middle of the rostrocaudal extent of the optic tectum) was counted for both layers. Cells were prepared as described (21Lezoualc'h F. Hassan A.H.S. Giraud P. Loeffler J.P. Lee S.L. Demeneix B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, optic lobes were dissected from chick embryos at embryonic day 6 (37.5 ± 0.5°C) and transferred to Petri dishes containing a dissection medium composed of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12, supplemented with 25 mMD-glucose, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After removing the meninges, tissue was minced and mechanically dissociated. Dissociated cells were suspended in serum-free medium (SFM, 21). For immunocytochemistry and ODN incorporation, cells were seeded on glass coverslips at 4.105 cells/well. Dishes were pretreated for 30 mn with gelatine (0.25 mg∙ml-1), and overnight with poly-D-lysine (Mr 70,000, 10 mg∙ml-1 in 0.15 M sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0). After rinsing with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dH2O, dishes were coated with a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 2 h. Cultures were grown at 37°C in humid 93% air, 7% CO2. [32P]ODN Incorporation and Stability-[32P]ODN incorporation and stability were measured according to Wickstrom et al.(22Wickstrom E. Bacon T.A. Gonzales A. Freeman D.L. Lyman G.H. Wickstrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). ASα was 5’-labeled with [α-32P]ATP (Amersham, Les Ulis, France) by using T4 polymerase kinase (Amersham). For each point 2 × 106 counts/min of 5’-labeled ODN (1 pmol of labeled ODN and 10 μM carrier unlabeled ODN complexed with a three times charge excess of DOGS or 10 μM carrier unlabeled ODN) was added to 4.105 cells. After a further 12 h, labeled ODN was recovered from cells and culture medium and radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. To evaluate ODN stability, aliquots of cell extracts and culture medium were electrophoresed in a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel and exposed to X-OMAT film (Kodak, Les Ulis, France) for 24 h. For fluorescence microscopy, 1 μM ASα (final concentration) labeled in 3’ with rhodamine was complexed with DOGS (at a three times charge excess, see below) and added to the cells. After 6 h, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde PBS for 30 mn. After rinsing twice with 0.1 M PBS and distilled water, coverslips were mounted in Moviol (Hoechst) and visualized by fluorescence, Nomarski optics, and confocal microscopy. The translation start regions of cTRα and cTRβ mRNA were chosen as targets to block cTRs protein expression (see Refs. 3Sap J. Munoz A. Damm K. Goldberg Y. Ghysdael J. Leutz A. Beug H. Vennström B. Nature. 1986; 324: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar and 7Forrest D. Sjöberg M. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1516-1528Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar for cDNA sequences). ODNs, purified on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were purchased from Genosys (United Kingdom) and Eurogentec (Belgium). Control ODNs with an 18-mer randomized sequence of the same A, T, G, C content as antisens α (ASα) and antisens β (ASβ) were, respectively, designated as random α (RDα) and random β (RDβ). To follow ODN incorporation and intracellular distribution, ASα was labeled in 3’ with rhodamine (Eurogentec). Sequences were as follows: ASα, 5’-GCTGGGCTTCTGTTCCAT-3’; RDα, 5’-GTCGGCGTTCTGTTATCG-3’; ASβ, 5’-ATATACCCTGACATACTG-3’; RDβ, 5’-ATATACCTCCAGATAGTC-3’. The T3RE-LUC construct contains a synthetic ODN sequence encoding a palidromic TRE in SV-luciferase (23Glass C.K. Lipkin S.M. Devary O.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It was kindly provided by Dr. C. K. Glass, San Diego. The lipid used was DOGS. DOGS (135 ×μM DOGS/×μM ODN) was incubated in 150 mM NaCl with ODN for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was added directly to the cells and incubated together for a given time. For plasmid transfection, cultures were transfected according to published methodology (21Lezoualc'h F. Hassan A.H.S. Giraud P. Loeffler J.P. Lee S.L. Demeneix B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). DNA was complexed with DOGS (1 μl 4 mM DOGS/μg DNA) in 100 μl of 0.015 M NaCl, then diluted into the appropriate volume of SFM. After 1 h the transfection medium was replaced with fresh SFM. Transfection efficiency is high and very regular (21Lezoualc'h F. Hassan A.H.S. Giraud P. Loeffler J.P. Lee S.L. Demeneix B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, there has never been any need to normalize for transfection efficiency in any cells so far transfected by this method. [5’-3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay in Vitro DNA synthesis was assayed at 2 days in vitro either by scintillation counting or by determining the number of labeled cells. For scintillation counting cells were seeded at 106 cells/well in 24-well plates. At 1 day in vitro, neuroblasts were labeled with 37 kBq of [5’-3H]thymidine (specific activity 488 GBq, Amersham, Les Ulis, France) for 24 h. ODNs (25-150 nM, complexed with three time charge excess of DOGS, see above) were added at 24 h. At 48 h, cells were rinsed twice with SFM and lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Homogenates were counted in a scintillation counter. To determine the number of labeled cells, 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates. The number of labeled cells represents the proportion of cells incorporating [3H]thymidine in the nucleus, reflecting DNA synthesis. Cultures were incubated with 37 kBq of [5’-3H]thymidine from 1 to 2 days in vitro. ODNs (150 nM, complexed with three times charge excess of DOGS, see above) were added at 24 h. At 2 days in vitro, cells were processed for autoradiography. Briefly, cells fixed in 4% formaldehyde PBS (30 mn), were dehydrated in ethanol, dipped into NTB2 emulsion (Kodak, Les Ulis, France) at 43°C, dried, and exposed in the dark at 4°C for 8 days. Slides were developed in Kodak DEKTOL, fixed in Kodak UNIFIX, and washed in water. Finally, slides were lightly stained for cell bodies and nucleus using eosin, hematoxylin, and coverslipped with DPX (Electron Microscopic Sciences). Positive and negative cells in seven or eight random areas were scored for silver granules at × 100 magnification on each well until 500-1000 cells were counted. The percentage of positive cells was then calculated. Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega Luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Tropix ™ luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT) calibrated against a tritium standard. Light emitted was measured over 10 s. Cultures were fixed at 3 days in vitro with ethanol, rinsed in 0.1 M PBS, supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.05% sodium azide (PBS/FCS/NaA), then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of a polyclonal antiserum against cTRs (24Goldberg Y. Glineur C. Gesquière J.C. Ricouart A. Sap J. Vennström B. Ghysdal J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Controls for the cTRs antibody were incubated in preimmune rabbit serum. After incubation overnight at room temperature, cells were washed (three times) in PBS/FCS/NaA and incubated (1 h, room temperature) with a 1:100 dilution of biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham, Les Ulis, France). After three rinses cells were incubated (15 mn) with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (1:100, Amersham). Coverslips were mounted in Moviol. Cultures at 4 days in vitro were fixed and treated as above, then incubated with a 1:5 dilution of a monoclonal antibody against the 200-kDa neurofilament subunit (Boehringer Mannheim). After incubation overnight at 4°C, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h (20°C) with anti-mouse Ig linked to fluorescein (1:100, Amersham). Student's t test was used to calculate differences between means. Differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05. To test the effect of increasing T3 levels on neuroblast proliferation, we injected 3 μg of T3 into the yolks of 5-day-old chick embryos and assessed the incorporation of [3H]thymidine at embryonic day 8. [3H]thymidine incorporation was found in the inner and external layers of the optic tectum of both control and treated embryos in both experiments (Fig. 1, a-c). Densitometry showed that T3 injection at day 5 significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporated into both inner and external layers of the optic tectum (p < 0.05 in each case). Applying [3H]thymidine just prior to sacrifice allowed us to assess the number of cells synthetizing DNA within a 2-h period. When the number of cells labeled with [3H]thymidine was counted in the inner and external layers of optic tectum from saline- and T3-treated embryos, we found similar results to those obtained by densitometry. As seen in Fig. 1, b and c, most labeled cells were in the inner zone. T3 significantly increased numbers of cells labeled in this inner zone as compared to the saline controls (p < 0.01). Our aim in these experiments was to use an antisense approach to evaluate the contributions of different TRs to neuroblast proliferation. Given the wide distribution of the neurogenic precursors throughout the neuroepithelium it is apparent that efficient and homogenous delivery of ODNs to such an extensive area is currently technically unfeasible. Thus, we applied ODNs to neurogenic precursors maintained in primary culture, checking first that T3 increased [3H]thymidine incorporation under these conditions (Fig. 2, a and b). A dose-dependent response to T3 was found (Fig. 2a). A significant effect over controls (no T3 added) was seen at 1 nM, with maximum effect at 10 nM T3. Increasing T3 concentrations to 1 μM, a pharmacological level, decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation as compared to that seen at 100 nM T3. Significant effects of T3 on neuroblast proliferation were found by assessing both the total amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into the cultures (Fig. 2a) and the percentage of cells labeled on histological examination (Fig. 2b). In both cases, the maximum T3-dependent increase in proliferation was approximately 30%. A major problem with ODN delivery is their instability due to nucleases in the intra- and extracellular compartments. Compaction with a cationic lipid (DOGS) should increase uptake and reduce exposure to extracellular nucleases. Fig. 3b, shows that complexing ODNs with a three time charge excess of DOGS increased the percentage of ODNs found in the intracellular medium 12 h after application from <2% when applying ODNs alone, to >95% when complexed with lipid. Moreover, gel electrophoresis of intracellular and extracellular extracts showed that if ODNs were applied without DOGS, as the majority remained in the extracellular compartment, they were completely degraded 12 h after application and no signal was seen in the intracellular compartment (Fig. 3a, lane 4). In contrast, when ODNs are applied with DOGS, no signal is found in the extracellular compartment, and the signal from the intracellular medium shows a single band migrating at the level of an 18-mer (Fig. 3a, lane 3). To determine whether the ODNs applied with DOGS were actually within the cells and not just adhering to the membrane, we used a rhodamine-labeled ODN and examined its distribution in cultures exposed to ODN alone and ODN complexed with a three times charge excess of DOGS. Fluorescent optic microscopy (Fig. 4a) and confocal microscopy (data not shown) showed that when the ODNs were applied with the lipospermine vector, a strong signal was detected in the cytoplasm. However, in the cultures exposed to ODNs applied alone no signal could be detected. We next tested the effects of antisense ODNs against different TRs on the T3-dependent proliferation of embryonic neuroblasts. First, we confirmed that the culture conditions gave rise to a wholly neuronal population. As shown in Fig. 4b, neurofilament immunocytochemistry carried out on cultures at 4 days in vitro showed a homogenous population of neuronal cells. As we had previously determined that lipospermine in creases ODN uptake by neuroblasts and that when 1 μM ODNs are applied over 95% is within the cell, we tested the effects of the ODNs at concentrations <1 μM. ODNs with an 18-mer randomized sequence of the same A, T, G, C content as ASα and ASβ were used as controls and were, respectively, designated as RDα and RDβ. We found that 150 nM ASα inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by 46% (Fig. 5a). This inhibition was significant (p < 0.05). Application of the same amount of ASβ inhibited proliferation by approximately 30%, but this decrease was not significant. Both the random oligonucleotides had small, non-significant effects on neuroblast proliferation (Fig. 5a). In some experiments the sense controls were used instead of random sequences, and again these ODNs did not have any significant effect on proliferation (data not shown). Next we carried out a dose-response study using TRα antisense ODN concentrations between 25 and 150 nM. ASα significantly and maximally inhibited (p < 0.05) proliferation of the neurogenic precursors at 100 nM producing 30% inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation. (Fig. 5b). The control ODN, RDα, had no significant effect on proliferation at any of the concentrations used (Fig. 5b). To examine whether both AS sequences (ASα and ASβ) were functional, we used a cotransfection assay, where first we transfected in the cells a reporter construct containing a TRE linked to the luciferase reporter gene, and 1 h later transfected in the antisense ODNs or their respective controls. Cells were exposed to T3 (10 nM) for a further 24 h and then assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 6, addition of T3 increased transcription 1.45-fold in controls, and both antisense ODNs inhibited this T3-dependent transcription from the TRE construct (p < 0.05, in both cases as compared to controls). Transfection of the random controls had no significant effect on T3-dependent transcription. To examine whether the ASα ODNs were functional in decreasing the levels of TRα protein, we used immunocytochemistry as the levels of protein expression were insufficient for immunoblotting. Cultures were grown in the presence of T3 and treated with lipospermine-complexed ODNs 36 h after plating. After a further 24 h, cells were fixed and immunocytochemistry carried out employing an antibody specific for c-erbA-α raised in rabbit (24Goldberg Y. Glineur C. Gesquière J.C. Ricouart A. Sap J. Vennström B. Ghysdal J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found expression of a nuclear-located protein in most of the cells in cultures exposed to 0.15 μM RDα (Fig. 7a). A similar nuclear reaction was revealed in control cultures not treated with ODNs (data not shown). In contrast, in cultures treated with 0.15 μM ASα, a nuclear signal was much reduced (Fig. 7b). Cultures treated with preimmune serum showed no nuclear reaction (data not shown). Our aim in these experiments was to analyze T3 effects on neuroblast proliferation and to determine the type of TR implicated in the response. We used neuroblasts from the chick embryo optic lobe, and our analysis was carried out during embryonic days 6-8 (or its equivalent in vitro). This window of time was chosen for four reasons. First, it is a period during which mitosis in the optic lobe is still occurring, albeit at a lower rate than during days 4-6 (25Hart Lavail J. Maxwell Cowan W. Brain Res. 1971; 28: 391-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 26Hart Lavail J. Maxwell Cowan W. Brain Res. 1971; 28: 421-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Jacobson M. Developmental Neurobiology. 3rd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1991: 282-283Google Scholar). Second, it is the earliest stage when embryonic T3 levels can be experimentally increased by injecting T3 into the yolk without inducing embryonic mortality.3 3B. A. Demeneix, unpublished observations. Third, it is the earliest stage at which pure neuronal cultures can be prepared (28Louis J.C. Pettman B. Courageot J. Rumigny J.F. Mandel P. Sensenbrenner M. Exp. Brain Res. 1981; 42: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fourth, TRα is first detected in the embryonic chick brain at this stage (7Forrest D. Sjöberg M. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1516-1528Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Indeed this observation of TRα in a number of tissues, including the optic lobe (11Forrest D. Hallbök F. Persson H. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) during early chick embryogenesis, coupled with the finding that TRβ is expressed in a more restricted fashion during later in development, led Forrest and co-workers (7Forrest D. Sjöberg M. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1516-1528Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Forrest D. Hallbök F. Persson H. Vennström B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to suggest that different TRs might have distinct functions in development. Similar patterns of TR expression, with TRα appearing well before TRβ are found during development of the rat (10Strait K.A. Schwartz H.L. Perez C.A. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Xenopus(29Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 30Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Tata J.R. Development. 1991; 112: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations provide the basis for the hypothesis that T3 has a role to play in the early stages of embryogenesis, and that TRα is implicated in T3-dependent responses occurring at this time. The data presented here show that T3 does affect neurogenesis. T3-treated embryos showed increased proliferation of neuroblasts as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1, a-c),"
https://openalex.org/W2061380831,"The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of neutral lipids between lipoproteins and is associated with high density lipoproteins (HDL). To understand the mechanism of interaction of CETP with HDL, we studied the binding of pure recombinant CETP to l-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcho-line (POPC)/apoA-I discoidal particles. Separating bound from free CETP using native gradient gel electrophoresis, complexes of CETP with 10-nm hydrodynamic diameter discoidal particles migrated with a diameter of 12–16 nm, compared with ∼7.5 nm for CETP. At lower ratios of CETP to discs, CETP bound to discs without displacement of apoA-I. CETP alone was unable to generate discoidal complexes. Cross-linking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that CETP bound to discs as monomers. Cross-linking of CETP to apoA-I in discs suggested proximity of apoA-I and CETP. By negative-stain electron microscopy, discoidal complexes containing CETP and CETP monoclonal antibody showed localization of antibody molecules to the disc edge, suggesting that CETP was bound to the disc edge. The binding of CETP to discs of different composition or size was studied. Discs (10-nm Stokes diameter) prepared with either apoA-I or apoA-II had a similar Kd (120 nm). Inclusion of 1 mol % cholesteryl oléate, 5 mol % cholesterol, or 6 mol % phosphatidylinositol increased the binding affinity of CETP 3–10 times (20–30 run). In comparison, plasma HDL3 had a Kd of ∼450 nM. For POPC/apoA-I discs, 10-nm discs bound CETP with much higher affinity than smaller 7.8-nm discs (Kd = 1–2 µm). 7.7-nm hydrodynamic diameter POPC/apoA-I spherical particles containing either triolein or cholesteryl oleate in their core bound CETP with higher affinity (Kd = 50–100 nm) than 7.8-nm POPC/apoA-I discs. Thus, CETP appears to bind to the perimeter of discoidal particles, possibly in a process in which flexible segments in apoA-I or apoA-II accommodate CETP at the disc edge. The binding of CETP to HDL is markedly influenced by overall particle size and shape and by lipid composition, and the increased binding affinity for cholesterol- and cholesteryl ester-containing discs suggests a higher affinity of CETP for nascent than mature HDL. The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of neutral lipids between lipoproteins and is associated with high density lipoproteins (HDL). To understand the mechanism of interaction of CETP with HDL, we studied the binding of pure recombinant CETP to l-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcho-line (POPC)/apoA-I discoidal particles. Separating bound from free CETP using native gradient gel electrophoresis, complexes of CETP with 10-nm hydrodynamic diameter discoidal particles migrated with a diameter of 12–16 nm, compared with ∼7.5 nm for CETP. At lower ratios of CETP to discs, CETP bound to discs without displacement of apoA-I. CETP alone was unable to generate discoidal complexes. Cross-linking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that CETP bound to discs as monomers. Cross-linking of CETP to apoA-I in discs suggested proximity of apoA-I and CETP. By negative-stain electron microscopy, discoidal complexes containing CETP and CETP monoclonal antibody showed localization of antibody molecules to the disc edge, suggesting that CETP was bound to the disc edge. The binding of CETP to discs of different composition or size was studied. Discs (10-nm Stokes diameter) prepared with either apoA-I or apoA-II had a similar Kd (120 nm). Inclusion of 1 mol % cholesteryl oléate, 5 mol % cholesterol, or 6 mol % phosphatidylinositol increased the binding affinity of CETP 3–10 times (20–30 run). In comparison, plasma HDL3 had a Kd of ∼450 nM. For POPC/apoA-I discs, 10-nm discs bound CETP with much higher affinity than smaller 7.8-nm discs (Kd = 1–2 µm). 7.7-nm hydrodynamic diameter POPC/apoA-I spherical particles containing either triolein or cholesteryl oleate in their core bound CETP with higher affinity (Kd = 50–100 nm) than 7.8-nm POPC/apoA-I discs. Thus, CETP appears to bind to the perimeter of discoidal particles, possibly in a process in which flexible segments in apoA-I or apoA-II accommodate CETP at the disc edge. The binding of CETP to HDL is markedly influenced by overall particle size and shape and by lipid composition, and the increased binding affinity for cholesterol- and cholesteryl ester-containing discs suggests a higher affinity of CETP for nascent than mature HDL. Human plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) 1The abbreviations used are: CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); CE, cholesteryl ester(s); LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); POPC, l-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcho-line; CO, cholesteryl oleate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; DMS, dimethyl suberimidate; GGE, gradient gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TR-CETP, tetra-methylrhodamine-labeled CETP; F-CETP, fluorescein-labeled CETP; mAb, monoclonal antibody. exchanges a variety of lipids (cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids) between lipoproteins. In human plasma, most of CETP is bound to high density lipoproteins (HDL) due to the high molar concentration and higher affinity of HDL for CETP relative to other lipoproteins. CETP's main effect on HDL is to exchange HDL cholesteryl esters (CE) with triglycerides in other lipoproteins. As this CE is the product of the esterification of tissue-derived cholesterol, its transfer to very low and low density lipoproteins (LDL) by CETP is an important step in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver (1Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL exists in several subclasses distinguishable by shape, density, and lipid and apolipoprotein content. Most plasma HDL are spherical particles, consisting of a shell of cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins (A-I, A-II, E, and Cs) and a core of neutral lipids (CE and triglycerides) (2Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sphere-shaped HDL originate from disc-shaped HDL particles that consist of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers lined at the edges with apoA-I. Upon lecithinxholesterol acyltransferase action, these discoidal particles accumulate CE and acquire the spherical shape seen in mature HDL (3Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Discoidal HDL may also arise as surface remnants of very low density lipoprotein or chylomicron lipolysis (4Musliner T.A. Long M.D. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Krauss R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 917-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that apoA-I dissociated from HDL particles can combine with phospholipids and cholesterol to form discs (5Clay M.A. Newnham H.H. Forte T.M. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Tall A.R. Small D.M. Nature. 1977; 265: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that discoidal particles may also be secreted from the liver (7Hamilton R.L. Williams M.C. Fielding C.J. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Johnson F.L. Babiak J. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 537-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and small intestine (9Green P.H. Tall A.R. Glickman R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Particles with pre-beta electrophoretic mobility and composition similar to discoidal HDL have been reported to be the initial plasma recipient of cellular cholesterol (11Castro G.R. Fielding C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and to bind CETP (12Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. Hogue M. Czarnecka H. Zawadzki Z. Weech P.K. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. Milne R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The interaction of CETP with lipoproteins is mediated by both hydrophobic and ionic interactions (14Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nishida H.I. Arai H. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16352-16360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP has a higher affinity for negatively charged particles, and because of this, the incorporation of lipolysis-derived fatty acids in lipoproteins enhances the binding of CETP and increases the ability of these particles to serve as substrates for CE transfer (16Sammett D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6687-6697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol content also appears to be important in CETP-lipoprotein interactions as HDL with higher levels of free cholesterol has lower levels of triglyceride transferred into it by CETP, probably because cholesterol modulates neutral lipid availability on the lipoprotein surface (17Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12235-12241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence that the protein component of HDL also determines CETP binding because, in plasma, CETP was found to be preferentially associated with HDL containing only apoA-I rather than apoA-I/apoA-II particles (18Moulin P. Cheung M.C. Bruce C. Zhong S. Cocke T. Richardson H. Tall A.R. J. Lipid. Res. 1994; 35: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, more CETP is associated with HDL containing human apoA-I than with HDL containing mouse apoA-I (19Hayek T. Chajek-Shaul T. Walsh A. Agellon L.B. Moulin P. Tall A.R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), again pointing to the importance of the apolipoproteins. However, it is not clear from such studies whether the increased binding is due to a higher affinity of CETP for specific apolipoproteins or whether they impart properties to an HDL particle (e.g. size, charge, and lipid composition) that favor the binding of CETP. Since plasma HDL comprises many species, we sought to understand the determinants of CETP binding to HDL by studying recombinant HDL particles of defined composition. In this study, we examined the interaction of purified CETP with particles whose properties have been described in detail previously (20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (and references therein): 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sparks D.L. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23250-23257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Davidson W.S. Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8859-8865Google Scholar). We also undertook this study to examine the possibility that CETP forms a dimer on the surface of HDL. Purified CETP forms self-associated species (24Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and at high concentrations, it displays an apparent molecular weight that is double its native size (25Takahashi K. Jiang X.-C. Sakai N. Yamashita S. Hirano K. Bujo H. Hiroyuki Y. Kusunoki J. Miura T. Kussie P. Matsuzawa Y. Saito Y. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). There is evidence for CETP dimerization in the secretory pathway as coexpression of wild-type CETP and a low activity structural variant (either an alternatively spliced or a mutant form) leads to decreased specific activity in the culture medium (25Takahashi K. Jiang X.-C. Sakai N. Yamashita S. Hirano K. Bujo H. Hiroyuki Y. Kusunoki J. Miura T. Kussie P. Matsuzawa Y. Saito Y. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Quinet E. Yang T.P. Marinos C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16891-16894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two aspects of CETP binding to HDL have been studied. First, focusing on 80:1 mol/mol POPC/apoA-I discoidal particles (20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (and references therein): 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we looked at the mechanism of CETP binding. We investigated whether CETP can displace apoA-I from discs, whether CETP alone can form discs, where on the particle it binds, and whether it forms a dimer. Second, we examined how binding to HDL is modulated by HDL size, apolipoprotein and lipid composition, and charge and whether there is a specific interaction with the apolipoprotein. l-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesteryl oleate (CO), cholesteryl linoleate, phosphatidylinositol (PI), triolein, egg phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol were from Sigma; bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) and dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) were from Pierce; and [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7–3H]cholesteryl oleate was from DuPont NEN. The succinimidyl esters of 5-(or 6-)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine and carboxyfiuorescein were from Molecular Probes, Inc. CETP was purified from a stably transfected line of Chinese hamster cells grown in a bioreactor as described previously (25Takahashi K. Jiang X.-C. Sakai N. Yamashita S. Hirano K. Bujo H. Hiroyuki Y. Kusunoki J. Miura T. Kussie P. Matsuzawa Y. Saito Y. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2060-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were purified from human HDL and used to prepare discoidal recombinant HDL by the cholate removal method, followed by purification by gel filtration (20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Davidson W.S. Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8859-8865Google Scholar). Spherical recombinant HDL particles were prepared by co-sonication of the lipids with apoA-I, followed by reisolation by ultracentrifugation as described (23Davidson W.S. Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8859-8865Google Scholar). [3H]CO-labeled LDL and [3H]CO-labeled HDL were prepared as described (14Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sammett D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6687-6697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CE transfer assays were performed by incubating CETP with labeled donor and unlabeled acceptor lipoprotein in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (TSE); then the acceptor was separated from the donor by either precipitation (27Tall A.R. Granot E. Brocia R. Tabas I. Hesler C.B. Williams K. Denke M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or ultracentrifugal flotation. Binding assays were performed by incubating mixtures of CETP and recombinant HDL in 50 µl of TSE and then analyzing them by native gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE). All incubation mixtures included 30 µg of BSA to minimize the adsorption of CETP to the gel matrix. The 4–30% gels were run in a Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3, in a Hoefer 600 electrophoresis system at 600 V for 16 h at ∼10 °C and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose at a current of 0.3 A for 16 h. The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat Carnation milk in TSE-T (0.1% Tween 20 in TSE) for 1 h, washed with TSE-T, incubated with the primary antibody in TSE-T for 1 h, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, and then developed with a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp. or DuPont NEN). In some experiments, the antibody was stripped off the blot and then reprobed with another antibody. Stripping was performed by incubating the membrane in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, at 50 °C for 30 min with agitation and then washing it twice in TSE-T. For cross-linking experiments, CETP and discoidal particles were combined in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C; 0.1 volume of a BS3 stock in PBS was added to give the indicated concentration and incubated for 30 min at room temperature; and then glycine was added to 7 mm to stop the reaction. The samples were analyzed by either SDS-PAGE or GGE. In some experiments, a dimethyl suberimidate stock in 1 m triethylamine buffer, pH 9.7, was used as the cross-linking agent. Negative-stain electron microscopy was done using a Jeol JEM-1200 EX II electron microscope. Samples were incubated in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 37 °C; mixed with an equal volume of 2% sodium phosphotungstate, pH 7.5; and then placed on the surface of a lacey Formvar/carbon-coated grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After 30 s, the excess liquid was blotted, the rest was allowed to dry, and the grid was examined within 1 h. The structures on the EM grids were assessed by one of the authors (A. T.) who did not know the identity of the samples. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, CETP was coupled to succinimidyl esters of either 5-(or 6-)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine or carboxyfiuorescein. CETP (100 µg) in 90 µl of PBS was mixed with 10 µl of 1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.3. The dye was rapidly dissolved in dry dimethylformamide to a final concentration of 10 mm, and 5 µl of this was added to the protein solution. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then run over a Sephadex G-50 column (equilibrated with PBS) to separate unincorporated dye. CETP conjugated with either dye (TR-CETP and F-CETP, respectively) had dye/protein molar ratios of ∼0.8. Both preparations were active in a transfer assay. To prevent loss of activity, the preparations of modified CETP were stored in 0.2 mg/ml BSA. Fluorescence measurements were done in an SLM-AMINCO 8000C spectrofluorometer. During fluorescence measurements, the photomultiplier tube was cooled to minimize electronic noise, samples were scanned five times at 2-nm intervals, and the spectra were averaged. Spectra were corrected for dilution effects caused by sample addition, and control spectra of samples without dye-conjugated CETP were subtracted. All measurements were made at room temperature. The diameter of a globular CETP molecule was calculated to be ∼50 A from the molecular mass of ∼53 kDa predicted from CETP's primary sequence (28Drayna D.A. Jarnagin A.S. McLean J. Henzel W. Kohr W. Fielding C. Lawn R. Nature. 1987; 327: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and using a typical density of 1.4 g/ml. Thus, in calculating the expected size of a putative CETP dimer, we assumed the intersubunit distance of a CETP dimer to be 50 Á. The theoretical efficiency (E) of fluorescence energy transfer for this system can be calculated from the following formula (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Pres, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar): E = Roe/(Ro6 + r6), where Ro is the Forster distance for the pair of dyes used and equals 50 A (30Johnson D.A. Voet J.G. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5717-5725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and r is the distance between them. For r = 50 Å, the efficiency would be 50%. Given that the dye/protein ratio was ∼0.8 for both preparations, only in 64% of potential dimers would both CETP molecules have a dye molecule, and only half of these (32%) would have two different dyes. Thus, the expected maximal energy transfer in this system due to the 50% efficiency is 16%. To understand the nature of CETP·HDL complexes, we studied the interaction of purified recombinant CETP with POPC/apoA-I discoidal particles. Binding assays were performed by incubating CETP and recombinant HDL, followed by electrophoresis on native gradient gels and immunoblotting with CETP mAb (TP2) (Fig. 1). Free CETP migrates primarily as a major band at 7.5 nm. The faint diffuse signal at higher molecular masses probably represents nonspecific interaction with the gel matrix since it was minimized by the addition of albumin (Fig. 1). Other interpretations are less likely; CETP contains only 1 mol of bound phospholipid/mol of CETP (41Wang S. Kussie P. Deng L. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and self-associated species (dimers and trimers) would have appeared as discrete bands. As shown by Coomassie Blue protein staining, the POPC/apoA-I discs were predominantly a single species 10 nm in diameter (lane 7). Following incubation of discs with CETP, the CETP signal was seen at higher molecular masses, representing binding to the discs. With increasing disc concentrations (lanes 2–6), the CETP signal moved to progressively higher apparent molecular masses, reaching a limiting size of ∼12–16 nm. We interpret the broadness of the bands at lower disc concentrations to arise either from heterogeneity of complexes or from partial dissociation of CETP·HDL complexes during electrophoresis. The large limiting size of these complexes suggests a major increase in hydrodynamic radius when discs bind CETP. The presence of CETP in large complexes could indicate that the discs have been transformed as a result of CETP activity. To assess this possibility, the binding of CETP to discs was studied as a function of CETP concentration and incubation time, and the distribution of both CETP and apoA-I was determined following native gel electrophoresis. When the concentration of CETP was varied, CETP was incorporated primarily into large complexes of 12–16 nm at lower concentrations (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3), but also gave rise to smaller complexes and free CETP at higher concentrations (lanes 4–6). The distribution of apoA-I was determined in the same experiment (Fig. 2B). The POPC/apoA-I discs alone gave rise to an apoA-I band of 9–11 nm (lane 1). At a lower CETP concentration, the distribution of apoA-I was not appreciably changed (lane 2). A separate higher band of CETP·apoA-I complexes is not seen because less than one-tenth of the apoA-I mass is in complexes with CETP. At higher CETP concentrations, an appreciable part of apoA-I is seen in complexes of similar size to CETP (i.e. 12–16 nm). In addition, lower migrating species of apoA-I appear, probably representing smaller discs, and only at the highest CETP concentration do small apoA-I-containing species appear, running below albumin (lane 6). In time course experiments, 1 µg of apoA-I in discs was incubated with 100 ng of CETP for 0–100 min (data not shown). At short incubation times, CETP was incorporated into complexes of 12–16 nm, without any appreciable change in apoA-I distribution. Prolonged incubation favored the formation of small apoA-I-containing species as seen in Fig. 2B (lane 6). The results suggest that complexes formed with brief incubation times (0–30 min) and at lower amounts of CETP (30–100 ng/1 µg of POPC/apoA-I discs) represent direct binding of CETP to discs. At high CETP concentration and longer incubation times, disc reorganization may occur, producing smaller complexes and release of apoA-I. To investigate whether the reorganization of the discs we observed at high CETP/disc ratios is due to CETP combining with phospholipids to form CETP-lipid complexes, we examined CETP's ability to form discoidal complexes by incubating it with POPC by the cholate removal method (20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions that lead to the formation of POPC/apoA-I discoidal complexes, the POPC/CETP mixture appeared opalescent, and analysis by native GGE indicated the presence of protein in particles larger than 20 nm in diameter, suggesting the formation of liposomes to which CETP binds (data not shown). We also examined CETP's ability to form discoidal complexes by incubating it with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar liposomes (Fig. 3). Apolipoproteins such as apoA-I readily form discoidal complexes in these assays as indicated by a clearing of turbidity. However, CETP had no effect, indicating lack of complex formation. In contrast, apoA-I readily formed complexes in the same assay. These results indicate that unlike apolipoproteins, CETP lacks the ability to form discoidal complexes on its own. Rather, it binds to phospholipid-apolipoprotein complexes that have already been formed. The large changes in hydrodynamic radius that result from binding of CETP to POPC/apoA-I discs suggested that CETP might be binding to discs as a dimer (Fig. 1). This was evaluated by chemical cross-linking studies using BS3 (Fig. 4) and DMS (Fig. 5). CETP incubated by itself in solution at physiological concentrations (∼2 µg/ml) (13Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. Hogue M. Czarnecka H. Zawadzki Z. Weech P.K. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. Milne R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with either DMS or BS3 cross-links to itself only to a negligible extent (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4; and Fig. 5, lanes 4–6). At high concentrations of CETP (200 µg/ml), the protein does cross-link to itself to form dimers, trimers, and tetramers (data not shown). CETP at ∼2 µg/ml incubated with apoHDL does not form higher molecular mass species (Fig. 5), indicating that CETP does not cross-link to apoA-I or apoA-II under these conditions. Similar results were obtained by cross-linking CETP in the presence of purified apoA-I (data not shown). When discoidal particles at physiological concentrations of apoA-I (∼1.5 mg/ml) are reacted with BS3, apoA-I is cross-linked to form two bands migrating at 60 and 75 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 13–16). These bands represent two forms of cross-linked apoA-I dimers (31Rye K.-A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FIG. 5CETP cross-linking to 80:1 mol/mol POPC/apoA-I discoidal particles and HDL apolipoproteins. CETP (100 ng) with 10 µg of apoHDL (lanes 1–3), with no addition (lanes 4–6), or with 0.3 µg (lanes 7–9) or 10 µg (lanes 10–12) of apoA-I in 80:1 mol/mol POPC/apoA-I particles was incubated with the indicated concentrations of DMS as described under “Materials and Methods.” After ending the reaction, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with mAb TP2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Samples of CETP incubated with discoidal particles were cross-linked with BS3, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted first with the anti-CETP mAb TP2, and then after stripping this antibody, reprobed with anti-apoA-I antiserum to identify the components of each band. CETP cross-linked in the presence of discs produces one ∼100-kDa band at 40 µm BS3 and a faint ∼150-kDa band at higher BS3 concentrations (Fig. 4, lanes 6–8). The same bands contained apoA-I (lanes 10–12). Since these bands containing apoA-I and CETP were not visualized in preparations of CETP alone or discs alone, they represent cross-linked species of CETP and apoA-I, probably CETP cross-linked to 1 and 2 molecules of apoA-I. 2The reason the apparent sizes of these bands are slightly larger than the sum of the molecular masses of their components (∼67 kDa for CETP and 38.5 kDa for apoA-I) may be due partly to the addition of multiple cross-linker molecules that reacted monovalently with the proteins and partly to the inability of SDS molecules to bind to the intramolecularly cross-linked proteins to the same extent as to unreacted proteins. A CETP-containing band that migrates slightly faster than the monomelic form of CETP appears at high levels of cross-linking, probably indicating an intramolecularly cross-linked form of the protein that is unable to be unfolded by SDS. Similar cross-linked species were seen by using DMS and could be visualized with CETP mAb (Fig. 5, lanes 8, 9, 11, and 12) and with apoA-I antiserum (data not shown), indicating cross-linking of CETP to apoA-I. The interpretation that the two higher molecular mass cross-linked species represent CETP·apoA-I complexes was supported in further experiments in which CETP was cross-linked to discs, immunoprecipitated with CETP mAb (TP2-Sepha-rose), and then analyzed by Western blotting with CETP and apoA-I antibodies: the immunoprecipitated cross-linked species contained both CETP and apoA-I (data not shown). To assess the possibility that the 150-kDa band might contain CETP dimer in addition to CETP-(apoA-I)2 complexes, we compared by densitometric analysis the intensity of the band at this position with the intensity of the band corresponding to the CETP·apoA-I band (∼100 kDa). Since the formation of a cross-linked CETP dimer is a bimolecular reaction, while the formation of a CETP(apoA-I)2 complex is a trimolecular reaction, at the lower cross-linker concentrations, CETP dimer formation should be favored over CETP(apoA-I)2 formation. However, in Fig. 4, the ratio of the CETP signal to apoA-I signal in the 150-kDa band did not change with BS3 concentration and remained at 0.5 ± 0.2, while the same ratio for the 115-kDa band was 1.2 ± 0.2. This suggests that the 150-kDa species consists predominantly of CETP(apoA-I)2 complexes. This result also confirms the native gel binding experiments that show CETP binding to discs conta"
https://openalex.org/W2006447473,"Activation of the TAL1 (or SCL) gene, originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation, is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The protein products of this gene contain the basic-helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers. TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical-induced erythroleukemia cell lines in vitro suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation. Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo), we investigated whether the expression or activity of the TAL1 gene and its protein products were affected by Epo in splenic erythroblasts from mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVA cells). Epo elicited a rapid, dose-related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs. An Epo-inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein. Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo-induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein. These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages.

The TAL1 (also known as SCL and TCL5) gene was originally identified through its location at a chromosome breakpoint in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1Begley C.G. Aplan P.D.

Although involved in reciprocal translocations with the T-cell receptor-α/δ and, in one case, -β locus (4Fitzgerald T.J. Neale G.A.M. Raimondi S.C. Goorha R.M. Blood. 1991; 78: 2686-2695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the gene is more frequently affected by interstitial deletions upstream of its coding region which result in the head-to-tail fusion of the TAL1 and SIL (for SCL interrupting locus) genes (5Aplan P.D.

Overall, deregulated TAL1 expression may occur in as many as 30% of individuals with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, making this the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in this disorder. The protein products of the TAL1 gene contain a dimerization motif characteristic of a large family of genes involved in the regulation of cell fate (10Garrell J. Campuzano S.

The HLH motif promotes the formation of protein hetero- and homodimers, while an adjacent region enriched in basic amino acids and found in many of the proteins of this class mediates sequence-specific DNA binding (13Voronova A.

Distinct subgroups of HLH genes can be recognized on the basis of sequence homology, pattern of expression, and function. Four bHLH proteins, of which MyoD is the prototype, are expressed in developing muscle and share the ability to induce myogenic differentiation when expressed in certain cell lines (18Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 19Weintraub H. Davis R.

The three genes TAL1, TAL2, and LYL-1 show greater than 80% identity within their basic and HLH domains and share an additional similarity in that each was isolated as a result of its involvement in a human leukemia (8Baer R. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 341-347PubMed Google Scholar). The recently identified bHLH-EC2 gene also shows considerable sequence homology to and overlaps with TAL1 in its expression (20Quertermous E.E.

TALI RNA has been detected in megakaryocytic, erythroid, and mast cell lines (21Green A.R. Salvaris E. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar, 22Visvader J. Begley C.G.

Romeo P.-H. Vainchenker W. Mathieu-Mahul D. Blood. 1993; 81: 647-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells (25Hwang L.-Y. Siegelman M. Davis L. Oppenheimer-Marks N. Baer R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3043-3046PubMed Google Scholar) and neurons (23Green A.R. Lints T. Visvader J. Harvey R. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 653-660PubMed Google Scholar) have also been found to express TAL1 RNA and protein, and studies of its expression during embryogenesis suggest the gene may have actions in vascular, neural, and hematopoietic development (26Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that TAL1 regulates aspects of erythroid differentiation. TAL1 RNA and protein are expressed in embryonic and adult erythroid progenitors (21Green A.R. Salvaris E. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar, 23Green A.R. Lints T. Visvader J. Harvey R. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 653-660PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell lines, increasing significantly with hexamethylene bisacetamide- or Me2SO-induced differentiation (21Green A.R. Salvaris E. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar, 22Visvader J. Begley C.G. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar, 27Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enforced expression of TAL1 promotes the differentiation of MEL lines even in the absence of chemical inducer, while antisense-mediated inhibition of TAL1 expression blocks Me2SO- and hexamethylene bisacetamide-stimulated differentiation (27Aplan P.D. Nakahara K. Orkin S.H. Kirsch I.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Since the terminal events of erythropoiesis are controlled by the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo), these observations suggested that the expression of the TAL1 gene or the activity of its protein products might be regulated by this growth factor. To analyze the effects of Epo on TAL1 mRNA and protein expression we have used erythroblasts purified from the spleens of mice infected with an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVA cells). In contrast to established MEL lines, these cells show an absolute dependence on Epo for their initial survival in culture and undergo apoptosis if the growth factor is withheld (28Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In the presence of Epo, FVA cells complete a full program of differentiation over a period of 48–60 h, including nuclear extrusion with the formation of reticulocytes (29Koury M.J. Sawyer S.T. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 121: 526-532Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This cell system has been extensively characterized with regard to Epo's effects on hemoglobin synthesis (30Bondurant M.C. Lind R.N. Koury M.J. Ferguson M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal maturation (31Koury S.T. Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and programmed cell death (28Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), and represents an excellent model of normal erythroid differentiation. Our experiments indicate that sequential activating and inhibitory influences, operating at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, act on the TAL1 locus in Epo-stimulated erythroblasts. Furthermore, they establish a link between signaling by this hematopoietic growth factor and a family of transcription factors many of whose members have been shown to specify cell fate. CD2F1 mice of 8–12 weeks of age were given 104 spleen focus-forming units of an anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus by tail vein injection. The animals were sacrificed 2 weeks later and erythroblasts purified from spleen cell suspensions by sedimentation at unit gravity through a linear gradient of 1 to 2% bovine serum albumin as described (29Koury M.J. Sawyer S.T. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 121: 526-532Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). FVA-induced erythroblasts were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 30% fetal calf serum, 1% deionised bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mM α-thioglycerol with the indicated concentration of recombinant human Epo (Ortho). Cells were collected at the indicated times of culture and washed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline prior to use. Total cellular RNA was isolated from erythroblasts using a single step guanidine thiocyanate/phenol method (RNAzol; BioTecx) (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). RNA samples (10 μg) were fractionated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels containing 0.66 M formaldehyde and transferred by capillary action to nylon membranes (Nytran; Schleicher and Schuell). Baked membranes were prehybridized for 4–6 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC (1 × = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 µg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 1.5 × 10e cpm/ml radiolabeled probe in the same buffer and washed with 2 × SSC for 20 min at room temperature, 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C, and 0.1 × SSC for 30 min at 65 °C. Following washing, blots were exposed to film and the resulting autoradiograms analyzed by laser scanning densitometry (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.). RNA loading was normalized to 28 S ribosomal RNA using a photographic negative of the ethidium bromide-stained gel as described (33Wickrema A. Bondurant M.C. Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 78: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data from four independent experiments were used in determining the mean RNA level ±S.E. for both the 5.0- and 3.7-kb TAL1 mRNAs as a function of time following Epo addition. Differences in mean RNA levels in Epo-treated versus Epo-deprived cells were analyzed by a two-tailed t test. A 535-base pair BanVXbäl restriction fragment of the mouse TAL1 cDNA was used as probe. This region does not contain the conserved basic and HLH domains to avoid potential cross-hybridization to related HLH sequences. The GATA-1 probe was an XhoI/XhoI restriction fragment of plasmid pXM-GF-1 containing the full coding sequence of murine GATA-1 (34Tsai S.-F. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), the Id1 probe was a BamHI/EcoRI restriction fragment of plasmid pMH18ΔR containing bases 5–927 of murine Idi sequence (35Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar), and the LYL-1 probe was a polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA containing bases –28–422 of murine LYL-1 sequence (22Visvader J. Begley C.G. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar). All probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random primer extension (36Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from FVA-induced erythroblasts at the indicated times using a Dounce homogenizer as described previously (30Bondurant M.C. Lind R.N. Koury M.J. Ferguson M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and frozen overnight at –70 °C in a buffer containing 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. In vitro transcription was carried out as described (37Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 × 107 nuclei and 250 μCi of [a-32P]UTP per reaction for 30 min at 30 °C. Briefly, the resulting radiolabeled RNA was treated with DNase I and proteinase K, extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and ethanol, and resuspended in diethylpyroearbonate-treated water. Nitrocellulose filters containing the indicated probes immobilized by baking were prehybridized for at least 4 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.05 mg/ml poly(A), and 0.25 mg/ml herring sperm DNA and then incubated in the same buffer containing radiolabeled RNA adjusted to give an equal number of counts per filter. Hybridization was carried out for 96 h at 42 °C and filters washed in 2 × SSC for 10 min at room temperature and 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA for 70 min at 42 °C with three changes. The identical TAL1 cDNA probe used for Northern blot hybridization was used in nuclear run-off assays. The actin probe was a PstI/PstI fragment of the mouse actin clone PAM91 containing the entire a-actin coding region (38Minty A.J. Caravatti M. Robert B. Cohen A. Daubas P. Weydert A. Gros F. Buckingham M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 2561008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed filters were exposed to film and the resulting autoradiograms analyzed by laser scanning densitometry. Binding of radiolabeled RNA to immobilized plasmid (pGEM-4Z) carried out in parallel was minimal and not included in data analysis. Data from five independent experiments were used to determine the mean fold increase in transcriptional rate ± S.E. as a function of time following Epo addition. Differences from that at initiation of culture were analyzed by a two-tailed t test. Cultures of FVA cells were incubated for 2 h with or without 2 units/ml recombinant Epo, following which actinomycin D was added at a concentration of 5 µg/ml. Previous studies established that this concentration of aetinomycin D was sufficient to inhibit transcription in FVA cells without significant toxicity during the period analyzed (33Wickrema A. Bondurant M.C. Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 78: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated at 30 min intervals for up to 3 h following aetinomycin D treatment and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization as described. The resulting autoradiograms were analyzed by laser scanning densitometry, and the mean percentage of initial mRNA remaining ± S.E. from four independent experiments was expressed for both Epo-treated and Epo-deprived cells as a function of time following addition of aetinomycin D to culture (33Wickrema A. Bondurant M.C. Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 78: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Linear regression analysis was used to determine the best fit of the line for log transformed data and 95% confidence intervals determined for slopes. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against a bacterial expressed malE-fusion containing the 72 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of murine TAL1 has been previously described (26Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total immunoglobulin was purified from serum obtained prior to immunization on protein A-Sepharose and used at an equivalent concentration where indicated. Equal amounts (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) of FVA cell nuclear protein prepared as described for electrophoretic mobility shift analysis were fractionated on gradient (8–15%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with antibody as described (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and binding detected by enhanced chemilummeseence (ECL, Amersham). Autoradiograms were analyzed by laser scanning densitometry, and data from four independent experiments were used in determining the mean TAL1 protein level as a function of time following Epo addition. The ratio of TAL1 protein levels in Epo-treated versus Epo-deprived cultures was determined at each time point and differences from that at initiation of culture, assigned a value of 1.0, were analyzed by a two-tailed t test. Nuclear extracts were prepared from FVA cells using the method of Dignam et al. (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Washed FVA cells were suspended in a chilled buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, and nuclei isolated with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, washed once, and resuspended in chilled 1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, containing 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM sodium vanadate. The resulting extracts were stirred on ice for 30 min, clarified by centrifugation at 28,000 × g for 20 min, and stored in aliquote at –70 °C until used. Double stranded oligonucleotides of the indicated sequences were end-labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated with nuclear extracts (20 μg) diluted in 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20 mM MgCL_, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, with or without the indicated antibodies for 20 min at room temperature in a binding buffer containing 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM KCl, 60 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, in a total volume of 30 μl. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using 5% Polyacrylamide gels as described (14Davis R.L. Cheng P.-F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed to film and analyzed by autoradiography. The sequences of the upper strand of each pair of oligonucleotides with the Ε-box sequences underlined are: μΕ2, CCTGCAGCAGCTG-GCAGGAA; mutant μΕ2, CCTGCAGCCGCTTGCAGGAA; preferred site, ACCTGAACAGATGGTCGGCT: mutant preferred site, ACCT-GAACCGATTGTCGGCT. Erythroblasts were washed once with phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium containing 20% dialyzed fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then cultured at a density of 4 × 10′Vml in medium containing 0.9 mCi/ml [!2P]orthophosphate (ICN Biomedicals) with and without Epo (5 units/ml) for the indicated times. Following labeling, cells were pelleted and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared as described above. Volumes of extract containing an equivalent number of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were diluted in 1 mil EDTA, 1 nui EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin to which antibody (1:1000) or preimmune immunoglobulin was added. The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 4 h and antigen-antibody complexes isolated with protein A-Sepharose (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times, boiled for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide loading buffer, and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacryl-amide gels. Dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Incubation of FVA cells with recombinant Epo resulted in proportional increases in the steady state levels of both the 5.0- and 3.7-kb TAL1 mRNAs within 30 min of growth factor addition (FIG. 1, FIG. 2). The maximum stimulated level was observed at 2 h, with a mean increase after correction for RNA loading of 3.5- and 3.0-fold for the larger and smaller species, respectively, relative to that measured at the initiation of culture (Fig. 2). A dose-dependent increase in TAL1 mRNA was noted over the range of Epo concentrations observed in response to anemia (0.16–2 units/ml), with near-maximal responses obtained at concentrations greater than 1 unit/ml (not shown). Message was detected for at least 72 h following Epo addition.FIG. 2Time course of TAL1 mRNA accumulation in FVA-induced erythroblasts. Total RNA was extracted from FVA cells cultured in the presence (■, ●) or absence (□, O) of Epo (2 units/ml) for the indicated times and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Autoradiograms of hybridized filters were analyzed by laser scanning densitometry. Mean induction t S.E. from four independent experiments is expressed as a function of time in h after Epo addition for the 5.0-kb (O, ●) and 3.7-kb (□, ■) TAL1 mRNAs.

The propensity of these cells to undergo apoptosis in the absence of Epo (28Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) precluded their being cultured under these conditions for longer periods. The increase in TAL1 message observed in Epo-treated FVA cell cultures did not reflect a general change in RNAs encoding transcription factors. Steady state levels of mRNA for GATA-1, expressed in many of the same cell types as TAL1, did not increase for at least 2–4 h of culture and that of the related HLH gene LYL-1 was not affected by Epo addition (not shown). The effect of Epo on TAL1 transcription was analyzed in nuclear run-off studies (Fig. 3). Consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis, transcription of the TAL1 gene was detected in FVA cells at the initiation of culture. In Epo-treated cells, TAL1 transcription increased a mean 2.3-fold within 1 h following the addition of growth factor and remained above the initial level for at least 4 h. No effect of Epo was seen on actin transcription in the first 4 h of culture, consistent with previous measurements of actin mRNA levels in Epo-treated FVA cells during this period (33Wickrema A. Bondurant M.C. Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 78: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that Epo-stimulated accumulation of TAL1 message results in part from an increase in transcription of the gene. To determine whether the Epo-induced increase in steady state levels of TAL1 mRNAs also reflected any change in their stability, TAL1 message was measured by Northern blot analysis in cultures treated with actinomycin D at a concentration previously determined to inhibit transcription (33Wickrema A. Bondurant M.C. Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 78: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two major species of TAL1 mRNA, which diverge in their 3′ untranslated regions and utilize different polyadenylation sites (42Begley C.G. Visvader J. Green A.R. Aplan P.D. Metcalf D. Kirsch I.R. Gough N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), were found to have different half-lives. Treatment of FVA cells with Epo (2 units/ml) for 2 h significantly affected the slope of the decay curve of the 5.0-kb TAL1 message (p < 0.05), resulting in a prolongation in the calculated half-life from approximately 2 to 3.5 h (Fig. 4). The stability of the 3.7-kb message was unaltered by Epo treatment, with the calculated half-life remaining approximately 1 h in both the presence and absence of Epo. Thus, RNA stabilization also contributes to Epo-induced accumulation of TALI mRNA in Friend virus-induced erythroblasts. Nuclear TAL1 protein was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal antibody generated to carboxyl-terminal sequences. A series of TAL1 proteins with molecular masses of 45–47 kDa increased in abundance by approximately 2-fold as determined by densitometry in Epo-treated versus Epo-deprived cells 1–2 h following the increase in message (Fig. 5, A and B). Another TAL1 protein with a molecular mass of 24 kDa was expressed transiently in Epo-stimulated cells, peaking at 2 h and then largely disappearing by 4 h after growth factor addition (Fig."

The resulting GlcNSO3(3-OSO3) units are largely restricted to heparin chains with high affinity for antithrombin (HA heparin). Low affinity (LA) heparin fails to serve as a substrate in the 3-O-sulfotransferase reaction yet contains potential 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites (Kusche, M., Torri, G., Casu, B., and Lindahl, U.

O-Desulfated, re-N-sulfated LA heparin, as well as an octasaccharide fraction isolated after heparinase I digestion of LA heparin, both yielded labeled HA components following incubation with solubilized mouse mastocytoma microsomal enzymes and [35S]adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′phosphosulfate (PAPS), suggesting that the 3-O-sulfotransferase may be inhibited by sulfated saccharide sequences outside the 3-O-sulfate acceptor region. Indeed, the addition of LA heparin precluded enzymatic 3-O-sulfation of a synthetic pentasaccharide substrate. The Km for the pentasaccharide was determined to ~be 6 μΜ. Incubations of mixed pentasaccharide substrate and saccharide inhibitors revealed Ki values for intact LA heparin and for a heparin octasaccharide fraction of ~1.3 and ~0.7 μΜ, respectively. Inhibition experiments with selectively desulfated heparin indicated that both IdoA 2-O-sulfate and GlcN 6-O-sulfate groups contributed to the inhibition of the 3-O-sulfotransferase. By contrast, chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate showed no significant inhibitory activity. It is proposed that the regulation of GlcN 3-O-sulfation during biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate depends on the topological organization of the membrane-bound enzyme machinery in the intact cell.

In commercial heparin preparations, only a fraction, usually 30–40% of the molecules, contains the AT binding sequence and has high affinity for AT (HA heparin). The proportion of HA components in preparations of heparan sulfate from various sources is generally, but not invariably, lower than in heparin (12Lane D.A. Pejler G. Flynn A.M. Thompson E.A.

Apart from the 3-O-sulfate group, no apparent qualitative structural differences between HA- and LA heparin/heparan sulfate have been found.Heparin and heparan sulfate are synthesized as proteoglycans that consist of multiple polysaccharide chains attached to various distinct core protein species. The polymer initially formed has a simple structure of repeating -GlcA-GlcNAc-units. In the presence of PAPS, this polysaccharide is carried through a series of modification reactions which involves N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc units, C-5-epimerization of GlcA to IdoA residues, and finally incorporation of O-sulfate groups at various positions (18Kusche M. Bäckström G. Riesenfeld J. Petitou M. Choay J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15474-15484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the reactions are generally incomplete, variable proportions of the disaccharide units are only partially modified, as reflected by the structural heterogeneity typical of the mature polysaccharide chains. The selection of target units in the various reactions is partially controlled by the substrate specificities of the corresponding enzymes but is also influenced by other, yet poorly defined factors.The biosynthesis of the AT binding region has been the subject of a number of studies. Kusche et al. (18Kusche M. Bäckström G. Riesenfeld J. Petitou M. Choay J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15474-15484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed, using oligosaccharide sulfate acceptors, that incorporation of the critical GlcN 3-O-sulfate group concludes the biosynthetic process, adding the final modification to a saccharide sequence already endowed with all other structural components required for AT binding. The sequence of hexuronic acid units within the 3-O-sulfate acceptor structure, unit 3, a GlcA, and unit 5, an IdoA residue (Fig. 1), was found to be essential for 3-O-sulfation and generation of a functional AT binding region (19Kusche M. Oscarsson L.-G. Reynertson R. Rodén L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7400-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of LA heparin suggested the presence of saccharide structures predicted to serve as an acceptor sequence for the 3-O-sulfotransferase; yet incubation of LA heparin with solubilized mastocytoma microsomal sulfotransferases, in the presence of [35S]PAPS, failed to produce any radiolabeled HA components (17Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present study suggest that the inability of the 3-O-sulfotransferase to act on LA heparin was due to strong inhibition of the enzyme by sulfated saccharide sequences other than the 3-O-sulfate acceptor site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES MaterialsA microsomal fractions was prepared from a transplantable mouse mastocytoma (20Furth J. Hagen P. Hirsch E.I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1957; 95: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) according to Jacobsson et al. (21Jacobsson I. Bäckström G. Höök M. Lindahl U. Feingold D.S. Malmström A. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2975-2982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled PAPS and heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum (EC 4.2.2.7) were obtained from Sigma. Radiolabeled [35S]PAPS was prepared essentially following the procedure of Renosto and Segel (22Renosto F. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using a yeast homogenate (23Robbins P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 964-977Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sephadex G-50 (superfine grade) and Sephadex G-15 were from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology. Human AT (given by L.-O. Andersson at Pharmacia) was covalently coupled to Sepharose-4B (24Höök M. Björk I. Hopwood J. Lindahl U. FEBS Lett. 1976; 66: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (stage 14, Inolex Pharmaceutical Division, Park Forest South, IL) was purified by repeated precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride from 1.2 M NaCl (25Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2817-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was then separated into HA and LA fractions by affinity chromatography on AT-Sepharose (26Laurent T.C. Tengblad A. Thunberg L. Höök M. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The procedure (continuous salt gradient elution) was scaled up to accommodate samples of 300 mg, using a column of 600-ml bed volume. Polysaccharides in the effluent which were either not adsorbed to the affinity matrix or emerged at s 0.7 M NaCl concentration, distinctly separated from the HA material, were combined into one LA pool. Heparin was O-desulfated by treating the pyridinium salt of the polysaccharide with dimethyl sulfoxide, 10% methanol at 100 °C for 2 h (27Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) or for shorter periods of time to achieve partial desulfation. The products were dialyzed against water and were then re-N-sulfated by reaction with trimethylamine-sulfurtrioxide complex (28Levy L. Petracek F.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 190: 901-905Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Heparin preparations preferentially O-desulfated either at C-2 of IdoA or at C-6 of GlcN units were as described (29Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic heparin pentasaccharide (generated largely as described in Ref. 30Petitou M. Duchaussoy P. Lederman L. Choay J. Jacquinet J.-C. Sinaÿ P. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 167: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) having the structure, GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-OMe, i.e. a sequence corresponding to the AT binding region except for the lack of a 3-O-sulfate group at unit 4 (see Fig. 1), was given by M. Petitou (Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France). Chondroitin sulfate isolated from bovine nasal septa was given by Å. Wasteson (University Hospital, Linköping, Sweden) and dermatan sulfate from pig intestinal mucosa by L. Rodén (University of Alabama at Birmingham); the latter polysaccharide was freed from heparin-like compounds by treatment with HNO2 (31Teien A.N. Abildgaard U. Höök M. Thromb. Res. 1976; 8: 859-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).MethodsIncubations of Saccharides with Microsomal 3-O-Sulfotransferase—Heparin-related saccharides were tested as acceptors for GlcN 3-O-sulfate groups by incubation with detergent-solubilized mouse mastocytoma microsomal proteins in the presence of [35S]PAPS. Incubation mixtures contained, in a total volume of 100 μl, 0.05 M HEPES (pH 7.4), the amounts of saccharide indicated, 1–2 mg of microsomal protein, 25 μCi of [35S]PAPS, 1 mm unlabeled PAPS, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 3.5 μΜ NaF, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Deviations from these standard conditions will be indicated as required. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, during which period the synthetic pentasaccharide substrate (at 20 μΜ; essentially substrate saturation) was 3-O-35S-sulfated at a constant rate (data not shown). The incubations were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. Labeled saccharide products in the supernatant with high affinity for AT were detected by affinity chromatography on a 3-ml column of AT-Sepharose. The sample was applied in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 M NaCl, and the column was then thoroughly washed with the same buffer before elution of HA components with buffered 2 M NaCl (stepwise elution procedure). Effluent fractions of ~2 ml were analyzed for 35S by liquid scintillation counting. Alternatively, the column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl before application of the sample, and was then washed with at least 3 bed volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a linear salt gradient (total volume, 80 ml) extending from 50 mm to 3 M buffered NaCl (gradient elution procedure). Occasionally, the remaining [35S]PAPS was removed before affinity chromatography by passing the sample through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.2 M NH4HCO3, followed by lyophilization of the excluded fraction. In some experiments, the 3-O-35S-sulfated pentasaccharide product was detected by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 190 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (superfine grade) in 1 M NaCl.Degradation of Heparin—Deaminative cleavage of heparin by treatment with HNO2 at pH 1.5 (cleavage at N-sulfated GlcN units) was performed as described (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Even numbered heparin oligosaccharides were generated by partial deaminative cleavage, reduction of the products with NaBH4, and separation by gel chromatography (33Pejler G. Lindahl U. Larm O. Scholander E. Sandgren E. Lundblad A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5197-5201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Heparin oligosaccharides were also obtained by controlled, limited digestion with heparinase I (34Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A sample (10 mg) of LA heparin was incubated, in a total volume of 0.5 ml, with 32 mIU (20 Sigma units) of enzyme and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin in 5 mm NaH2PO4, 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). The reaction was monitored by removing aliquots and measuring A232 nm after appropriate dilution in 30 mm HCl. After incubation at 30 °C for 11 h, an additional 8 mIU of heparinase was added, and incubation was continued for 3 more h to reach ~50% completion of the digestion. The reaction mixture was boiled for 2 min, centrifuged to remove denatured proteins, and separated by gel chromatography on a (1 × 190 cm) column of Sephadex G-50, equilibrated with 1 M NaCl. Effluent fractions were analyzed for hexuronic acid and fractions contributing to an octasaccharide peak were combined, concentrated, and desalted by passage through a column of Sephadex G-15 in 0.2 M NH4HCO3, followed by lyophilization.Sequence Analysis of Heparin—A procedure was developed to determine the sequence of monosaccharide residues in heparin, toward the reducing end of the chain starting from an N-acetylated GlcN unit (see scheme in Fig. 2). Heparin (5 mg) was subjected to limited cleavage by treatment with 10 μl of deamination reagent (56 mg of NaNO2/ml of H2O) in a total volume of 2 ml of H2O acidified to pH 1.5 with H2SO4. After 3 h at 2 °C the reaction mixture was neutralized with Na2CO3 and was then reduced with 1 mCi of NaB3H4 (5–15 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN). Labeled saccharides were recovered after passage through Sephadex G-15 (4Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 100: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and were then separated by gel chromatography on a (1 × 190 cm) column of Sephadex G-50, eluted with 1 m NaCl. Oligosaccharides larger than tetrasaccharides were combined, desalted (passage through Sephadex G-15), and N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis (6 × 106 cpm of 3H-labeled saccharides and 2.5 mg of hydrazine sulfate in 250 μl of 70% hydrazine, 30% H2O; 100 °C; 2 h) (35Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The products were passed through a PD-10 column in 0.2 μ NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and were then cleaved at N-unsubstituted GlcN units by high pH deamination (500 μl of 5.6 M NaNO2, 200 μl of 0.4 M acetic acid, pH 4.5; room temperature; 10 min). The resultant labeled oligosaccharides were again separated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50, eluted with 1 M NaCl. Di- and tetrasaccharides were pooled and desalted. The disaccharides were directly analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC as described below. The tetrasaccharides were cleaved by low pH deamination, and the released 3H-labeled disaccharides were recovered and identified. For further information see “Results.”Fig. 2Strategy employed to define saccharide sequences in a heparin chain, toward the reducing terminus from N-acetylated GlcN units. The initial sequence (top) represents a heparin chain composed of hexuronic acid units (circles), N-sulfated GlcN units (filled squares) and a single N-acetylated GlcN unit (stippled square); the reducing terminus is to the right. Partial deaminative cleavage of glucosaminidic bonds of N-sulfated GlcN units (reaction with HNO2 at pH 1.5), followed by reduction of the products with NaB3H4, results in the formation of a series of oligosaccharides with reducing terminal [3H]aManR units (striped arrowheads). Hexasaccharides and larger fragments are recovered by gel chromatography and are then N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis and cleaved at the site of the resultant N-unsubstituted GlcN unit by treatment with HNO2 at pH 4.5. The released, N-sulfated oligosaccharides are separated with regard to size, and the tetrasaccharides and larger oligosaccharides are further degraded by exhaustive low pH deamination. Identification of the 3H-labeled disaccharides thus formed will reveal the structures of the corresponding disaccharide units in the native polymer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additional Analytical Methods—3H-Labeled HexA-aManR disaccharides were separated by anion-exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column (Whatman) (17Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); effluent radioactivity was quantified either by a radio flow detector (17Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in a Beckman model LS 6000 IC liquid scintillation spectrometer.The molar concentration of glycosaminoglycans (poly- and oligosaccharides) was estimated by the carbazole reaction for hexuronic acid (36Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5138) Google Scholar), arbitrarily assuming a 33% hexuronic acid content, an Mr of 15,000 for all polysaccharide preparations, and an Mr of 300 for the average monosaccharide unit.RESULTSThe incitement to the present study was the previous finding that solubilized mastocytoma microsomal sulfotransferases could catalyze GlcN 3-O-sulfation of oligosaccharide acceptors (18Kusche M. Bäckström G. Riesenfeld J. Petitou M. Choay J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15474-15484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but were unable to convert LA- into HA heparin (17Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This failure could be due to the lack of the appropriate acceptor structure in LA heparin, as claimed by Linhardt et al. (37Linhardt R.J. Wang H. Loganathan D. Bae J.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2380-2387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, 3-O-sulfation might be restricted by inhibitory, as yet unidentified, structural elements present in the polysaccharide chain. Each of these possibilities was evaluated in the present study.Occurrence of a Potential 3-O-Sulfate Acceptor Site in LA heparin—Our current view of the structure of the AT binding region in heparin (and in heparan sulfate) is illustrated in Fig. 1. Two structural variants have been identified within the native, functional binding region, i.e. the N-substituent of unit 2, which may be either an acetyl or a sulfate group, and the O-substituent at C6 of unit 4, either a hydrogen atom or a sulfate group (7Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Bäekström G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12368-12376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, when the GlcN unit 2 is N-acetylated, the IdoA unit 1 (outside the actual binding region) appears predominantly to lack an O-sulfate group at C-2, whereas an N-sulfated unit 2 is preceded by an O-sulfated unit 1.The occurrence of potential 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites in LA heparin was previously investigated by analysis of deamination products generated by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (17Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions glycosidic bonds of N-sulfated GlcN units are cleaved, along with conversion of the amino sugars to terminal 2,5-anhydro-mannose (subsequently reduced to aManR) units, whereas N-acetylated GlcN units are resistant. Deamination of LA heparin (from pig intestinal mucosa) yielded the tetrasaccharide, IdoA-GlcNAc(6-OSO3)-GleA-aManR(±6-OSO3), corresponding to units 1–4 in Fig. 1, in amounts approaching 1 mol/mol of polysaccharide chain. This tetrasaccharide thus would express the distinguishing structural features of the AT binding region, except for the 3-O-sulfate group. It was proposed that LA heparin contains appreciable proportions of nonutilized 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites, such that the structural difference between HA and LA heparin would primarily be restricted to the presence or absence of this particular sulfate group.The disaccharide unit 5–6 in the AT binding region has the same structure, -IdoA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-, as the most abundant disaccharide unit in heparin, and it was therefore tacitly assumed to occupy the corresponding position also in LA heparin (17Kusche M. Torri G. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7292-7300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this assumption we have adopted a novel sequencing strategy (see “Methods”), aimed at identifying disaccharide units that are located at defined distances toward the reducing end from a potentially cleavable reference site. The method, which should have general applicability, is schematically outlined in Fig. 2. The heparin chain is first subjected to partial (essentially random) deaminative cleavage at N-sulfated GlcN units, and the resultant anhydromannose residues are reduced with NaB3H4 to [3H]aManR units. Following the removal of low molecular weight labeled oligosaccharides by gel chromatography (not indicated in Fig. 2), the labeled oligo/polymers are N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis, and the products are treated with nitrous acid at pH 4.5. Under these conditions cleavage occurs exclusively at N-unsubstituted GlcN units, N-sulfated units being resistant, such that the labeled aManR units of the oligosaccharides now released will correspond to N- sulfated GlcN units at defined positions in relation to the N-acetylated residues of the intact polysaccharide. After N-deacetylation of unit 2, the labeled disaccharide formed on high pH deamination thus will directly identify units 3–4 (Fig. 2). The labeled tetra- and hexasaccharides should be cleaved at N-sulfated GlcN residues (low pH deamination) to release the terminal, 3H-labeled, disaccharide units, which will correspond to units 5–6 and 7–8, respectively.The application of this method to the sequencing of LA heparin is illustrated in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Limited low pH deamination of LA heparin (5 mg) followed by reduction of the products with NaB3H4 yielded ~65 × 106 cpm of 3H-labeled oligosaccharides. The di- and tetrasaccharides, together 39% of the incorporated label, were separated from higher oligosaccharides by gel chromatography (data not shown) and discarded. The latter components (61% of total 3H initially incorporated) were N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis and were then deaminated at pH 3.9, resulting in a series of new, smaller oligosaccharides that were separated by gel chromatography (Fig. 3). The new disaccharide fraction thus obtained from LA heparin (13% of initial 3H incorporated), predicted to contain the disaccharide unit adjacent to the N-acetylated GlcN residue in the intact structure (units 3–4 in Fig. 2), was separated further by anion-exchange HPLC (Fig. 4A). A major peak of GlcA-aManR(6-OSO3) was observed, in accord with prediction, thus validating the method. In addition, however, the same sample contained significant amounts (~2.3% of initial 3H incorporated) of the disulfated disaccharide, IdoA(2-OSO3)-aManR(6-OSO3), derived from the predominant disaccharide unit of heparin (38Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was unexpected, since IdoA units do not occur bound at C-4 to N-acetylated GlcN residues (due to the substrate specificity of the GlcA C-5-epimerase (39Jacobsson I. Lindahl U. Jensen J.W. Rodén L. Prihar H. Feingold D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1056-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In search for an explanation, the initial, end group-labeled oligosaccharides (≥six saccharides; 61% of initial 3H incorporated) were subjected to high pH deamination without previous N-deacetylation. Labeled low molecular weight oligosaccharides were again released, albeit in smaller amounts than obtained with the chemically N-deacetylated starting material. Anion-exchange HPLC of the disaccharide fraction yielded IdoA(2-OSO3)aManR(6-OSO3) as the only labeled component present in significant amounts (data not shown), correspon"

We compared NADPH oxidase activity with the membrane translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and p21rac2. In a cell-free system, GTPγS stimulated translocation of p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane only in the presence of arachidonate, and this translocation correlated with NADPH oxidase activity of the reisolated plasma membranes (R = 0.94 and 0.97, respectively). In contrast, GTPγS-stimulated p21rac2 translocation with or without arachidonate, and the extent of translocation did not correlate with oxidase activity (R = 0.17). Neutrophil cytoplasts were used to relate membrane translocation of p47phox, p67phox and p21rac2 to membrane oxidase activity in response to the inflammatory agonists. Whereas N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulated equimolar, transient membrane translocation of p47phox and p67phox which kinetically paralleled NADPH oxidase activity, relatively little p21rac2 translocated (moles of p47phox/p21rac2 = 16.6). Moreover, although phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated both the stable translocation of p47phox and p67phox and sustained NADPH oxidase activity, it did not stimulate p21rac2 translocation. From these data we conclude that membrane translocation of p21rac2 does not regulate NADPH oxidase activity stoichiometrically.

Neutrophils and other phagocytic cells have the capacity to generate superoxide anion (O2⨪) and related toxic oxygen species that are critical to host defense against microorganisms and play a role in autoimmune tissue damage. The multimeric enzyme responsible for O2⨪ production, NADPH oxidase, is latent in resting neutrophils. Upon stimulation with a variety of inflammatory agonists, an active oxidase complex is transiently assembled at the plasma/phagolysosome membrane (1Morel F. Doussiere J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Studies of patients with the X-linked form of chronic granulomatous disease characterized by a complete absence of neutrophil NADPH oxidase permitted the identification of the first component of the oxidase, cytochrome b558 (2Segal A.W.

The minimum complement of proteins required to assemble an active NADPH oxidase in a fully recombinant system include cytochrome b658 and three cytosolic factors designated p47phox, p67phox, and p21rac2 (8Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Katkin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14256-14260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the latent NADPH oxidase appears to involve translocation of the cytosolic factors to the PM. Both p47phox and p67phox contain src homology 3 (SH3) domains (9Lomax K.J. Leto T.L.

In resting neutrophils, p47phox has been found exclusively in the cytosol (CS) whereas p67phox has been localized to both the CS and a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction thought to consist of cytoskeleton (12Clark R.A.

Stimulation of neutrophils with the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) promotes phosphorylation of p47phox (17Heyworth P.G. Segal A.W.

Studies using neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease lacking either cytochrome b558, p47phox, or p67phox suggest that cytochrome b558 is required for translocation of both p47phox and p67phox and that p47phox can translocate to the PM in the absence of p67phox but p67phox translocation requires p47phox (21Heyworth P.G.

J. 1994; 298: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), cofactors required for NADPH oxidase activation. p21rac2 is a member of the ras superfamily of GTPases that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes by cycling between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active state (26Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). Like all ras-related proteins, p21rac2 is post-translationally processed by C-terminal prenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation that targets it to membranes (27Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). However, members of the rho and rab families of ras-related proteins can remain soluble after post-translational modification by association with regulatory proteins known as GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDI). Moreover, the partition of members of this class of ras-related proteins between membranes and GDI appears to depend on the guanine nucleotide bound (28Isomura M. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 29Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The two cytosolic rac proteins purified as activators of the NADPH oxidase, p21rac1 from guinea pig macrophages (30Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1992; 353: 668-670Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and p21rac2 from human neutrophils (31Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) were both found to be complexed with rhoGDI. These properties make p21rac2 an attractive candidate for the factor that regulates NADPH oxidase assembly at the neutrophil PM by translocation from the CS. We previously reported that in a cell-free system, GTPγS stimulated membrane translocation of neutrophil p21rac2, but not rhoGDI, under conditions in which GTPγS also stimulated carboxyl methylation of p21rac2 (32Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Using a cell-free system and enucleate neutrophil cytoplasts, we have now tested the hypothesis that translocation of p21rac2 from CS to PM regulates NADPH oxidase activity by promoting stoichiometric assembly of the oxidase complex. We found that p21rac2 translocation is independent of stimulated carboxyl methylation and is neither necessary nor sufficient for NADPH oxidase activation. Preliminary reports of these results have been presented (33Philips M.R. Feoktistov A.S. Pillinger M.H. Weissmann G. Clin. Res. 1993; 41 (abstr.): 322AGoogle Scholar, 34Philips M.R. Feoktistov A.S.

Neutrophils were isolated from heparinized venous blood of normal volunteers by Ficoll/Hypaque (Accu-Prep) centrifugation followed by dextran sedimentation and hypotonic lysis of residual erythrocytes as described previously (37Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-78PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils were maintained in cell buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KOH, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Neutrophil subcellular fractions (CS, PM, and specific granules) were produced by nitrogen cavitation followed by discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation as we have described (38Philips M.R.

Human erythrocyte membranes were prepared as described previously (39Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). Neutrophil CS was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 kallikrein inactivating units of aprotinin/ml to reduce potassium concentrations (100 meq in cavitate) to permit SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Membranes were washed and suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 kallikrein inactivating units of aprotinin/ml (TA buffer). All subcellular fractions were stored in aliquots at –70 °C until use, and all thawed CS was centrifuged at 100,000 × g immediately prior to use in translocation assays. Cytoplasts were prepared from cytochalasin b-treated neutrophils by discontinuous Ficoll 70 (12.5%, 16%, and 25%) centrifugation at 37 °C as described by Roos et al. (40Roos D. Voetman A.A. Meerhof C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cytoplasts were washed and maintained in cell buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose (CBG) and used immediately. The viability of each preparation of cytoplasts was confirmed with an assay of fMLP-stimulated O2⨪ production. Neutrophil subcellular fractions were analyzed by 14% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose in 10 mm sodium bicarbonate, 3 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.9. Nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3 (PBS/T/Az buffer). The blots were probed with antisera in PBS/T/Az (1:200 for all anti-ras-related protein antisera and monoclonal antibodies, 1:500 for anti-p47phox and anti-p67phox antisera, and 1:10,000 for anti-rhoGDI antiserum) overnight at 4 °C, washed five times, and then incubated with 3–5 × 106 cpm/ml 125I-protein A (rabbit primary antisera) or 126I-protein G (goat primary antisera) for 2 h at 4 °C. When murine monoclonal antibodies were used, a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse antiserum was used as an intermediary reagent before incubation with 125I-protein A. The nitrocellulose was washed five times, and the immunodetected proteins were visualized by autoradiography (1–3 day exposures) and quantitated by Phosphorlmager (Molecular Dynamics model 400A). The cell-free translocation assay was performed with and without reisolation of PM over discontinuous sucrose gradients. In the latter, 100 µg of centrifuged CS was combined with 25 µg of membranes and added to TA buffer prewarmed to 37 °C with or without GTPγS, arachidonate, or other reagents, for a final volume of 25 µl. After 1 min or longer, the reaction was stopped with 100 µl of ice-cold TA buffer, and the soluble and particulate fractions were separated by centrifugation (150,000 × g for 10 min) in a TL-100 (Beckman Instruments) tabletop ultracentrifuge using a TLA-100.3 rotor. The supernatants were collected, concentrated to 15 µl by vacuum centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot alongside the particulate pellet that was resuspended by sonication in SDS sample buffer. A similar procedure was followed when PM was reisolated over sucrose density gradients except 400 µg of CS was combined with 100 µg of PM in a final volume of 100 µl. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 min, the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of ice-cold TA buffer, and the mixture was layered over a 200-µl methylene blue-stained 15%/300-µl 50% discontinuous sucrose gradient in 0.7-ml UltraClear tubes (Beckman Instruments) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in an SW-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments). CS was collected as the colorless fluid floating on the blue 15% sucrose, and PM was reisolated from the 15%/50% sucrose interface. One-quarter of the CS was reduced to 15 µl by vacuum centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblot beside one-quarter of the reisolated PM. Translocation was quantitated by phosphorimage analysis of the immunoblots and expressed as the percent of the total (CS + PM) cytosolic oxidase factor detected in the particulate or reisolated PM fraction. Another quarter of the reisolated PM was split in half and added to each of two cuvettes containing 0.25 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 130 mm NaCl, 340 mm sucrose, 0.9 mg/ml ferricytochrome c, and 100 µg/ml NADPH, one of which also contained 10 µg/ml superoxide dismutase (reference cuvette). The NADPH oxidase activity of the reisolated PM was measured as the slope of the change in absorbance at 551 nm in a dual beam spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments) using the extinction coefficient 15.15 nm ferricytochrome c reduced/ΔA661 and expressed per mg of membrane protein as determined by the Pierce BCA assay. Neutrophils were treated with fMLP, PMA, or buffer alone prior to subcellular fractionation as described above. CS and PM was analyzed for p21rac2, p47phox, and p67phox by immunoblot and Phosphorlmager analysis. Cytoplasts (8 × 108/ml) were prewarmed in 300 µl of CBG for 5 min prior to addition of fMLP (100 nm), PMA (1 µg/ml), or CBG alone. At various times poststimulation, 50-µl aliquots were removed to 150 µl of ice-cold TA containing 1.33 mm EGTA and 6.65 mm MgCl2 and immediately disrupted with three 1-s pulses from a probe sonicator. Homogenates were loaded onto 15%/50% discontinuous sucrose gradients and processed as described above for reisolation of PM in the cell-free assay. One-tenth of the CS (2.4 × 106 cytoplast equivalents) was analyzed for p21rac2, p47phox, and p67phox by immunoblot alongside one-half of the cytoplast-derived PM (1.2 × 107 cytoplast eq). The content of each cytosolic oxidase component in the CS and PM was measured by Phosphorlmager, and the percent associated with the PM normalizing for cytoplast equivalents was determined. One-half of the cytoplast-derived PM without addition of CS, GTPγS, or arachidonate was used to assay cell-free NADPH oxidase activity as described above for reisolated neutrophil PM. Immunoblot analysis of neutrophil subcellular fractions generated by nitrogen cavitation and discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation revealed that 99 ± 1% of p21rac2 was cytosolic. When 25 µg of PM and 100 µg of CS (4-fold the original PM:CS protein ratio of the subcellular fractions; PM:CS = 0.07 ± 0.01) were incubated together at 37 °C for 1 min and then separated by centrifugation (150,000 × g), 18 ± 1% of p21rac2 was recovered in the pellet. In the presence of 100 µm GTPγS, the proportion of p21rac2 found in the pellet increased to 66 ± 4% (Fig. 1). Both the baseline and GTPγS-stimulated association of p21rac2 with the 150,000 × g pellet was dependent on the PM (Fig. LA). In contrast, a portion of both cytosolic p47phox and p67phox was recovered in the 150,000 × g pellet in the absence of PM (Fig. 1A). GTPγS augmented the insoluble portion of p47phox and p67phox. Thus, whereas this simple cell-free system was not reliable for reporting membrane association of p47phox and p67phox, it detected a GTPγS-stimulated increase in the association of neutrophil cytosolic p21rac2 with isolated PM and therefore reliably reported membrane translocation of activated p21rac2. Another nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMP-PNP, stimulated p21rac2 translocation, although to a lesser extent than GTPγS (Table I). GTP at the same concentration (100 µm) was 29% as effective as GTPγS in stimulating p21rac2 translocation. Increasing the concentration of GTP 10-fold did not increase the extent of translocation. Neither GDPβS nor ATPγS had any activity (Table I). GTPγS-stimulated membrane translocation of p21rac2 was rapid (complete by 1 min) and stable for at least 1 h (Fig. 1B). Because membrane association of p21rac2 increased slightly over 1 h at 37 °C in the absence of GTPγS and because NADPH oxidase activation in intact cells and in cell-free systems is rapid (<1 min), all subsequent analysis of cell-free membrane translocation was performed with a 1-min incubation.Table IThe effects of nucleotides on p21rac2 membrane associationNucleotidePercent membrane-associatedNone27 ± 4GTPγS72 ± 6GMP-PNP60 ± 9GTP40 ± 5GDPβS32 ± 7ATPγS24 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Because, in addition to membrane translocation of p21rac2, GTPγS stimulated α-carboxyl methylesterification of the same protein under similar conditions (32Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we determined whether stimulated carboxyl methylation is required for membrane translocation. Neither the prenylcysteine-directed carboxyl methyltransferase inhibitors AFC and AGGC nor the general methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine had any effect on the GTPγS-stimulated membrane translocation of p21rac2 (Table II). Neither did excess (100 µm) methyl donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine, affect p21rac2 translocation. Thus, activation of p21rac2 with GTPγS can promote its membrane association without carboxyl methylation.Table IILack of effect of methylation inhibitors and AdoMet on p21rac2membrane associationAdditionaAdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine.−GTPγS+GTPγSNone15 ± 256 ± 5100 μm AFC15 ± 262 ± 420 μm AGGC19 ± 265 ± 4100 μm AdoHcy1257100 μm AdoMet1563a AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Open table in a new tab To determine whether GTPγS-stimulated membrane translocation was specific to neutrophil p21rac2, the CS:PM distributions of three other ras-related proteins and the accessory protein rhoGDI were determined in the absence or presence of 100 µm GTPγS (Fig. 2). Like p21rac2, two other members of the rho family of ras-related proteins, p22rac1 and p21CDC42hs, were predominantly cytosolic in neutrophils. GTPγS stimulated membrane translocation of both p22rac1 and p21CDC42hs to an extent similar to that observed for p21rac2. rhoGDI was found exclusively in the CS in the absence or presence of GTPγS. In contrast, p21rap1, a protein in the ras family that has been reported to be physically associated with cytochrome b668 of the neutrophil oxidase (41Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Walker L. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was found in both PM and specific granule membranes but not CS (38Philips M.R. Abramson S.B. Kolasinski S.L. Haines K.A. Weissmann G. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS did not affect the subcellular localization of p21rap1 in the cell-free assay. Thus, GTPyS-stimulated membrane translocation is a property shared by several members of the rho family of ras-related proteins in neutrophils. We next determined whether GTPγS-stimulated p21rac2 translocation was specific to neutrophil-derived membranes. The membranes of neutrophil-specific granules function as an intracellular store of intrinsic PM proteins such as cytochrome b558 (42Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) because within seconds following an inflammatory stimulus specific granule membranes are added to the PM through the process of degranulation. Like PM, neutrophil-specific granule membranes supported GTPγS-stimulated membrane translocation of p21rac2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, although 20 ± 1% of neutrophil cytosolic p21rac2 became associated with human erythrocyte membranes after 1 min at 37 °C, there was no increase in this association in the presence of GTPγS. Thus, neutrophil plasma and specific granule membranes contain a factor that promoted GTPγS-stimulated membrane translocation of p21rac2. Since GTPγS-stimulated p21rac2 translocation under conditions of high (5 mM) Mg2+ (not shown) as well as low Mg2+ (dialyzed CS plus PM without exogenous Mg2+, FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4), it is likely that a guanine nucleotide exchange factor is required.FIG. 4Cell-free NADPH oxidase activity of reisolated PM correlates with membrane translocation of p47phox and pG7phox but not p21rac2 or p21rhoA. CS (100 µg) and PM (25 µg) were mixed in the absence (○, △) or presence (●, ▲) of arachidonic acid (80 µm) and the concentration of GTPγS indicated on the abscissae. After 1 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 2 volumes of ice-cold buffer, and the PM was reisolated over a 15%/50% discontinuous sucrose gradient. The reisolated PM was assayed for NADPH oxidase activity (○, ●) as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c without further addition of anything except NADPH (left ordinates). The reisolated PM and CS were assayed for p47phox (A), p67phox (B), p21rac2 (C), and p21rhoA (II) by immunoblots quantitated by Phosphorlmager analysis. The extent of membrane translocation (△, ▲) is expressed as the percent of total immunodetectable protein in the PM (right ordinates). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of five (A and B) or four (C and D) experiments. Linear regression revealed correlation coefficients between NADPH oxidase activity and cytosolic protein membrane translocation in the presence of arachidonate of 0.94, 0.97, 0.17, and 0.17 for p47phox, p67phox, p21rac2, and p21rhoA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the relationship between the membrane translocation of cytosolic oxidase components and NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free system we measured translocation to the PM of p21rac2, p47phox, and p67phox and compared it to the capacity of the same membranes to generate O2⨪ (Fig. 4). In addition to neutrophil PM and CS, GTP and an anionic amphiphile such as arachidonate are absolutely required for optimal cell-free NADPH oxidase activity (3Bromberg Y. Pick E.

Therefore, PM and CS were combined in the presence of increasing amounts of GTPγS and in the absence or presence of the concentration of arachidonate (80 µm) found to promote maximal O2⨪ production in our cell-free assay. To eliminate membrane-independent precipitation of p47phox and p67phox from our assay, we reisolated the PM over a 15/50% discontinuous sucrose density gradient after a translocation reaction consisting of mixing neutrophil CS and PM in the presence of GTPγS with or without arachidonate for 1 min at 37 °C.

The following data suggest that ΑE1 and AE2 have been functionally reconstituted: (i) the rate of SO42- transport in AE1 and ΑE2 containing proteoliposomes was 10–20 times higher than in proteoliposomes derived from control microsomes; (il) the transport of SO42- was strongly dependent on the presence of a trans anion; and (iii) the anion exchanger inhibitors, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) and 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DNDS) totally abolished SO42- transport. Furthermore, DIDS inhibits SO42- transport only when occluded inside the vesicles, indicating a uniform, asymmetrical, inside-out orientation of the reconstituted exchangers. The Ki values of the stilbene disulfonate compound DNDS were 2.5 and 4 μΜ for AE1 and AE2, respectively, suggesting that the two exchangers possess similar high affinity sites for stilbene compounds. Both AE1 and AE2 showed the same steep pH dependence of sulfate transport, which was maximal at pH 5.5 and reduced to less than 10% (of the value at pH 5.5) at pH 8.5, suggesting that an acidic residue shared by AE1 and AE2 participates in the pH regulation of sulfate transport.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied member of the family is AE1 (band 3), which is abundantly expressed in the erythrocyte plasma membrane (2Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte anion exchange serves to increase the capacity for plasma CO2 transport by exchanging HCO42- generated by intracellular carbonic anhydrase for extracellular Cl− (3Knauf P.A. Andreoli T. Hoffman J.F. Schultz S.G. Fanenstil D.D. Membrane Transport Disorders. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1986: 191-220Google Scholar). The nonerythroid anion exchanger, AE2, is expressed in lymphoid, fibroblastic, and epithelial cells (4Alper S.L. Kopito R.R. Libresco S.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

In addition, specialized AEs play key roles in acid-base balance in bone (6Green J. Yamaguchi D.T. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Gen.

Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: C247-C259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate transport is steeply pH-dependent in that the rate of transport is maximal at a pH value of ~5 and is reduced to less than 10% at pH 8 and above (10Milanick M.A. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: C247-C259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Milanick M.A. Gunn R.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 79: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The slow rate and strong pH dependence of SO42- transport have been reconciled as reflecting a requirement for binding and cotransport of a proton that accompanies SO42- movement (12Jennings M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 28: 187-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, cotransport of sulfate and proton preserves the monovalent nature of transport and explains the steep pH dependence of the process (10Milanick M.A. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: C247-C259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gunn R.B. Gerlach E. Moser K. Deutch E. Wilmans W. Erythrocytes, Thrombocytes, Leukocytes. Thieme, Stuttgart1973: 77-79Google Scholar). Although measurement of sulfate transport has served as an important tool in studying transport kinetics, the anion binding site, and regulation of anion transport, little is known about sulfate transport in the related nonerythroid exchanger, AE2. A hallmark of the anion exchangers is their sensitivity to disulfonic stilbene derivatives. Although the affinity constant of various stilbene disulfonate compounds for band 3 is firmly established, the affinity constant of the stilbene compound DIDS has been reported to vary over 300-fold between two nonerythroid anion exchangers, AE2 and AE3 (14Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting differences in the stilbene disulfonate binding sites between AE1 and AE2 (14Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the difference in the DIDS apparent affinity may arise from different densities of the exchangers in various expression systems or the complex nature of covalent and noncovalent binding of the most frequently used inhibitor DIDS (15Cabantchik Z.I. Greger R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 31: C803-C827Crossref Google Scholar, 16Frohlich O. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 65: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that AE1 and AE2 can be overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells (14Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in these cells, a significant portion of AE2 acquires mature oligosaccharides and is functionally detectable at the plasma membrane. In contrast, AE1 expression is restricted in these cells to the endoplasmic reticulum (17Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, comparison between sulfate transport mediated by AE1 and AE2 cannot be performed on intact cells. In addition, populations of vesicles containing AE1 or AE2 in crude microsomes from transfected HEK cells are heterogeneous in size, lipid composition, sidedness, and ionic permeability (18Darnell J. Lodish H. Baltimore D. Molecular Cell Biology. Scientific American Books, New York1990: 489-578Google Scholar), thereby complicating functional comparison between the two exchangers using crude microsomes. In the present study, we describe a reconstitution method to assess and compare the functional properties of sulfate transport mediated by AE1 and AE2. We have used this system to determine stilbene disulfonate affinity and pH dependence of sulfate transport mediated by these two anion exchangers. Expression of Anion Exchangers in Cultured Cells—Murine anion exchanger cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pRBG4 and expressed in HEK 293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line transformed with human adenovirus type 5 DNA (14Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown and transfected in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in humidified incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Anion exchangers were expressed by transient transfection of HEK cells as described previously (17Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmids were added at 16 μg/150-mm tissue culture plate. After 48 h, cells were harvested. Microsome Preparation—Unless otherwise stated, all steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Medium was removed from 5–10 culture dishes (150 mm), and the cells were scraped using a plastic cell scraper and resuspended in 3 ml of wash buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for each plate. Cells in the wash buffer were pooled and centrifuged at 1500 rpm (551 × g) for 10 min in a H-6000A Sorvall rotor. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20–40 ml of wash buffer, and the cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm (291 × g) for 10 min. The cellular pellet was resuspended in 10–20 ml of swelling buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The suspension was then subjected to centrifugation at 4000 rpm (4660 × g) for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10–20 ml of swelling buffer, homogenized with 50 strokes using a 5-ml glass Dounce homogenizer, and sonicated twice for 1 s each using a cylindrically shaped bath sonicator, G112SPIT (Laboratory Supplies Co.), that was operated at 80 × 103 cycles/s at 300 watts. Sucrose solution was then added from a 70% w/v stock to achieve a final concentration of 10% w/v. The nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation at 1200 rpm (400 × g) for 5 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 3700 rpm (4100 × g) for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was supplemented with 50 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. This mixture was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm (140 × 103 × g) in a Beckman Ti45 rotor for 50 min, and the final microsomal pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 7% sucrose w/v, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Crude microsomes derived from ten 150-mm plates were resuspended in 0.5–1.2 ml at a protein concentration of about 1 mg/ml, homogenized using a 2-ml tight Teflon glass homogenizer, and immediately frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen for up to 60 days. Reconstitution of the Anion Exchanger—Unless otherwise stated all steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Crude microsomes (40–80 μg of protein in 40–80 μl) were mixed with a 50-fold excess (w/w) of sonicated soybean asolectin (Sigma) in standard sulfate buffer (20 mm Na2SO4, 10 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.0, and 2 mm MgSO4) with 70 μCi of [35S]Na2SO4 (1050–1600 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in a final volume of 0.5–1 ml in the presence or absence of 300 μΜ DIDS. The reconstitution mixture was subjected to one cycle of rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature, followed by five successive 1-s sonication cycles using a cylindrically shaped bath sonicator, G112SPIT (Laboratory Supplies Co.), operated at 80 × 103 cycles/s. To remove tracer not trapped inside the proteoliposomes and to exchange to the desired extravesicular buffer, the sample was centrifuged through a prechilled 10-ml semi-dried Sephadex G-50 fine (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column at 1200 rpm (400 × g) for 5 min in a H-6000A Sorvall rotor. The columns were semi-dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 900 rpm (200 × g) in the same rotor. Prior to the semi-dry process, the resin was preswollen in boiling water for 2 h, degassed, and then equilibrated with at least 2 column volumes of desired buffer lacking the isotopic tracer. Sulfate Transport Assays—[35S]SO42- transport was initiated by transferring the proteoliposomes to a 30 ºC water bath and terminated by passing 50–100-μl aliquots through Dowex 1 (Bio-Rad) anion exchange columns that were converted into a formate form and packed into 1.5-ml Pasteur pipettes as described in Ref. 19Gasko O.D. Knowls A.F. Sherzer H.G. Suolinna E.M. Racker E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar. Loading of the sample was followed by washing with 1.5 ml of ice-cold isoosmolar sucrose solution. Recoveries of the anion exchanger after the Sephadex spin and Dowex columns were determined by immunoblot to be 85–95% (data not shown). Time 0 of each reaction was determined by passing ice-cold proteoliposomes on the Dowex column. Different preparations show sulfate efflux specific activity that ranged from 150 to 450 × 103 cpm of [36S]SO42-−/mg of protein × min at 20 mm SO42-, pH 6, for AE1 and AE2. For sulfate influx experiments, proteoliposomes were formed in the standard sulfate buffer as described above with non-radioactive sulfate. Transport was initiated by adding 70–100 μCi of [35S]SO42- to 1 ml of proteoliposomes and passing the proteoliposomes through a 3-ml Dowex column. The transport data represent an average of at least three independent experiments each performed in triplicate. pH Dependence of Sulfate Efflux—Proteoliposomes were formed as described above and passed through a spin-down column, equilibrated with standard sulfate buffer in which 10 mm MES was replaced by 10 mM MES and 10 mm HEPES brought to the desired pH with KOH. To avoid a formation of a ΔpH across the proteoliposomes, 10 μΜ nigericin (Sigma) and 5 μΜ carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (Sigma) were added prior to the passage of the proteoliposomes on the semi-dry spin column, and sulfate flux experiments were performed as described above. The dissipation of ΔpH was verified by spectrofluorimetric analysis of intracellular pH in proteoliposomes reconstituted in the presence of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (20Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy of AE Proteoliposomes—For electron microscopy, a drop of reconstituted vesicle suspension was applied to a Formvar-coated grid made hydrophilic by glow discharge. After 30 s, most of the liquid was absorbed at the periphery of the grid using a filter paper; the remaining sample was air-dried at room temperature for 30 min and subsequently by vacuum for 10–15 min. This fixation treatment was used in order to avoid any staining solution-induced artifact, that is the formation of multilamellar vesicles. Finally, the monolayer of reconstituted vesicles was negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate for 30 s. Excess staining solution was absorbed at the periphery of the grid using filter paper. Samples were viewed and photographed using a Philips 410 electron microscope under 1.2 × 104 magnification. Miscellaneous Determinations—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot processing were performed as described in Ref. 17Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. Protein concentration was determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma) in the presence of 0.5% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The Marquardt-Levenberg least squares regression algorithm was used to fit the data to nonlinear equations using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software) for sulfate dependence and linear fit for the Dixon plot analysis. Sulfate Transport by Reconstituted Anion Exchangers—Crude microsomes prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with ΑΕ1, AE2 cDNA, or vector alone were reconstituted into soybean phospholipids by a modified freeze-and-thaw procedure. The AE1 proteoliposomes as visualized by electron microscopy were round and unilamellar (Fig. 1). More than 80% of the proteoliposomes had diameters in the range of 150–400 nm as determined by measurement of 250 randomly selected vesicles. AE2 and control proteoliposomes showed a similar shape and size distribution (not shown). Equilibrium sulfate exchange in these proteoliposomes was measured by monitoring [35S]SO42- efflux (Fig. 2A) or influx (Fig. 2B) mediated by the anion exchangers. Sulfate efflux from proteoliposomes reconstituted with membranes from vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A) was low, corresponding to an initial rate of 28 × 103 cpm mg−1 min−1. Similar low rates were observed from pure (proteinfree) liposomes assayed under identical conditions (not shown). In contrast, proteoliposomes reconstituted with AE1 or AE2 microsomes showed a markedly enhanced [35S]SO42- efflux, reaching equilibrium at ~60 min. The initial rates of [35S]SO42- efflux for AE1 and AE2 proteoliposomes were 238 and 384 × 103 cpm mg−1 min−1, respectively. These rates are 9–15-fold faster than those observed in control liposomes, suggesting that most if not all the sulfate efflux is mediated by the anion exchanger. To further characterize the capacity of AE-reconstituted proteoliposomes to mediate sulfate exchange, sulfate influx was assayed under steady-state conditions (Fig. 2B). Proteoliposomes were loaded with non-isotopic 20 mm sulfate buffer and mixed into an isoosmolar sulfate solution with [35S]SO42- tracer. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with AE1 or AE2 showed an influx of 7 and 8 nmol of SO42-/mg of protein min−1, respectively. In contrast, proteoliposomes derived from vector-transfected cells showed a sulfate influx rate that is at least 10 times slower.Fig. 2Sulfate transport mediated by ΑΕ1 and AE2. A, sulfate content as a function of time from proteoliposomes reconstituted from cells transfected with AE1 (squares), AE2 (circles), or vector (diamonds). B, sulfate uptake in proteoliposomes reconstituted from cells transfected with AE1 (squares), AE2 (circles), or vector (diamonds). Symbols and error bars represent the mean ± S.D. of 3 and 4 flux measurements performed on different cell preparations, in triplicate for the efflux and the influx measurements, respectively. The specific activities for the sulfate influx measurements for AE1 and AE2 were 350 ± 40 and 402 ± 47 cpm of [35S]SO42- mg−1 protein min−1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of AE1 and AE2 Transport by Disulfonic Stilbenes—Disulfonic stilbenes such as DIDS are potent inhibitors of ΑΕ1-mediated anion exchange in erythrocytes (21Passow H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 103: 62-203Google Scholar), where they react with AE1 exclusively from the extracytoplasmic side (22Kaplan J.H. Skoran K. Fasold H. Passow H. FEBS Lett. 1976; 62: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We took advantage of these properties to further characterize sulfate transport in reconstituted proteoliposomes and to probe the membrane orientation of the reconstituted protein. DIDS was either occluded within the proteoliposomes during reconstitution or added to the extravesicular side after membrane resealing. As shown in Fig. 3, DIDS inhibits AE1 (Fig. 3A) or AE2 (Fig. 3B)-mediated [35S]SO42- efflux only when occluded inside the proteoliposomes, indicating a predominantly inside-out orientation of the reconstituted anion exchangers. Inhibition of the anion exchanger by DIDS may involve both covalent and noncovalent interactions that complicate the evaluation of Ki (21Passow H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 103: 62-203Google Scholar). Therefore we used DNDS, a disulfonic stilbene that interacts with AE1 in a strictly noncovalent manner (16Frohlich O. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 65: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, DNDS was effective in inhibiting more than 90% of AE1 and AE2 activity. The Ki for DNDS inhibition, derived from Dixon analysis (Fig. 4, A and B, inset), was 2.5 and 4 μΜ for AE1 and AE2, respectively. These values are similar to the Ki value of 2 μΜ previously described for erythrocyte band 3 (23Barzilay M. Ship S. Cabantchik Z.I. Membr. Biochem. 1979; 2: 227-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that the stilbene binding site is preserved during heterologous expression and reconstitution and is conserved between AE1 and AE2.Fig. 4Inhibition of ΑΕ1 and ΑΕ2 by DNDS. ΑΕ1 (A) and AE2 (B) proteoliposomes were prepared with the indicated concentrations of DNDS. Insets show a Dixon plot analysis of the data. Symbols represent the mean of 4 flux measurements, each performed on different cell preparations in triplicate for AE1 and AE2. The specific activities for sulfate efflux were 175 ± 21 and 223 ± 12 × 10s cpm of [35S]SO42- mg−1 protein min 1 for AE1 and AE2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) trans Anion Concentration Dependence of [35S]SO42- Efflux Mediated by the Anion Exchangers—An important prediction of exchange-only transport systems is the dependence of transport on the trans anion. Exchange-only transport should be stimulated in a saturable manner by increasing the trans substrate concentration, while keeping the cis concentration constant (24Krupka R.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 109: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this property is preserved in our reconstitution system, proteoliposomes were loaded with 60 mm sulfate buffer, while the extravesicular concentration was varied between 0 and 60 mm sulfate. To maintain isoosmolarity, the “spectator” anion (i.e. non-transportable) gluconate was used to replace sulfate on the trans side. As shown in Fig. 5, DIDS-sensitive sulfate efflux from the proteoliposomes was abolished in the absence of external sulfate, demonstrating that sulfate efflux from the reconstituted proteoliposomes was dependent on the presence of a transportable trans anion. Stimulation of transport was saturatable with apparent Km values of 9.2 ± 2.3 and 10.2 ± 1.7 mm for AE1 and AE2, respectively. Proton Activation of [35S]SO42- Efflux—We investigated the pH dependence of sulfate transport mediated by AE1 and AE2 proteoliposomes. As shown in Fig. 6, transport by both anion exchangers was maximal at pH 5.5 and dropped sharply to below 10% at pH 8.5. The striking similarity between AE1 and AE2 pH dependence suggests the participation of the same titratable group(s) on AE1 and AE2. The ability to measure the binding and transport of divalent anions mediated by the erythroid anion exchanger band 3 have provided important insight into the nature of the binding sites for anions and inhibitors and the mechanism of anion transport and selectivity (2Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although sulfate transport mediated by AE1 and AE2 has been demonstrated to occur in crude microsomes derived from cells expressing the transporters (17Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), little is known about kinetic parameters that underlie this process. The difficulties in assessing these parameters may arise from distribution of the anion exchangers in at least two organelles: the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. Microsomes derived from these organelles differ in lipid composition, size, and permeability properties (18Darnell J. Lodish H. Baltimore D. Molecular Cell Biology. Scientific American Books, New York1990: 489-578Google Scholar). The reconstitution of heterologously expressed anion exchangers permits the assessment of kinetic parameters under similar conditions and membrane composition. In the present work, we have established a reconstitution system to investigate sulfate transport mediated by the anion exchangers AE1 and AE2 expressed in heterologous cells and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. That the anion exchangers have been functionally reconstituted is corroborated by the following observations. First, the rate of [35S]SO42- efflux from proteoliposomes reconstituted with AE-containing microsomes was at least 9-fold faster than that from proteoliposomes reconstituted with microsomes derived from vector-transfected cell and from pure liposomes. Second, this enhanced [36S]SO42- efflux was sensitive to inhibition by stilbene disulfonate compounds. Third, [35S]SO42- efflux mediated by both AE1 and AE2 was strongly dependent on trans-sulfate concentration, with a Km between 6 and 10 mm sulfate at pH 6.0. An important question to address is whether the reconstituted anion exchangers have a specific activity comparable with that of the erythroid AE1. By subtracting the nonspecific flux of sulfate into the control proteoliposomes from the initial rate of sulfate uptake by AE-containing proteoliposomes (Fig. 2B), we estimated an influx rate of 7 and 8 nmol of sulfate mg−1 protein min−1 for AE1 and AE2, respectively, at 30 °C and pH 6. Based on an abundance of 0.4% w/w of AE1 and AE2 protein in the crude microsomes, estimated by an immunoblot comparison of ΑΕ1, AE2, and erythrocyte band 3 2J. Casey, personal communication. and assuming 100% incorporation into the proteoliposomes during reconstitution, the specific activity of AE1 and AE2 is estimated to be between 1750 and 2000 nmol sulfate mg−1 protein min−1, respectively. These values compare favorably with those of Schnell et al. (25Schnell K.F. Gerhardt S. Schoppe-Fredenburg A. J. Membr. Biol. 1977; 30: 319-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), who estimated the maximal specific activity of erythrocyte band 3 (corrected to pH 6 and 30 °C) to be approximately 2600 nmol sulfate mg−1 protein min−1. These estimated specific activities of recombinant AE1 and AE2 also compare favorably with detergent-purified erythrocyte AE1 reconstituted into lipid proteoliposomes (26Lukacovic M.F. Feinstein M.B. Sha'afi R.I. Perrie S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that AE1 and AE2 reconstituted into proteoliposomes are fully functional. Disulfonic stilbene compounds have been shown to inhibit anion exchangers of various cells and tissues with widely different affinities (27Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 419-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Hopfer U. Liedtke C.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 51-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar, 30Reinertsen K.V. Tonnessen T.I. Jacobsen J. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11117-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, AE2 and AE3 heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells showed susceptibility to reversible inhibition by DIDS that varied over a 300-fold range (14Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while AE2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed a IC50 of about 400 μΜ for DNDS (31Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: C1295-C1307Crossref Google Scholar), which is considerably higher than the 0.2–5 μΜ value described for erythroid AE1. These observations suggested the existence of structural differences in the stilbene disulfonate binding site among the anion exchangers (14Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of structural differences in the stilbene disulfonate binding site has been further supported by the demonstration that mutating mouse AE1 lysine 869 to methionine, which is naturally occurring in mouse and human AE2, reduced the affinity to DNDS by 10-fold (32Wood P.G. Müller H. Sovak M. Passow H. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This result can be interpreted to mean that the different amino acids at position 869 are at the least partially responsible for the observed difference in the affinity of DNDS for AE1 and AE2. This interpretation, however, needs to be further substantiated by the reverse mutation whereby AE2 methionine 869 is replaced by a lysine. Whether this reverse mutation would enhance the affinity of DNDS for AE2 by 10-fold cannot be predicted o priori. Furthermore, a double mutant with substitutions at both lysine 869 and lysine 558, the latter of which is conserved among all anion exchangers hitherto identified, resulted in a synergistic reduction of DNDS inhibitory capacity by about 80-fold. This result suggested that residues shared by AE1 and AE2 have a role in high affinity stilbene disulfonate binding, and further studies comparing the role of AE2 residues, such as methionine 869, in binding stilbene compounds are still required. On the other hand, the differences in stilbene disulfonate binding sites may stem from differences in membrane composition (e.g. lipid composition, charge) or surface densities of the expressed anion exchangers (15Cabantchik Z.I. Greger R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 31: C803-C827Crossref Google Scholar). The possibility that the difference in the inhibitory capacity of stilbene disulfonate compounds for AE1 and AE2 depends on the expressing host cell rather than on structural differences in the inhibitor binding site is supported by a comparison of the anion exchangers expressed in different cell types. The IC50 of H2 DIDS for AE2 expressed in HEK 293 cells in the absence of Cl− was approximately 142 μΜ, while the IC50 and Ki of DIDS inhibition of AE2 expressed in SF-9 insect cells and Xenopus oocytes are 5 and 0.5 μΜ, respectively (31Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: C1295-C1307Crossref Google Scholar, 33He X. Wu X. Knauf P.A. Tabak L.A. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1075-C1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even more striking is the observation that, while in K562 cells, which endogenously express AE2, the IC50 for DNDS inhibition is 23 μΜ, the IC50 for H2DIDS and DNDS for AE2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes is approximately 0.5 and 400 μΜ, respectively. Moreover, AE2 expressed in oocytes has a lower sensitivity to other stilbene compounds such as SITS and 4,4′-diaminostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (31Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: C1295-C1307Crossref Google Scholar). Taken together, such vast differences in the affinity of stilbene compounds for the same anion exchanger expressed in different cells may exceed the actual difference in affinity of stilbene compounds for different anion exchangers expressed in the same host cell. It has been suggested that the density of the anion exchanger, the presence of the glycocalyx, and the composition and charge of membrane may affect stilbene disulfonate affinity for the anion exchangers (15Cabantchik Z.I. Greger R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 31: C803-C827Crossref Google Scholar). Unfortunately, little is known about the individual role of each factor. Reconstitution of band 3 into liposomes, while maintaining a similar exchange rate to native band 3, reduced the IC50 for DNDS by about 6-fold, indicating that a change in the lipid environment or the density of the anion exchanger reduced the affinity of DNDS inhibition (34Kohne W. Haest C.W.M. Deutike B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 229: 547-556Google Scholar). Another factor that may play a role in changing the apparent affinity of stilbene disulfonates is the presence of an abundantly expressed membrane protein not related to the anion exchanger but possessing a high affinity for stilbene disulfonate. One such protein is aminopeptidase A, a major protein in kidney microsomes that binds with high affinity to SITS Affi-Gel resin (35See H. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The apparent Ki in this study of DNDS is 2.5 and 4 μΜ for AE1 and AE2, respectively, and is comparable with an apparent Ki value of approximately 2 μΜ for DNDS inhibition of SO42-/SO42- exchange mediated by band 3 measured in red blood cells (23Barzilay M. Ship S. Cabantchik Z.I. Membr. Biochem. 1979; 2: 227-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data indicate that AE1 and AE2 share a similar, if not identical, binding site for stilbene disulfonate compounds. The striking similarity of the pH dependence of sulfate transport mediated by AE1 and AE2 strongly suggests that a conserved site has a key role in the pH regulation of sulfate transport. Furthermore, the steep pH dependence for both anion exchangers suggests the participation of an acidic group in the process of AE-mediated divalent anion transport. The latter notion is in agreement with a pH-titratable site for sulfate transport on erythrocyte AE1 (11Milanick M.A. Gunn R.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 79: 87-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Gunn R.B. Gerlach E. Moser K. Deutch E. Wilmans W. Erythrocytes, Thrombocytes, Leukocytes. Thieme, Stuttgart1973: 77-79Google Scholar). Unfortunately our data do not permit accurate determination of the pKa value for this titratable group on AE2, as the proteoliposomes became leaky at pH values below 5.0. The use of reconstituted proteoliposomes described here offers several advantages over the use of crude microsomes: homogeneity of size and orientation, low permeability to anions, and the ability to rapidly exchange solution using the dry spin process. Thus, reconstitution by freeze-and-thaw may have widespread applications for measuring the activity of other heterologously expressed transporters. The availability of transport assays for both divalent and monovalent anions and our ability to express site-directed mutants will permit future studies aimed at dissecting the role of specific residues that participate or regulate anion transport. Studies are under way to determine which residues participate in or regulate ion binding and transport as well as pH sensitivity. We thank Drs. Joe Casey and Paul Quinton for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful discussions. Thanks to Fran Thomas for help with the electron microscopy.

Interestingly, it has been found that glycogen associated with SR membranes is less branched compared with glycogen particles (Wanson and Drochmans, 1968Wanson J.C. Drochmans P. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 130-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but the functional and physiological role of this observation is not known. Recent results obtained in our laboratory support the view that the association of glycogen phosphorolysis with SR membranes in skeletal muscle cells can produce low amounts of ATP in the vicinity of these membranes, which support Ca2+ transport into the SR (Cuenda et al., 1993Cuenda A. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because of the importance that these findings may have in regulating muscle bioenergetics, we have studied the association of phosphorylase with SR membranes under experimental conditions approaching normal physiological conditions (concentrations of phosphorylase and of SR membranes, pH, temperature, ionic strength, and the allosteric activators of phosphorylase b, AMP and IMP). In addition, we have investigated the kinetic properties of phosphorylase b present in SR membranes prepared from skeletal muscle and the effect of phosphorylase b on the Ca2+ pump of SR membranes. Phosphorylase b and SR membranes were prepared from rabbit (New Zealand White) back and hind leg skeletal muscle as described (Gutiérrez-Merino et al., 1980Gutiérrez-Merino C. Garcia-Blanco F.

Based on the SDS gel electrophoretic pattern (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), phosphorylase b was found to be >98% pure and did not show a detectable AMP deaminase activity (measured with 100 μg of protein/ml). Ca2+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.38) was purified from SR membranes as described (Gutiérrez-Merino, 1987Gutiérrez-Merino C. Arch. Biochem.

The protein concentration was determined using the method of Lowry et al., 1951Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Ullman A. Goldberg M. Buc H. Biochimie (Paris). 1971; 53: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The glycogen concentration of SR membranes was measured using the phenol sulfuric method (Dubois et al., 1956Dubois M. Giles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40876) Google Scholar) with glycogen as a standard and was found to be on average 32 ± 10 μg of glycogen/mg of membrane protein (n = 10). The phosphorylase activity was measured in the direction of both glycogen synthesis and degradation as described by Cuenda et al., 1991Cuenda A. Centeno F. Gutiérrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys.

In the synthesis mode, the assay medium contained 10 mM glucose 1-phosphate, 0.45 g/liter glycogen, 0.1 mM AMP, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM TES (pH 7.4) or 10 mM MES (pH 6.0), and 0.1 mg/ml purified phosphorylase b.

Unless stated otherwise, the initial activity in the direction of glycogen synthesis was measured after a 1-min reaction. The phosphorylase activity in the direction of glycogen phosphorolysis was measured in the following assay medium: 12 mM H2PO4K, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.63 mM NADP+, 50 mM imidazole (pH 6.9), 1 mM AMP, 0.45 g/liter glycogen, 25 μg of phosphoglucomutase, and 15 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase plus purified phosphorylase b (≤1 μg/ml) or SR membranes (30-50 μg of protein/ml). Each data point of phosphorylase activity in the figures is the average of triplicate experiments done with at least three different preparations of phosphorylase b or of SR membranes, and the error bars shown are the standard errors (n ≥ 9). When needed, the concentration of glucose 1-phosphate in the medium used for phosphorylase activity was measured from the increase in absorbance at 340 nm after the addition of 0.63 mM NADP+, 25 μg of phosphoglucomutase, and 15 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by interpolation in the calibration line obtained with solutions of known concentrations of glucose 1-phosphate. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured at 25°C using the coupled enzyme system pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (Warren et al., 1974Warren G.B. Toon P.A. Birdsall N.J.M. Lee A.G. Metcalfe J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 78: 795-799Google Scholar) as described (Gutiérrez-Merino et al., 1989Gutiérrez-Merino C. Molina A. Escudero B. Diez A. Laynez J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3398-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Cuenda et al., 1990Cuenda A. Henao F. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with the following assay medium: 100 mM TES (pH 7.4), 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 35 μg of pyruvate kinase, 30 μg of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 mM NADH, 0.42 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 2.5 mM ATP. On average, the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity of our preparations assayed in the presence of calcimycin (0.1 μg/μg of protein) ranged from 3 to 5 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein. The Ca2+-independent ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 3.5 mM EGTA and was <10% of total uncoupled ATPase activity. The steady-state level of calcium accumulation was monitored using arsenazo III as a metallochromic dye as described (Fernéndez-Salguero et al., 1990Fernéndez-Salguero P. Henao F. Laynez J. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The AMP deaminase and phosphoglucomutase activities of SR membrane preparations were determined from measurements of the AMP concentrations at different times as described (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On average, the AMP deaminase and phosphoglucomutase activities of our SR membrane preparations were found to be (1.12 ± 0.55) × 10-2 and (0.86 ± 0.33) × 10-3μmol of product/min/mg of membrane protein (n = 10), respectively. The correction of the effect of the AMP deaminase activity on the activity of phosphorylase b in the presence of SR membranes was done as follows. The decrease in AMP concentration and the increase in IMP concentration at every SR concentration at the given time of incubation were measured. By making use of the saturation curves for the phosphorylase activity induced by AMP and IMP, determined under the same experimental conditions, the loss of activity due to partial desaturation of AMP or IMP (1 - Y) was corrected using the following relationship: activitycorrected = activitymeasured× (1/Y). Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) was resolved from phosphorylase following the method of Strausbauch et al., 1967Strausbauch P.H. Kent A.B. Hedrick J.L. Fischer E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 671-675Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar with minor modifications, and PLP was taken as a measurement of phosphorylase content of SR membranes because no other proteins in the SR membranes contain PLP (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, to resolve PLP from phosphorylase, the enzyme was treated with 0.6 M perchloric acid for 30 min at 30°C with mild stirring, and the sample was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The concentration of PLP in the supernatant was determined using absorbance measurements at 410 nm of the PLP-phenylhydrazone derivative (ε = 3 × 104M-1 cm-1). Essentially, 1 volume of sample was mixed with 0.05 volume of 2% phenylhydrazine in 5 M NH2SO4 and then allowed to stand for 30 min before taking absorbance readings. The absorbance of samples of reconstituted Ca2+-ATPase with endogenous SR lipids treated as described above was used as the blank value in measurements of phosphorylase bound to SR membranes and was found to be <0.005 A at 410 nm (20 nmol of PLP gives an absorbance reading of 0.110 ± 0.005 A). Bovine serum albumin, AMP, ATP, α-amylose, PLP, phosphoenolpyruvate, EGTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, β-mercaptoethanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate, Sephadex G-50, glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, Trizma (Tris base), and TES were obtained from Sigma. Glycogen, NADH, NADP+, calcimycin, α-amylase, pyruvate kinase (200 IU), lactate dehydrogenase (550 IU), phosphoglucomutase (200 IU), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (350 IU) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Starch (70-80% amylopectin and 20-30%α-amylose) and all other chemicals used in this study were obtained from Merck. The activity of purified phosphorylase b is inhibited when the enzyme is incubated with SR membranes at 25°C (Cuenda et al., 1991Cuenda A. Centeno F. Gutiérrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The inhibition is fully reversed by dilution of the phosphorylase b/SR membrane mixture, thus showing that it is a reversible process. This excluded the possibility that the inhibition could be due to irreversible processes, such as proteolysis and/or denaturation of phosphorylase b. Increasing the temperature of the incubation medium from 25 to 37°C enhances the inhibition of purified phosphorylase b by SR membranes (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that the inhibition of phosphorylase b activity by SR membranes is stronger at physiological temperatures than at 25°C. In addition, the inhibition appears to be insensitive to physiological pH changes (6.0 and 7.4) (Fig. 1B). This inhibition is specific for SR membranes because neither incubation with liposomes from egg lecithin or from SR lipids nor incubation with plasma membrane vesicles from erythrocytes produces a significant inhibition of phosphorylase b activity (Cuenda et al., 1991Cuenda A. Centeno F. Gutiérrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).2 2A. Cuenda, M. Nogues, F. Henao, and C. Gutiérrez-Merino, unpublished results. The Ca2+,Mg2+-ATPase is the major protein component of the SR membrane, accounting for 70-80% of total SR protein (Andersen, 1989Andersen J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, preincubation of SR membranes with purified phosphorylase b (up to 8 mg/ml) had no effect on the Ca2+-ATPase activity, on Ca2+ binding to SR membranes, or on Ca2+ uptake by these membranes at pH 7 (data not shown). This and the lack of inhibition of phosphorylase b by incubation with Ca2+-ATPase reconstituted in egg lecithin (data not shown) suggest that interaction of phosphorylase b with another component(s) of the SR membrane should be producing the observed inhibition of its activity. Fig. 2 shows that the extent of inhibition of purified phosphorylase b by SR membranes is dependent on the time of incubation of SR membranes with the assay medium not containing AMP, prior to the addition of purified phosphorylase b. The time taken to achieve 50% inhibition (t) is linearly dependent on the concentration of SR membranes in the reaction medium (Fig. 2, inset). This inhibition is dependent on the presence of glucose 1-phosphate since if it is omitted from the incubation medium, no time-dependent inhibition of phosphorylase b activity was observed in the presence of up to 4 mg of SR protein/ml. Withdrawal of any other of the components of the incubation medium did not significantly alter the time course of inhibition shown in Fig. 2. The inhibition of phosphorylase b activity by preincubation of SR membranes with the assay medium cannot be explained in terms of glucose 1-phosphate depletion because the concentration of glucose 1-phosphate only decreased from 10 to 9.9 mM after a 120-min incubation with SR membranes (2 mg of protein/ml), a decrease that would account for <5% inhibition. In addition, this time-dependent inhibition was also observed in the presence of saturating concentrations (30 mM) of glucose 1-phosphate. A small amount of phosphoglucomutase activity is associated with the SR membranes (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since glucose 6-phosphate is a well known allosteric inhibitor of phosphorylase b (Graves and Wang, 1972Graves D.J. Wang J.H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 435-482Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that this time-dependent inhibition could be due to glucose 6-phosphate production from glucose 1-phosphate. As shown in Fig. 2, production of glucose 6-phosphate cannot account for the time-dependent inhibition observed. Despite the absence of AMP in the reaction medium used in the incubation of SR membranes, there is a low but significant phosphorylase activity in the direction of glycogen synthesis ((0.40 ± 0.02) × 10-3μmol/min/mg of SR protein (n = 10)). Taking into account that the SR membrane preparations used in this study contain <0.1 mg of phosphorylase b/mg of SR protein (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; see below), this activity is close to that reported elsewhere for purified phosphorylase b in the absence of AMP, 0.1 IU (Madsen and Shechosky, 1967Madsen N.B. Shechosky S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3301-3307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polysaccharide synthesized by phosphorylase b activity is linear (Graves and Wang, 1972Graves D.J. Wang J.H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 435-482Google Scholar), and the spectral characteristics of the complex of the polysaccharide synthesized by SR membranes with I2 confirmed this point and the lack of glycogen branching activity in these membranes (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The preparations of SR membranes contain glycogen (see “Materials and Methods” and Wanson and Drochmans, 1972Wanson J.C. Drochmans P. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since treatment with α-amylase dissociates endogenous phosphorylase b from SR membranes (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that inhibition of purified phosphorylase b by SR membranes could be due to interaction with linear polysaccharide fragments associated with these membranes. The kinetic properties of purified phosphorylase b with starch and α-amylose as substrates support this hypothesis. Fig. 3A shows that for purified phosphorylase b, the Kmvalues obtained with glycogen, starch, and α-amylose are approximately the same. However, the Vmax values for purified phosphorylase b with starch (16 ± 2 IU) and with α-amylose (7 ± 1 IU) were much lower than the Vmax that we obtained with glycogen (28 ± 3 IU). In addition, the K0.5(AMP) values with starch and α-amylose as substrates obtained from Hill plots of the data of Fig. 3B (170 ± 20 and 220 ± 20 μM, respectively) are severalfold higher than the K0.5(AMP) with glycogen as substrate (30 ± 5 μM) (Fig. 3B and Table I).Table IKinetic constants for substrates and ligands of phosphorylase Open table in a new tab The SR preparations used in this study have a phosphorylase activity in the presence of 1 mM AMP between 0.3 and 0.75 μmol of glucose 1-phosphate released per min/mg of SR membrane protein. At least 95% of this activity is in the unphosphorylated b form since this activity depends on the presence of AMP (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The content of phosphorylase in these membranes was measured as described under “Materials and Methods” by assaying the content of PLP and also by using polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylase. The values obtained ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 mg of phosphorylase/mg of membrane protein. Therefore, we obtained a specific Vmax at 30°C and pH 6.9 for phosphorylase b bound to SR membranes of 12 ± 6 IU (n = 14). This Vmax is clearly lower than that for soluble and purified enzyme (25-30 IU) and close to the Vmax obtained using starch as substrate instead of glycogen (Fig. 3A). If the inhibition of phosphorylase b activity by SR membranes is due to the use of low branched polysaccharide associated with SR membranes instead of glycogen as substrate, the dependence of the activity on AMP concentration should be altered (see above). Fig. 4 and Table I show that the activation by AMP and IMP of the phosphorylase b activity associated with SR membranes is shifted to higher nucleotide concentrations. The apparent K0.5(AMP) was 100 ± 10 μM for phosphorylase b associated with SR membranes. This is ~3-fold higher than that obtained for the purified enzyme (30 ± 5 μM) with glycogen as substrate (Fig. 4A), and it is closer to the K0.5(AMP) with starch as substrate, 170 ± 20 μM (Fig. 3B). The slope of the Hill plot of the dependence of the activity on AMP concentration was 1.7-1.8 and therefore shows characteristics of positive cooperativity in the activation process, like purified phosphorylase b (Morange et al., 1976Morange M. Garcia-Blanco F. Vanderbunder B. Buc H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained from the analysis of the activation by IMP of phosphorylase b bound to SR membranes (Fig. 4B). Table I shows that association of phosphorylase b with SR membranes had no effect on the Kmvalues for Pi and glycogen and on the Kifor glucose 6-phosphate. If AMP causes the dissociation of phosphorylase b from the SR membranes, this can account for the apparent lack of effect of SR membranes on these kinetic parameters since they were obtained under saturating concentrations of AMP. Therefore, we measured the dissociation constant for purified phosphorylase b from SR membranes in the absence and presence of AMP, and the results obtained are presented below. SR membranes (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with different concentrations of purified phosphorylase b (0.5-15 mg/ml) at 25°C in 10 mM TES/KOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 M KCl. After a 15-min incubation, SR membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 90 min at 25°C. In control experiments, we demonstrated that SR membranes were completely pelleted by this procedure because no significant Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured in the supernatant. Furthermore, purified phosphorylase b under these conditions remained in the supernatant, as shown by the fact that the phosphorylase activity in the supernatant was identical before and after centrifugation in the absence of added SR membranes. The concentration of phosphorylase b in the supernatant (free phosphorylase b) was determined by measuring the concentration of PLP as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentration of phosphorylase b bound to the membrane was calculated as the difference between total and free phosphorylase b. Identical values were obtained by directly measuring the concentration of PLP in the membrane pellet. Scatchard plots of the results obtained in a typical experimental series are presented in Fig. 5. The scatter of the data at low phosphorylase b concentrations is likely due to the variation in the content of phosphorylase in the SR membrane preparations used in these experiments (from 0.03 to 0.1 mg of phosphorylase/mg of total SR protein). It can be readily observed that the data demonstrate that the binding of phosphorylase b to SR membranes shows, at most, weak positive cooperativity. Fig. 5 illustrates that an SR membrane concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml can bind up to 2.0-2.5 mg of phosphorylase/ml and that the endogenous content of phosphorylase in our SR preparations accounts for only 3-10% of the maximum binding capacity of SR membranes. From the results shown in Fig. 5, a Kdof 1.7 ± 0.6 mg of phosphorylase b/ml was obtained, a value that is well below the phosphorylase concentration in skeletal muscle cells (~10 mg/ml) (Fischer et al., 1978Fischer E.H. Alaba J.O. Brantigan D.L. Kerrick W.G.L. Malencik D.A. Moeschler H.J. Picton C. Pocinwong S. Li C.H. Proceedings of the International Symposium on Proteins, Taipei, Taiwan, March 6-8, 1978. Academic Press, New York1978: 133Google Scholar). This Kdis close to the concentration of SR membranes producing 50% of the maximum inhibition of phosphorylase activity in titrations of purified phosphorylase b with SR membranes (Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy that the inhibition of phosphorylase b by light, heavy, and unfractionated SR membranes was found to be the same within experimental error (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows that in the presence of saturating AMP concentration (1 mM), the dissociation constant for phosphorylase b from SR membranes is ~3-fold higher than the one obtained in its absence. Therefore, if inhibition of phosphorylase b is a consequence of its binding to SR membranes, it can be predicted that the Kiobtained from titrations of the activity of purified phosphorylase b with SR membranes should be dependent on the concentration of AMP. Plotted in Fig. 6 are the results obtained from these titrations in the presence of the following AMP concentrations: 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mM, which produced endogenous phosphorylase activities of SR membranes of ~25, 50, and 95% of the Vmax at saturation by AMP, respectively (Fig. 4). An ~3-fold increase in the Kiis produced when the AMP concentration is raised from 0.05 to 0.5 mM, in good agreement with the conclusions derived from the Scatchard plots in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 also shows that in the presence of AMP, the SR membranes can bind at saturation approximately twice the amount of phosphorylase b than in the absence of AMP. This latter result can be simply rationalized taking into account that AMP shifts the dimer ⇌ tetramer equilibrium toward the tetramer of phosphorylase b (Merino et al., 1976Merino C. Garca-Blanco F. Laynez J. FEBS Lett. 1976; 67: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The association of phosphorylase b with SR membranes is reversible, and upon dissociation, phosphorylase is fully active (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that SR membranes can act as a phosphorylase b reservoir in skeletal muscle cells. The results presented in this paper support this hypothesis since the dissociation constant (Kd) for phosphorylase b from the SR membranes determined in this study at 25°C at physiological pH and ionic strength is 1.7 ± 0.6 mg of phosphorylase b/ml. A 2-3-fold decrease in the Kdis produced by raising the temperature from 25 to 37°C. Owing to the high content of phosphorylase in skeletal muscle cells (~10 mg/ml) (Fischer et al., 1978Fischer E.H. Alaba J.O. Brantigan D.L. Kerrick W.G.L. Malencik D.A. Moeschler H.J. Picton C. Pocinwong S. Li C.H. Proceedings of the International Symposium on Proteins, Taipei, Taiwan, March 6-8, 1978. Academic Press, New York1978: 133Google Scholar; Varsanyi and Heilmeyer, 1981Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 131: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and to the large membrane network of SR in these cells (>1.5 mg of protein/ml) (MacLennan, 1970MacLennan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4508-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be estimated that a large fraction of phosphorylase b must be bound to SR membranes in vivo. The conversion of phosphorylase b to a produces dissociation of fully active phosphorylase from SR membranes since phosphorylase a binds ~10-fold more weakly than phosphorylase b (Cuenda et al., 1991Cuenda A. Centeno F. Gutiérrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, we show in this study that the association constant for phosphorylase b with SR membranes is 3-fold lower in the presence of AMP, the allosteric activator of phosphorylase b, which produces a conformational change in this enzyme close to that observed upon phosphorylation (Barford et al., 1991Barford D. Hu S.H. Johnson L.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). On the basis of in vivo concentrations of relevant metabolites, it has been estimated that in normal skeletal muscle during contraction, ~10-14% of total phosphorylase activity can be attributed to the allosteric activation of this enzyme by AMP (Busby and Radda, 1976Busby S.J.W. Radda G.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1976; 10: 89-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, however, that the effect of compartmentation of phosphorylase was not taken into account when doing these calculations. The results reported in this paper show that binding of phosphorylase b to SR membranes produces inhibition of the activity of this enzyme and a severalfold increase in the K0.5 of activation by AMP and IMP. As a result, the allosteric activation of phosphorylase b in vivo by nucleotides (AMP and IMP) must be lower than previously assumed, at least by a factor of 2. Thus, the association of phosphorylase with SR membranes will result in a more efficient cutoff of glycogenolysis after muscle contraction ceases. The association of AMP deaminase with SR membranes (Cuenda et al., 1994Cuenda A. Henao F. Nogues M. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) should also contribute to this end since this will result in even further decreases in the local AMP concentration near phosphorylase b bound to SR membranes. Inhibition of phosphorylase b was produced by SR membranes, but not by other membrane preparations, such as erythrocyte membranes, or by liposomes prepared from lipids extracted from these membranes (Cuenda et al., 1991Cuenda A. Centeno F. Gutiérrez-Merino C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; data not shown). Therefore, the inhibition of phosphorylase b by SR membranes must be caused by its interaction with a non-lipid component of SR membranes. In spite of the high content of Ca2+-ATPase in SR membranes, purified Ca2+-ATPase reconstituted with egg lecithin or endogenous SR lipids failed to produce inhibition of phosphorylase (data not shown). SR membrane preparations contain 32 ± 10 μg of glycogen/mg of protein, enriched in linear polysaccharide fragments with respect to glycogen purified from skeletal muscle (see “Materials and Methods” and Wanson and Drochmans, 1968Wanson J.C. Drochmans P. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 130-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is likely that this glycogen is tightly bound to the glycogen-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase-1, PP1G, a protein component of the SR membranes (Hubbard and Cohen, 1993Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Because treatment of SR membranes with α-amylase promotes dissociation of phosphorylase b from the SR membrane (Wanson and Drochmans, 1972Wanson J.C. Drochmans P. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; this paper), we considered the possibility that the inhibition of phosphorylase is a consequence of binding to linear polysaccharide fragments tightly associated with SR membranes. This hypothesis is supported by the following experimental results reported in this paper. 1) The inhibition of the activity of purified phosphorylase b by SR membranes is strongly potentiated by incubation of SR membranes in a medium containing all the components required for polysaccharide synthesis by the phosphorylase associated with these membranes. In addition, the spectral characteristics of the I2-polysaccharide complex showed that the polysaccharide synthesized is an α-amylose type. 2) The Vmax for purified phosphorylase b with α-amylose as substrate (7 ± 1 IU) is only 25% of the Vmax with glycogen (28 ± 3 IU). With starch, the Vmax (16 ± 2 IU) is about half the Vmax with glycogen, and it is close to the activity obtained for phosphorylase b associated with SR membrane preparations (12 ± 6 IU). 3) Endogenous phosphorylase b associated with SR membranes has a K0.5(AMP) severalfold higher than that for purified phosphorylase b with glycogen as substrate. This is also seen with purified phosphorylase b when α-amylose or starch is used as substrate instead of glycogen. The simplest hypothesis of how phosphorylase b binds to the SR membranes in vitro is that it initially associates with glycogen particles on the membrane, which act as anchoring points until new binding sites are formed by the elongation of the polysaccharide. Light scattering studies show that the SR membranes preferentially associate with low branched polysaccharides,2 and this is consistent with the fact that glycogen associated with the SR membranes has long end chains with a mean length of 16-18 glucose units (Wanson and Drochmans, 1968Wanson J.C. Drochmans P. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 130-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since the Vmax for phosphorylase b is much lower when α-amylose is used as substrate instead of glycogen, binding to the SR membranes results in a high level of inhibition of phosphorylase activity measured in the presence of glycogen. From the results obtained with purified phosphorylase b and α-amylose as substrate, a maximum inhibition of 75-80% should be expected after a long preincubation of the SR membranes with the assay medium, which allows for a large elongation (through α-1,4-glycosidic bonds) of the end chains of the glycogen associated with the SR membranes. The maximum inhibition experimentally measured (80-90%) is in good agreement with this prediction. Neither the Ca2+ dependence nor the Vmax for the Ca2+ pumping activity of SR membranes mediated by the Ca2+-ATPase is altered by this association. Values were obtained from titrations with glycogen, Pi, AMP, or IMP at 30°C in 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.63 mM NADP+, 50 mM imidazole (pH 6.9), 25 μg of phosphoglucomutase, and 15 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase plus phosphorylase b (1 μg/ml) or SR membranes (30-50 μg of protein/ml).

INTRODUCTIONBecause of its inherent inefficiency and its dual activities of biosynthetic carboxylation and biodegradative oxygenation of RuBP1, 1The abbreviations used are: RuBPD-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphatePGA3-phospho-D-glyceratePGyc2-phosphoglycolateRubiscoD-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseXuBPD-xylulose 1,5-bisphosphateBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) is viewed as a fulcrum of biomass yields (see Ref. 1Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review of Rubisco). Catalytic turnover of RuBP by Rubisco involves several unstable intermediates (Fig. 1): the 2,3-enediolate of RuBP (I), 2-carboxyl-3-ketoarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (and its hydrate) (II, III), and the C2 carbanion of PGA (VI) all in the carboxylation pathway and the same enediolate (I) and a putative C-2 peroxy derivative of RuBP (and its hydrate) (IV, V) in the oxygenation pathway. Questions then arise as to how the enzyme mitigates decomposition of labile intermediates and ensures normal throughput of substrate. We are attempting to address these questions by use of site-directed mutagenesis to probe potentially relevant structural elements as suggested by the x-ray structure (2Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One such structural element is a mobile segment of the N-terminal domain of the interfacial active site, which includes the catalytically facilitative residue Glu-48. In this report, we show that the E48Q mutant of the Rhodospirillum rubrum enzyme, although severely impaired in carboxylase activity, catalyzes the oxidation of RuBP to D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate. As a signature of the corresponding peroxy derivative of RuBP, this novel dicarbonyl product provides the most direct evidence to date for a peroxy intermediate in the normal oxygenase pathway as first invoked in pioneering studies of Lorimer et al.(3Lorimer G.H. Andrews T.J. Tolbert N.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCommon laboratory reagents and biological materials were procured at the highest level of purity readily available. [1-3H]RuBP and [5-3H]RuBP were synthesized from commercial [2-3H]glucose and [6-3H]glucose, respectively, by a published procedure (4Kuehn G.D. Hsu T.-C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The E48Q mutant of R. rubrum Rubisco was isolated from transformed Escherichia coli MV1190 as described earlier (5Lee E.H. Harpel M.R. Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 26583-26591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was homogeneous, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The concentration of the mutant protein was based on the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of the wild-type enzyme (A of 1.2 for 1 mg/ml) (6Schloss J.V. Phares E.F. Long M.V. Norton I.L. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Analyses of turnover products derived from [1-3H]RuBP or [5-3H]RuBP followed the published anion-exchange method (7Harpel M.R. Lee E.H. Hartman F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Detailed reaction conditions are provided in the figure and table legends. Except where noted, all reactions were carried out at room temperature and included air-saturated concentrations of O2 (255 μM).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe active sites of Rubisco are interfacial (8Larimer F.W. Lee E.H. Mural R.J. Soper T.S. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15327-15329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), being comprised of the β/α-barrel domain from one subunit and the N-terminal domain of the adjacent identical subunit (9Andersson I. Knight S. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. Brändén C.-I. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 229-234Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). During catalysis, the active sites are apparently occluded by flexible segments (loop 6 from the β/α-barrel domain and helix B from the N-terminal domain) that extend over the mouth of the barrel and approach each other. In this closed conformation, visualized directly in the three-dimensional structure of the exchange-resistant complex of activated enzyme and the reaction-intermediate analogue 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, active-site Lys-329 (located at the apex of loop 6) and active-site Glu-48 (located at the C-terminal end of helix B) engage in intersubunit electrostatic interaction (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).We have used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the roles of the intersubunit salt bridge and the residues therein (5Lee E.H. Harpel M.R. Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 26583-26591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Harpel M.R. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5553-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as well as loop 6 per se(12Larson E.M. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (in press)Google Scholar), in intermediate stabilization and control of ligand ingress to and egress from the active site. Prior characterization (5Lee E.H. Harpel M.R. Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 26583-26591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the E48Q mutant showed that Glu-48 enhances the carboxylation rate by 200-fold and that disruption of the salt bridge decreases the carboxylation/oxygenation partitioning ratio and leads to extensive misprotonation of the intermediate enediolate at C-3 to form XuBP, a poor alternate substrate for Rubisco. Whereas this error occurs only once per 400 turnovers with the native spinach enzyme (13Edmondson D.L. Kane H.J. Andrews T.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 62-66Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is undetectable with the wild-type R. rubrum enzyme (5Lee E.H. Harpel M.R. Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 26583-26591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), misprotonation and carboxylation of the enediolate occur at similar rates with the E48Q mutant. In addition to XuBP, an uncharacterized minor side product (denoted unknown in Fig. 2) was also formed during turnover of RuBP by E48Q.Figure 2:Anion-exchange chromatographic analyses of radioactive products generated from [1-3H]RuBP by E48Q. [1-3H]RuBP (250 μM) and E48Q (1 mg/ml) were incubated in 0.5 ml of pH 8.0 buffer (50 mM Bicine, 66 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% glycerol). At 30 s (panel A), 10 min (panel B), and 60 min (panel C), 100-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched with 1% (w/v) SDS, deproteinated (Amicon Centricon-10 filters), and chromatographed at pH 8.0 on a MonoQ anion exchanger (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. HR5/5, 5 × 50 mm) with a gradient (depicted only in panel A) of NH4Cl containing a fixed concentration of 10 mM sodium borate. Radioactivity was monitored continuously by flow-through radiometric detection (IN/US β-RAM). Ƭ values were calculated from the ratio of radioactive peak areas for PGA and PGyc (corresponding to the kinetic partitioning between carboxylation and oxygenation) according to the relationship, Ƭ = (vc/v0)/([CO2]/[O2]) (14Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Panel D depicts an identical, 60-min reaction mixture (100 μl), except for the inclusion of 80 mM borate. Analysis of a third reaction mixture (300 μl) (30 min), which was identical to that shown in panel D but freed of oxygen by inclusion of protocatechuate and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (7Harpel M.R.

Unk, unknown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Curiously, the carboxylation/oxygenation partitioning ratio (VcK0/VcKƬ) (14Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) declines during progression of [1-3H]RuBP utilization by E48Q. For example, the Ƭ value provided by the [3-3H]PGA/[2-3H]PGyc ratio declines from 2.0 at early stages of RuBP utilization to 0.3 at completion, with PGA and PGyc as the sole end products (Fig. 2, A-C). By contrast, the Ƭ value of the wild-type enzyme is about 11 (7Harpel M.R. Lee E.H. Hartman F.C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 227: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and is independent of the extent of RuBP turnover. Thus, a transient product (XuBP or the unknown) must be partitioned differently than RuBP by the mutant enzyme. Since XuBP and RuBP should yield the same enediolate, the unknown presumably accounts for the Ƭ dependence on the extent of RuBP turnover. This contention is supported by inclusion of borate in the reaction mixture, thereby trapping the unknown and retarding its subsequent processing (Fig. 2D). Under these conditions, 35% of the input RuBP is converted to the unknown, and the Ƭ value is raised to 1.6 (i.e. disproportionately less PGyc is formed when processing of the unknown is blocked). The unknown is not formed in the absence of oxygen (Fig. 2E).Its late elution position from the anion-exchange column, in conjunction with the oxygen requirement for its formation, indicated that the unknown might be an oxidized analogue of RuBP with both phosphate groups intact. A compound fitting this description is D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Such a dicarbonyl bisphosphate should undergo oxidative cleavage by hydrogen peroxide to form PGyc and PGA, condensation with o-phenylenediamine to form a dioxime, and reduction with sodium borohydride to form ribitol bisphosphate, arabinitol bisphosphate, and xylitol bisphosphate in molar ratios of 1:2:1 (Fig. 3). Purified unknown (Fig. 4), derived from [1-3H]RuBP, was subjected to each of these chemical treatments, and the resulting products were identified by anion-exchange chromatography. As predicted, cleavage of the unknown with hydrogen peroxide gave PGyc as the only labeled product (Fig. 4B), condensation with o-phenylenediamine gave complete conversion to a less acidic compound (Fig. 4C), and borohydride reduction gave an approximate 1:2:1 mixture of the three pentitol bisphosphates (Fig. 4D). These experiments were repeated with purified unknown derived from [5-3H]RuBP. Chromatographic profiles were identical to those shown in Fig. 4 with the exception of PGA rather than PGyc as the only labeled product of oxidative cleavage (data not shown). We conclude that the unknown is D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate and stress that neither the corresponding 2,4-pentodiulose nor any of the pentulose isomers would exhibit the observed chemical properties.Figure 3:Predicted reactions of D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate with hydrogen peroxide, o-phenylenediamine, or sodium borohydride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4:Characterization of D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The dicarbonyl bisphosphate (55 μmol) was isolated by MonoQ chromatography of a reaction mixture consisting of [1-3H]RuBP and E48Q as described in the legend for Fig. 2D. Rechromatography on MonoQ of a portion of the isolated material demonstrates its purity (panel A). Another portion of the isolated material (7 μM) was treated with 1 M hydrogen peroxide in 10 mM sodium borate (pH 8.0) for 1 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with 9 volumes of H2O followed by the addition of 2,000 units of catalase. Following deproteination, the sample was chromatographed (panel B). A third portion of the dicarbonyl bisphosphate (4 μM) in 50 mM Bicine (pH 8.0) was incubated with 100 mMo-phenylenediamine for 1 h prior to chromatography (panel C). A fourth portion of the dicarbonyl bisphosphate (7 μM) was treated at 2°C with 10 mM NaBH4 for 15 min in a pH 8.0 buffer containing 50 mM Bicine, 85 mM NaCl, 120 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, 66 mM NaHCO3, and 1 mM EDTA and chromatographed subsequent to the addition of glucose (20 mM) to consume excess borohydride (panel D); peak assignments are based on standards (7Harpel M.R.

Unk, unknown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our earlier study (5Lee E.H. Harpel M.R. Chen Y.-R. Hartman F.C. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 26583-26591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tentatively (and erroneously) identified this compound as 3-ketoarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, which would be formed by misprotonation of the enediolate at C-2 and has indeed been reported as a minor product with wild-type spinach Rubisco (16Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1354-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our misidentification was based on borohydride reduction in which arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate was the only significant product. The reduction was carried out at pH 8.0 in 120 mM NH4Cl containing 10 mM sodium borate, i.e. the solvent composition for the compound as eluted from the MonoQ column. We have confirmed that reduction of D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate under these conditions yields arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate almost exclusively. In contrast, at higher ionic strengths as used in the present study and described in the legend for Fig. 4D, the reduction leads to the statistically predicted ratio of the three pentitol bisphosphates. We conclude that at relatively low ionic strengths complexation of borate by the dicarbonyl compound results in stereoselective borohydride reduction.The formation of PGA and PGyc as the sole end products of RuBP turnover by E48Q and the disproportionate increase in labeled PGyc (from [1-3H]RuBP as substrate) as turnover progresses prompt the deductions that D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate must serve as an alternate substrate for the mutant enzyme and that PGyc must be a product. Incubation of the isolated [1-3H]dicarbonyl bisphosphate with E48Q indeed gives PGyc as the only labeled product (Fig. 4E), whereas turnover of the isolated [5-3H]dicarbonyl bisphosphate identifies PGA as the other cleavage product (data not shown). Although we have not studied the enzyme-catalyzed turnover of the dicarbonyl bisphosphate in detail, the process is oxygen-dependent (data not shown) and thus appears similar to oxidative cleavage of the compound by hydrogen peroxide.Oxidation of RuBP by molecular oxygen to form a 2,3-pentodiulose can only occur via a C-2 peroxy intermediate (Fig. 5), identical to that proposed in the normal oxygenase pathway of Rubisco catalysis leading to PGA and PGyc (3Lorimer G.H. Andrews T.J. Tolbert N.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although this earlier postulate was chemically sound and was supported by the appearance in PGyc of one atom of oxygen derived from molecular oxygen and also supported by 17O-EPR (17Brändén R. Nilsson T. Styring S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4378-4382Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), proof has been lacking due to inherent instability of the putative intermediate. Our discovery of D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate provides a direct signature of the oxygenase intermediate and thus confirms the proposed pathway for oxidative cleavage of RuBP by Rubisco. Our studies also illustrate alternate fates for the peroxy intermediate: carbon-carbon scission as promoted by wild-type enzyme or elimination of hydrogen peroxide as promoted by E48Q. Formation of hydrogen peroxide concomitant with the dicarbonyl bisphosphate has been verified by use of peroxidase and catalase (Table I). Thus, the demonstrated chemistry is reminiscent of flavin hydroperoxides, which dissociate to hydrogen peroxide and oxidized flavin (see Ref. 18Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a review).Figure 5:Formation of the C-2 peroxy compound from RuBP and partitioning to D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose 1,5-bisphosphate or PGyc and PGA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IFormation of hydrogen peroxide during turnover of RuBP by the E48Q mutant[1-3H]RuBP (250 μM) and E48Q (1 mg/ml) were incubated in 300 μl of pH 8.0 Bicine buffer (inclusive of 80 mM sodium borate) as described in the legend for Fig. 2D with and without catalase (1000 units). After 1 h, one-third of each reaction mixture was mixed with an equal volume of 2 M sodium acetate to lower the pH to 5.4 and then assayed for peroxide; the remainder of each reaction mixture was quenched with 1% (w/v) SDS, deproteinated, and chromatographed. Open table in a new tab Outstanding issues, worthy of future consideration, include identification of factors that dictate the ultimate fate of the dicarbonyl bisphosphate, the mechanism of its enzyme-catalyzed oxidative cleavage, whether it might be formed with wild-type enzyme but cleaved prior to dissociation from the active site and hence never before detected, and whether it might be partially responsible for the time-dependent inactivation of higher plant Rubisco that occurs during RuBP turnover (13Edmondson D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2039349692,"Histochemical study indicated that the posterior pituitary possesses numerous microvesicles (MVs) containing synaptophysin, a marker protein specific for brain synaptic vesicles (Navone, F., Di Gioia, G., Jahn, R., Browning, M., Greengard, P., and De Camilli, P. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 3425–2433). By monitoring cross-reactivity with anti-synaptophysin antibody, the MVs were highly purified from bovine posterior pituitaries by a combination of differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugations. The purified MVs had an average diameter of about 60 nm and were associated with synaptophysin as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. The vesicles contained ATPase activity partially sensitive to bafilomycin A1 and to vanadate. The membrane fraction immunoisolated with anti-synaptophysin antibody also exhibited similar ATPase activity. The two ATPases could be purified separately; the vanadate-sensitive enzyme was identified as a 115-kDa polypeptide immunochemically similar to chromaffin granule P-ATPase (forming phosphoenzyme intermediate), and the bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase showed essentially the same properties as those of vacuolar type H+-ATPases. Upon addition of ATP, the MVs formed an electrochemical gradient of protons and took up norepinephrine in a reserpine-sensitive manner, indicating the presence of secondary monoamine transporter coupled with vacuolar type H+-ATPase. No uptake of L-glutamate, γ-aminobutyrate, glycine, or acetylcholine was observed. The identification of MVs as organelles responsible for storage of monoamines is important for understanding the physiological function of the posterior pituitary. Histochemical study indicated that the posterior pituitary possesses numerous microvesicles (MVs) containing synaptophysin, a marker protein specific for brain synaptic vesicles (Navone, F., Di Gioia, G., Jahn, R., Browning, M., Greengard, P., and De Camilli, P. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 3425–2433). By monitoring cross-reactivity with anti-synaptophysin antibody, the MVs were highly purified from bovine posterior pituitaries by a combination of differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugations. The purified MVs had an average diameter of about 60 nm and were associated with synaptophysin as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. The vesicles contained ATPase activity partially sensitive to bafilomycin A1 and to vanadate. The membrane fraction immunoisolated with anti-synaptophysin antibody also exhibited similar ATPase activity. The two ATPases could be purified separately; the vanadate-sensitive enzyme was identified as a 115-kDa polypeptide immunochemically similar to chromaffin granule P-ATPase (forming phosphoenzyme intermediate), and the bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase showed essentially the same properties as those of vacuolar type H+-ATPases. Upon addition of ATP, the MVs formed an electrochemical gradient of protons and took up norepinephrine in a reserpine-sensitive manner, indicating the presence of secondary monoamine transporter coupled with vacuolar type H+-ATPase. No uptake of L-glutamate, γ-aminobutyrate, glycine, or acetylcholine was observed. The identification of MVs as organelles responsible for storage of monoamines is important for understanding the physiological function of the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary contains nerve endings of hypothalamic neurons. Two kinds of vesicles have been identified in the nerve endings: dense-cored secretory granules with diameters of 100–300 nm (neurosecretory granules) and microvesicles (MVs) 1The abbreviations used are: MV, synaptophysin-containing microvesicle; C12E9, polyoxylethylene 9-laurylether; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; MES, 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NE, norepinephrine; [3H]NE, DL-[7–3H]norepinephrine; P-ATPase, ATPase forming phosphorylated intermediate; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; V1, an extrinsic sector of V-ATPase; SCH28080, 2-methyl-8(phenylmethoxyl)imidazo(1′-2α)pyridene-3-acetonitrile.1The abbreviations used are: MV, synaptophysin-containing microvesicle; C12E9, polyoxylethylene 9-laurylether; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; MES, 2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NE, norepinephrine; [3H]NE, DL-[7–3H]norepinephrine; P-ATPase, ATPase forming phosphorylated intermediate; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; V1, an extrinsic sector of V-ATPase; SCH28080, 2-methyl-8(phenylmethoxyl)imidazo(1′-2α)pyridene-3-acetonitrile. with average diameters of about 60 nm (1Tweedle C.D.

The microvesicles were first postulated to be vesicles formed during membrane recycling of neurosecretory granules fused with plasma membranes upon exocytosis (6Gerschenfeld H.M. Tramezzani J.H. de Robertis E. Endocrinology. 1960; 66: 741-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Later, their morphological similarities to brain synaptic vesicles were reported (7Douglas W.W. Nagasawa J. Schulz R. Mem. Soc. Endocrinol. 1970; 19: 353-377Google Scholar, 8Broadwell R.D.

More recently, Navone et al. (11Navone F. Di Gioia G. Jahn R. Browning M. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in histochemical studies demonstrated the presence of synaptic vesicle proteins (i.e. synapsin I and synaptophysin) in microvesicles. Furthermore, Walch-Solimena et al. (12Walch-Solimena C. Takei K. Marek K.L. Midyett K. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Jahn R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found synaptotagmin in these vesicles. These results suggest that the microvesicles have proteins necessary for exocytosis and may be involved in a novel type of neurosecretion. However, the detailed properties of these vesicles are unknown, because they could not be purified previously for biochemical studies. In this study, we established a procedure for isolating microvesicles from bovine posterior pituitary and found that these vesicles accumulate norepinephrine depending on an electrochemical proton gradient established by V-ATPase. Interestingly, these microvesicles did not accumulate other transmitters such as L-glutamate or GABA, in contrast to synaptic vesicles prepared from a brain homogenate. These studies indicate that microvesicles participate in storage and secretion of NE from the posterior pituitary. [3H]NE (24.7 Ci/mmol), l-[3H]glutamate (17.25 Ci/mmol), [3H]GABA (36.8 Ci/mmol), [3H]glycine (22.5 Ci/mmol), [14C]acetylcholine (3.6 mCi/mmol), 125I-protein A (0.5 mCi/mg protein) and 126I-antimouse IgG (87.7 Ci/ml), and [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN, Amersham Corp., or ICN-Biochemicals. Other chemicals used in this study were of the highest grade commercially available. Phosphatidylserine, ouabain, and SCH28080 were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Sigma, and Dr. George Sachs, respectively. V-ATPase and vanadate-sensitive ATPase were purified from bovine adrenal chromaffin granules (13Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against V-ATPase subunits, vanadate-sensitive ATPase, and rat mitochondrial Fl-ATPase were raised by injecting the individual proteins into albino rabbits. Monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin was prepared as described previously (15Obata K. Nishiya H. Fujita S.C. Shirao T. Inoue H. Uchizono K. Brain Res. 1986; 375: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All steps for purifications of MVs and ATPases were carried out at 4 °C. Twenty bovine posterior pituitaries were kept in ice and used within a few hours after their isolation at a local slaughterhouse. They were washed twice, suspended in 50 ml of SME buffer (20 mit MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 ng/ml leupeptin, and 5 µg/ml pepstatin A), and homogenized by a few strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant pellet (light mitochondrial fraction) was washed once and suspended in SME buffer (5 ml), and an aliquot of 1 ml was applied to a continuous sucrose density gradient (8 ml of 0.4–2 m sucrose containing 5 µg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin). After centrifugation at 78,000 × g for 3 h, three distinct bands were obtained: upper (white), middle (brown), and bottom (white) bands containing vesicles with synaptophysin, mitochondria, and neurosecretory granules, respectively. The upper band was collected (about 3 ml in total) and rapidly diluted into 150 ml of 5 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 5 µg/ml pepstatin A and leupeptin. The solution was kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was carefully withdrawn by pipette and recentrifuged at 140,000 × g for 1 h. The transparent pellet (crude MV fraction) was suspended in SME buffer, diluted 1.5-fold with distilled water (total volume, about 1 ml), applied to a second sucrose gradient (4 ml of 0.3–1.0 m sucrose containing protease inhibitors), and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 2 h. The upper band was collected, diluted with SME buffer, and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet (purified MVs) was suspended in SME and stored at –70 °C until use. The MV fraction (2.5 mg protein/ml; 2 ml) was supplemented with 1% C12E9, incubated for 5 min, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 10 mm MES-Tricine buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm monothioglycerol and 0.1% C12E9 (buffer A). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 20% saturation, and the mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min. The fluffy white precipitate rich in V-ATPase was suspended in buffer A, and 1 ml of the suspension was applied to a continuous glycerol density gradient (5 ml, 10–30%) in buffer A. After centrifugation at 330,000 × g for 5 h, fractions containing V-ATPase were pooled and stored at –70 °C. The 20% ammonium sulfate supernatant was mixed with solid ammonium sulfate to give 40% saturation and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was brought to 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 20 min. The floating precipitate, rich in vanadate-sensitive ATPase, was suspended in buffer A (about 1 mg of protein/ml) and stored at –70 °C. MVs (about 40 µg of protein) were suspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm ATP-Tris. The uptake of [3H]NE into MVs was assayed at 30 °C by adding 5 µm [3H]NE (2 µCi). Aliquots (150 µl) were taken at intervals and applied to 0.45-µm Millipore filters (type HA). Their radioactivities were counted in a liquid scintillation counter after extensive washing (16Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Uptakes of other radiolabeled transmitters (0.1 mm) were assayed essentially by the same procedures as described above except that KCl concentration was reduced to 4 mm for glutamate uptake. Conventional and immunoelectron microscopy (17Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and other procedures (18Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18445-18450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were as described previously. Cross-reactivity with anti-synaptophysin antibody was used in preparation of MVs from bovine posterior pituitaries. The final preparation showed 18-fold enrichment of MVs over the post-nuclear supernatant with about 50% recovery (about 1 mg of protein from 20 pituitaries) (Table I). The key purification step was the first sucrose gradient centrifugation in which MVs were clearly separated from neurosecretory granules (Fig. 1): MVs contained synaptophysin but not neurophysin (a marker protein for neurosecretory granules). The purified MVs were small vesicles with an average diameter of about 60 nm (Fig. 2A) and were recognized by anti-synaptophysin antibody (Fig. 2B). The purified MV fraction contained essentially no vasopressin, F0F1-ATPase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, or adenosine monophosphatase (Table I). Cytochrome b561, which is a membrane component of neurosecretory granules (12Walch-Solimena C. Takei K. Marek K.L. Midyett K. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Jahn R. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not detectable immunologically (data not shown). These results indicated that the purified MV fraction was not contaminated appreciably with neurosecretory granules, mitochondria, lysosomes, or plasma membranes.Table IPurification of MVsMarkerSpecific activity or relative concentrationPost-nuclear supernatantUpper fractionMVsSynaptophysin1.06.318.3Neurophysin1.00.02<0.01Vasopressin5.9NDaND, not detectable.NDV-ATPase1.08.212.1F0F1-ATPase1.00.13NDAdenosine monophosphatase1912<0.1N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase1.10.460.13a ND, not detectable.

Consistent with the presence of V-ATPase, about half of the ATPase activity in the purified MV fraction was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (70 nM), a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase (19Bowman E-J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, MVs). Furthermore, about 60% of the ATPase activity in the purified MV fraction was inhibited by vanadate (0.1 min), an inhibitor for P-ATPase (20O'Neal S.G. Rhoads D.B. Racker E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the ATPase activity was inhibited almost completely by bafilomycin A1 plus vanadate. These results suggested that two kinds of ATPase (V-ATPase and vanadate-sensitive ATPase) are present in the vesicles. Both ATPases were also detectable in MVs precipitated with anti-synaptophysin antibody (Table II).Table IIATPase activity in the immunoprecipitatet MVs fractionAdditionATPase activitymilliunits/assayNone1.19Bafilomycin A1 (75 nm)0.65Vanadate (0.5 mm)0.72Bafilomycin + vanadate0.23 Open table in a new tab After solubilization of MV membrane proteins with C12E9, the V-ATPase and vanadate-sensitive ATPase could be separated by ammonium sulfate fractionation; V-ATPase was mainly recovered at 20% ammonium sulfate saturation, and vanadate-sensitive ATPase was mainly recovered at 40–50% saturation (Fig. 3A). The vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity was co-purified with a 115-kDa polypeptide that was recognized by antibody against P-ATPase from chromaffin granules (Fig. 3B). The purified vanadate-sensitive ATPase (40–50% ammonium sulfate fraction) was inhibited 81, 63, and 95% by N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm), calcium chloride (0.5 mm), and sodium fluoride 150 µm), respectively. Furthermore, phosphatidylserine (10 µg/ml) stimulated the ATPase activity 2-fold. However, bafilomycin A, (10 µm), ouabain (0.2 mm), or SCH28080 (0.1 mm) had no effect. These properties of the ATPase from MVs were different from those of known ion-translocating P-ATPases but were similar to those of chromaffin granule P-ATPase (14Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Moriyama Y. Nelson N. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase in MVs was purified further by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The final preparation exhibited a specific activity of 0.58 unit/mg of protein, which was about 4.5-fold higher than that of the membrane vesicles. The purified V-ATPase had essentially the same properties as V-ATPases from various mammalian sources (data not shown). A minor but interesting difference was that the apparent molecular size of the accessory subunit I of MVs (110 kDa) was slightly lower than that of a counterpart of chromaffin granules (115 kDa) (13Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9175-9180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to the different degree of glycosylation of the subunit, since the subunit I polypeptide is a glycoprotein (22Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 553-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 69: 765-796Crossref Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that it is an isoform similar to the yeast subunit (24Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of V-ATPase is to establish an electrochemical gradient of protons across membranes for various organellar functions such as active transport of transmitters and protein degradation (22Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 553-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 69: 765-796Crossref Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 25Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). As in other organelles, the V-ATPase in MVs could form both a pH gradient (acidic inside) and a membrane potential (positive inside) upon addition of ATP (Fig 4, A and B, respectively); ATP-dependent fluorescence quenchings of acridine orange and oxonol-V were completely inhibited by the addition of bafilomycin A1, N-ethylmaleimide, or proton conductors such as 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene malononitrile (1 µm) but insensitive to vanadate (0.5 mm), oligomycin (5 µg), azide (0.5 mm), and ouabain (0.5 mm). These results also confirmed that the electrochemical gradient was established by V-ATPase, but not by other ATPases such as vanadate-sensitive ATPase described above. We then investigated whether various transmitters are taken up by MVs coupled with V-ATPase. The MVs accumulated [3H]NE dependent on ATP, and this uptake was inhibited by bafilomycin A1, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene malononitrile, and reserpine (Fig. 5A), indicating that [3H]NE was taken up by the vesicular monoamine transporter, which was driven by an electrochemical gradient of protons established by V-ATPase. Other monoamines such as dopamine and serotonin were also taken up by MVs in a similar manner (not shown). The properties and the kinetics of the transport were comparable with those of monoamine transport in synaptic vesicles and chromaffin granules (25Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Unlike synaptic vesicles prepared from brain, however, no detectable uptake of l-glutamate, GABA, glycine, or acetylcholine by MVs was observed (Fig. 5, B-F), suggesting the absence of transporters for these transmitters. Brain vesicles are from various neurons and, therefore, showed mixed transport activities of various neurotransmitters (25Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Synaptophysin-containing microvesicles in various neuroendocrine cells such as adrenal chromaffin and pancreatic β cells have been identified histochemically (11Navone F. Di Gioia G. Jahn R. Browning M. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Annaert W.G. Llona I. Backer A.C. Jacob W.A. De Potter W.P. J.

The detailed physiological function(s) of these vesicles has not been studied mainly because the vesicles could not be isolated; preparation of pure vesicles is essential to characterize their membrane proteins and transport and storage activities. In this study, we established for the first time a procedure for preparation of such vesicles (MVs) from posterior pituitary. Our simple method results in reasonably good recovery of MVs and can be applied to the purifications of similar microvesicles from other endocrine cells. The purified MVs were slightly larger than synaptic vesicles. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that the purified MV fraction contained synapsin I, synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin, marker proteins for synaptic vesicles (28Sudhof T. Jahn R. Neuron. 1991; 6: 665-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and also N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (29Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results confirmed previous histochemical studies (11Navone F. Di Gioia G. Jahn R. Browning M. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and supported the idea that MVs possess proteins for vesicular transport. The presence of V-ATPase and vesicular monoamine transporter clearly indicated that MVs possess a system for storage of monoamines. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that MVs are responsible for secretion of monoamines from nerve endings in the posterior pituitary. MV-mediated secretion is a novel system of neurosecretion. Further studies on the mechanism of fusion of MVs with plasma membrane and exocytosis of monoamines will be important for understanding the physiological function of the posterior pituitary. Comparative studies on neurosecretory granules and MVs will also be fruitful because these are distinct organelles as discussed previously (9Nordmann J.J. Morris J.F.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1746-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These vesicles may accumulate transmitters by a mechanism similar to that shown here (active transport coupled with V-ATPase (27Annaert W.G. Llona I. Backer A.C. Jacob W.A. De Potter W.P. J.

https://openalex.org/W2026345280,"Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to the culture medium of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells blocks transport of newly synthesized gp80 (clusterin, apolipoprotein J), a soluble marker protein for apical exocytosis in this epithelial cell line. In cells treated with DTT during pulse labeling, gp80 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. After removal of the reducing agent, gp80 is posttranslationally oxidized and secreted at the apical surface of MDCK cell monolayers. This demonstrates that when folded and oxidized posttranslationally, gp80 can acquire a conformation that exhibits sorting signals for vectorial targeting. In the continuous presence of DTT, the transepithelial electrical resistance of filter-grown monolayers is maintained for several hours, indicating the presence of functionally intact tight junctions. Under the same conditions, transport competent forms of gp80 mature within the Golgi complex and are secreted predominantly at the apical surface of MDCK monolayers. Furthermore, another secretory protein, the osteopontin-derived 20-kDa polypeptide, is targeted to the apical plasma membrane domain in the continuous presence of DTT. These results suggest that the apical sorting machinery in MDCK cells functions independent of the redox state of the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2081153112,"The modular ligand-binding domains of steroid receptors have been widely used to generate protein chimeras that are ligand dependent for activity. In a similar manner, we generated a series of conditionally active JunD and c-Fos proteins by fusing their carboxyl (COOH)-terminal ends with a COOH-terminal fragment of the human estrogen receptor (ER) that contains the ligand-binding domain. JunD-ER (DER) and Fos-ER (FER) chimeras with an intact leucine zipper and basic region exhibit hormone-dependent activation of activator protein-1-directed transcription in transient expression assays. One of these fusions, DER, has been examined in detail to determine its mechanism of action. Results from immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from DER and Fos transfected cells demonstrate that Fos and DER readily form heterodimer complexes. Surprisingly, the formation of Fos:DER heterodimers, and possibly DER homodimers, is estrogen-independent. However, gel shift assays clearly demonstrate that DNA binding to AP1 sites by Fos:DER heterodimers or DER homodimers is estrogen-dependent. Moreover, in the absence of estrogen, the DER protein is an effective inhibitor of Fos-mediated transactivation, and this effect is reversed by the presence of estrogen. Our results indicate that the DER protein is a direct, hormone-reversible inhibitor of Fos and that estrogen controls the conditional positive or dominant negative activities of DER at the level of DNA binding to AP1 sites. Accordingly, clonally derived fibroblast cell lines that stably express the DER protein exhibit reduced entry into the S phase of the cell cycle when quiescent cells are serum stimulated in the absence of estrogen. This is in contrast to the estrogen-treated controls. These results support the hypothesis that AP1 is important for cell cycle progression and provide a unique approach for examining the role of AP1 in this process. The modular ligand-binding domains of steroid receptors have been widely used to generate protein chimeras that are ligand dependent for activity. In a similar manner, we generated a series of conditionally active JunD and c-Fos proteins by fusing their carboxyl (COOH)-terminal ends with a COOH-terminal fragment of the human estrogen receptor (ER) that contains the ligand-binding domain. JunD-ER (DER) and Fos-ER (FER) chimeras with an intact leucine zipper and basic region exhibit hormone-dependent activation of activator protein-1-directed transcription in transient expression assays. One of these fusions, DER, has been examined in detail to determine its mechanism of action. Results from immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from DER and Fos transfected cells demonstrate that Fos and DER readily form heterodimer complexes. Surprisingly, the formation of Fos:DER heterodimers, and possibly DER homodimers, is estrogen-independent. However, gel shift assays clearly demonstrate that DNA binding to AP1 sites by Fos:DER heterodimers or DER homodimers is estrogen-dependent. Moreover, in the absence of estrogen, the DER protein is an effective inhibitor of Fos-mediated transactivation, and this effect is reversed by the presence of estrogen. Our results indicate that the DER protein is a direct, hormone-reversible inhibitor of Fos and that estrogen controls the conditional positive or dominant negative activities of DER at the level of DNA binding to AP1 sites. Accordingly, clonally derived fibroblast cell lines that stably express the DER protein exhibit reduced entry into the S phase of the cell cycle when quiescent cells are serum stimulated in the absence of estrogen. This is in contrast to the estrogen-treated controls. These results support the hypothesis that AP1 is important for cell cycle progression and provide a unique approach for examining the role of AP1 in this process. Members of the Jun and Fos families of oncoproteins are the essential components of the dimeric transcription factor activator protein-1 (API). 1The abbreviations used are: AP1, activator protein-1; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; WT, wild type; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor. The three members of the jun gene family, c-jun, junB, and junD, all undergo similar, but not identical, regulation and encode proteins that share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (1Vogt P.K. Bos T.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 55: 2-36Google Scholar). They are also similar in their interaction with c-Fos and Fos-related proteins (2Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Jun:Jun or Jun:Fos dimer complexes bind to DNA at AP1 sites and regulate the expression of target genes. Since jun and fos family members are rapidly induced in response to extracellular growth signals, they are classified as immediate early response genes. Expression of these two gene families is an integral part of a well-orchestrated cascade of events leading to cellular proliferation (1 and 3, and references therein). Since Jun proteins are important participants in the cellular growth response, further studies analyzing the direct effects of these proteins on gene expression and cell growth would be greatly facilitated by a well characterized inducible expression system. One approach for creating an inducible system focuses on placing the activity of a protein under the control of the ligand-binding domain of a steroid hormone receptor such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or the estrogen receptor (ER). Steroid receptor fusion proteins have been created with proteins such as E1A (4Picard D. Salser S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), c-Myc (5Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (6Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), MyoD (7Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), p53 (8Roemer K. Friedman T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and c-Fos (9Superti-Furga G. Bergers G. Picard D. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Schuermann M. Hennig G. Muller R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2781-2790PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these cases, the fusion protein appeared to be devoid of biological activity when expressed in cells in the absence of hormone, whereas its appropriate wild type (WT) function was restored in the presence of hormone. We explored the possibility that the activities of WT and mutated Jun proteins could be regulated post-translationally by fusion with the ER. A JunD chimeric molecule was created by appending a truncated human ER sequence to its 3′ end resulting in the JunD-ER (DER) fusion. Analysis of the DER fusion protein shows that it is estrogen dependent for the activation of transcription from AP1 reporter constructs. In addition, a detailed analysis of the mechanism by which estrogen regulates the DER protein was performed. The chimera forms heterodimers with WT Fos proteins but does not readily form heterodimers with WT Jun proteins. However, neither the weak interactions between DER and WT Jun nor the strong interactions between DER and Fos are regulated by estrogen. In contrast, DNA binding by DER homodimers or DER:Fos heterodimers is completely estrogen-dependent. Because of this novel mechanism of action, the DER fusion protein is an effective dominant negative protein that complexes with Fos and reversibly inhibits its DNA binding activity. In addition, cell clones that stably express the DER protein exhibit a reduced capacity to enter S phase from a growth arrested state in the absence of estrogen, a result that is consistent with the hypothesis that AP1 is important for normal cell cycle progression. While a number of recombinant chimeras between steroid receptors and various proteins have been described previously, the mechanisms by which hormone controls the activities of these chimeric proteins have been largely unexplored. This is the first report to examine in detail the mechanism of hormone-dependent regulation of an ER fusion protein. Our results, which show that these ER chimeras are not necessarily physiologically inert in the unliganded state, have important implications for other studies that have similarly employed the estrogen receptor. Indeed, we suggest that this approach may be generally useful for developing hormone-regulated dominant negative proteins, particularly in cases where the WT polypeptides normally form heterotypic complexes with other proteins. The Bluescript plasmid (pBS(KS), Stratagene) containing the 475/ junD hybrid cDNA (pBS.junD), as constructed by Nakabeppu et al. (2Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), was used to generate the deletion and fusion gene constructions. The basic region deletion mutant deleted the coding sequence for a stretch of 26 amino acids immediately preceding the leucine zipper (amino acids 258 through 281). The sequences 5′ and 3′ to this region were joined by an artificially created AflIII site as the result of two separate PCR (polymerase chain reaction) products. The introduced AflIII site did not insert or change any amino acids across this junction. The transactivation domain deletion mutant deleted the coding sequence for amino acids 2 through 158. This clone was generated in a two-step process. The first step deleted the coding sequence for amino acids 93 through 158. To accomplish this a 340-base pair HindIII-BstYI fragment (with the BstYI 5′ overhang rendered blunt with Klenow) was excised from pBS.junD. This fragment was ligated to a 3.4-kilobase fragment of pBS.junD cut with HindIII and SfiI, in which the SfiI end was rendered blunt using T4 DNA polymerase. The blunt-end ligation between SfiI and BstYI created a BamHI site at the deletion junction. This clone was then used in the second step to delete an NcoI/BamHI fragment to remove amino acids 2 through 93. In this process two additional amino acids were inserted between amino acids 1 and 158 which are an asparagine and proline. To create the junD-estrogen receptor fusion gene, pBS.junD was used as the template to create a PCR product which replaced the terminal TGA with a BglII site. This clone, pBS.junD3′Bgl, was then used to excise a 1-kilobase XhoI and BglII fragment with the BglII 5′ overhang filled in with Klenow. The ER portion of the fusion was prepared by excising a 1-kilobaseb fragment from pBS.HE14 (11Kumar V. Green S. Staub A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) digested with SacI and partially with NcoI. The NcoI 5′ overhang was rendered blunt with Klenow. The junD and ER fragments were then ligated into Bluescript digested with XhoI and SacI. A block of nine amino acids was inserted fortuitously during the cloning process that linked the coding sequences of these two polypeptides: RSIPPWIDP. From each deletion mutant, DAB2 and DΔTA, an XhoI-HincII fragment was excised and used to replace the corresponding junD sequences in the DER clone. All of the above constructs were initially cloned into the Bluescript vector and checked via sequencing to ensure the fidelity of the PCR products and deletion junctions. All sequencing reactions were performed using a modification of the dideoxy chain termination reaction of Sanger et al. (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) according to the specifications of the manufacturer of the Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). For DNA transfections, a reporter plasmid containing a single AP1 site linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter (AP1/tkCAT) was used. The above deletion mutants and ER fusions were cloned into the pMT2 (13Bontron D.R. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Orr E.C. Mitsock L.M. Ewenstein B. Loscalzo J. Ginsburg B. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 324: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and LNCX (14Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) eukaryotic expression vectors to examine the effects of the various constructs following transient introduction into cells. Either the plasmid pCH110 or RSV-βGAL, which encode the β-galactosidase gene, was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The F9 embryonal carcinoma cell line was routinely maintained by culturing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) which was supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were plated to be 50–60% confluent at the time of transfection. Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes via the standard calcium phosphate technique or in 6-well plates using the lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The latter was used as per the manufacturer's instructions after determining that 5 µl of the lipofectamine reagent/one well of a 6-well plate was optimal for these cells under our culture conditions. F9 cells grown on 60-mm dishes were transfected with the AP1/tkCAT reporter plasmid (2 µg), the β-galactosidase plasmid pCH110 (1.5 µg), and 4.5 µg of the pMT2 expression plasmid by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Lipofectamine transfections into cells grown in 6-well plates used the following DNA concentrations: 0.4 µg of AP1/tkCAT reporter plasmid, 0.4 µg of RSV-β-GAL plasmid, and 1.5 µg of pMT2 or LNCX expression plasmid. In those experiments where estrogen effects were examined, the transfection media was DMEM (without phenol red; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated calf serum (15Stanley E.R. Palmer R.E. Sohn U. Cell. 1977; 10: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This media was used after the requisite incubation of the DNA-lipofectamine mix with the cells. More recent experiments have shown that 10% FBS can also be used with no effect on the estrogen inducibility of specific constructs. To test the hormonal regulation of the various constructs, β-estradiol (Sigma) was added to the transfection media at 10–6 m final concentration from a stock solution of 10–2 or 10–3 m prepared in ethanol. Estrogen minus wells or plates received the comparable amount of ethanol alone. Cells were harvested 24 h (lipofectamine mediated) or 48 h (calcium phosphate mediated) after the transfection. Extracts were then prepared via a standard freeze-thaw method and analyzed for β-galactosidase and CAT activities where appropriate. The COS cell line was routinely maintained by culturing in the same conditions as the F9 cells. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes to be approximately 70% confluent at the time of transfection. Transfections using the pMT2 expression plasmids were performed via the standard calcium phosphate technique or the DEAE-dextran procedure as follows. After washing the cells twice in DMEM without serum, 6 ml of DMEM (no serum) containing 400 µg of DEAE-dextran/ml and 200 ng each test DNA/ml was added to each dish and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After one wash with DMEM, 6 ml of DMEM containing 2.5% FBS and 100 µm chloroquin was added for an additional incubation of 3 h at 37 °C. After this second incubation, the cells were washed in DMEM and replated in DMEM (no phenol red) containing 10% FBS and where appropriate 10–6 m β-estradiol. Cells were harvested 48–72 h later. Whole cell extracts of transfected COS cells for gel shift analyses were prepared by a freeze-thaw method after the cells were resuspended in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.4 m potassium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To the cleared supernatant (10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge), glycerol was added to a 20% final concentration, and the extracts were stored at –70 °C. Extracts were checked by Western analysis for appropriate protein expression from the transgene. The Rat1A fibroblast cell line was routinely maintained by culturing in the same conditions as F9 cells. Rat1A transformants expressing the DER fusion protein from the LNCX expression vector were selected in DMEM (phenol red-free) containing 10% FBS, 10–6 m estrogen, and 400 µg of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) per ml. To establish cell lines, G418-resistant colonies were pooled, clones were selected by limiting dilution, and screened by immunofluorescence using the ER-LH1 antibody (Novacastra Laboratories Ltd.) to select clones that expressed various levels of the DER protein. The DER positive clones are routinely maintained in DMEM (phenol red-free) containing FBS and G418, as above, and estrogen at 5 × 10–7 m. Approximately 48 h after the transfection, cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine (ICN, Trans-label) at a concentration of 100 µCi/ml in DMEM (minus methionine and cysteine) containing 5% dialyzed FBS. The labeled cells were collected and stored as a pellet at –20 °C until extracts were prepared. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described by Harlow and Lane (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) by resuspending the cells in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 TIU (trypsin inhibitor unit) aprotinin/ml, 10 µg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 mm Na2MoO4. The supernatant fraction was saved. Counts precipitable by trichloroacetic acid were determined, and the volume of extract to be precipitated was calculated based on transfection efficiency determined by a β-galactosidase assay. Immunoprecipitations of labeled cell extracts or in vitro products were done as described (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) after preclearing with preimmune sera and formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (immunoprecipitin; Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was used to collect the immune complex. Precipitated antigen was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and radioactivity was measured by a Fujix Bio-Imaging analyzer (BAS1000 Mac). The β-galactosidase assay was performed by adding half of the extract to a buffer containing 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.01 m KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.045 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 4 mg 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyrano-side/ml. This was a timed reaction and stopped with 1 m Na2CO3 when a yellow color was observed. The absorbance at 420 nm was determined for each sample and was used to calculate β-galactosidase units per hour (A420 × 1000/time (h)). CAT activity in the extracts was determined in a continuous assay which measured the accumulation over time of radioactive chloramphenicol partitioning into a water-immiscible fluor, as detected in a scintillation counter (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Counting was started after overlaying the reaction mix with scintillation fluid. Several cycles were counted at 20–30-min intervals to obtain quantitative kinetic data. The reaction rates were determined by linear regression and data are stored and analyzed with the Cricket Graph software (Cricket Software, Inc.) Corrected CAT activities were obtained by adjusting the observed activities according to the level of β-galactosidase. The CAT activities for the WT junD and test constructs are divided by the CAT activity value obtained with the pMT2 or LNCX expression construct alone. This value is the induction ratio. Recombinant plasmids, in pBS(KS), containing the complete coding sequence were used to prepare in vitro transcribed RNAs as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The concentration of the RNA was determined by absorbance, and routinely 2 µg of RNA were used to prepare the in vitro translated product as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). [35S]Methionine (ICN, Trans-label) was used to label the in vitro products. A small portion of each reaction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to check for protein integrity and approximate concentration. For association studies, volumes of reticulocyte lysates (1–4 µl) representing equal amounts of protein were mixed, incubated for 0.5 h at 37 °C, and then immediately diluted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (18Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation using the appropriate antibody. Rabbit antisera specific for the COOH terminus of JunD (653), the NH2 terminus of JunD (183), and Fos (64) were previously prepared 2K. Ryder, unpublished data. and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the estrogen receptor (Novocastra Laboratories, Ltd., clone NCL-ER-LH1) were used for immunoprecipitations and supershift experiments. A mouse monoclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Promega) was also used in the supershift experiments. Jun:Fos heterodimers of in vitro translated products (1–5 µl) were allowed to form at 37 °C for 15 min in 20 µl of the DNA binding buffer of Brown et al. (19Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to adding the probe, the samples were incubated with 300 ng of salmon sperm DNA. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min with a 1-µl aliquot (0.093 pmol) of a 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single AP1 consensus sequence: 5′-CGGTATCGATAAGCTATGACT-CATCCGGGG-3′. This oligonucleotide was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a kinase reaction using [γ-32P]ATP (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After heat inactivating the kinase, a 3-fold molar excess of the complementary strand was added, heated to 85 °C for 10 min, and annealed by slow cooling to room temperature. The unincorporated radioactivity was removed as per the manufacturer's directions after loading the sample to a Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad). Gel shift analyses of COS cell transfectants were performed similarly. A 4-µl volume of each whole cell extract was added to 20 µl of the above binding buffer without sodium chloride. Salmon sperm DNA was added to the reaction mix at a final concentration of 0.5–1.0 µg/reaction and incubated 15–20 min at room temperature. A 1-µ1 aliquot (0.093 pmol) of the same 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixes of both types of samples were then loaded and run on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (29.5 parts acrylamide/1 part Bis-acrylamide) in 0.25 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE is 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. If antibodies were used, whole cell extracts and antibodies were preincubated for 1 h in binding buffer on ice (20Bossy-Wetzel E. Bravo R. Hanahan D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2340-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) prior to adding the labeled oligonucleotide probe. Radioactivity in the shifted bands was measured by a Fujix Bio-Imaging analyzer (BAS1000 Mac). Cells were collected at indicated times after growth arrest or serum stimulation and resuspended at approximately 107 cells/ml in a sodium citrate buffer containing dimethyl sulfoxide (21Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely stored at –20 °C at this point until stained. A detergent-trypsin method was used to prepare nuclei from 1–2 × 106 cells and stain DNA with propidium iodide for flow cytometric analysis as described by Vindelov et al. (21Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity in the cell nucleus was measured with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). For each sample, 10,000 cells were acquired using the CELLQuest software program (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with the MacCycle curve-fitting program for DNA content and cell cycle analysis (Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc.). A conditionally active JunD protein (DER) was created by joining in frame a truncated human ER sequence (11, HE14) that encodes the ligand-binding and hormone-inducible transactivation domains with the 3′ end of junD. In addition, two junD genes coding for mutant proteins containing deletions of the DNA binding basic region (DAB2) or the transactivation domain (DATA) were constructed. These mutants are comparable to those previously described with c-Jun and shown to be dominant negative molecules (19Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ransone L.J. Vivader J. Wamsley P. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3806-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fusions analogous to DER were generated with these deletion mutants resulting in DΔB2.ER and DΔTA.ER. A schematic representation of the WT, deletion mutants, and fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned into both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors for in vitro and in vivo analyses, respectively. Prior to the introduction of these constructs into tissue culture cells, the deletion mutants and fusion proteins were assessed for their interaction with Fos and subsequent DNA binding activity as compared to WT JunD. JunD and c-Fos polypeptides, as well as the mutant and fusion proteins, were expressed separately via an in vitro transcription-translation system, allowed to interact under conditions appropriate to form Jun:Fos dimers (18Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and then immunoprecipitated with a Fos-specific antibody (Fig. 2A). While the Fos antibody was unable to precipitate any of the Jun proteins alone (data not shown), the results in Fig. 2A show that in the presence of Fos, JunD and the deletion mutants coprecipitated with the 58-kDa Fos polypeptide (lanes 1–3). Since the in vitro translation reactions of the ER polypeptides did not yield as much protein as with JunD and the deletion mutants, 3-fold less in vitro translated Fos was used in the immunoprecipitation reactions (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–7). Analyses of the fusion proteins show that they also coprecipitated with the Fos polypeptide (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). In each of these cases, approximately 50% of the JunD deletion mutants or chimeras formed dimers with Fos, which is comparable to the percent of WT JunD that complexed with Fos. In contrast, the 35-kDa truncated ER polypeptide did not coprecipitate with Fos (HE-14; Fig. 2A, lane 7). After immunoprecipitation with the Fos-specific antibody, the truncated ER protein was, however, detected in the supernatant with an ER-specific antibody (data not shown). To examine the DNA binding activity of the JunD deletion and fusion proteins in the presence of Fos, aliquots of the various Jun:Fos dimers shown in Fig. 2A were allowed to interact with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide (30-mer) containing the consensus sequence of the API-binding site. Fig. 2B shows gel mobility shift results for the analyzed proteins. In vitro translated WT c-Jun (lane 2) and JunD (lane 3), the DER fusion (lane 6), and the TA deletion proteins (lanes 5 and 8) all bind and retard the labeled oligonucleotide, presumably through the formation of heterodimers with c-Fos. DNA binding by these complexes does not require added estrogen in vitro. It is important to note that this result is consistent with previous data which show that in vitro expressed steroid receptors bind DNA in a ligand-independent fashion, even though they are ligand dependent for DNA binding in vivo. In general, the various proteins show similar binding, with the possible exception of the DΔTA.ER fusion which seems to exhibit less binding. The reason for this observation is not obvious and has not been explored. In contrast, those proteins containing a deletion of the basic region (DΔB2 and DΔB2.ER), although capable of interacting with Fos, are devoid of DNA binding activity (lanes 4 and 7, Fig. 2B). Neither Fos alone nor the truncated ER in combination with Fos shows DNA binding (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 9 and 10 with lane 1). The data shown in Fig. 2, which examined the mutant and fusion proteins in vitro, predict that within a cell all of these proteins should interact with Fos nearly as well as WT JunD, bind to an AP1 site to some extent (except for those containing a basic region deletion), and possibly transactivate a gene containing an API-binding site. To examine API-directed transactivation, the altered JunD molecules and WT JunD were transiently expressed in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. These cells are typically chosen for their low, but not undetectable, level of endogenous AP1 activity (9Superti-Furga G. Bergers G. Picard D. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5114-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 3M. K. Francis, unpublished observations. Transactivation by the ER chimeras and their WT or deletion mutant counterparts wa"
https://openalex.org/W1975842892,"The identification of membrane-inserted segments of pore-forming soluble proteins is crucial to understanding the action of these proteins at the molecular level. A distinct member of this class of proteins is α-toxin, a 293-amino acid-long 33-kDa hemolytic toxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus that can form pores in both artificial and natural membranes. We have studied the interaction of α-toxin with single bilayer vesicles prepared from asolectin using a hydrophobic photoactivable reagent, 2-[3H]diazofluorene ([3H]DAF) (Pradhan, D., and Lala, A. K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8242–8251). This reagent readily partitions into the membrane hydrophobic core and on photolysis labels the lipid and protein segments that penetrate the membrane. Current models on the mode of action of α-toxin indicate that, on interaction with membranes, α-toxin forms an oligomer, which represents the active pore. In keeping with these models, we observe that [3H]DAF photolabels the membrane-bound α-toxin oligomer. Cyanogen bromide fragmentation of [3H]DAF-labeled α-toxin gave several fragments, which were subjected to Edman degradation. We could thus sequence residues 1–19, 35–60, 114–139, 198–231, and 235–258. Radioactive analysis and phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis during sequencing permitted analysis of DAF insertion sites. The results obtained indicated that the N and C termini (residues 235–258) have been extensively labeled. The putative pore-forming glycine-rich central hinge region was poorly labeled, indicating that the apposing side of the lumen of the pore does not form the lipid-protein interface. The DAF labeling pattern indicated that the major structural motif in membrane-bound α-toxin was largely β-sheet. The identification of membrane-inserted segments of pore-forming soluble proteins is crucial to understanding the action of these proteins at the molecular level. A distinct member of this class of proteins is α-toxin, a 293-amino acid-long 33-kDa hemolytic toxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus that can form pores in both artificial and natural membranes.

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8242–8251). This reagent readily partitions into the membrane hydrophobic core and on photolysis labels the lipid and protein segments that penetrate the membrane. Current models on the mode of action of α-toxin indicate that, on interaction with membranes, α-toxin forms an oligomer, which represents the active pore. In keeping with these models, we observe that [3H]DAF photolabels the membrane-bound α-toxin oligomer. Cyanogen bromide fragmentation of [3H]DAF-labeled α-toxin gave several fragments, which were subjected to Edman degradation. We could thus sequence residues 1–19, 35–60, 114–139, 198–231, and 235–258. Radioactive analysis and phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis during sequencing permitted analysis of DAF insertion sites. The results obtained indicated that the N and C termini (residues 235–258) have been extensively labeled. The putative pore-forming glycine-rich central hinge region was poorly labeled, indicating that the apposing side of the lumen of the pore does not form the lipid-protein interface. The DAF labeling pattern indicated that the major structural motif in membrane-bound α-toxin was largely β-sheet. α-Toxin is a soluble hemolytic protein toxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus as a soluble 33-kDa monomer and a major factor contributing to the pathogenicity of S. aureus. The α-toxin gene has been cloned and sequenced (1Kehoe M. Duncan I. Foster T. Fairweather N. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 1111-1115Crossref Google Scholar, 2Gray G.S. Kehoe M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the deduced amino acid sequence contains 293 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 33,400, which is in fair agreement with the SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; [3H]DAF, 2-[3H]diazofluorene; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin.1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; [3H]DAF, 2-[3H]diazofluorene; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin.-based determinations. More recently, the α-toxin gene has also been cloned and expressed in high yielding vectors (3Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11959-11962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Toxin has also been purified to homogeneity (5Lind I. Anhert-Hilger G. Fuchs G. Gratzl M. Anal.

Korom S. Hugo F. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3512-3519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to cellular membranes, membrane penetration and pore formation by α-toxin have also been demonstrated in protein-free liposome bilayers (8Fussle R. Bhakdi S. Sziegoleit A.

Biol. 1986; 90: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and monolayers (13Buckelew A.R. Colacicco G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). α-Toxin forms cylindrical oligomers in target membranes, and it has been suggested that these aggregates are amphiphilic ring-shaped hexamers that are responsible for lytic activity (8Fussle R. Bhakdi S. Sziegoleit A. Tranum-Jensen J. Kranz T. Wellensiek H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Bhakdi S. Fussle R. Tranum-Jensen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5475-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These pores are large in size, and diameters of 1–2 nm have been reported (8Fussle R. Bhakdi S. Sziegoleit A. Tranum-Jensen J. Kranz T. Wellensiek H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The current models suggest that, in any membrane type, α-toxin binds to the membrane as a monomer, which on lateral diffusion oligomerizes to a 200-kDa hexamer, which represents the active pore (8Fussle R. Bhakdi S. Sziegoleit A. Tranum-Jensen J. Kranz T. Wellensiek H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Bhakdi S. Fussle R. Tranum-Jensen J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, recent reports indicate that the oligomer formed is a heptamer (16Gouaux J.E. Braha O. Hobaugh M.R. Song L. Cheley S. Shustak C. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12828-12831Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Based on mutation and other studies involving proteolysis, it has been proposed that the assembly of the α-toxin pore involves separation of two rigid domains that are separated by a glycine-rich loop region located around the middle of the molecule (17Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On binding to membranes, α-toxin undergoes a conformational change resulting in the formation of amphiphilic rods, which then aggregate to form the active pore. More recent mutation studies suggest the involvement of the glycine-rich loop region in lining the membrane pore (19Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5285-5292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Walker B. Kasianowicz J. Krishnasastry M. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). While these studies have certainly helped in understanding the mode of action of α-toxin, we are still far from understanding it at the molecular level. Direct structural approaches have also met with limited success. Thus, despite the availability of reasonable quantities of the purified toxin, it has not been possible to obtain the three-dimensional structure of α-toxin. In the absence of the solution structure, it has been a formidable challenge to determine the structure of the membrane-bound pore. Electron microscopy was used in the past to obtain structural information on membrane-bound α-toxin, and these early studies indicated an annular structure with a stain-filled center (14Bhakdi S. Fussle R. Tranum-Jensen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5475-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Freer J.H. Arbuthnott J.P. Bernheimer A.W. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 1153-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even current studies involving image analysis of the electron micrograph have yielded structural information at very low resolutions and at best provide information on the oligomeric state of membrane-bound α-toxin (22Olofsson A. Kavéus U. Hacksell I. Thelestam M. Hebert H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Olofsson A. Kavéus U. Thelestam M. Hebert H. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1988; 100: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The identification of peptide segments of α-toxin that interact with the membrane, amino acid residues involved in subunit-subunit contact, and residues that line the pore is of considerable importance to understanding the mode of action of α-toxin at the molecular level. Hydrophobic photolabeling using apolar reagents can be used to establish the insertion of protein toxins in membranes and to identify protein segments that interact with the membrane hydrophobic core (24Montecucco C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This approach involves the use of hydrophobic or ampiphilic photoactivable reagents that can easily partition into the membrane. On photolysis, they generate highly reactive intermediates like a carbene or a nitrene, which readily insert into any bond, including a C-H bond, in neighboring molecules. Thus, a membrane hydrophobic core reagent can photolabel the lipid and protein components embedded in the hydrophobic core (25Brunner J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 628-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, the approach provides a direct method for establishing the peptide segments of a membrane-bound protein (24Montecucco C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Brunner J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 628-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We have used a carbene-based photoactivable reagent, [3H]DAF, to study the interaction of α-toxin with single bilayer vesicles. [3H]DAF is an apolar photoactivable reagent that readily partitions into the membrane hydrophobic core and labels the lipid and protein segments that span the membrane. [3H]DAF has been used to photolabel the erythrocyte glucose transporter (27Lala A.K. Batliwala H.F. Bhat S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1990; 62: 1453-1456Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 28Lala A.K. Bhat S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 586-594PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently to evaluate hydrophobic exposure, in the molten globule state of soluble proteins like α-lactalbumin (29Lala A.K. Kaul P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19914-19918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here a characterization of the photoincorporation of [3H]DAF in membrane-bound α-toxin and show that it labels α-toxin in the pore-forming oligomeric state. Analysis of DAF insertion sites in α-toxin by proteolysis and peptide sequencing shows that parts of the N- and C-terminal segments are associated with lipids. The photolabeling pattern indicates that a β-sheet structure is the dominant motif in membrane-bound α-toxin. All reagents used were of the highest commercial grade purity available. Spectral grade water was obtained using Milli-Q Plus (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Calcein and asolectin were purchased from Sigma. Asolectin (mixed soybean phospholipids) was further purified by the procedure of Kagawa and Racker (30Kagawa Y.L. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and stored as a chloroform solution at –20 °C. The concentration of the stock solution was determined by phosphate assay (31Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was carried out on a Shimadzu LC-6A system. Tritiated fluorenone was obtained by catalytic tritium exchange of 2-iodofluoren-9-one (Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Bombay, India). The purity of the [3H]fluorenone was checked by reverse-phase HPLC on a Bio-Sil ODS-5S C18 column (4 × 250 mm) using methanol/water (80:20, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Elution was monitored at 260 nm with an absorbance unit at full scale of 0.02. [3H]Fluorenone appeared at 13.78 min. In some of the batches received after tritium exchange, [3H]fluorenone was found to be contaminated with [3H]fluorenol (8.72 min) and [3H]fluorene (28.43 min). In such cases, the crude [3H]fluorenone was purified by HPLC. The purified [3H]fluorenone was reinjected onto the Cl8 column to confirm its homogeneity. The specific activity was estimated from the radioactivity and area associated with the [3H]fluorenone peak. The concentration of [3H]fluorenone was determined from the peak area using a standard curve prepared using unlabeled fluorenone as the external standard. [3H]DAF was prepared from [3H]fluorenone according to the procedure reported earlier (32Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Samples of lyophilized α-toxin were a kind gift from Dr. S. Bhakdi (Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Mainz, Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany). The toxin was found to be a single band as analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE according to the procedure of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Concentrations of α-toxin were estimated either by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1.1 for a 1 mg/ml solution (6Harshman S. Sugg N. Cassidy P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), or on the basis of protein assay (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were done at 23 °C unless specified otherwise. The standard buffer used in all experiments was 10 mm Tris buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, unless specified otherwise. Liposome Preparation—Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from asolectin. Asolectin (5 µmol) was dried onto the walls of a test tube. The thin film was dried under high vacuum for 8 h. To this film was added 1 ml of degassed standard buffer, which was then vortexed. The suspension was sonicated twice for 6 min at 4 °C using a Branson B-30 sonicator fitted with a microtip. The resulting clear solution was spun at 15,000 rpm (15,850 × g) to pellet any titanium particles shed from the microtip during sonication. The vesicles were freshly prepared for all experiments. Calcein Release Assay—1 ml of 100 mm calcein in 50 mm NaCl, adjusted to pH just above 7.0 when the calcein entirely dissolved, was added to the dried asolectin (5 µmol) film and vortexed for 5 min. The resulting preparation was sonicated twice for 6 min at 4 °C. Part (1 µmol of lipid) of the sonicated suspension was loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 40 cm), equilibrated in standard Tris buffer, and eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The calcein-entrapped vesicles eluted in the void volume, which corresponded to a volume of 3 ml. The liposome concentration was estimated by measuring the lipid phosphorus content (31Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final phosphate concentration was 0.33 µmol/ml. The release of calcein on addition of α-toxin was monitored using a Shimadzu Model RF-540 spectrofluorometer. Calcein-loaded vesicles (16.9 nmol) were added to 2 ml of standard Tris buffer in a cuvette of 1-cm path length. The excitation wavelength was set at 494 nm, and the emission wavelength at 520 nm. A 10-nm slit was used for both excitation and emission monochromators. The fluorescence intensity of the vesicle preparation in the buffer was taken as the zero reading. 100% calcein release was obtained by the addition of 20 µl of 5% Triton X-100. α-Toxin was added to the vesicle preparation, and calcein release was monitored as a function of time. The experiment was done for increasing α-toxin concentrations. The percent calcein release was expressed as follows: % calcein release = ((It – I0)/(If – I0)) × 100, where I0 is the fluorescence before the addition of the toxin, It is the fluorescence observed after the addition of the toxin, and If is the total fluorescence of calcein after the addition of Triton X-100. Photolabeling of α-Toxin in Vesicles with [3H]DAF—Photolabeling of α-toxin in asolectin vesicles with [3H]DAF was carried out on an analytical scale as well as on preparative scales. The specific activity of [3H]DAF ranged from 1.035 to 8.25 Ci/mmol, and [3H]DAF was stored as a 0.5–1 mm stock solution in ethanol at –20 °C. In a general procedure for photolabeling experiments, a few microliters of ethanolic solution of [3H]DAF (3–10 µCi) were added to asolectin vesicles (60.6 µm final lipid concentration) prepared in standard Tris buffer and incubated for 10 min in the dark. The total alcohol concentration never exceeded 2% (v/v) of the total buffer volume. The final concentration of [3H]DAF was 12 µm. α-Toxin (200 µg/ml) was then added and incubated for 60 min. At the end of 1 h, the tubes were photolyzed for 3 min using a Rayonet Minireactor (RMR-500) equipped with four 3000-Å lamps. In a control experiment, the sample containing α-toxin incubated with [3H]DAF-bearing vesicles was not photolyzed. Unreacted [3H]DAF, if any, was destroyed by the addition of glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 1 m. The photolabeled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE directly for the experiments carried out on a small scale i.e. sample volumes below 100 µl. SDS-PAGE was carried according to the procedure of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on a slab gel electrophoresis unit. In photolabeling experiments carried out on a larger scale (sample volumes of 4–5 ml, 1–2 mg of α-toxin), the photolabeled toxin was delipidated by chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) extraction twice. The aqueous layer was then dialyzed in water to remove salts and lyophilized. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE as before. The gel was then stained in Coomassie Blue and destained in a destaining solution containing 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol in water. The gel was photographed and sliced into 2-mm pieces. The sliced gel pieces were digested in 100 µl of 30% H2O2 at 60 °C for 8 h. The solubilized gel was counted in a toluene-based scintillation mixture (0.4% diphenyloxazole, 0.025% 1,4-bis[2-(4-methyl-5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene, 7.2% Bio-Solv as an aqueous solubilizer) using a liquid scintillation counter (Model Rackbeta 1217, LKB, Uppsala). To analyze the aggregation state of α-toxin photolabeled in asolectin vesicles with [3H]DAF, the sample, after photolysis, was directly electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel essentially according to the procedure of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), except that we did not boil the sample in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% 2-mercapto-ethanol. After staining with Coomassie Blue and destaining, the gel was scanned using a gel scanner (Model 1312, Isco Inc., Lincoln, NE). The region around the Coomassie Blue-stained bands were sliced into 2-mm pieces, solubilized in H2O2, and subjected to counting. Electroblotting of CNBr Fragments of Photolabeled α-Toxin—Photolabeled peptides from the CNBr digest of α-toxin photolabeled with [3H]DAF in vesicles were separated on a 16.5% Tris/Tricine gel and immediately electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems Inc.) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Novablot, LKB) according to the procedure of Mozdzanowski and Speicher (35Mozdzanowski J. Speicher D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transfer buffer contained 12.5 mm Tris, 96 mm glycine containing 0.1% SDS, and 10% MeOH. After electroblotting, the PVDF membranes were washed thoroughly with water to remove Tris and glycine and then stained for 1 min in 0.5% Coomassie Blue and destained in 50% MeOH/H2O. The radioactive bands were excised for sequencing. N-terminal Sequencing of Photolabeled a-Toxin and Its CNBr Fragments—Automated Edman degradation of radiolabeled peptides was carried out using gas-phase protein sequencers (Shimadzu Model PSQ-1 or Applied Biosystems Model 477A. both equipped with an on-line HPLC). For sequence analysis, the photolabeled toxin and the HPLC fractions were loaded onto a Polybrene-coated glass fiber disc, while the CNBr fragments were loaded as PVDF blots. The photolabeled toxin and its CNBr fragments were subjected to automated Edman degradation in the Shimadzu protein sequencer. For each sequencing cycle, 60% of the fraction collected was analyzed in an on-line PTH analyzer for PTH-derivative release, while the remaining 40% was counted for 3H release, pmol release and the radioactivity data were normalized to 100%. Sequence analysis of the HPLC fraction was done in an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer with an on-line PTH analyzer. 33% of the fraction collected after every sequencing cycle was injected into the PTH analyzer for PTH-derivative release, while the remaining 67% was counted for 3H release. Repetitive yields were calculated by performing nonlinear regression analysis of the data fitted to the equation M = I0·Rn, where M is the observed release at each cycle, I0 is the initial yield, R is the repetitive yield, and n is the cycle number. With the main objective of this work being the identification of membrane-interacting domains of α-toxin, it was important to ensure the functional integrity of the system being used for studying interaction of α-toxin with membranes. We used single bilayer vesicles prepared from negatively charged lipid, asolectin, as a source of membrane preparation. We then studied the release of vesicle-entrapped calcein by α-toxin as an indicator of toxin-induced pore formation. Calcein is a concentration-dependent self-quenching dye (36Allen T.M. Cleland L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) that provides a convenient membrane leakage assay (37Forti S. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The addition of a membrane lytic agent to calcein-loaded vesicles leads to the release of calcein to the outer medium. The resulting dilution of calcein leads to an increase in fluorescence. At toxin concentrations >27 µg/ml, calcein release was seen to be >50%. The calcein release experiments clearly indicated the pore-forming ability of α-toxin in the asolectin vesicle system used here. Photolabeling of Membrane-bound a-Toxin with [3H]DAF—In the hydrophobic photolabeling experiments, [3H]DAF was first partitioned into the hydrophobic core of asolectin vesicles prepared in 10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7. These DAF-bearing vesicles were then incubated with α-toxin in the dark, and the resulting preparation was photolyzed. The lipid and α-toxin concentrations corresponding to preparations that induced maximum calcein leakage in the experiments described above were used in the initial photolabeling experiments. Basically, these experiments were conducted with vesicle/toxin preparations made under conditions identical to those used for carrying out calcein leakage experiments. Briefly, the hydrophobic photoactivable reagent [3H]DAF with a specific activity of 1.035 Ci/mmol was partitioned into asolectin vesicles by adding an alcoholic solution of [3H]DAF to asolectin vesicles so that the final concentration of alcohol was <2% (v/v). This preparation was then incubated for 10 min in the dark. α-Toxin was added to the vesicles so that the final concentration of α-toxin was 1 µm. It was then incubated for 1 h in the dark and photolyzed for 3 min using four UV lamps that cut off light below 300 nm. The crude photolysate was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) to remove lipid and photorearrangement products of DAF and dialyzed. The bulk of the counts (>90%) was found to be associated with the organic layer. This is not surprising as membrane hydrophobic core photolabeling experiments using [3H]DAF and other photoactivable reagents in the past have shown major labeling of lipids relative to proteins (32Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous layer left after delipidation was then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Staining with Coomassie Blue gave a very faint band, indicating that most of the α-toxin had been lost during processing. In another experiment, the chloroform/methanol extraction step was not carried out, and the sample after photolysis was concentrated and directly subjected to SDS-PAGE. In such experiments, the photolabeled lipid and photorearrangement products of DAF run at the dye front on SDS-PAGE (32Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by allowing the tracking dye to run a little beyond the end of the gel, such products can be removed. Similar observations on the movement of photorearrangement products, resulting from use of aryl azide-based photoactivable reagents, to the dye front on SDS-PAGE have been made by others (38Kochi S.K. Martin L. Schiavo G. Mock M. Cabiaux V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2604-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, sliced, solubilized, and counted for radioactivity. In this case, a band corresponding to α-toxin could be seen, but was diffused. The high salt concentration in the buffer used in the calcein leakage and photolabeling experiments became still higher during sample concentration (2 ml) to a reasonable volume to carry out SDS-PAGE. Attempts to remove salt by dialysis before SDS-PAGE were sometimes successful, but often led to loss of α-toxin. Radioactive analysis indicated labeling of α-toxin with [3H]DAF, but the counts were barely above the background level. The photolabeling experiments were then carried out with [3H]DAF of higher specific activity (4.84 Ci/mmol) in low sample volumes. Analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) indicated photolabeling of α-toxin with [3H]DAF as the bulk of the radioactivity was found to be associated with the α-toxin band. As mentioned above, the radioactivity observed at the tracking dye front at the end of the gel corresponds to the photolabeled phospholipid and photorearrangement products of DAF. In a control experiment in which the sample was not subjected to photolysis, SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that no radioactivity was associated with the α-toxin band (Fig. 1). These results indicate that labeling of α-toxin with [3H]DAF is photoinduced. Subsequent experiments indicated that for detection of [3H]DAF-labeled α-toxin by SDS-PAGE, the specific activity of [3H]DAF should be at least 3 Ci/mmol. Further experiments were thus conducted with [3H]DAF with a specific activity of >3 Ci/mmol. After establishing analytical conditions for α-toxin photolabeling, we tried to standardize conditions for preparative photolabeling to isolate [3H]DAF-labeled α-toxin and to subject it to subsequent analysis. In these preparative scale experiments, the α-toxin concentration used was 200 µg/ml (6.06 µm), with the rest of the conditions being similar to those of the analytical experiments. Typically, these experiments used 1–1.5 mg of α-toxin. Unlike in the analytical experiments, in the preparative experiments, we decided to remove the bulk of the counts associated with lipid and photorearrangement products of DAF by delipidation before processing the [3H]DAF-labeled α-toxin.

The intact γ2a membrane-specific 3’-untranslated region, with its potential stem loop forming sequences and poly(A) site, is able to efficiently terminate transcription in the absence of the downstream region in which transcription normally terminates (term). Termination efficiency in the presence of the termination fragment decreases either when sequences specifying a potential stem/loop, upstream of the poly(A) region, are interrupted or when the stronger membrane poly(A) site is substituted with a weaker, secretory-specific poly(A) site. We therefore conclude that the γ2a membrane-specific untranslated region plays a major role in specifying downstream termination. We further conclude that the immunoglobulin γ2a, membrane-specific, 3’-untranslated region can function in the context of the gpt gene, driven by an SV40 promoter, to terminate transcription in a poly(A) site dependent fashion.

Starting about 1000 nt downstream of the M2 coding sequences, and 5’ of the AAUAAA's, there is a region containing (GAA)10, (GA)14, (GGAA)9, (GGA)10, and (GA)17 elements, followed by an unremarkable 90 bp, followed by (CT)23, followed by (GT)15. Then come the two A2UA3 elements (see Fig. 1B). The GA and (CT)23 repeats could intrastrand-base-pair to form a stem and loop structure approximately 95 nt upstream of the first γ2a membrane poly(A) site with a ΔG = −114 kcal/mol.

With Igμ, a correlation between poly(A) site strength and the efficiency of termination was recently shown (26Edwalds-Gilbert G. Prescott J. Falck-Pedersen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3472-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Little more is known about the eucaryotic termination process except that it may occur at regions of repeated sequence in the DNA. Elements upstream of retrovirus poly(A) sites, some involving stem/loop structures to maintain proper spacing, have been implicated in mediating differential poly(A) site use (28Russnak R. Ganem D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 764-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Gilmartin G.M. Fleming E.S. Oetjen J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4419-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We wondered if the potential stem loop structure in the γ2a gene might serve as a terminator in eucaryotes as stem loops do in factor-independent terminators in procaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 27Das A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 893-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DNA constructs consisting of various segments from the γ2a heavy chain gene membrane-specific 3’-UT and 3’-flanking regions, including the region where γ2a transcription normally terminates, were inserted into a γ2b heavy chain gene which had been deleted for the sec poly(A) site. Using nuclei of mouse myeloma cell lines stably transfected with these constructs, we find that the γ2a membrane untranslated region itself is the most important part of the transcription termination signal. When γ2a membrane UT sequences were inserted into a chimeric gpt/SV40 gene of pSV2gpt, transcription termination was further shown to be induced even with a heterologous promoter and gene, indicating that the sequences have a mode of action independent of the Ig gene. The rate of use of the membrane site was influenced not only by the presence of the unusual sequence elements upstream of the poly(A) site, but also by the poly(A) site itself. The murine plasmacytoma J558L has lost endogenous heavy chain expression through a deletion in the heavy chain locus but maintains myeloma regulation of secretory versus membrane-specific mRNA production (30Morrison S.L.

Immunol. 1984; 2: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mycophenolic acid-resistant clones were isolated. Only clones which met the criteria of RNA expression and contiguous integration of a single copy of the DNA (Southern blots, not shown) were used for subsequent analyses. Plasmid pMPC11 Oli Sac-Kpn was derived from the functionally rearranged MPC11 (31Kobrin B.J. Milcarek C. Morrison S.L. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1980; 209: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), see Fig. 1; the vector confers resistance to mycophenolic acid. An oligonucleotide linker containing EcoRI, HindIII, and KpnI restriction sites was inserted at the SacI site located downstream of the splice site at the 3’ end of the Igγ2b CH3 exon. Digestion with KpnI and subsequent religation removed an 830-bp KpnI fragment containing the γ2b sec poly(A) site and region downstream to the second KpnI site, which is located 0.55 kb 5’ of the M1 exon. This step eliminated the endogenous Igγ2b sec poly(A) site and would allow partial restoration of the CH3-M1 intron distance upon insertion of 0.9-2.2-kb putative γ2a terminator fragments. We refer to pMPC11 Oli Sac-Kpn as “Construct A” for simplicity. Segments from the γ2a gene 3’ end (GenBankTM accession number M35032 (9Hall B. Milcarek C. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)) were then cloned into the multicloning region of pGEM3 or pGEM4 (34Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) prior to their excision with EcoRI and HindIII digestion and subsequent insertion into pMPC11 Oli Sac-Kpn in an orientation-specific fashion using the unique EcoRI and HindIII sites in the oligonucleotide linker at the 3’ end of the CH3 exon. Construct B (pMPC11γ) contains a 2.2-kb HindIII fragment from map units 22.4-22.6 kb on the 40.4-kb genome of γ phage cI857 DNA. Construct C (pMPC11 2ap(A)m(SL) + term) contains a 2.2-kb BglII-PstI fragment encompassing: the γ2a membrane poly(A) site and 0.45 kb of upstream 3’-UT sequence with the GA/CT repeats (SL = stem loop) and 1.25 kb of downstream sequence, including the γ2a transcription termination region (term). Construct D (pMPC11 2a term alone) contains a 1.1-kb BamHI-PstI fragment encompassing the previously identified γ2a transcription termination region. Construct E (pMPC11 2ap(A)m(SL) alone) contains a 1.4-kb BglII-PvuII fragment which includes the γ2a membrane poly(A) site and associated sequences (including upstream (SL) repeat motif) but lacks the downstream termination region. Construct F (pMPC11 2ap(A)m + term) contains a 1.5-kb HindIII-PstI fragment, including the γ2a membrane poly(A) site and downstream termination region but with only the 3’ portion (the CT) of the GA/CT repeat motif and the (CT)15 element. Construct G (pMPC11 2bp(A)s + term) contains both a 167-bp SacI-BalI fragment, including the γ2b sec poly(A) site and a downstream 1.1-kb BamHI-PstI fragment containing the γ2a transcription termination region. Plasmid pSV2 gpt-EH5A has the 2.85-kb EcoRI fragment with the Ig heavy chain enhancer cloned into the EcoRI site of pSV2gpt (35Lassman C.R. Matis S. Hall B.L. Toppmeyer D.L. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1251-1260PubMed Google Scholar). The IgH enhancer is in the opposite transcription orientation to the gpt gene. DNA fragments of the γ2a membrane 3’-UT region (see Fig. 1B) were cloned into the unique HpaI site of pSV2 gpt-EH5A. Clone gpt-AX2 contains the 1105 nt second AccI to second XbaI fragment with the GA, CT, and GT elements of the γ2a 3’-UT plus the mb poly(A) sites. In gpt-AX2ΔpA the two mb poly(A) sites of gpt-AX2 have been removed by deletion of the 189-nt SphI to PvuII fragment. Plasmid gptXX (formerly called MPA+E, or gptmb⌃SV (35Lassman C.R. Matis S. Hall B.L. Toppmeyer D.L. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1251-1260PubMed Google Scholar)) contains the 780-nt XbaI to XbaI fragment of the γ2a 3’-UT and therefore has the CT and GT elements plus the mb poly(A) sites but lacks all the GA elements. Plasmid gptSphX (called MSL by D. Boczkowski) contains the 670-nt SphI to XbaI fragment of the γ2a 3’-UT with the mb poly(A) sites; all of the upstream dinucleotide repeat elements are missing. J558L cells were transiently transfected using a Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) technique with 20 μg of DNA/5 × 106 cells; cells were maintained in growth medium for 48 h. At that time cytoplasmic, poly(A) containing RNA was isolated and/or nuclear run-on analysis was performed. The conditions used for nascent RNA transcript labeling (15 min) in isolated nuclei are identical to those described previously (1Flaspohler J.A. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2802-2810PubMed Google Scholar, 36Flaspohler J.A. Milcarek C. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 68-72PubMed Google Scholar). The linear response range of the film was determined, and autoradiograms from exposures in that range were scanned in a Bio-Rad densitometer. Raw hybridization intensities minus background were obtained for each probe region. The relative hybridization per base of each probe was calculated using the following formula (hybridization intensity length of probe in bases = relative hybridization per base). Overexposed films are often shown in the figures for better photographic reproductions. Individual experiments were normalized to the β-actin (Ac) control slot. Each construct was assayed a minimum of two times with two different clones or transient transfections and the range of the results from the several experiments is indicated by the error bars in some of the graphs. The cRNA targets are calculated to be in at least a 65-fold excess to the 32P-labeled heavy chain nuclear RNA, assuming 10 pg of nuclear RNA/cell, with 2% of total RNA as poly(A) containing RNA, 6% of poly(A) containing RNA as Ig-specific mRNA, and a 1.88-kb mRNA. In addition, experiments in which increasing amounts of the [32P]-labeled nuclear RNA were added showed a parallel increase in hybridization to the filters, indicating that the targets are in excess (data not shown). Target sequences on the filters were chosen such that hybridization of the 32P-labeled J558L nuclear RNA was less than 3% of that seen with cells transfected with the appropriate gene (data not shown). Plasmids plus T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase were used to generate microgram quantities of 3H-labeled cRNA “target” run-on probes immobilized on filters as described previously (1Flaspohler J.A. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2802-2810PubMed Google Scholar, 36Flaspohler J.A. Milcarek C. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 68-72PubMed Google Scholar). All of the cRNAs were cloned into pGEM (Promega) vectors. Probe 1, pG4MK1, yields a 1.2-kb cRNA spanning a portion of the variable region intron after SalI linearization. Probe 2, p2aCH3, contains a 0.31-kb SacI fragment, including the γ2a CH3 exon. Probe 3, pXDB1.2, contains a 0.3-kb AccI-HindIII fragment from the γ2a mb 3’-UT, including the 5’-GA portion of the GA/CT repeat motif upstream of the γ2a membrane poly(A) site. Probe 4, pSX, contains a 0.44-kb SacI-XbaI fragment located 0.17 kb 3’ of the γ2a mb poly(A) site. Probe 5, pFT13-X2 contains a 0.64-kb XbaI-PstI fragment located 0.61 kb downstream of the γ2a membrane poly(A) site, including the transcription termination region and repetitive elements as assayed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Probe 6, pM1M2 contains a 1.15-kb KpnI-PstI fragment, including the γ2b membrane exons. Probe 7, pPSac contains a 1.4-kb PstI-SacI fragment, including the γ2b mb 3’-UT and poly(A) site. Probe 8, pDF1 contains a 0.31-kb SacI-EcoRI fragment located 0.25 kb downstream of the γ2b mb poly(A) site. Probes 2’, 3’, and 6’ are sense cRNA probes designed to measure opposite strand transcription across probe regions 2, 3, and 6, respectively. Actin cRNA (Ac) is transcribed from pG4pal41 which contains a 1.1-kb PstI fragment of the mouse β-actin cDNA (37Minty A.J. Alonso S. Guenet J.L. Buckingham M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 77-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). See Fig. 6A for the positions of the gpt/Ig run-on probes. Probe 9, pSV-KH3, contains the 325-nt HindIII to KpnI fragment of the gpt gene of pSV2gpt. Probe 10, pFT13-X1(ΔSΔS), contains the 222-nt SphI to SacI fragment of the Igγ2a gene (9Hall B. Milcarek C. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the region near the membrane poly(A) sites. Probe 11, pSVBH contains the 238-nt BamHI to HincII fragment of pSV2gpt. Probe 12, pSV-HH contains the 240-nt HincII to HincII fragment of pSV2 gpt which derives originally from SV40 and begins 288 nt downstream of the SV40 early poly(A) site of the vector and 988 nt downstream of the inserted membrane poly(A) site in plasmids gpt-AX2, -XX, and -SphX. The ability of RNA polymerase II to transcribe through the various inserted putative terminator elements in the Igγ gene was assayed in nuclear run-on experiments on stably transfected cell lines. A γ2b heavy chain gene construct deleted for its first poly(A) site and containing no inserted putative transcription termination element, pMPC11 Oli Sac-Kpn, construct A, supports the transcription of the regions downstream from the inserted 24-bp oligonucleotide polylinker at levels nearly equal to transcription of the upstream constant region-encoding exons (Fig. 2A, 3-7% termination; Table I). Insertion of a 2.2-kb fragment of heterologous γ phage DNA into the polylinker, in pMPC11γ, construct B, only slightly increases termination prior to transcription of the downstream probes 6/7 region with most RNA polymerase II molecules traversing the γ DNA as indicated by the strong hybridization to probes 6 and 7 (Fig. 2B, 12-17% termination). Appropriate sense strand cRNA controls, which were designed to detect opposite strand transcription, were included in each nuclear run-on assay (e.g.Fig. 2, probes 2’, 3’, and 6’). In all the experiments there was little or no opposite strand transcription as indicated by the low or absent hybridization to the opposite orientation probes. Hybridization of 32P-labeled nuclear RNA from untransfected J558L cells to probes 1-4 and 6-8 was less than 3% of that seen in the cells transfected with the intact MPC11 gene (data not shown). A β-actin (37Minty A.J. Alonso S. Guenet J.L. Buckingham M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 77-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) antisense cRNA probe was used to normalize transcription rates between independent experiments. A lower hybridization signal to the probe 1 region, which includes a portion of the VJH to CH1 region intron, than to probe 2, was consistently observed and may reflect polymerase passing through the probe 1 region without subsequent new initiation during preparation of nuclei or possible nonuniform polymerase loading. Note that probes 1 and 2 are separated by at least 6 kb. Therefore, hybridization to probe 2 was used for the normalizations in the figures and. Table ITable IRelative termination efficiencies of inserted putative termination elements in IgG gene constructs Open table in a new tab Insertion of a 2.2-kb fragment of the γ2a gene 3’ end containing the previously identified region where γ2a transcription normally terminates (term) as well as the γ2a membrane poly(A) signal/site and upstream set of stem loop-specifying GA/CT repeat elements (SL) plus (GT)15 in the 3’-UT was able to act as a very efficient termination element in this system. As seen in Fig. 2C, insertion of this whole element in pMPC11 p(A)m(SL) + term, Table I, construct C, caused a 93-97% decrease in transcription of downstream regions as assayed in isolated transfectant nuclei. The effect of the γ2a region appears to be specific, since the absence of an insert or the presence of a heterologous DNA insert failed to cause termination (Fig. 2, A and B). The probe 5 region contains repetitive DNA elements which are responsible for the high signal obtained so it was subsequently omitted from the analyses. Hybridization of run-on RNA from nuclei of pMPC11 2ap(A)m(SL) + term transformants to probes 6 and 7 was very minimal, indicating that, as we had determined by sequence comparisons, the γ2a and γ2b gene elements are sufficiently diverged to allow for our analyses with these probes. The insertion of the 750-bp region in which γ2a transcription normally terminates (term) with no other upstream γ2a sequences into the γ2b gene (pMPC11 2a term alone) leads to significant read-through of the termination region into the probe 6/7 region (Fig. 3 and Table I, construct D), indicating that the region in which γ2a transcription terminates normally fails to efficiently stop Pol II on its own. The construct pMPC11 2ap(A)m(SL) alone, construct E, contains the γ2a 3’-UT with stem/loop structure and mb poly(A) sites. The data in Fig. 3 and Table I show, somewhat surprisingly, that the γ2a mb 3’-UT and poly(A) region acts as an extremely efficient transcriptional terminator in our constructs. Indeed, transcription has decreased by 72% over the downstream probe 6 region and by 92% over the probe 7 region, relative to transcription of the upstream probe 2 (CH3 exon) region. The ability of the γ2a membrane 3’-UT and poly(A) region to terminate transcription on its own and the inefficiency of the region of termination alone (term) in specifying Pol II stopping indicates a major role for the γ 2a mb 3’-UT and poly(A) region in specifying downstream termination. To test the potential role of the GA repeat motifs in specifying transcription termination, we inserted into the γ2b gene a fragment starting 30 bp upstream of the (CT)23 element of the γ2a membrane 3’-UT region and containing the downstream termination region, but lacking the GA repeat motifs upstream, creating pMPC11 2ap(A)m + term, construct F in Table I. As shown in Fig. 4, this construct was still able to cause specific transcription termination, but at a reduced efficiency (see Table I) in the nuclear run on assay. Therefore, the stem/loop may be an important determinant of the efficiency with which the membrane 3’-UT is able to halt the polymerase molecule. To determine whether another poly(A) region could act as a functional substitute and whether the strength of the poly(A) site played a role in termination, we inserted the γ2b sec poly(A) region together with the downstream γ2a termination region into pMPC11 Oli Sac-Kpn to create pMPC11 2bp(A)s + term, construct G. We have previously shown this Ig secretory-specific poly(A) site to be almost 10 times weaker at directing polyadenylation than the membrane-specific sites when both are placed in competition with the same downstream element (35Lassman C.R. Matis S. Hall B.L. Toppmeyer D.L. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1251-1260PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lassman C.R. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2578-2585PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, and summarized in Table I, this insert is able to cause 56-64% transcription termination. So the secretory-specific poly(A) site + term is more efficient than the γ2a term region alone, but was not able to terminate transcription as efficiently as the intact γ2a membrane poly(A) region alone or pMPC11 2a poly(A)m(SL) + term. We conclude that stronger poly(A) sites cause more efficient termination than weaker sites. We conclude further that the term region has the effect of increasing termination in conjunction with the sec poly(A) site, since the sec poly(A) site has been previously shown to cause little or no termination on its own (Table I and Ref. 1Flaspohler J.A. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2802-2810PubMed Google Scholar). The expected size or sizes of the transcripts from each of the constructs is shown in Fig. 5. Cytoplasmic, poly(A) containing RNA was isolated, run on denaturing formaldehyde:agarose gels, blotted to membranes, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe for the VH domain of the Ig gene. As shown in Fig. 5, the recipient cell line, J558L, produces no endogenous cytoplasmic RNA capable of hybridizing with the VH-specific probe, whereas hybridization of the same blot with a glycerol aldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase probe shows that RNA was present (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the sizes of the cytoplasmic RNAs produced from cells tranfected with constructs A, B, C, D, and E were consistent with the results we had obtained from the transcription run-on studies. Transfectants with constructs F and G produce primarily the shorter of the two predicted species, indicating little use of the second poly(A) site in the transcript. We assume that the virtual absence of the larger predicted mRNA species in construct G (pMPC11 2b(A)s+ term) where 40% of the molecules should read through the second poly(A) site, indicates that either insertion of the termination region in the CH3 to M1 intron interferes with splicing or the first poly(A) site is able to compete for the polyadenylation machinery of the cell because of its promoter proximal location and the large distance between the sites. The amounts of poly(A)-containing cytoplasmic mRNA detected by the VH probe varied not only from construct to construct, but also from transfectant to transfectant with the same construct (data not shown). We have previously shown that between individual stable transfectants, even with the same Ig construct, the amount of exogeneous Ig heavy chain mRNA, as a percentage of total RNA in that cell, can vary from 5 to 50% of the level seen in a normal plasma cell (31Kobrin B.J. Milcarek C. Morrison S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We assume that this variation is a function of the position of insertion of the exogenously added Ig gene. Therefore, conclusions about the relative abundance of the cytoplasmic poly(A) containing RNAs between constructs is not informative. Igγ2a fragments were inserted into the unique HpaI site of pSV2gptEH5a, downstream of the gpt coding region, yet upstream of the vector, SV40 early, polyadenylation site as shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:A. In these constructs the gpt gene is driven by the SV40 promoter:enhancer elements. Construct AX2 contains the entire GA/CT stem/loop, (GT)15 element and the membrane-specific poly(A) encoding region. Construct XX contains only the (CT)23 portion, (GT)15 and poly(A) region of AX2. In AX2ΔpA the SphI to PvuII fragment containing the two membrane-specific poly(A) site was removed from AX2. Construct SphX contains the poly(A) site and the region 3’ of it from AX2, but lacks the GA/CT and GT regions entirely. We used transient transfections where it is possible to detect more transcription signal from the large number of input molecules. The gpt signal in these experiments was roughly 5% of that seen with an internal β-actin control. The results from the run-on assays, performed on nuclei of cells which had been transfected with the indicated constructs, are shown in Fig. 6, B and C, and summarized in Table II. Relative hybridization per base pair to an immobilized target within the gpt coding region was set as 1.0. Hybridization to probe 12 is decreased significantly in construct AX2, indicating at least 65% termination of transcription in that region. The run-on probe 12 spans the region from +988 to +1228 downstream of the inserted membrane-specific poly(A) site.Table IIRelative termination efficiencies of inserted γ2aIg elements in gpt constructs Open table in a new tab From the analysis of the results in Table II, we conclude that the regions upstream of and including the membrane poly(A) site can function in the gpt gene, driven by the SV40 promoter, to cause transcription termination. We observe that deletion of the poly(A) site, as in AX2ΔpA, causes a decrease in termination efficiency, yet the membrane-specific poly(A) site alone is insufficient to cause termination in SphX. Therefore, the interaction of the region upstream of the membrane poly(A) site plus the region surrounding the A2UA3 element itself are necessary and sufficient for efficient termination and function independently of the Ig promoter. Cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from the J558L transfectants, size-fractionated on denaturing RNA gels, blotted to membranes, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled, antisense probe for the body of the gpt message, i.e. probe 9, see Fig. 6A. The predicted sizes of the gpt RNAs are listed in Table II. As shown in Fig. 7, in cells transfected with AX2 and XX, the most abundant gpt/Ig RNA species were the ones corresponding to use of the first, γ2a, membrane poly(A) site. In accordance with the transcription termination data, very little of the RNA ending with the downstream (SV40 early, vector) poly(A) site was observed. In cells transfected with AX2ΔpA, gpt/Ig RNA, with a size corresponding to use of the downstream vector poly(A), was the major species observed, consistent with the run-on data. However, there was also a gpt/Ig RNA species of 2.15 kb. We hypothesize that this RNA may arises from a AATAA sequence about 35 nt downstream of the start of the AX2 insert. Some of this RNA is also observed in a few of the AX2 transfectants with an intact stem/loop and poly(A) site, see lanes 3 and 4, Fig. 7. Since little transcription termination was occurring just beyond the second poly(A) site, we had expected to see only the longer gpt/Ig RNA (2.8 kb) species in the transfectants with SphX. Those are observed, but, in addition, we saw a species whose size (2.2 kb) is consistent with the use of the first (membrane) poly(A) site. We conclude that the “first come first served” model of poly(A) site choice (38Lassman C.R. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2578-2585PubMed Google Scholar) is operating in this construct. We show that the Ig heavy chain γ2a membrane poly(A) region, which contains an upstream GA/CT element, a (GT)15 element and two tandem poly(A) signal/sites, each with their own downstream GT-rich elements, is capable of specifying very efficient transcription termination in two different types of constructs. We see 72-92% termination in a construct driven by the homologous Ig promoter and 65% termination in a construct where it is driven by the SV40 promoter. The distance of the termination event relative to the γ2a membrane poly(A) site is over a range of 320-1470 nt, analogous to most eucaryotic genes thus far studied where the poly(A) to termination event distance is approximately 1000 nt. The Igγ2a membrane poly(A) site could therefore serve as a moderately sized (approximately 600 nt) cassette for gene expression studies where an efficient poly(A) site:terminator is required. Disruption of the GA/CT potential stem loop in the γ2a membrane 3’-UT in the construct pMPC11 2ap(A)m + term, construct F, while still allowing fairly efficient termination, increases the level of read-through transcription relative to constructs C or E. The same is true in the comparison of constructs XX and AX2 in Table II. The formation of an RNA stem loop 95 nt upstream of the membrane poly(A) site could enhance termination by directly increasing membrane poly(A) site utilization through sequestering of polyadenylation factors and/or pausing the RNA polymerase II elongation complex. In this model polyadenylation and termination could be linked and increasing membrane poly(A) site utilization inherently would lead to increasing transcription termination. Alternatively, the RNA stem loop may increase termination efficiency directly through slowing or stalling polymerase II and/or providing a site where a putative “antitermination factor” is lost or a “termination factor” is bound to the elongation complex. This eucaryotic element bears a striking resemblance to the procaryotic factor independent terminators for RNA polymerase where the polymerase stalls at a stem loop structure in the RNA. A nuclear factor binding site has been located just upstream (8Law A. Kuwabard M. Briskin M. Fasel N. Hermanson G. Sigman D. Wall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 4: 9160-9164Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) of the μ membrane poly(A) site and has been proposed as a nucleation site for termination factor binding. The region upstream of the μ membrane poly(A) site has also been reported to stall or pause polymerase II elongation through interaction with DNA repetitive elements in the vicinity of the μ membrane poly(A) site and mediate termination (2Galli G. Guise J.W. McDevitt M.A. Tucker P.W. Nevins J.R. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Guise J.W. Lim P.L. Yuan D. Tucker P.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3988-3994PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a (GT)15 element, also upstream of the γ2a membrane poly(A) site, is intriguing, since GT-rich elements are found downstream of many poly(A) sites. The (GT)15 element may have a role in enhancing the strength of the membrane specific poly(A) site. The ability of the γ2a termination region to cause only 40% transcription termination on its own mirrors the inefficiency of the mouse β major globin gene termination region in specifying termination when inserted into the adenovirus E1A gene (20Falck-Pedersen E. Logan J. Shenk T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1985; 40: 897-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is not surprising, given the sequence heterogeneity present in most identified regions of polymerase II disengagement and the demonstrated need for a functional poly(A) site (20Falck-Pedersen E.

Repetitive DNA elements have been found at or near the termination regions of both Ig- (8Law A. Kuwabard M. Briskin M. Fasel N. Hermanson G. Sigman D. Wall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 4: 9160-9164Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and non-Ig-encoding genes (17Pribyl T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5369-5377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Frayne E.G. Leys E.J. Crouse G.F. Hook A.G. Kellems R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2921-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and have been postulated to play a role in termination, possibly mediating the “stacking up” of polymerase II molecules to facilitate dissociation from the DNA template (3Guise J.W. Lim P.L. Yuan D. Tucker P.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3988-3994PubMed Google Scholar, 4Weiss E.A. Michael A. Yuan D. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1046-1052PubMed Google Scholar). The γ2a termination region may contribute to termination by possessing a sequence which facilitates polymerase II pausing and/or disengagement as directed by upstream sequence elements. When we compare the termination in probe 6 for constructs labeled D, G, F, and C we see a progressive increase in termination efficiency (from 40-56% to 76-97%, see Table II). This progression seems to parallel an increase in the “strength” of the poly(A) sites involved. We previously measured the amount of steady state cytoplasmic RNA in J558L cells transfected with different constructs in which the membrane or secretory-specific poly(A) regions were put in a cis-competition with an identical downstream SV40 early poly(A) site (35Lassman C.R. Matis S. Hall B.L. Toppmeyer D.L. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1251-1260PubMed Google Scholar). The myeloma cells containing the γ2b secretory poly(A) region produced cytoplasmic RNA in which the sec poly(A)-terminated molecules were three times as abundant as the SV40 poly(A)-terminated molecules. Cells transfected with γ2a membrane poly(A) region constructs with only the (CT)23 half of the potential stem/loop sequences produced RNA in which the mb-terminated molecules were 26 times as abundant as the SV40-terminated molecules (35Lassman C.R. Matis S. Hall B.L. Toppmeyer D.L. Milcarek C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1251-1260PubMed Google Scholar). The cells transfected with the full GA:CT sequence element of the 2a mb untranslated region produced RNA in which the mb-terminated molecules were 89 times as abundant as the SV40-terminated molecules (41Hall B.L. Sequence and Secondary Structure of the Murine Immunoglobulin 2a Membrane 3’-Untranslated Region. 1989; (Ph.D. thesis, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA)Google Scholar). So, by the criteria of stable mRNA produced, the membrane poly(A) site is much stronger than the sec site. Likewise, we and others have also shown that the μ membrane site is stronger than the μ secretory site as assayed in various constructs (2Galli G. Guise J.W. McDevitt M.A. Tucker P.W. Nevins J.R. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Guise J.W. Lim P.L. Yuan D. Tucker P.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3988-3994PubMed Google Scholar, 26Edwalds-Gilbert G.

Biol. 1989; 9: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the absence of any known poly(A) site, the term alone construct (construct D), termination falls to 40%. We conclude that a poly(A) site is required for efficient termination, and the stronger the site, the more active the process becomes. This conclusion is confirmed by the lack of termination in the construct AX2ΔpA. A functional poly(A) site has been shown to be mandatory for termination of polymerase II transcripts both in cells and nuclear extracts (20Falck-Pedersen E. Logan J. Shenk T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1985; 40: 897-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Whitelaw E. Proudfoot N. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Logan J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3593-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to speculate whether poly(A) site “strength” in other polymerase II gene products is a true reflection of the polyadenylation/cleavage efficiency of the sequence itself or is more a function of the ability of that site to promote termination which then facilitates mature 3’ end formation. The stronger membrane Igμ poly(A) site terminates transcription more efficiently than the weaker secretory-specific Igμ site in an adenovirus hybrid construct (26Edwalds-Gilbert G. Prescott J. Falck-Pedersen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3472-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transcription termination and poly(A) site strength are clearly interrelated, perhaps not directly through cleavage and polyadenylation itself, but through assembly or disassembly of an elongation complex.

These chimeras consisted of four truncated amino-terminal segments of the α subunit linked at amino acid residues 126, 179, 313, and 439 to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), a reporter protein, that contains a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation. The fusion sites were located after one of the four hydrophobic segments (H1-H4). The results showed that the chimeras in which the α subunit was truncated at positions 126 and 313 were glycosylated, and the glycosylated peptides were protected by membranes from proteolysis. However, the other two chimeras were not glycosylated and the inserted peptides were digested by protease into fragments which did not immunoprecipitate with anti-CAT. These results clearly demonstrate that hydrophobic segments H1 and H3 function as signal/anchor type II, and H2 and H4 function as halt transfer signals. Furthermore, membrane insertion of the NH2-terminal third of Na,K-ATPase α subunit is achieved by a series of alternate signal/anchor type II and halt transfer sequences.

CAT is chosen since it is a cytosolic protein and does not contain either insertion or halt transfer sequences. It can therefore be used as a faithful COOH-terminal reporter protein (Lipp and Dobberstein, 1986Lipp J. Dobberstein B.

The chimeras are designed such that topogenic properties of hydrophobic segments can be examined sequentially in the native context. Signal/anchor and halt transfer sequences are identified by characterization of their COOH-terminal flanking sequence with respect to the membrane. Two properties, occurrence of N-linked glycosylation and membrane protection of the reporter protein from proteolysis, are used as the marker for the luminal disposition.

All cDNA constructs (pN-1, pN-2, pN-3, and pN-4) encoding the fusion proteins of the truncated Na,K-ATPase α subunit and CAT as a reporter protein were derived from two plasmids: pF1 in which the entire coding region of α-1 subunit was engineered into a plasmid pT7/T3 19R, and pCAT, in which the entire coding region of CAT was engineered into a plasmid pGEM-3Z. cDNA constructs pX-1, pX-2, pX-3, and pX-4 were constructed from an in vivo and in vitro expression vector containing rat growth hormone cDNA (pSG5rGH) and one of the pN-1, pN-2, pN-3, and pN-4. The α-1 subunit cDNA, engineered from Okayama-Berg vector into pT7/T3 19R vector, contained about 200 nucleotides in 5’ end-noncoding region. When the mRNA from the cDNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system the translation efficiency was very poor probably due to the long stretch of GC pairs preceding the initiation codon. To improve the in vitro translation efficiency, a new 45-mer oligonucleotide, AGCTTGATATCGATAACTGAATAGCTGCAGGACGATCGCCATGGG, was designed according to Kozak's rule (Kozak, 1987Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) and engineered just before the initiator codon of the α subunit by ligating the annealed oligomers, the NcoI/SacI fragment from plasmid Okayama-Berg α1 and the plasmid pT7/T3 19R cut with HindIII and NcoI. The entire coding region of the CAT gene obtained by cutting a plasmid pCAT basic with HindIII and NlaIV was ligated into the plasmid pGEM-3Z cut with HindIII and HincII. The 404-base pair fragment obtained by cutting a plasmid pF I with PstI and RsaI was ligated into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut with PstI and HincII. A plasmid pF 1 was linearized by NspV digestion, and its protruding ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme. The linearized, blunt-ended pF 1 was then ligated to 8-mer SalI linkers, and the ligated sample was digested with PstI and SalI. A 535-base pair PstI/SalI fragment thus obtained was inserted into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut with PstI and SalI. A plasmid pF 1 was digested with XhoI, and the protruding ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme. After digestion with PstI, an approximately 0.97-kilobase pair fragment was isolated and inserted into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut with PstI and HincII. A plasmid pF 1 was linearized with AflII, and its protruding ends were filled in with Klenow enzyme. After digestion with PstI, a fragment of about 1.35 kilobase pair was isolated and inserted into the plasmid pCAT that had been cut with PstI and HincII. A fragment containing one of four hydrophobic segments (H1, H2, H3, or H4) and CAT was made by polymerase chain reaction using their corresponding linearized plasmid pN-1, pN-2, pN-3, or pN-4 as the template and two oligonucleotides described below. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NaeI (pX-1 and pX-2) or PmlI (pX-3 and pX-4) and BamHI and then ligated to the plasmid pSG5rGH that had been cut with Eco47III and BamHI. The NH2-terminal side oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides 1, 2, 3, and 4) and the COOH-terminal side oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide C) are: oligonucleotide 1 for pX-1, ATTCCGGCAGCTGTT; oligonucleotide 2 for pX-2, GATGAGCTCTGCCGGCTGTACCTCGGGGTCGTGGC; oligonucleotide 3 for pX-3, GATGAGCTCGCACGTGTCATCCACCTCATCACGGG; oligonucleotide 4 for pX-4, TGATGAGCTCGCACGTGCTGTCATCTTCCTCATTGG; oligonucleotide C, CCATGGCTCGAGCTTAAG. That all constructs encoding chimeras were ligated in frame has been confirmed by DNA sequencing, size of the primary translation products, and immunoreactivity of the primary translation products to anti-CAT antibody. Microsomes were prepared from canine pancreas as described by Walter and Blobel, 1983Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar. Occasionally microsomal membranes were obtained from Promega Corp. The plasmids pN-1, pN-2, pN-3, and pN-4 and pX-1, pX-2, pX-3, and pX-4 were cut with SmaI and BamHI, respectively, and the linearized DNAs were purified with a Geneclean kit. A 45 μl of transcription reaction mixture contains 5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA, 80 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 16 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 40 mM DTT, 1 unit/μl RNasin, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μM cap analog (m7G(5’)ppp(5’)G), and 50 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (for pN-1, pN-2, pN-3, and pN-4) or T7 RNA polymerase (for pX-1, pX-2, pX-3, and pX-4). After the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 40°C, 5 μl of nucleotide mixture (0.5 mM each of ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP) was added and incubated again at 40°C for 1 h. Then, in order to obtain the maximal amount of the transcripts, 50 units of RNA polymerase were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 40°C for an additional hour. The transcripts were then purified with phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, and the pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The translation reaction was carried out as described in the Promega's technical manual. Briefly, a 20-μl translation mixture contains 14 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 1.6 μl of 10 mCi/ml [35S]methionine, 20 μM each of the other 19 amino acids, 20 units of RNasin, and 68 mM KOAc (endogenous amount of KOAc, 78 mM, contained in the lysate was not included). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 90 min in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes (5 A260 units/ml of translation reaction). Immediately after the incubation was over, the translation mixture was chilled on ice and diluted with high salt buffer (500 mM KOAc, 3 mM Mg(OAc)2, 50 mM triethanolamine (pH 7.5), and 1 mM DTT) to 100 μl. The diluted sample was incubated on ice for an additional 10 min and overlaid onto a 100-μl cushion containing 0.5 M sucrose, 500 mM KOAc, 50 mM triethanolamine, 3 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 1 mM DDT. The step gradient was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 150 min in the 100.3 rotor of the Beckman centrifuge TL-100. The top 125 μl was collected as the supernatant fraction, the rest of the sucrose cushion was discarded, and the pellet (microsomal fraction) was gently washed once with high salt buffer. The supernatant fractions (see the previous paragraph) or the translation products synthesized in the absence of membranes were mixed with 1.7 volume of saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Trasylol was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 4°C for 4 min. The resultant pellets were suspended in a small volume of 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 4°C for 4 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The pellets were suspended in a small volume of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.2), 2% SDS, and 50 mM DTT. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 55°C and then analyzed in 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The microsomal membranes isolated from the translation mixture as described earlier were dissolved in a 30 μl 1% SDS solution containing 50 mM DTT, incubated for 3 min in boiling water, followed by addition of an equal volume of 0.2 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.2 μg/ml Trasylol. The samples were then equally divided into two parts: one part was supplemented with 3 μl of 1 mU/μl Endo H and to the other 3 μl of water was added. Both samples were incubated at 37°C overnight. After addition of 33 μl of the sample loading buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.2, 50 mM DTT and 10% glycerol) the samples were incubated in boiling water for 3 min and analyzed in 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Microsomal membranes isolated from the translation mixture were suspended in 40 μl of dilution buffer (2.5% Triton X-100, 190 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) containing 0.1 μg/ml Trasylol. 10 μl of 20% SDS solution was added, and the sample was incubated in boiling water for 4 min. After the sample was chilled to about 4°C, 4 volumes of cold dilution buffer and then 4 μl of antiserum against CAT were added. The samples were processed as described by Anderson and Blobel, 1983Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar. For immunoprecipitation of the translation products synthesized in the absence of microsomal membranes, immunoprecipitation was conducted after the endogenous globins were removed by addition of saturated ammonium sulfate, as described before. Translation mixture was diluted with 3 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and incubated in the presence of 3 mM tetracaine hydrochloride at room temperature for 10 min to stabilize the microsomal membranes. Freshly prepared stock solutions of trypsin and chymotrypsin were added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml each in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. Proteolytic digestion was carried out at room temperature for 30 min and terminated by the addition of Trasylol (at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (at a final concentration of 3 mM). The reaction mixture was then supplemented with KOAc to a final concentration of 400 mM and overlaid onto 100 μl of 0.5 M sucrose/0.5 M KOAc cushion. The step gradient was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 15 min in the 100.3 rotor of the Beckman centrifuge TL-100. The membrane pellets were washed once with 50 μl of high salt buffer solution and analyzed in SDS-PAGE after incubation in boiling water for 5 min in the presence of sample loading buffer. As shown in the hydropathy plot (Fig. 1), the NH2-terminal third of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit contains four hydrophobic segments. They are located at residues Leu91-Ile112 (H1), Leu125-Gln145 (H2), Phe286-Leu308 (H3), and Ala315-Ala343 (H4). The topogenic nature of these hydrophobic segments was examined using in vitro insertion into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of chimeras that were expressed by the cDNA constructs pN-1, pN-2, pN-3 and pN-4. These constructs contained one or more hydrophobic segments sequentially in their native context. As described in the Introduction, two criteria, occurrence of N-linked glycosylation of the reporter protein and membrane protection of the reporter protein from proteolysis, were used as markers for the luminal location of the ligation site. When the mRNA transcribed from pN-1 was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence of microsomal membranes, the immunoprecipitates with anti-CAT antibody contained a single band with molecular mass of 39 kDa, which corresponds to the size of the primary translation product of the fusion protein N-1 (Fig. 2, lane 1). Translation in the presence of microsomal membranes yielded two major proteins with molecular masses of about 42 and 39 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 2). This 39-kDa protein was slightly larger than the primary translation product in lane 1, which suggested that the 39-kDa protein was not the primary translation product but the glycosylated fusion protein N-1 that was initiated from an internal methionine, Met27. This is supported by Endo H digestion results discussed below. The 42-kDa protein comprised about 60% of the total immunoprecipitates. The immunoprecipitates also contained a smaller protein (about 36 kDa) as a minor product. Since an internal methionine residue is located at the 32nd amino acid from the NH2 terminus (see Fig. 1), the minor protein may be the unglycosylated fusion protein N-1 that was initiated by the internal methionine. When the immunoprecipitates shown in lane 2 were digested with Endo H, the two major proteins shifted quantitatively from 42 and 39 kDa to 39 and 36 kDa, respectively (lane 3). This 36-kDa protein migrated exactly at the same speed as the minor protein in lane 2, strongly supporting that the 39-kDa protein in lane 2 was the glycosylated fusion protein N-2 initiated by Met27 Therefore, the glycosylated form comprised more than 80% of the newly synthesized fusion proteins. This high efficiency of translocation of the fusion protein N-1 initiated by the hydrophobic segment H1 allowed us to examine the topogenic properties of its downstream hydrophobic segments in an in vitro translation/translocation system. To examine whether the hydrophobic segment H1 functions as an anchor signal, the fusion protein N-1, which was synthesized in the presence of microsomes, was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. The membrane-protected fragments were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody. In this experiment, if H1 functioned as an anchor signal, 95 NH2-terminal flanking residues of H1 would remain untranslocated in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and would be cleaved by proteases in the absence of Triton X-100. Therefore, the size of a peptide that is protected by membranes from proteolysis will be smaller by about 10 kDa than the control fusion protein N-1. As shown in Fig. 3, lane 2, one fragment whose molecular mass was about 30 kDa was recovered by immunoprecipitation when digested in the absence of Triton X-100. As no fragments were recovered upon digesting in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, lane 3), it is reasonable to conclude that the fragment recovered was a membrane protected one. These results clearly demonstrated that the hydrophobic segment H1 functioned as an insertion signal as well as an anchor of the inserted signal sequence and also confirmed that the NH2-terminal flanking region of the H1 is located in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Upon translation of the plasmid pN-2 transcript in a reticulocyte lysate without addition of microsomes, a major protein with molecular mass of about 51 kDa was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody (Fig. 2, lane 4). This size corresponds to that of the unglycosylated fusion protein N-2. A minor band (about 48 kDa) was also recovered. This protein was probably an unglycosylated fusion protein N-2 that was initiated by the internal Met27. The molecular mass difference between the major and minor proteins was about 3 kDa, which corresponds to the size of the peptide between Met-5 and Met27. When the pN-2 transcripts were translated in the presence of microsomes, a 51-kDa protein was recovered as a major product (Fig. 2, lane 5). This product had the same apparent molecular mass as those obtained in the absence of microsomes (compare the sizes of the major bands in lanes 4 and 5), which strongly indicated that the fusion protein N-2 was not glycosylated. As predicted, the apparent molecular mass of this band did not shift down by Endo H treatment (the data are not shown here). Since the CAT protein was linked to an amino acid residue in the COOH-terminal flanking region of H2, the result showed that the translocation which was initiated by H1 was halted by H2, and consequently the CAT protein remained in the cytoplasmic side of membranes as illustrated in Fig. 2, bottom. These results were further supported by proteolysis experiments. Fig. 3, lane 5, showed that no membrane-protected fragments were recovered by immunoprecipitation upon digestion with proteases. The immunoprecipitates from the translation of pN-3 transcript in the absence of microsomes contained a major band with molecular mass of about 59 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 6), which is the size of an unglycosylated fusion protein N-3. A minor band (about 56 kDa) might be an unglycosylated fusion protein that was initiated by an internal methionine. Translation in the presence of microsomes yielded an additional band with molecular mass of about 62 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 7). The larger band, however, shifted its molecular mass to 59 kDa by Endo H treatment (Fig. 2, lane 8), which confirmed that the shift was due to deglycosylation of the N-linked sugar moiety. Since hydrophobic segment H3 was linked to an amino acid residue in the COOH-terminal flanking region of H3, the results demonstrated that the second round of translocation of the N-3 peptide was initiated by H3, and the following CAT protein was translocated into the ER lumen where it was glycosylated. To confirm if the hydrophobic segment H3 functions also as an anchor signal, the translation mixture performed in the presence of microsomes was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the digested sample was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody. As predicted, only one fragment (about 29 kDa) was recovered by the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3, lane 8), and no fragments were recovered upon proteolysis in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 3, lane 9). This verified that the 29-kDa band was the membrane-protected fragment, and the results confirmed that the hydrophobic segment H3 functioned as a signal/anchor type II. Translation of the plasmid pN-4 transcript carried out in a reticulocyte lysate without addition of microsomal membranes produced a major band with molecular mass of about 70 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 9), which corresponds to the unglycosylated form of the fusion protein N-4. Translation performed in the presence of microsomes produced also a 70-kDa protein (Fig. 2, lane 10). This result indicated that the H4 halted the translocation of its downstream peptide containing CAT protein, and therefore, the CAT protein remained in the cytoplasmic side of the membranes. To ascertain that the CAT protein remained untranslocated, the translation mixture of the pN-4 transcript, carried out in the presence of microsomes, was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the digested sample was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody. No fragments were recovered (Fig. 3, lane 11). Thus, protease digestion experiments demonstrated that the CAT protein remained in the cytoplasmic side of membranes and was digested by exogenously added proteases. Figure 2:, Figure 3: have shown that hydrophobic segments H2 and H4 function as halt transfer signal in the native context. In order to examine whether the topogenic nature of H2 and H4 is intrinsic and whether H1 and H3 are also capable of halting translocation, we chose a rat growth hormone signal sequence and constructed plasmids pX-1, pX-2, pX-3, and pX-4. These plasmids encoded fusion proteins consisting of the NH2-terminal 66 amino acid residues (including a cleavable signal sequence) of rat growth hormone and one of the hydrophobic segments (H1, H2, H3, and H4) linked at its COOH-terminal flanking region to the CAT protein. As a control, plasmid pX-c was constructed. This plasmid encoded a chimera consisting of NH2-terminal 66 amino acid residues of rat growth hormone and CAT protein only. In this experiment, the topogenic nature of each hydrophobic segment was characterized by occurrence of N-linked glycosylation of the reporter protein and complete protection by membranes from proteolysis, as shown schematically in Fig. 4B. The transcripts of plasmids pX-c, pX-1, pX-2, pX-3, and pX-4 were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of microsomes. An aliquot of the translation mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-CAT antibody, and the resulting precipitates were digested with Endo H. Other aliquots were digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin in the presence or absence of Triton X-100, and membrane-protected fragments were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody. The results are summarized in Fig. 4A. The primary translation product of the control chimera X-c gave a single band with a molecular mass of about 33 kDa (X-c, lane 1). The product obtained in the presence of microsomes also gave a single band with a molecular mass of about 33 kDa (X-c, lane 2); however, the molecular mass of this protein was shifted to about 30 kDa by Endo H digestion (X-c, lane 3). After digestion of the translation product with trypsin and chymotrypsin, a 33-kDa protein was recovered by immunoprecipitation (X-c, lane 4), but the translocated protein was digested into undetectable fragments by immunoprecipitation when digested in the presence of Triton X-100 (X-c, lane 5). These results show that, as expected, the cleavable signal sequence of rat growth hormone did very efficiently initiate translocation of the control chimera, and almost all of the translocated proteins were glycosylated and fully protected by membranes from proteolysis. The primary translation products of the plasmids pX-1, pX-2, pX-3, and pX-4 were about 37, 44, 37, and 47 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4A), and the translation products carried out in the presence of microsomes were about 34, 41, 34, and 44 kDa, respectively. These sizes were not changed by Endo H treatment (Fig. 4A), suggesting that all four chimeric proteins were inserted into membranes where their signal sequences were cleaved and further translocation of their downstream peptides was halted by the hydrophobic segments. Therefore the CAT protein remained in the cytoplasmic side of the membranes. When these translation products were digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin, no fragments were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-CAT antibody, which proved that the CAT protein remained in the cytosol and was digested by exogenously added proteases (Fig. 4). Thus, the data have clearly demonstrated that all four hydrophobic segments in the NH2-terminal third of α subunit have halt transfer signal function when they are in a different context and therefore their nature seems to be intrinsic. In addition, these experiments further confirmed that hydrophobic segments H2 and H4 are transmembrane domains. We report here the topogenesis of the NH2-terminal third of the α subunit examined by using in vitro ER membrane insertion of two different groups of chimeras. The first group of chimeras encoded fusion proteins consisting of different lengths of truncated α subunit with one or more hydrophobic segments located sequentially in the native context and CAT protein as a reporter protein. The second group encoded fusion proteins consisting of NH2-terminal 66 amino acid residues (including a cleavable signal sequence) of rat growth hormone, one of the H1, H2, H3, or H4 sequences, and CAT protein. Our data demonstrated that the membrane insertion of the NH2-terminal third of α subunit was initiated by H1 which functioned as a signal/anchor type II and was achieved by the downstream hydrophobic segments, which acted alternately as halt transfer (H2), insertion (H3), and halt transfer (H4) signals. The data also demonstrated that H1 and H3 were capable of halting translocation of their downstream peptides and that halt transfer function shown by all four hydrophobic segments seemed to be intrinsic. Homareda et al., 1989Homareda H. Kawakami K. Nagano K. Matsui H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5742-5745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar used in vitro ER membrane insertion of truncated α subunits that contain two adjacent hydrophobic segments such as H1 and H2 or H3 and H4 to examine which of the hydrophobic segments function as an insertion signal. Since the truncated polypeptides that were inserted into microsomal membranes in an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fashion were resistant to alkali extraction, Homareda et al., 1989Homareda H. Kawakami K. Nagano K. Matsui H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5742-5745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar have suggested that at least two insertion signals were present in the NH2-terminal third of the α subunit. The present data confirm the existence of two insertion signals in the NH2-terminal third and furthermore demonstrate that H1 and H3 function as a signal/anchor type II.

The present data have confirmed the orientation of H1 and H3 by the occurrence of N-linked glycosylation of the reporter protein at the COOH-terminal flanking region of the hydrophobic segments and sensitivity to protease digestion of the NH2-terminal flanking region of the segments. Although the first group of chimeras showed the orientation of H2 and H4 (Figure 2:, Figure 3:), the results were not conclusive, because the chimeras lacked a marker for the luminal disposition of NH2-terminal flanking region of H2 and H4. The conclusion was drawn from the data together with the following circumstantial observations: (a) the COOH-terminal flanking regions of H1 and H3 are located in the ER lumen, (b) the loops between H1 and H2 and particularly between H3 and H4 are too short to span the lipid bilayer, and (c) both loops are highly charged. In order to obtain conclusive results on the orientation, we constructed plasmids encoding chimeras in which one of hydrophobic segments was engineered into a passenger protein that had a cleavable signal sequence with high translocation efficiency. This allowed us to directly examine if these hydrophobic segments function as a halt transfer signal. In this approach, cleavage of an insertion signal was used as a marker for the luminal location of the NH2-terminal flanking region of each hydrophobic segment, and digestion of the reporter protein by proteases was used as a marker for the cytoplasmic location of the COOH-terminal flanking region of the segment. As seen in Fig. 4, the control chimera X-c was translocated very efficiently by the cleavable signal sequence of rat growth hormone and almost all of the translocated protein was glycosylated. The apparent molecular mass of the glycosylated protein became smaller by about 3 kDa when digested with Endo H (Fig. 4, X-c: lanes 1 and 3), indicating occurrence of the signal sequence cleavage as expected. Under the same translation/translocation conditions, the signal sequence of the chimeras X-2 and X-4 were cleaved, but the inserted chimeras were not glycosylated. In addition, they were digested by proteases into fragments which did not immunoprecipitate with anti-CAT antibody (see Fig. 4A). These experiments have conclusively confirmed the orientation of H2 and H4. The data have also showed that H1 and H3 are not only a signal/anchor type II but also capable of halting translocation, if employed, in a different context. The present study has demonstrated that the experimental approaches employed here are very effective in determining the topogenic nature of hydrophobic segments in the native context of a polytopic membrane protein. Using the same approaches, studies on the membrane topology of the COOH-terminal third of Na,K-ATPase α subunit are currently in progress. We thank Dr. David D. Sabatini for encouragement and support throughout this work. We also thank Dr. Y. Hara for the rat brain Na,K-ATPase α-1 subunit cDNA and J. Culkin and F.

https://openalex.org/W2092496555,"Efficient fluorescence energy transfer from aromatic residues to the pyridine moiety of the bound coenzyme (NAD) of UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from Kluyveromyces fragilis had been reported earlier (Mukherji, S., and Bhaduri, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11709–11713). We have employed N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to identify tryptophan as the exclusive aromatic donor in the energy transfer. The characteristic UV absorption spectrum associated with Trp oxidation is observed during NBS modification of two of the four Trp residues of native epimerase along with concomitant inactivation of the enzyme. Excellent correlation between the observed inactivation and abolition of fluorescence energy transfer to coenzyme from Trp in epimerase upon treatment with NBS implicates the involvement of the same two tryptophans in both catalytic activity and fluorescence energy transfer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorescence data preclude gross structural/conformational changes in epimerase due to NBS oxidation. The susceptible tryptophans do not reside at the substrate binding site as substrates and UMP fail to protect against NBS modification. However, failure of sodium borohydride to reduce the bound NAD in the NBS-inactivated epimerase suggests that the reactive tryptophans are close to the coenzyme. Tryptophan fluorescence lifetime values of 1.9 and 3.9 ns for the native and 3.5 ns for the NBS-modified epimerase, complemented by a linear Stern-Volmer plot (effective Stern-Volmer constant = 2.85 m–1) of acrylamide quenching, suggest that the two key tryptophans are buried close to an intrinsic quencher, presumably NAD. Efficient fluorescence energy transfer from aromatic residues to the pyridine moiety of the bound coenzyme (NAD) of UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from Kluyveromyces fragilis had been reported earlier (Mukherji, S., and Bhaduri, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11709–11713). We have employed N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to identify tryptophan as the exclusive aromatic donor in the energy transfer. The characteristic UV absorption spectrum associated with Trp oxidation is observed during NBS modification of two of the four Trp residues of native epimerase along with concomitant inactivation of the enzyme.

UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2), an obligatory enzyme of the galactose metabolic pathway, catalyses a freely reversible transformation between UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal (1Caputto R. Leloir L.F. Trucco R.E. Cardini C.E. Paladini A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 179: 497-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive studies on the mechanism of epimerization have demonstrated that the tightly bound pyridine nucleotide NAD is involved in a transient oxidation/reduction reaction in which a hydride is removed from C4 of the hexose moiety of the nucleotide sugar substrate and subsequently returned to the opposite face of the enzyme-bound 4-ketopyranose intermediate (2Gabriel O. Kalckar H.M. Darrow R.A. Ebner K.E. Subunit Enzymes. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1975: 84-135Google Scholar, 3Frey P.A. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramonic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Vol. 2B. Wiley, New York1987: 462-477Google Scholar). Thus epimerase has emerged as the prototype of a new class of oxidoreductase that, unlike the classical dehydrogenases, utilize enzyme-bound NAD as a true cofactor rather than a cosubstrate (3Frey P.A. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramonic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Vol. 2B. Wiley, New York1987: 462-477Google Scholar). Besides epimerase, some typical examples of apparently dissimilar enzymes belonging to this class are dTDP-glucose oxidoreductase (EC 4.2.1.46), UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.35), S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1), and dehydroquinate synthase (EC 4.6.1.3) (4Gabriel O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1978; 3: 193-195Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 5Gabriel O. Van Lanten L. Int. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 16: 1-36Google Scholar). The striking similarity in the mechanism of the enzymes of this class of oxidoreductase raises several questions of considerable interest for contemporary enzymology. Do these enzymes have a common evolutionary relationship or do they have a common conserved tertiary structure at the active site that emerges from totally different types of amino acid sequences? Is there a commonality between the amino acid residues that may participate directly in catalysis for these oxidoreductases and the dehydrogenases? In contrast to the detailed knowledge about the mechanistic pathway of these oxidoreductases, little is known about the structural features at their active site. Hence, mapping of active sites of these enzymes may be the initial step in addressing some of the fore mentioned critical questions. Our consistent efforts in this direction have provided a partial map of the structural organization at the active site of epimerase from Kluyveromyces fragilis. The yeast enzyme is a homodimer containing 1 mol of NAD noncovalently bound per mol of the apoenzyme. Thus, the enzyme has only one active site per mol of the functional dimer. One of the most intriguing features of the K. fragilis epimerase is its unique NADH-like fluorescence (excitation A:353 nm, emission A:435 nm) due to the pyridine moiety of its bound coenzyme NAD (6Bertland II, A.U. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4649-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although its exact chemical nature is not known, this characteristic coenzyme fluorophore serves as a direct monitor of environmental changes at the active site. This property has been exploited by us to reveal an essential arginine at the substrate binding site, a histidine and two thiols at the coenzyme binding site as well as other relevant features of the enzyme (7Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10777-10781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol.

Apart from this well documented coenzyme fluorescence, an efficient fluorescence excitation energy transfer from aromatic residues to the coenzyme fluorophore of epimerase had been accidently discovered during the course of the work related to establishing the presence of an essential histidine at the active site of epimerase (13Mukherjee S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observed energy transfer phenomenon provides a second delicate intrinsic monitor of events occurring at the active site of the enzyme as well as demonstrates the presence of one or more aromatic amino acid residues within the Forster distance of the bound coenzyme NAD. The involvement of tryptophan in the reported fluorescence energy transfer was suspected, although detailed investigations in this regard were not attempted at that stage. In the present work, it was our aim to explore the possibility of the location of tryptophan(s) at the active site of the enzyme and subsequently elucidate their functional role. Chemical modification and fluorescence studies, which were used as an initial tool to achieve this, have revealed the presence of two Trp residues which are involved in maintaining catalytic activity as well as are the exclusive aromatic donors of fluorescence excitation energy to the coenzyme fluorophore. In addition, we have exploited the environmentally sensitive, intrinsic fluorescence characteristics of tryptophans, such as fluorescence lifetime and quenching, to probe the neighborhood and approximate location of these reactive residues of epimerase.

Essentially homogenous UDP-glucose 4-epimerase was prepared by following the method of Darrow and Rodstrom (14Darrow R.A. Rodstrom R. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) up to stage III, and this was further purified by a Waters Protein Pak 300 SW HPLC column (7.8 × 300 mm) when microheterogenity was encountered. The specific activity of the enzyme batches, measured by the coupled assay method (14Darrow R.A. Rodstrom R. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), ranged between 40 and 60 units mg–1 of protein. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase was used as the coupling enzyme, and stoichiometric formation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm. Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard or by measuring absorption at 280 nm (14Darrow R.A. Rodstrom R. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of epimerase was determined to be 150,000 on a Sephadex G-200 column. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Centrifuge spin columns containing Sephadex G-50 were used to remove excess unreacted modifying reagents according to the method of Maniatis et al. (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 466Google Scholar). The procedure employed for NBS modification was adapted from the methods of Patchornik et al. (18Patchornik A. Lowson W.G. Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 5923-5927Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Spande and Witkop (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar). NBS was found to have a strong inhibitory effect on the coupling enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. Hence, to examine the effect of NBS on the activity of epimerase by the convenient coupled assay procedure, aliquots from the incubation mixture were first diluted with a suitable volume of a 0.1% bovine serum albumin solution, and aliquots from this diluted mixture were transferred to the assay medium. Bovine serum albumin is known to consume large excesses of NBS (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and hence can quench any residual NBS in the incubation mixture. Oxidation of epimerase was accomplished at 25 °C by stepwise addition of 5-µl aliquots of a freshly prepared aqueous solution of NBS (10 mM) to 0.9 ml of epimerase (5.33 µm, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7). The absorption spectrum of the treated enzyme solution was recorded on a Hitachi U3200 spectrophotometer. The absorbance at 280 nm was corrected for dilution, and the number of modified tryptophan residues per mol of native epimerase was calculated as described by Spande and Witkop (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence data were taken on a Hitachi Spectrofluorimeter, model F-4010 (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a 0.5-cm path length, 1-ml quartz cuvette. Dilute enzyme solutions (1–2 µm) in the desired buffer at 25 °C were used for fluorescence measurements. NAD content of epimerase (1 mg/ml, 0.2 ml), inactivated by NBS (2 µl, 5 mM), was estimated by converting it to a highly fluorescent product in strong alkali in the usual manner (13Mukherjee S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11709-11713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Udenfriend S. Fluorescence Assay in Biology and Medicine.Vol. 1. Academic Press, New York1962: 249Google Scholar). For quenching studies, the absorbance of epimerase solution taken was always less than 0.1 at the excitation wavelength. Fluorescence intensities were determined by continuous monitoring of the emission at 330 nm after excitation at 295 nm. The final intensity at any given acrylamide concentration was taken as a time averaged value after correcting for dilution and inner filter effects (21Helene C. Brun F. Yaniv M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A correction for absorption of acrylamide itself at 295 nm was made according to McClure and Edelman (22McClure W.O. Edelman G.M. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using a molar extinction coefficient of 0.29 M–1 cm–1 at 295 nm. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were made using a time-correlated single photon counter (model 199, Edinburgh Instruments, Edinburgh, Scotland) equipped with a thyratron-gated nitrogen flash lamp as a light source. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 297 and 330 nm, respectively. Peak counts were typically 10,000. The decay data were analyzed by a nonlinear least squares method (23Grinvald A. Steinberg I.Z. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), assuming that the fluorescence decay follows a multiexponential law, It = Σiαi-e–t/τi, where It is the fluorescence emission intensity at a time t after withdrawing the excitation pulse and the relative amplitudes αi and the decay constants τi are the numerical parameters to be recovered. The best fit between the theoretical curve and the decay data was evaluated from the plot of residuals, the autocorrelation function of the residuals and the reduced chi square. The decay of N-acetyltryptophan, which served as the standard sample, yielded a lifetime value of 2.95 ns. The Role of Tryptophan as the Exclusive Donor of Fluorescence Excitation Energy to the Coenzyme Fluorophore of Epimerase from K. fragilis The main features of the fluorescence properties of the native enzyme from K. fragilis are shown in Fig. 1A. When the native enzyme was excited at 353 nm, a characteristic, NADH-like fluorescence emission spectrum with a maximum at 435 nm was observed (24Weber G. Nature. 1957; 1801409Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When the enzyme was excited at 280 nm, the fluorescence emission spectrum exhibited two maxima with peaks at 330 and 435 nm, respectively. The peak at 330 nm is the typical protein fluorescence due to the tryptophan and tyrosine residues, whereas the second peak is characteristic of coenzyme fluorescence. In the present study, the appearance of the second peak in the region of the coenzyme fluorescence clearly demonstrated the transfer of fluorescence excitation energy from one or more aromatic amino acid residues to the coenzyme fluorophore. Evidently one or more aromatic amino acid residues reside within Forster distance (25Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar) of the coenzyme binding site. In a preliminary attempt to identify the aromatic donor residue(s) involved in the energy transfer phenomenon, we selectively excited the tryptophan residues of epimerase by exciting the protein at 295 nm (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 342Google Scholar). At this position of excitation, tyrosine residues of proteins exhibit a negligible absorbance and hence do not contribute to protein fluorescence. The resultant fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 1A), displayed peaks at 330 and 435 nm due to the tryptophans and the coenzyme fluorophore of the enzyme, respectively, suggesting the involvement of one or more tryptophan residues in the energy transfer process. Moreover, when the selective excitation of tryptophans was carried out in the presence of the substrate UDP-Gal or 5′-UMP, a powerful competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, an increase in the energy transfer to the coenzyme fluorophore was observed. Apparently, both substrate and UMP binding brought the tryptophan(s) closer to the coenzyme binding site, thereby increasing the efficiency of tryptophan to coenzyme fluorescence energy transfer. The participation of tryptophan residues as donors in the fluorescence energy transfer process was confirmed by chemical modification studies. NBS is a commonly used modifying reagent for tryptophans in proteins (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 27Shanmugasundaram T. Kumar G.K. Wood H.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28May J.M. Zhi-chao Qu. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9524-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reagent is found to be fairly selective in its action when used in carefully controlled amounts under acidic conditions (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The effect of NBS on epimerase was examined under mildly acidic conditions of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, since the strongly acidic conditions (pH 3–4) generally recommended for NBS modification studies resulted in inactivation of epimerase. Upon treatment with NBS under the above-mentioned nondenaturing condition, epimerase was found to undergo a parallel loss of tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence energy transfer (Fig. 1B), clearly indicating that one or more tryptophans act as donor residues in the observed energy transfer phenomenon. In addition to tryptophan, the contribution of tyrosine residues to the energy transfer process was also assessed by treating the enzyme with N-acetylimidazole, a specific modification reagent for tyrosine residues in proteins (29Simpson R.T. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The reagent was found to have only a minor effect on the protein fluorescence and no discernible effect on the fluorescence energy transfer (data not shown). These experimental findings implicated the exclusive involvement of one or more tryptophans as the aronative matic donor residues in fluorescence energy transfer to the coenzyme fluorophore. Thus, it was of interest to investigate their possible role in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. NBS was found to completely inactivate epimerase (Fig. 2) at a NBS:epimerase molar ratio of 66:1 under nondenaturing conditions of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7. In order to ascertain whether the tryptophan residue(s) associated with activity are the same tryptophans that are involved in the energy transfer, we simultaneously monitored relative loss of activity, tryptophan fluorescence and energy transfer after each successive addition of NBS. As shown in Fig. 2, there was a parallel loss of activity and energy transfer. When the enzyme became completely inactive the energy transfer process was also completely abolished, suggesting the involvement of the same tryptophan residues in both catalytic activity and energy transfer of the enzyme. Loss of tryptophan fluorescence, however, did not correlate with the loss of activity and even after essentially complete inactivation of the enzyme nearly 60% of the total tryptophan fluorescence was retained. This was possibly due to the contribution of other tryptophan residues that are not related either to activity or to the energy transfer process. These observations prompted us to determine the number of tryptophans contributing to activity and energy transfer. The oxidation of indole to oxindole by NBS exhibits a characteristic absorption spectrum with a decrease in the absorbance at 280 nm (∊M = 5500) and the appearance of a major peak at 261 nm (∊M = 10,300) and a minor peak at 309 nm (∊M = 1630) (30Ramachandran L.K. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 283-299Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The difference absorption spectra induced (as described under “Materials and Methods”) during the stepwise modification of epimerase with NBS showed a similar characteristic pattern with the appearance of a negative peak at 283 nm and two positive peaks at 252 and 305 nm, indicating the modification of tryptophan residues (Fig. 3). The inset in Fig. 3 shows the correlation between the loss of activity and the number of tryptophan residues modified. The oxidation of two tryptophan residues per mol of enzyme was found to result in complete inactivation of the enzyme at a NBS:Trp molar ratio of ~30:1. These results indicated that two tryptophan residues were involved in maintaining the activity of epimerase from K. fragilis. As only two tryptophan residues of the native enzyme were modified by NBS under nondenaturing conditions, NBS titration was carried out under various denaturing conditions to estimate the total number of tryptophan residues present per mol of epimerase. Four tryptophans were titrated by NBS when epimerase was oxidized, either in the presence of the strongly acidic conditions (50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4) generally recommended for the reaction (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar) or after complete denaturation with urea (8 m). In both cases, the NBS:Trp molar ratio was estmated to be ~15:1. Thus, two classes of tryptophan with significantly different reactivities toward NBS were identified for native epimerase. In addition to tryptophan, NBS may occasionally oxidise other amino acid residues such as tyrosine, histidine, and cysteines in proteins (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar), although, except for the sulfydryl group, the rate of oxidation of these residues is very small compared with the indole group (31Peterman B.F. Laidler K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). NBS oxidation of these residues, however, does not interfere with the detection of tryptophan modification as none of these residues or their oxidation products exhibit the characteristic absorption spectrum observed during tryptophan oxidation (19Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-532Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In the present study, modification of residues other the tryptophans seems unlikely upon considering the linear relationship between the number of tryptophans oxidized and the moles of NBS consumed (inset, Fig. 3). Moreover, under the neutral conditions we used for NBS oxidation, reaction with side chains other than tryptophans and cysteines becomes negligible since the rate of oxidation by NBS falls dramatically above pH 5 (31Peterman B.F. Laidler K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 577: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As two cysteines had earlier been identified at the active site of epimerase (7Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10777-10781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility of sulfydryl oxidation by NBS with concomitant loss of activity had to be considered. Direct quantitative estimation of free sulfydryl groups in the native and NBS-modified enzyme, according to the previously tested spectrophotometric method involving pCMB titration of free thiols (7Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10777-10781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Darrow R.A. Rodstrom R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2036-2042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), clearly demonstrated that the sulfydryl groups of epimerase were not modified by NBS. For this experiment, 0.6 mg of the enzyme in 0.5 ml of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, was first inactivated with NBS in a molar ratio of 70:1 for 3 min. The inactivated enzyme was passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column, previously equilibriated with 50 mM glycylglycine buffer, pH 7.8. Appropriate aliquots of the eluted enzyme were taken in a final volume of 1 ml of the same buffer and titrated stepwise with pCMB (2.3 nmol/µl). Average of two such titrations showed that 25.4 nmol of pCMB was consumed for 0.24 mg of the inactivated enzyme. The unmodified, native enzyme, treated in the same fashion recorded an average value of 25.2 nmol of pCMB for the same amount of protein. The active holoenzyme from K. fragilis is a dimeric protein containing 1 mol of bound NAD essential for catalytic activity. Unlike treatment with pCMB or exposure to heat (33Darrow R.A. Rodstrom R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Ray M. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), inactivation of epimerase by NBS does not stem from the dissociation of the dimeric holoenzyme or the loss of the bound NAD. A direct fluorimetric estimation of the enzyme bound NAD as described under “Materials and Methods,” for the native and NBS-modified epimerase clearly demonstrates that the modified enzyme retains more than 90% of the bound NAD as compared to the control enzyme. Large excess of NBS in the presence of strongly acidic conditions (pH 3–4) can cause scission of peptide bonds at tryptophan, tyrosine or histidine residues (30Ramachandran L.K. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 283-299Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7), reactivity of NBS is usually restricted to the oxidation of tryptophan residues. Identical bands obtained for the native and NBS-modified enzymes in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown) as well as identical elution volumes (5.5 ml, with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7) on a protein Pak HPLC column (7.8 × 300 mm) ruled out the possibility of peptide cleavage and subunit dissociation. Moreover, modification with NBS does not introduce a bulky group into the primary structure of the enzyme that might cause inactivation due to steric disturbances to the active tertiary structure. The intrinsic fluorescence of proteins due to aromatic residues serves as a sensitive index of environmental and conformational changes. A comparison of the fluorescence properties of the NBS-modified enzyme with those of the native and other modified states of the enzyme did not reflect any gross conformational change in the NBS-inactivated epimerase. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded after various treatments (described below), each of which led to a modified enzyme. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Curve 1 represents the native enzyme. NBS modification of epimerase was found to elicit a 40% depletion of the tryptophan fluorescence of the native enzyme without any change in the emission maximum (Curve 2). On the other hand, upon incubation with 3 m urea, a condition under which the enzyme is known to become inactive and lose tryptophan to coenzyme fluorescence energy transfer but retain the tightly bound coenzyme, 2S. Ray and A. Bhaduri, unpublished observation. a 15-nm red shift of the emission maximum was observed (Curve 3). Evidently, a large conformational change occurred in this state of epimerase which dramatically increased the exposure of tryptophan residues and also disturbed the critical relative orientation required to maintain the tryptophan to coenzyme fluorescence energy transfer. Further, upon complete unfolding of epimerase by treatment with 8 m urea, there was an additional 5-nm red shift of emission maximum accompanied by a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield of the tryptophan residues (Curve 4). On the basis of these observations we inferred that NBS modification of tryptophans only altered the microenvironment around these residues without affecting the overall structure of epimerase. The physical location of the reactive tryptophan residues on the enzyme surface was next investigated. Neither of the substrates, UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose, nor the powerful competitive inhibitor 5′-UMP could protect epimerase against inactivation by NBS (data not shown). Such protection had been earlier observed for yeast epimerase during modification studies with sulfydryl reagents (12Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and arginine-modifying reagents (9Mukherji S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the key tryptophans of epimerase were located outside the substrate binding region of the active site. The characteristic"
