https://openalex.org/W4291675384,"Racial/ethnic minorities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The effects of COVID-19 on the long-term mental health of minorities remains unclear. To evaluate differences in odds of screening positive for depression and anxiety among various racial and ethnic groups during the latter phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 691,473 participants nested within the prospective smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study in the United States (U.S.) and United Kingdom (U.K). from February 23, 2021 to June 9, 2021. In the U.S. ( n =57,187), compared to White participants, the multivariable odds ratios (ORs) for screening positive for depression were 1·16 (95% CI: 1·02 to 1·31) for Black, 1·23 (1·11 to 1·36) for Hispanic, and 1·15 (1·02 to 1·30) for Asian participants, and 1·34 (1·13 to 1·59) for participants reporting more than one race/other even after accounting for personal factors such as prior history of a mental health disorder, COVID-19 infection status, and surrounding lockdown stringency. Rates of screening positive for anxiety were comparable. In the U.K. ( n =643,286), racial/ethnic minorities had similarly elevated rates of positive screening for depression and anxiety. These disparities were not fully explained by changes in leisure time activities. Racial/ethnic minorities bore a disproportionate mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. These differences will need to be considered as health care systems transition from prioritizing infection control to mitigating long-term consequences."

In this study, green method of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production was employed using an extract from grapevine canes. The aim of the study was to contribute to the knowledge about biosynthesized AgNPs by focusing on elucidation of their antifungal efficiency based on their size and/or hypothesized synergy with bioactive substances from Vitis vinifera cane extract. The antifungal activity of AgNPs capped and stabilized with bioactive compounds was tested against the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida albicans . Two dispersions of nanoparticles with different morphology (characterized by SEM-in-STEM, DLS, UV-Vis, XRD, and AAS) were prepared by modification of reaction conditions suitable for economical production and their long-term stability monitored for six months was confirmed. The aims of the study included the comparison of the antifungal effect against suspension cells and biofilm of small monodisperse AgNPs with narrow size distribution and large polydisperse AgNPs. The hypothesis of synergistic interaction of biologically active molecules from V . vinifera extracts and AgNPs against both cell forms were tested. The interactions of all AgNPs dispersions with the cell surface and changes in cell morphology were imaged using SEM. All variants of AgNPs dispersions were found to be active against suspension and biofilm cells of C . albicans ; nevertheless, surprisingly, larger polydisperse AgNPs were found to be more effective. Synergistic action of nanoparticles with biologically active extract compounds was proven for biofilm cells (MBIC 80 20 mg/L of polydisperse AgNPs in extract), while isolated nanoparticles suspended in water were more active against suspension cells (MIC 20 mg/L of polydisperse AgNPs dispersed in water). Our results bring new insight into the economical production of AgNPs with defined characteristics, which were proven to target a specific mode of growth of significant pathogen C . albicans ."
https://openalex.org/W4291675335,"Recent clinical guidelines have emphasized non-opioid treatments in lieu of prescription opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, exempting cancer patients from these recommendations. In this study, we determine trends in opioid and non-opioid treatment among privately insured adults with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) or cancer. Using administrative claims data from IBM MarketScan Research Databases, we identified privately-insured adults who were continuously enrolled in insurance for at least one calendar year from 2012 to 2019. We identified individuals with CNCP diagnosis, defined as a diagnosis of arthritis, headache, low back pain, and/or neuropathic pain, and a individuals with cancer diagnosis in a calendar year. Outcomes included receipt of any opioid, non-opioid medication, or non-pharmacologic CNCP therapy and opioid prescribing volume, MME-per-day, and days' supply. Estimates were regression-adjusted for age, sex, and region. Between 2012 and 2019, the proportion of patients who received any opioid decreased across both groups (CNCP: 49.7 to 30.5%, p<0.01; cancer: 86.0 to 78.7%, p<0.01). Non-opioid pain medication receipt remained steady for individuals with CNCP (66.7 to 66.4%, p<0.01) and increased for individuals with cancer (74.4 to 78.8%, p<0.01), while non-pharmacologic therapy use rose among individuals with CNCP (62.4 to 66.1%, p<0.01). Among those prescribed opioids, there was a decrease in the receipt of at least one prescription with >90 MME/day (CNCP: 13.9% in 2012 to 4.9% in 2019, p<0.01; Cancer: 26.2% to 7.6%, p<0.01); >7 days of supply (CNCP: 56.3% to 30.7%, p <0.01; Cancer: 47.5% to 22.7%, p<0.01), the mean number of opioid prescriptions (CNCP: 5.2 to 3.9, p<0.01; Cancer: 4.0 to 2.7, p<0.01) and mean MME/day (CNCP: 49.9 to 38.0, p<0.01; Cancer: 62.4 to 44.7, p<0.01). Overall, from 2012-2019, opioid prescribing declined for CNCP and cancer, with larger reductions for patients with CNCP. For both groups, reductions in prescribed opioids outpaced increases in non-opioid alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W4291022708,"Neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have shown a great preventative/therapeutic potential. Here, we report a rapid and efficient strategy for the development and design of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing humanized nanobody constructs with sub-nanomolar affinities and nanomolar potencies. CryoEM-based structural analysis of the nanobodies in complex with spike revealed two distinct binding modes. The most potent nanobody, RBD-1-2G(NCATS-BL8125), tolerates the N501Y RBD mutation and remains capable of neutralizing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a structural basis for understanding the neutralization process of nanobodies exclusively focused on the spike-ACE2 interface with and without the N501Y mutation on RBD. A primary human airway air-lung interface (ALI) ex vivo model showed that RBD-1-2G-Fc antibody treatment was effective at reducing viral burden following WA1 and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, this presented strategy will serve as a tool to mitigate the threat of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4291023086,"Urban heat islands are major factors hindering the quality of present-day urban habitats. The ongoing acceleration of the worldwide urbanization process is leading to an exacerbation of the urban heat island effect; however, urban forestry can mitigate it. For a sustainable urban development, it is particularly important to evaluate the dual effect of both factors on the urban heat island phenomenon. In this study, we focused on Zhengzhou City (China), at the center of the Central Plains Forest City Cluster. The spatial and temporal evolutions of the local urban heat island and vegetation coverage were measured from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing images taken between 2006-2020 and the effects of urban construction and urban forestry on the urban heat island effect were evaluated. The results showed that, in the past 15 years, the high-temperature zone in the urban area of Zhengzhou City has gradually spread from its center to surrounding areas. Within the same period, the whole urban heat island has deteriorated and gradually improved: its area increased by 138.72 km2 between 2006-2014 and decreased by 135.66 km2 between 2014-2020. Notably, the development of vegetation coverage occurred consistently with the improvement of the heat island. A quantitative analysis of the relationship between urban construction, the urban forest, and the urban heat island has shown that factors like population density (representing urban construction), urban planning, and vegetation cover (representing the urban forest) all have an impact on the urban heat island. Based on the dynamic changes of the urban heat island in the urban area of Zhengzhou City between 2006-2020, we conclude that urban forest construction strategies are beginning to bear fruit. Overall, the findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for future urban construction and urban forest construction plans; moreover, they can support landscape pattern optimization and urban heat island mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W4291675780,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a key role in regulating soil quality functions and ecosystem services. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of deforestation and subsequent land-use change on the SOC and total nitrogen (TN) concentration, quality, and lability under otherwise similar soil and environmental conditions. Geo-referenced composite soils (0 to 30 cm depth at 7.5 cm interval) sampled from agriculture, bioenergy plantations ( Miscanthus x giganteus ), Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and wetland were analyzed for SOC, TN, active C (AC), humic- and fulvic acid (HA and FA), non-humic C (NH), E 4 : E 6 ratio, humification indices (HI, HR, and DH), and carbon and nitrogen management indices (CPI, NPI, and CMI), compared to soils under protected forest as a control. Results showed that the CRP had the highest depth distribution and profile-wise stocks of SOC, TN, AC, and FA with respect to the lowest in agriculture upon conversion of forest. Moreover, the SOC and TN contents were significantly stratified in the CRP when compared to agriculture. While agriculture had the wider HA: FA ratios with highest HI and HR but lowest DH values, the CRP, in contrast, had the narrow HA: FA ratios with lowest HI but highest DH values, when compared to the forest. Spectral analyses have shown lower E 4 : E 6 ratios under the forest when compared to both agriculture and the CRP; however, the later had significantly higher E 4 : E 6 ratios than that of agriculture. The CPI, as measures of SOC accumulation or depletion, significantly decreased by 16% under agriculture but increased by 12% under the CRP. While the CMI, as measures of SOC accumulation or depletion and lability, with higher values under the CRP suggested a proportionally more labile SOC accumulation, in contrast, the smaller values under agriculture indicated a greater depletion of labile SOC over time. Moreover, the CRP may have favored a more labile SOC accumulation with higher proportions of aliphatic C compounds, whereas agriculture may have a SOC with high proportions of non-labile aromatic C compounds. Principal components analysis clearly separated and/or discriminated the land-use impacts on soil carbon pools and TN. Likewise, redundancy analysis of the relationship between measured soil parameters and land-use validated that the TOC, TN, FA, humin, and CPI were significantly impacted due to synergism among soil properties as positively influenced by the CRP upon conversion of agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W4291676653,"A Gram-staining-negative, aerobic bacterium, designated strain PT3T was isolated from laboratory-reared larvae of the Japanese sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequences revealed that PT3T was closely related to Amphritea ceti RA1T (= KCTC 42154T = NBRC 110551T) and Amphritea spongicola MEBiC05461T (= KCCM 42943T = JCM 16668T) both with 98.3% sequence similarity, however, average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (in silico DDH) values among these three strains were below 95% and 70%, respectively, confirming the novelty of PT3T. Furthermore, the average amino acid identity (AAI) values of PT3T against other Amphritea species were on the reported genus delineation boundary (64-67%). Multilocus sequence analysis using four protein-coding genes (recA, mreB, rpoA, and topA) further demonstrated that PT3T, Amphritea ceti and Amphritea spongicola formed a monophyletic clade clearly separate from other members of the genus Amphritea. Three strains (PT3T, A. ceti KCTC 42154T and A. spongicola JCM 16668T) also showed higher similarities in their core genomes compared to those of the other Amphritea spp. Based on the genome-based taxonomic approach, Aliamphritea gen. nov. was proposed together with the reclassification of the genus Amphritea and Aliamphritea ceti comb. nov. (type strain RA1T = KCTC 42154T = NBRC 110551T), Aliamphritea spongicola comb. nov. (type strain MEBiC05461T = KCCM 42943T = JCM 16668T), and Aliamphritea hakodatensis sp. nov. (type strain PT3T = JCM 34607T = KCTC 82591T) were suggested."
https://openalex.org/W4291283439,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, analyses on global data have not reached unanimous consensus on whether warmer and humid weather curbs the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conjectured that this lack of consensus is due to the discrepancy between global environmental data such as temperature and humidity being collected outdoors, while most infections have been reported to occur indoors, where conditions can be different. Thus, we have methodologically investigated the effect of temperature and relative humidity on the spread of expired respiratory droplets from the mouth, which are assumed to be the main cause of most short-range infections. Calculating the trajectory of individual droplets using an experimentally validated evaporation model, the final height and distance of the evaporated droplets is obtained, and then correlated with global COVID-19 spread. Increase in indoor humidity is associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread, while temperature has no statistically significant effect."
https://openalex.org/W4291286501,"The effects of mental fatigue have been studied in relation to specific percentages of maximal aerobic or anaerobic efforts, maximal voluntary contractions or the performance of sport specific skills. However, its effects on tremor, dexterity and force steadiness have been only marginally explored. The present work aimed at filling this gap. In twenty-nine young individuals, measurement of postural, kinetic and isometric tremor, pinch force steadiness and finger and hand dexterity were performed before and after either 100 min of mental fatigue or control tasks. During the interventions blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate and perceived effort in continuing the task were recorded every 10 minutes. Tremor was analysed in both time (standard deviation) and frequency domain (position, amplitude and area of the dominant peak) of the acceleration signal. Finger dexterity was assessed by Purdue pegboard test and hand dexterity in terms of contact time in a buzz wire exercise. Force steadiness was quantified as coefficient of variation of the force signal. Postural, kinetic and isometric tremors, force steadiness and dexterity were not affected. Higher oxygen saturation values and higher variability of heart rate and blood pressure were found in the intervention group during the mental fatigue protocol (p < .001). The results provide no evidence that mental fatigue affects the neuromuscular parameters that influence postural, kinetic or isometric tremor, force steadiness and dexterity when measured in single-task conditions. Increased variability in heart rate may suggest that the volunteers in the intervention group altered their alert/stress state. Therefore, it is possible that the alterations that are commonly observed during mental fatigue, and that could have affected tremor, steadiness and dexterity only last for the duration of the cognitive task and are not detectable anymore soon after the mental task is terminated."
https://openalex.org/W4291674503,"The preservative effect of the addition of different essential oils (copaiba and oregano) on meat quality parameters and sensorial acceptability was analyzed for fresh ground beef patties over 21 days of display. Five treatments were assessed: control (CON) without antioxidants; addition of the synthetic additive butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT); addition 0.05% of copaiba essential oil (CEO); 0.05% of oregano essential oil (OEO); or blend of 0.025% copaiba and 0.025% oregano essential oils (BEO). The lowest cooking losses and greatest tenderness (P &lt;0.05) were reached with the blend (BEO). The inclusion of oregano essential oil presented a more intense chroma (P &lt;0.05), with the best color retained during display. Oregano essential oil (OEO) and the blend (BEO) showed the highest antioxidant activity, reducing the lipid oxidation of beef patties during display (P &lt; 0.05). Consumers preferred the odor of beef patties with essential oils (OEO and BEO) to the CON; however, the flavor from OEO had the lowest acceptability and the worst scores for overall acceptability (P &lt; 0.05). Patties with the blend addition (BEO) were the best scored on overall acceptability assessments. In conclusion, the oregano and copaiba essential oils blend had a good preservative effect on fresh beef patties during display and increased sensory acceptability of the product, thus being a possible alternative for replacing synthetic compounds in processed foods."
https://openalex.org/W4291283477,"Preprints have been widely cited during the COVID-19 pandemics, even in the major medical journals. However, since subsequent publication of preprint is not always mentioned in preprint repositories, some may be inappropriately cited or quoted. Our objectives were to assess the reliability of preprint citations in articles on COVID-19, to the rate of publication of preprints cited in these articles and to compare, if relevant, the content of the preprints to their published version.Articles published on COVID in 2020 in the BMJ, The Lancet, the JAMA and the NEJM were manually screened to identify all articles citing at least one preprint from medRxiv. We searched PubMed, Google and Google Scholar to assess if the preprint had been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and when. Published articles were screened to assess if the title, data or conclusions were identical to the preprint version.Among the 205 research articles on COVID published by the four major medical journals in 2020, 60 (29.3%) cited at least one medRxiv preprint. Among the 182 preprints cited, 124 were published in a peer-reviewed journal, with 51 (41.1%) before the citing article was published online and 73 (58.9%) later. There were differences in the title, the data or the conclusion between the preprint cited and the published version for nearly half of them. MedRxiv did not mentioned the publication for 53 (42.7%) of preprints.More than a quarter of preprints citations were inappropriate since preprints were in fact already published at the time of publication of the citing article, often with a different content. Authors and editors should check the accuracy of the citations and of the quotations of preprints before publishing manuscripts that cite them."
https://openalex.org/W4291285639,"Biological systems are frequently analyzed by means of mechanistic mathematical models. In order to infer model parameters and provide a useful model that can be employed for systems understanding and hypothesis testing, the model is often calibrated on quantitative, time-resolved data. To do so, it is typically important to compare experimental measurements over broad time ranges and various experimental conditions, e.g. perturbations of the biological system. However, most of the established experimental techniques such as Western blot, or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction only provide measurements on a relative scale, since different sample volumes, experimental adjustments or varying development times of a gel lead to systematic shifts in the data. In turn, the number of measurements corresponding to the same scale enabling comparability is limited. Here, we present a new flexible method to align measurement data that obeys different scaling factors and compare it to existing normalization approaches. We propose an alignment model to estimate these scaling factors and provide the possibility to adapt this model depending on the measurement technique of interest. In addition, an error model can be specified to adequately weight the different data points and obtain scaling-model based confidence intervals of the finally scaled data points. Our approach is applicable to all sorts of relative measurements and does not need a particular experimental condition that has been measured over all available scales. An implementation of the method is provided with the R package blotIt including refined ways of visualization."
https://openalex.org/W4291286129,"Objectives To assess total antibody levels against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) spike protein up to 12 months after Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) infection in non-vaccinated individuals and the possible predictors of antibody persistence. Methods This is the first part of a prospective multi-centre cohort study. Participants The study included SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive and negative participants in South-Eastern Norway from February to December 2020. Possible predictors of SARS-CoV-2 total antibody persistence was assessed. The SARS-CoV-2 total antibody levels against spike protein were measured three to five months after PCR in 391 PCR-positive and 703 PCR-negative participants; 212 PCR-positive participants were included in follow-up measurements at 10 to 12 months. The participants completed a questionnaire including information about symptoms, comorbidities, allergies, body mass index (BMI), and hospitalisation. Primary outcome The SARS-CoV-2 total antibody levels against spike protein three to five and 10 to 12 months after PCR positive tests. Results SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies against spike protein were present in 366 (94%) non-vaccinated PCR-positive participants after three to five months, compared with nine (1%) PCR-negative participants. After 10 to 12 months, antibodies were present in 204 (96%) non-vaccinated PCR-positive participants. Of the PCR-positive participants, 369 (94%) were not hospitalised. The mean age of the PCR-positive participants was 48 years (SD 15, range 20–85) and 50% of them were male. BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 was positively associated with decreased antibody levels (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.42). Participants with higher age and self-reported initial fever with chills or sweating were less likely to have decreased antibody levels (age: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99; fever: OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75). Conclusion Our results indicate that the level of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies against spike protein persists for the vast majority of non-vaccinated PCR-positive persons at least 10 to 12 months after mild COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4291674123,"Background Venous phlebotomy performed by trained personnel is critical for patient diagnosis and monitoring of chronic disease, but has limitations in resource-constrained settings, and represents an infection control challenge during outbreaks. Self-collection devices have the potential to shift phlebotomy closer to the point of care, supporting telemedicine strategies and virtual clinical trials. Here we assess a capillary blood micro-sampling device, the Tasso Serum Separator Tube (SST), for measuring blood protein levels in healthy subjects and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods 57 healthy controls and 56 participants with mild/moderate COVID-19 were recruited at two U.S. military healthcare facilities. Healthy controls donated Tasso SST capillary serum, venous plasma and venous serum samples at multiple time points, while COVID-19 patients donated a single Tasso SST serum sample at enrolment. Concentrations of 17 protein inflammatory biomarkers were measured in all biospecimens by Ella multi-analyte immune-assay. Results Tasso SST serum protein measurements in healthy control subjects were highly reproducible, but their agreements with matched venous samples varied. Most of the selected proteins, including CRP, Ferritin, IL-6 and PCT, were well-correlated between Tasso SST and venous serum with little sample type bias, but concentrations of D-dimer, IL-1B and IL-1Ra were not. Self-collection at home with delayed sample processing was associated with significant concentrations differences for several analytes compared to supervised, in-clinic collection with rapid processing. Finally, Tasso SST serum protein concentrations were significantly elevated in in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Conclusions Self-collection of capillary blood with micro-sampling devices provides an attractive alternative to routine phlebotomy. However, concentrations of certain analytes may differ significantly from those in venous samples, and factors including user proficiency, temperature control and time lags between specimen collection and processing need to be considered for their effect on sample quality and reproducibility."

A volunteer sample of 675 U.S. participants completed a KAP questionnaire after electronic distribution.Participants had good knowledge and practices, but poor attitudes. Predictors of higher knowledge scores included white ethnicity, non-essential worker status, and healthcare worker status. Correlates with positive attitude included male gender, residence in California, higher annual income, and not utilizing radio or social media. Higher practice scores were predicted by female gender, non-essential and healthcare worker status, and information source.Differences in KAP were found among demographic variables.

https://openalex.org/W4291709193,"Background Adverse events following immunization (AEFI) against SARS-CoV-2 are common as reported by clinical trials and contemporary evidence. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the local and systemic adverse events following vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BBIBP-CorV among the healthcare professionals (HCPs) of Nepal. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 606 vaccinated HCPs of Kathmandu, Nepal. Data was collected from June 15 to 30, 2021 using a self-administered online survey tool. Multiple binary logistic regression models were used to predict the adverse events according to the vaccine types and doses after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results The mean (SD) age of the participants was 35.6 (13.2) years and 52% of them were female. Almost 59% of participants were vaccinated with two doses and around 54% of total of them took the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. At least one local and systemic adverse event was reported by 54% and 62% of participants after the first dose and 37% and 49% after the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and by 37% and 43% after the first dose and 42% and 36% after the second dose of BBIBP-CorV vaccine respectively. Injection site pain, swelling and tenderness at the injection site were the most frequently reported local AEFI while, fatigue, headache, fever and myalgia were the most frequently reported systemic AEFI. The logistic model demonstrated that the risk of both local and systemic adverse events was higher among the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients compared to the BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Almost 10% of individuals reported a post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection and most of them occurred after taking the first dose of vaccine. Conclusions Recipients of both the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BBIBP-CorV vaccine among the HCPs of Nepal reported only mild and constitutional symptoms including injection site pain and tenderness, headache, fever, fatigue, etc. after vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4291710227,"Determining the acoustic ecology of extinct or rare species is challenging due to the inability to record their acoustic signals or hearing thresholds. Katydids and their relatives (Orthoptera: Ensifera) offer a model for inferring acoustic ecology of extinct and rare species, due to allometric parameters of their sound production organs. Here, the bioacoustics of the orthopteran Prophalangopsis obscura are investigated. This species is one of only eight remaining members of an ancient family with over 90 extinct species that dominated the acoustic landscape of the Jurassic. The species is known from only a single confirmed specimen-the 150-year-old holotype material housed at the London Natural History Museum. Using Laser-Doppler Vibrometry, 3D surface scanning microscopy, and known scaling relationships, it is shown that P. obscura produces a pure-tone song at a frequency of ~4.7 kHz. This frequency range is distinct but comparable to the calls of Jurassic relatives, suggesting a limitation of early acoustic signals in insects to sonic frequencies (<20 kHz). The acoustic ecology and importance of this species in understanding ensiferan evolution, is discussed."

Inferring which newspaper published a given article, based only on the frequencies with which it uses different phrases, leads to a conditional probability distribution whose analysis lets us automatically map newspapers and phrases into a bias space. By analyzing roughly a million articles from roughly a hundred newspapers for bias in dozens of news topics, our method maps newspapers into a two-dimensional bias landscape that agrees well with previous bias classifications based on human judgement. One dimension can be interpreted as traditional left-right bias, the other as establishment bias. This means that although news bias is inherently political, its measurement need not be."
https://openalex.org/W4291284363,"Charadriiformes represent one of the largest orders of birds; members of this order are diverse in morphology, behavior and reproduction, making them an excellent model for studying evolution. It is accepted that the avian putative ancestral karyotype, with 2n = 80, remains conserved for about 100 million years. So far, only a few species of Charadriiformes have been studied using molecular cytogenetics. Here, we performed chromosome painting on metphase chromosomes of two species of Charadriidae, Charadrius collaris and Vanellus chilensis, with whole chromosome paint probes from Burhinus oedicnemus. Charadrius collaris has a diploid number of 76, with both sex chromosomes being submetacentric. In V. chilensi a diploid number of 78 was identified, and the Z chromosome is submetacentric. Chromosome painting suggests that chromosome conservation is a characteristic common to the family Charadriidae. The results allowed a comparative analysis between the three suborders of Charadriiformes and the order Gruiformes using chromosome rearrangements to understand phylogenetic relationships between species and karyotypic evolution. However, the comparative analysis between the Charadriiformes suborders so far has not revealed any shared rearrangements, indicating that each suborder follows an independent evolutionary path, as previously proposed. Likewise, although the orders Charadriiformes and Gruiformes are placed on sister branches, they do not share any signature chromosomal rearrangements."

In this work, the proteins of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated and non-stimulated hemocytes of Malaysian Tachypleus gigas were profiled using LC-MS/MS. A total of 154 proteins were identified in both types of samples. Additionally, seventy-seven proteins were commonly found in both conditions, while 52 and 25 proteins were uniquely found in the LPS-stimulated and non-stimulated hemocytes, respectively. ATP-dependent energy-generating proteins such as actins and BLTX actin-related proteins were detected in both stimulated and non-stimulated T. gigas hemocytes, but more of such proteins were found in the former type. Proteins such as tachylectin-2, coagulogen, c-reactive proteins, histones, hemocyanin, and DNA polymerase, which play key roles in the organism's innate immunity, were differentially expressed in the hemocytes following LPS challenge. In conclusion, the proteins identified in the hemolymph of T. gigas are vital for the organism's molecular functions, biological processes, and activation of innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4291676251,"As a critical aspect of language, vocal learning is extremely rare in animals, having only been described in a few distantly related species. New evidence, however, extends vocal learning/innovation to the primate order, with zoo-housed chimpanzees and orangutans producing novel vocal signals to attract the attention of familiar human caregivers. If the ability to produce novel vocalizations as a means of navigating evolutionarily novel circumstances spans the Hominidae family, then we can expect to find evidence for it in the family’s third genus, Gorilla . To explore this possibility, we conduct an experiment with eight gorillas from Zoo Atlanta to examine whether they use species-atypical vocalizations to get the attention of humans across three different conditions: just a human, just food, or a human holding food. Additionally, we survey gorilla keepers from other AZA-member zoos to compile a list of common attention-getting signals used by the gorillas in their care. Our experiment results indicated that Zoo Atlanta gorillas vocalized most often during the human-food condition, with the most frequently used vocal signal being a species-atypical sound somewhere between a sneeze and a cough (n = 28). This previously undescribed sound is acoustically different from other calls commonly produced during feeding (i.e., single grunts and food-associated calls). Our survey and analyses of recordings from other zoos confirmed that this novel attention-getting sound is not unique to Zoo Atlanta, although further work should be done to better determine the extent and patterns of transmission and/or potential independent innovation of this sound across captive gorilla populations. These findings represent one of the few pieces of evidence of spontaneous novel vocal production in non-enculturated individuals of this species, supporting the inclusion of great apes as moderate vocal learners and perhaps demonstrating an evolutionary function to a flexible vocal repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W4291676350,"Leprosy neuropathy is the most common peripheral neuropathy of infectious etiology worldwide; it is characterized as asymmetric and focal multiple mononeuropathy. Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test is a simple method to assess sensory nerve function.In this prospective cohort study, a dermatologist carried out hands and feet tactile sensation test with SWM in 107 multibacillary leprosy patients at diagnosis and in 76 patients at the end of treatment from 2016 to 2019. At diagnosis, 81/107 (75.7%) patients had some degree of functional disability, and 46 (43%) of them had altered SWM-test in the hands and 94 (87.9%) of them in the feet. After one year of multibacillary multidrug therapy, the disability decreasing to 44/76 patients (57.9%) and decreasing of the percentual of patients with altered SWM-test to 18% for the hands, and to 28.7% for the feet. At the end of treatment, the number of SMW-test points presented improvement in the hands of 22 (28.9%) patients, and in the feet of 47 (61.8%). In the hands, by SWM-test, only the radial nerve point demonstrated a significant asymmetry, while in the feet, the difference between the sum of altered SWM-test points showed significant asymmetry between both sides, highlighting the tibial nerve for the establishment of asymmetric leprosy neuropathy. In Spearman's correlation analysis, a positive correlation with statistical significance was observed between the number of hands and feet SWM altered points at diagnosis and the degree of disability at diagnosis (0.69) and at the end of the treatment (0.80).The patterns of hands and feet tactile sensation at diagnosis and their consequent modifications with the anti-leprosy drugs define the bacterial etiology of neuropathy, an important tool for the clinical diagnosis and follow up of the disease, highlighting the tibial nerve findings, the most affected nerve among leprosy patients by SWM-test, with significant asymmetry and focality impairments."
https://openalex.org/W4291677591,"The post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome is defined as the persistence of symptoms after viral clearance and the emergence of new symptoms after a few months following recovery from COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome and the risk factors that contribute to its development.This study was conducted prospectively in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), located in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. The patients were followed up for three months.The post-COVID status of 300 patients admitted to the COVID emergency of TUTH was studied. The mean age of the patients was 46.6±15.7 years, and the proportion of male (56%) was slightly higher than female (44%). Most of the patients (81.7%) had fever on their presentation to the emergency which was followed by fatigue (81.3%) and cough (78.3%). During the post-COVID phase, fatigue was the most common persistent symptom, with 34% experiencing fatigue after 60 days and 28.3% even after 90 days from the onset of symptoms. Univariate logistic regression showed sore throat (OR 4.6; 95% CI (2.8-7.6)), rhinitis (OR 3.6; 95% CI (2.1-5.9)), fatigue (OR 3.7; 95% CI (1.8-7.6)), diarrhea (OR 4.1; 95% CI (2.4-6.9)), anosmia (OR 6.7; 95% CI (3.9-11.3)), ageusia (OR 7.8; 95% CI (4.5-13.4)) and shortness of breath (OR 14.9; 95% CI (1.8-119.6)) at admission were all predictors of post-COVID syndrome after three months.Even after recovering from COVID-19, people with COVID-19 may develop symptoms. As a result, COVID-19's long-term consequences should not be neglected, as they may lead to increased morbidity among patients, consumption of financial resources, and added burden on the health system."
https://openalex.org/W4291710062,"Background HIV-focused organizations, care providers and research programs often hire Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in their efforts to reach highly affected communities. Due to their unique social position within and outside of organizations, Black GBMSM are ideally situated to contribute to HIV care and prevention programming targeting their own communities, but may also be at risk for stress and burnout in these settings. Despite this critical role for Black GBMSM in efforts to end the epidemic, little is known about subjective experiences of Black GBMSM who work in the HIV field. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with 19 Black GBMSM who were identified as key informants. All were working in community-based organizations, clinical or academic settings in the area of HIV prevention and treatment in Atlanta, Georgia. We used a thematic analysis approach to identify salient themes with respect to the workplace experiences of Black GBMSM as well as the role of their identities in their work in the field. Results Participants discussed: (1) Shared experiences and growth; (2) Work-related stressors; (3) Worker burnout; and (4) Commitment to continue working in the HIV field. On the whole, Black GBMSM derived meaning from their work, and found their intersectional identities to be a strength in fulfilling job duties. At the same time, Black GBMSM described multiple stresses faced as they balanced their personal and professional connections to this work, while also dealing with their own challenges related to discrimination, socioeconomic status, and health. Participants repeatedly described sacrificing their own well-being for the greater good of their communities, highlighting contributors to burnout within and outside of the workplace. Conclusions Our participants derived meaning from their work in the HIV field and were affirmed by professional interactions with other Black GBMSM. At the same time, they also faced work-related and other psychosocial stressors that predisposed them to frustration and burnout. To promote workplace equity and wellness for Black GBMSM, we share recommendations for HIV-focused organizations that employ and serve men in this demographic."
https://openalex.org/W4290989516,"Solving complex problems, from biodiversity conservation to reducing inequality, requires large scale collective action among diverse stakeholders to achieve a common goal. Research relevant to meeting this challenge must model the interaction of stakeholders with diverse cognitive capabilities and the complexity of the problem faced by stakeholders to predict the success of collective action in various contexts. Here, we build a model from first principles of cognitive abilities, diversity, and socio-environmental complexity to identify the sets of conditions under which groups most effectively engage in collective action to solve governance problems. We then fit the model to small groups, U.S. states, and countries. Our model illustrates the fundamental importance of understanding the interaction between cognitive abilities, diversity, and the complexity of socio-environmental challenges faced by stakeholders today. Our results shed light on the ability of groups to solve complex problems and open new avenues of research into the interrelationship between cognition, institutions, and the environments in which they co-evolve."
https://openalex.org/W4291283202,"The emotion expressions of social robots are some of the most important developments in recent studies on human–robot interactions (HRIs). Several research studies have been conducted to assess effective factors to improve the quality of emotion expression of the robots. In this study, we examined the effects of a robot’s vertical oscillation and transition on the quality of its emotion expression, where the former indicates the periodic up/down movement of the body of the robot, while the latter indicates a one-time up or down movement. Short-term and long-term emotion expressions of the robot were studied independently for the four basic emotions described in the circumplex model of emotions: joy, anger, sadness, and relief. We designed an experiment with an adequate statistical power and minimum sample size of human subjects based on a priori power analysis. Human subjects were asked to evaluate the robot’s emotion expressions by watching its video with/without vertical movement. The results of the experiment showed that for the long-term emotions, the speed of vertical oscillation corresponded to the degree of arousal of the emotion expression as noted in the circumplex model; this indicated that fast oscillations improved the emotion expression with a higher degree of arousal, such as joy and anger, while slow or no oscillations were more suited to emotions with a lower degree of arousal, such as sadness and relief. For the short-term emotions, the direction of the vertical transition corresponded to the degree of valence for most of the expressed emotions, while the speed of vertical oscillation reflected the degree of arousal. The findings of this study can be adopted in the development of conversational robots to enhance their emotion expression."
https://openalex.org/W4291284111,"Despite recent advances in perinatal medicine, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common complication of preterm birth. Inflammation, the main cause for BPD, results in arrested alveolarization. All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), the active metabolite of Vitamin A, facilitates recovery from hyperoxia induced cell damage. The mechanisms involved in this response, and the genes activated, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of action of ATRA in human lung epithelial cells exposed to hyperoxia. We hypothesized that ATRA reduces hyperoxia-induced inflammatory responses in A549 alveolar epithelial cells.A549 cells were exposed to hyperoxia with or without treatment with ATRA, followed by RNA-seq analysis.Transcriptomic analysis of A549 cells revealed ~2,000 differentially expressed genes with a higher than 2-fold change. Treatment of cells with ATRA alleviated some of the hyperoxia-induced changes, including Wnt signaling, cell adhesion and cytochrome P450 genes, partially through NF-κB signaling.Our findings support the idea that ATRA supplementation may decrease hyperoxia-induced disruption of the neonatal respiratory epithelium and alleviate development of BPD."
https://openalex.org/W4291284677,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are increasing at an alarming rate among the South African population. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of modifiable CVD risk factors for fatal and non-fatal events to inform cardiovascular health promotion practices in the South African public health system.Data was collected from individuals participating in the South African leg of a multi-national prospective cohort study. Binary logistic regression was applied to estimate odds of total, non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular events.Binary logistic regression analyses identified age as a predictor of non-fatal and fatal CV events, with ORs of 1.87 to 3.21, respectively. Hypertension increased the odd of suffering a non-fatal CV event by almost two and a half (OR = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.26, 4.85). Moreover, being physically active reduced the odd of non-fatal CVD events by 38% (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.46, 0.83 for 1 Standard deviation increase of the weighted physical activity index score (WPA)). On the one hand, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was associated with a higher fatal cardiovascular disease risk OR = 2.45 (95% CI = 1.36, 4.42) for a standard deviation increase.Elevated blood pressure, GGT, and physical activity have significant prognostic values for fatal or non-fatal CV events. These findings emphasise the importance of highlighting hypertension and physical activity when planning cardiovascular health education and intervention programmes for this population, with attention to the monitoring of GGT."
https://openalex.org/W4291285552,"Problematic video gaming (PVG) and problematic shopping (PS) are addictive behaviors prevalent in adolescents, characterized by positive and negative reinforcement, and associated with psychosocial impairment. This study examined how PS and PVG relate in adolescents. It also examined how PS interacts with PVG in relation to health/functioning measures. Survey data from 3,657 Connecticut high-school students were evaluated. Chi-square analyses and logistic regression models were used to assess relationships between PS and measures of PVG. Interaction analyses measured effects of PS on relationships between PVG and health/functioning measures. Relative to adolescents without PS, those with PS had 8.79-fold higher odds of exhibiting PVG and were more likely to endorse gaming to relieve anxiety and impairment due to gaming. Interaction analyses revealed that in adolescents with PS, the relationships between PVG and aggressive behaviors, including fighting, serious fighting leading to physical injury, and weapon-carrying, were stronger than in adolescents without PS. PS strongly relates to PVG, and among youth reporting PS, there are stronger associations between PVG and aggressive behaviors. Prevention efforts for adolescents should consider the co-occurrence of PS and PVG. PS and PVG may be linked by negative reinforcement and propensities for aggressive and addictive behaviors, suggesting that further research should explore possible interventions targeting stress management and maladaptive coping."
https://openalex.org/W4291674536,"Making use of a state space framework, we present a stochastic generalization of the SIRD model, where the mortality, infection, and underreporting rates change over time. A new format to the errors in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead compartments is also presented, that permits reinfection. The estimated trajectories and (out-of-sample) forecasts of all these variables are presented with their confidence intervals. The model only uses as inputs the number of reported cases and deaths, and was applied for the UK from April, 2020 to Sep, 2021 (daily data). The estimated infection rate has shown a trajectory in waves very compatible with the emergence of new variants and adopted social measures. The estimated mortality rate has shown a significant descendant behaviour in 2021, which we attribute to the vaccination program, and the estimated underreporting rate has been considerably volatile, with a downward tendency, implying that, on average, more people are testing than in the beginning of the pandemic. The evolution of the proportions of the population divided into susceptible, infected, recovered and dead groups are also shown with their confidence intervals and forecast, along with an estimation of the amount of reinfection that, according to our model, has become quite significant in 2021. Finally, the estimated trajectory of the effective reproduction rate has proven to be very compatible with the real number of cases and deaths. Its forecasts with confident intervals are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W4291675488,"Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, elicits a homeostatic mechanism known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR reprograms gene expression to promote adaptation to chronic ER stress. The UPR comprises an acute phase involving inhibition of bulk protein synthesis and a chronic phase of transcriptional induction coupled with the partial recovery of protein synthesis. However, the role of transcriptional regulation in the acute phase of the UPR is not well understood. Here we analyzed the fate of newly synthesized mRNA encoding the protective and homeostatic transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) during this acute phase. We have previously shown that global translational repression induced by the acute UPR was characterized by decreased translation and increased stability of XBP1 mRNA. We demonstrate here that this stabilization is independent of new transcription. In contrast, we show XBP1 mRNA newly synthesized during the acute phase accumulates with long poly(A) tails and escapes translational repression. Inhibition of newly synthesized RNA polyadenylation during the acute phase decreased cell survival with no effect in unstressed cells. Furthermore, during the chronic phase of the UPR, levels of XBP1 mRNA with long poly(A) tails decreased in a manner consistent with co-translational deadenylation. Finally, additional pro-survival, transcriptionally-induced mRNAs show similar regulation, supporting the broad significance of the pre-steady state UPR in translational control during ER stress. We conclude that the biphasic regulation of poly(A) tail length during the UPR represents a previously unrecognized pro-survival mechanism of mammalian gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4291676261,"Preventing mosquito-borne infectious diseases requires that vector mosquitoes are monitored and controlled. Targeting immature mosquitoes (eggs, larvae, and pupae), which have less mobility than adults, is an effective management approach. However, conducting these surveys is often difficult due to the limitations of morphological classification and survey costs. The application of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis can solve these issues because it allows easy estimation of species distribution and morphology-independent species identification. Although a few previous studies have reported mosquito eDNA detection, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the dynamics related to the persistence of immature mosquito eDNA. We used Culex pipiens pallens , a vector of West Nile fever, as a model species. First, we developed a species-specific detection assay and confirmed its specificity using in silico and in vitro tests. Next, we conducted laboratory experiments using breeding tanks. Water samples were collected at each developmental stage. In addition, water samples were collected daily until the seventh day after emergence from the pupae. We quantified eDNA using real-time PCR with the developed assay to investigate the dynamics of mosquito eDNA. The specificity of the developed assay was confirmed by in silico and in vitro tests. Mosquito eDNA was detected at all developmental stages and detected up to seven days after emergence of pupae. In particular, high concentrations of eDNA were detected immediately after hatching from eggs and after emergence from pupae. Highly frequent positive eDNA signals were continuously detected between egg hatching and pupa hatching. Mosquito eDNA was detected immediately after the eggs were introduced, and eDNA-positive detections continued until pupae emergence, suggesting that eDNA analysis is useful for monitoring mosquito larvae. In the future, monitoring immature mosquitoes using eDNA analysis will contribute to prevent mosquito-borne infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4291708151,"Recent studies have demonstrated that particulate matter (PM) can induce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses that are related to the development or exacerbation of several inflammatory dermatoses. However, the effect of PM on acne vulgaris has yet to be determined. In this study, we induced acne-like inflammation in HEKn cells with several concentrations of Cutibacterium acnes (C . acnes) and Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PGN) to investigate whether PM exposure exacerbates acne-like inflammation and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. To confirm whether PM increases the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in C . acnes- or PGN-treated HEKn cells, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blot assays. The results demonstrated that C . acnes , PGN, and PM induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in a time- and dose-dependent manner at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Moreover, PM further increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, COX2, TLR4, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB in C . acnes- and PGN-treated HEKn cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that PM may exacerbate acne symptoms by increasing the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W4291708252,"Background The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems in many countries, and the rapid spread of the virus and the acute course of the disease resulted in a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We studied preferences of the public in the Netherlands regarding the allocation of ICU beds during a health crisis. Methods We distributed a cross-sectional online survey at the end of March 2020 to a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. We collected preferences regarding the allocation of ICU beds, both in terms of who should be involved in the decision-making and which rationing criteria should be considered. We conducted Probit regression analyses to investigate associations between these preferences and several characteristics and opinions of the respondents. Results A total of 1,019 respondents returned a completed survey. The majority favored having physicians (55%) and/or expert committees (51%) play a role in the allocation of ICU beds and approximately one-fifth did not favor any of the proposed decision-makers. Respondents preferred to assign higher priority to vulnerable patients and patients who have the best prospect of full recovery. They also preferred that personal characteristics, including age, play no role. Conclusion “Our findings show that current guidelines for allocating ICU beds that include age as an independent criterion may not be consistent with societal preferences. Age may only play a role indirectly, in relation to the vulnerability of patients and their prospect of full recovery. Allocation of ICU beds during a health crisis requires a multivalue ethical framework.”"
https://openalex.org/W4291709414,"Accurate understanding of changing population dynamics associated with climate change is critical for managing highly migratory fish species. However, long-term data on population dynamics and the resulting recruitment variability is still lacking for many species, making it difficult to predict and integrate the effects of ocean warming into management schemes. In this study, high-resolution stable oxygen isotope (δ18O) analysis was performed on the otoliths of adult Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to determine the natal origin of an individual fish. The core δ18Ootolith corresponding to the larval stage greatly varied among the individuals, indicating that the larvae experienced a wide range of thermal environments. The non-hierarchical cluster analysis performed on the core δ18Ootolith grouped fish into those with higher δ18Ootolith (lower temperature) and those with lower δ18Ootolith (higher temperature), most likely representing relative temperature difference experienced between fish born in the Sea of Japan and in the Nansei Islands area. The Nansei Islands area cluster showed more variability in the early otolith growth indicating a longer spawning season, which is consistent with the observed longer spawning duration in this area. The absolute temperature estimates based on the SIMS-measured core δ18Ootolith were significantly higher than those expected from sea surface temperature data, suggesting the effects of matrix-related bias on the temperature offsets. The relative temperature difference, however, matched well with the known spawning temperature range of the two spawning grounds. The recruitment contribution from each spawning ground (all year-classes pooled, n = 51) was 45% in the Sea of Japan and 55% in the Nansei Islands area. Overall, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of SIMS δ18Ootolith analysis for investigating the natal origin of fish and its potential application in fish population dynamics studies."
https://openalex.org/W4291709655,"Objective The financial burden from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is a threat worldwide, alleviated only when good social protection schemes are in place. Albeit the Government in Albania has committed to Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC), Out-of-Pockets (OOPs) persist. Through this study, we aimed to assess the OOPs related to consultations, diagnostic tests, and medicine prescriptions as self-reported by people suffering from NCDs. Methods A household survey was conducted in two regions of Albania. The present analysis includes respondents who suffered from chronic health conditions and consulted a health care provider within the last 8 weeks (n = 898). Mixed logistic regression models with random intercepts at the level of communities were employed in order to assess the association of OOPs with age, gender, urban vs. rural residency, health insurance, marital status, barriers experienced, type of chronic condition(s) and region. Results Of those who consulted a provider, 95% also received a drug prescription. Among them, 94% were able to obtain all the drugs prescribed. Out-of-pocket payments occurred throughout the NCD treatment process; specifically, for consultation (36%), diagnostic tests (33%), and drugs purchased (88%). Drug expenditures accounted for 62% of all household expenditures. Respondents with health insurance were less likely to pay for consultation and drugs. The elderly (patients above 60 years old) were less likely to pay for consultations and tests. Those who lived in urban areas were less likely to pay for drugs and consultations. Patients encountering any form of barrier when seeking care had increased odds of OOPs for consultations (OR; 2.25 95%-CI; 1.57; 3.23) and tests (OR; 1.71 95%-CI; 1.19; 2.45). Conclusion Out-of-pocket payments by NCD patients principally made up through the purchase of prescribed drugs, remain important. Tackling the high costs of drugs will be important to accelerate the UHC agenda. Here, it is important to raise the population’s awareness on patients’ knowledge of their entitlements to health insurance, and on the current health reforms."

The final factor model identified three domains for diabetes knowledge: general knowledge, diabetes specific knowledge and causes of diabetes, and complications of untreated diabetes. Overall knowledge scores were 23.8 ± 2.4 for general diabetes knowledge, 2.3 ± 0.8 for diabetes specific knowledge, 2.3 ± 1.2 for causes, and 5.2 ± 1.2 for complications of untreated diabetes. Patients with diabetes were more knowledgeable than adults without diabetes in the population. While the general public in Singapore has adequate knowledge of diabetes, misconceptions were identified in both groups which underscores the need to tailor specific educational initiatives to reduce these diabetes knowledge gaps."
https://openalex.org/W4291710534,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous states in the United States instituted measures to close schools or shift them to virtual platforms. Understanding parents' preferences for sending their children back to school, and their experiences with distance learning is critical for informing school reopening guidelines. This study characterizes parents' plans to return their children to school, and examines the challenges associated with school closures during the 2020-2021 academic year.A national-level cross-sectional online survey was conducted in September 2020. Focusing on a subset of 510 respondents, who were parents of school-aged children, we examined variations in parents' plans for their children to return to school by their demographic and family characteristics, and challenges they anticipated during the school-year using multivariable logistic regressions.Fifty percent of respondents (n = 249) said that they would send their children back to school, 18% (n = 92) stated it would depend on what the district plans for school reopening, and 32% (n = 160) would not send their children back to school. No demographic characteristics were significantly associated with parents plans to not return their children to school. Overall, parents reported high-level of access to digital technology to support their child's learning needs (84%). However, those who reported challenges with distance learning due to a lack of childcare were less likely to not return their children to school (aOR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64). Parents who reported requiring supervision after school had higher odds of having plans to not return their children to school (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.79). Parents viewed COVID-19 vaccines and face-masks important for resuming in-person classes.About one-third of parents objected to their children returning to school despite facing challenges with distance learning. Besides access to vaccines and face-masks, our findings highlight the need to better equip parents to support remote learning, and childcare."
https://openalex.org/W4291022499,"Objective Many growth charts provide single centile cutoffs for each week of gestation, yet fetuses gain weight throughout the week. We aimed to assess whether using a single centile per week distorts the proportion of infants classified as small and their risk of stillbirth across the week. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Victoria, Australia. Population Singleton, non-anomalous infants born from 2005–2015 (529,261). Methods We applied growth charts to identify small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses on week-based charts (single centile per gestational week) and day-based charts (centile per gestational day). Main outcome measures Proportions &lt;10 th centile by each chart, and stillbirth risk amongst SGA infants. Results Using week-based charts, 12.1% of infants born on the first day of a gestational week were SGA, but only 7.8% on the final day; ie. an infant born at the end of the week was 44% less likely to be classed as SGA (p&lt;0.0001). The relative risk of stillbirth amongst SGA infants born on the final day of the week compared with the first was 1.47 (95%CI 1.09–2.00, p = 0.01). Using day charts, SGA proportions were similar and stillbirth risk equal between the beginning and end of the week (9.5% vs 9.9%). Conclusions Growth standards using a single cutoff for a gestational week overestimate the proportion of infants that are small at the beginning of the week and underestimate the proportion at the end. This distorts the risk of stillbirth amongst SGA infants based on when in the week an infant is born. Day-based charts should be used."
https://openalex.org/W4291283868,"Adolescence is a critical transition in human growth and adolescents tend to engage in various risky behaviors which are likely to continue into adulthood. Co-occurrence of non-communicable disease risk factors has the potential to increase risks of chronic disease comorbidity and increased mortality in later life. Behavioral risk factors are adopted due to changes in lifestyle and adolescents are more prone to acquire them. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of co-occurrence of non-communicable disease risk factors among school-going adolescents of Kathmandu Metropolitan City.We conducted a cross-sectional study among school-going adolescents of Kathmandu Metropolitan City in January/February 2020. We used stratified random sampling to select 1108 adolescents studying in 9, 10, 11, and 12 grades. We used Global Schools Health Survey tools to collect data. We entered data in EpiData 3.1 and exported it into Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20 for statistical analysis. We estimated prevalence of NCDs risk factors and co-occurrence of risk factors. We applied multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, religion, education, type of school, and parental education to determine factors associated with co-occurrence of NCDs risk factors.The prevalence of physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco among school-going adolescents were 72.3% (95%CI: 69.6-74.9), 41.1% (95%CI: 38.2-44.0), 14.8% (95%CI: 12.8-17.0) and 7.8% (95%CI:6.3-9.5) respectively. The adolescent with co-occurrence of two or more risk factors was 40.7% (95%CI: 37.8-43.7). The school-going adolescents who were in higher age group (AOR = 1.72, 95% CI- 1.06, 2.77), Hindus (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI-1.09, 2.89), other than Brahmin/Chhetri by ethnicity (AOR = 2.11, 95% CI-1.39, 2.22) and with lower education level of mothers (AOR = 2.40, 95% CI- 1.46,3.98) were more likely to have co-occurrence of NCDs risk factors after adjusting for all socio-demographic variables.The co-occurrence of non-communicable disease risk factors was high among school going adolescents and was associated with age, religion, ethnicity and mother's education. Integrated and comprehensive interventional programs should be developed by concerned authorities."

The mean annual age-adjusted rate of PPI was 125.5±11.6 per-100,000-men, compared to 63.4±14.3 per-100,000-women (P<0.01). The mean annual rate of PPI increased from 2009-2017 by 0.9±3.3% in men, compared to 0.4±4.4% in women (P<0.01) suggesting a widening disparity. Total non-fatal in-hospital complications was higher in women compared to men (8.2% vs 6.6%, P<0.01), and this persisted throughout study period even after adjusting for multiple covariates. Overall, in-hospital mortality was low (0.73%) and similar between sexes.In a statewide Australian population exceeding 7 million, PPI rates were consistently nearly two-fold higher for men compared to women over 10-years, with an apparently widening disparity, that was not explained by age. Overall complication rates were higher in women. Future studies should examine the aetiology behind this disparity in PPI rates, as well as its complications."
https://openalex.org/W4291284513,"The main objective of this study was to develop and validate the Awareness and Knowledge of Diabetes Distress (AKODD) questionnaire, so that it can be used to assess the knowledge attitude and practice of doctors who treat patients with diabetes distress. This validation study was conducted at the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from June to July 2019. Doctors from the Departments of Primary Care Medicine, Medicine, Psychological Medicine, Emergency Medicine and Staff Health Unit, who could understand English were recruited, as they treat patients with diabetes or diabetes distress. The AKODD was developed based on literature review. Next, an expert panel met to review findings from literature and to develop the items for AKODD. The AKODD has 3 sections: socio-demographic information, awareness and knowledge. It was then piloted among 7 doctors from the Departments of Primary Care Medicine, Medicine, Psychological Medicine and Emergency Medicine. No problems were encountered. Hence, no changes were made, and the AKODD was administered twice: at 0 and 2 weeks as part of the validation process. Discriminative validity was assessed by comparing scores of doctors who had/had not attended a diabetes course before. A total of 103/119 doctors agreed to participate (response rate = 86.6%). Flesch Reading Ease was 51.1. Thirty-three doctors (32.0%) have heard of diabetes distress before. Doctors had a good level of knowledge regarding diabetes distress with a median score of 77.8% (IQR:66.7-88.9). The AKODD had adequate discriminative validity between participants who had (83.3%)/had not attended a diabetes course before (72.2%; p<0.049). The AKODD had good internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson = 0.931) and adequate reliability as 9/18 items were not statistically significant at test-retest. The AKODD was found to be a valid and reliable questionnaire to assess the awareness and knowledge of diabetes distress among doctors in Malaysia as it had adequate psychometric properties."
https://openalex.org/W4291285780,"Tuberin is a major component of the protein regulatory complex known as the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression and protein synthesis. Mutations in the Tuberin gene, TSC2 , lead to the formation of benign tumors in many organ systems and causes the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex disorder. Genotypes ranging from point mutations to large deletions in the TSC2 gene have been clinically characterized with a wide range of phenotypes from skin tumors to large brain tumors. Our lab has previously demonstrated that Tuberin can directly bind and regulate the timing of nuclear transport of the G2/M cyclin, Cyclin B1. Herein we study the consequence of one clinically relevant truncation in the Tuberin protein on cell cycle function. We demonstrate that exogenous expression of a fragment of the N-term region of Tuberin alters the subcellular localization of Cyclin B1 and increases cell proliferation. This adds to our body of information about the residues within Tuberin responsible for regulating the cytoplasmic retention of Cyclin B1 and supports the phenotypic data seen in the clinic with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex patients harbouring similar large deletions in Tuberin."
https://openalex.org/W4291286179,"Objective Asian Indians are among the fastest growing United States (US) ethnic subgroups. We characterized mortality trends for leading causes of death among foreign-born and US-born Asian Indians in the US between 2005–2017. Study design and setting Using US standardized death certificate data, we examined leading causes of death in 73,470 Asian Indians and 20,496,189 non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) across age, gender, and nativity. For each cause, we report age-standardized mortality rates (AMR), longitudinal trends, and absolute percent change (APC). Results We found that Asian Indians’ leading causes of death were heart disease (28% mortality males; 24% females) and cancer (18% males; 22% females). Foreign-born Asian Indians had higher all-cause AMR compared to US-born (AMR 271 foreign-born, CI 263–280; 175.8 US-born, CI 140–221; p&lt;0.05), while Asian Indian all-cause AMR was lower than that of NHWs (AMR 271 Indian, CI 263–278; 754.4 NHW, CI 753.3–755.5; p&lt;0.05). All-cause AMR increased for foreign-born Asian Indians over time, while decreasing for US-born Asian Indians and NHWs. Conclusions Foreign-born Asian Indians were 2.2 times more likely to die of heart disease and 1.6 times more likely to die of cancer. Asian Indian male AMR was 49% greater than female on average, although AMR was consistently lower for Asian Indians when compared to NHWs."
https://openalex.org/W4291674369,"Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis has impeded tuberculosis prevention and control due to its low treatment efficiency and prolonged infectious periods. Early culture conversion status has long been used as a predictor of good treatment outcomes and an important infection control metric, as culture-negative patients are less likely to spread tuberculosis. There is also evidence that suggests that delayed sputum conversion is linked to negative outcomes. Therefore, this study was aimed at developing a nomogram to predict the risk of late culture conversion in patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis using readily available predictors.The objective of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction nomogram for the prediction of late culture conversion among multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients in North-West Ethiopia.Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis data from the University of Gondar and the Debre Markos referral hospitals have been used and a total of 316 patients were involved. The analysis was carried out using STATA version 16 and R version 4.0.5 statistical software. Based on the binomial logistic regression model, a validated simplified risk prediction model (nomogram) was built, and its performance was evaluated by assessing its discriminatory power and calibration. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the generated model's clinical and public health impact.Registration group, HIV co-infection, baseline BMI, baseline sputum smear grade, and radiological abnormalities were prognostic determinants used in the construction of the nomogram. The model has a discriminating power of 0.725 (95% CI: 0.669, 0.781) and a P-value of 0.665 in the calibration test. It was internally validated using the bootstrapping method, and it was found to perform similarly to the model developed on the entire dataset. The decision curve analysis revealed that the model has better clinical and public health impact than other strategies specified.The developed nomogram, which has a satisfactory level of accuracy and good calibration, can be utilized to predict late culture conversion in MDR-TB patients. The model has been found to be useful in clinical practice and is clinically interpretable."
https://openalex.org/W4291675850,"Background In 2008, the Japanese government implemented a National Intervention Program for metabolic syndrome. Low-risk individuals were not direct targets of this intervention. Nevertheless, they were indirectly enlightened by this massive campaign. Documentation of the metabolic shifts in low-risk individuals following the program launch may inform public health policy regarding approaches to metabolic risks in the general population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from non-diabetic participants who underwent general health check-ups at the Physical Check-up Center of Sumitomo Hospital. Participants during 2007–2008 were pair-matched with those during 2015–2016 with respect to sex, age, smoking status, hemoglobin level, and red blood cell (RBC) count. Each participant was included only once in the study. Results Totals of 3,140 men and 2,048 women were pair-matched. The non-diabetic participants showed lower waist circumference, blood pressure, heart rate, and serum lipid concentrations during the second study period. In contrast, the entire distributions of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration in both sexes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) in women were shifted upwards. In men, Δ FPG was +1.6 mg/dL ( P &lt; 0.001) and Δ HbA 1c was ±0% ( P = 0.6). In women, Δ FPG was +3.0 mg/dL ( P &lt; 0.001), and Δ HbA 1c was +0.1% ( P &lt; 0.001). Δ Homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function was −6.6 in men (P &lt; 0.001) and −10.3 in women ( P &lt; 0.001). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance did not change significantly. Conclusions The “glycemic set point” has increased in non-diabetic people in Japan during recent years. Lifestyle or environmental changes may have caused this metabolic shift through obesity-independent pathways, possibly through effects on pancreatic β-cell function. The underlying mechanism awaits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4291675939,"Background The AID line probe assay has shown promising evaluation data on the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as 1 st - and 2 nd -line drug resistance, using isolates and selected clinical samples in previous studies. Methods The diagnostic performance of three AID-modules (AID INH/RIF, AID FQ/EMB and AID AG) was analyzed in sputum samples from patients with presumed tuberculosis against culture methods and phenotypic drug resistance as reference standards. Results 59 patients had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. All AID modules showed moderate sensitivity (46/59, 78.0%, 65.3–87.7) and very good specificity (100%, 95.5%, 93.7%). There was a high proportion of invalid tests, resulting in 32.6%, 78.3% and 19.6% of 46 AID-positive tuberculosis cases, who could not be assessed for drug resistance by the AID INH/RIF-, AID FQ/EM- and AID AG-module, respectively. A small number of patients showed drug resistance by reference standards: Three MDR-TB cases plus three, one and one patients with resistance to streptomycin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, respectively. The AID-assay detected all MDR-TB cases, two of three streptomycin-resistant TB cases, one of one of fluoroquinolone-resistant and missed one aminoglycoside-resistant TB case. Discussion The high proportion of invalid results precludes the use of the AID-assay from direct sputum-based tuberculosis and drug-resistance testing."
https://openalex.org/W4291708740,"The introduction in many countries of conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis has led to significant reductions in acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) in children. However, recent population-based data on ABM in sub-Saharan Africa are limited.Population-based surveillance for meningitis was carried out in a rural area of The Gambia under demographic surveillance from 2008 to 2017, using standardised criteria for referral, diagnosis and investigation. We calculated incidence using population denominators.We diagnosed 1,666 patients with suspected meningitis and collected cerebrospinal fluid (n = 1,121) and/or blood (n = 1,070) from 1,427 (88%) of cases. We identified 169 cases of ABM, 209 cases of suspected non-bacterial meningitis (SNBM) and 1,049 cases of clinically suspected meningitis (CSM). The estimated average annual incidence of ABM was high at 145 per 100,000 population in the <2-month age group, 56 per 100,000 in the 2-23-month age group, but lower at 5 per 100,000 in the 5-14-year age group. The most common causes of ABM were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 44), Neisseria meningitidis (n = 42), and Gram-negative coliform bacteria (n = 26). Eighteen of 22 cases caused by pneumococcal serotypes included in PCV13 occurred prior to vaccine introduction and four afterwards. The overall case fatality ratio for ABM was 29% (49/169) and was highest in the <2-month age group 37% (10/27). The case fatality ratio was 8.6% (18/209) for suspected non-bacterial meningitis and 12.8% (134/1049) for clinically suspected meningitis cases.Gambian children continue to experience substantial morbidity and mortality associated with suspected meningitis, especially acute bacterial meningitis. Such severely ill children in sub-Saharan Africa require improved diagnostics and clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W4291709650,"Morphometric assessment of Chiari malformation type I (CMI) is typically performed on a midsagittal MRI. However, errors arising from an imprecise selection of the midsagittal plane are unknown. We define absolute parasagittal error as the absolute difference between morphometric measurements at the midsagittal and parasagittal planes. Our objective was to determine the absolute parasagittal error at various lateral distances for morphometric parameters commonly used in CMI research.Sagittal T1-weighted MRI scans of 30 CMI adult female subjects were included. Image sets were evaluated to assess 14 CMI morphometric parameters in the midsagittal plane and four parasagittal planes located 1 and 2 mm lateral (left and right). Comparisons between measurements at the midsagittal and parasagittal planes were conducted to determine the mean individual absolute and mean group parasagittal errors for all 14 parameters.The mean individual absolute parasagittal error was > 1 unit (1 mm for lengths and 1 degree for angles) for 9/14 parameters within a lateral distance of 2 mm. No significant group parasagittal errors were seen in 14/14 parameters, including tonsillar position within a lateral distance of 2 mm.Our results show that the absolute errors for imprecise midsagittal plane selection may impact the clinical assessment of an individual patient. However, the impact on group measurements, such as in a research setting, will be minimal."
