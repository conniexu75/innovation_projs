https://openalex.org/W2935995671,"The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the induction and remission of depressive episodes over time are not well understood. Through repeated longitudinal imaging of medial prefrontal microcircuits in the living brain, we found that prefrontal spinogenesis plays a critical role in sustaining specific antidepressant behavioral effects and maintaining long-term behavioral remission. Depression-related behavior was associated with targeted, branch-specific elimination of postsynaptic dendritic spines on prefrontal projection neurons. Antidepressant-dose ketamine reversed these effects by selectively rescuing eliminated spines and restoring coordinated activity in multicellular ensembles that predict motivated escape behavior. Prefrontal spinogenesis was required for the long-term maintenance of antidepressant effects on motivated escape behavior but not for their initial induction."

https://openalex.org/W2936622381,"Glutamate-gated AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory signal transduction at chemical synapses throughout all regions of the mammalian brain. AMPA receptors are tetrameric assemblies composed of four subunits, GluA1-GluA4. Despite decades of study, the subunit composition, subunit arrangement, and molecular structure of native AMPA receptors remain unknown. Here we elucidate the structures of 10 distinct native AMPA receptor complexes by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We find that receptor subunits are arranged nonstochastically, with the GluA2 subunit preferentially occupying the B and D positions of the tetramer and with triheteromeric assemblies comprising a major population of native AMPA receptors. Cryo-EM maps define the structure for S2-M4 linkers between the ligand-binding and transmembrane domains, suggesting how neurotransmitter binding is coupled to ion channel gating."

Charenton et al. solved the structures of the human pre–B complex, providing detailed mechanistic insights into how the helicase Prp28 transfers the 5′ splice site of the messenger RNA precursor from U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to U6 snRNA. The pairing of the 5′ splice site with U6 induces a series of conformational changes that triggers the relocation of Brr2 helicase and loading of U4 snRNA to the helicase active site. This leads to unwinding of the U4/U6 snRNA duplex and allows U6 to fold and pair with U2 to create the spliceosome active site. Science , this issue p. 362"
https://openalex.org/W2937103177,"Electron transfer reactions slow down when they become very thermodynamically favorable, a counterintuitive interplay of kinetics and thermodynamics termed the inverted region in Marcus theory. Here we report inverted region behavior for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Photochemical studies of anthracene-phenol-pyridine triads give rate constants for PCET charge recombination that are slower for the more thermodynamically favorable reactions. Photoexcitation forms an anthracene excited state that undergoes PCET to create a charge-separated state. The rate constants for return charge recombination show an inverted dependence on the driving force upon changing pyridine substituents and the solvent. Calculations using vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory yield rate constants for simultaneous tunneling of the electron and proton that account for the results."

Buscaill et al. studied how a flagellin fragment is made accessible for recognition by host glycosidases, which degrade the glycosylations shielding the peptide that triggers the immune response. The pathogen, in turn, evades detection by altering flagellin glycosylation and inhibiting the host glycosidase. This aspect of plant defense against infection plays out in the apoplast, the extracellular space within plant tissues. Science , this issue p. eaav0748"
https://openalex.org/W2935807287,"Sweet spot for making oligosaccharides Sugars pose a challenge for chemists: how to string together functional group–rich building blocks that can adopt multiple conformations. Two papers in this issue used sugar building blocks constrained by a macrocyclic linker to encourage formation of a specific glycosidic linkage (see the Perspective by Pohl). Ikuta et al. used glucose building blocks containing a linker that changes the sugar conformation to synthesize cyclic oligomers with only three or four units. The linker changes the conformation of the glucose monomers, enabling them to come together despite the strain in the final structure. Komura et al. prepared sialic acid building blocks with a linker that allows for selective formation of the α-anomeric linkage with a range of nucleophiles. They synthesized dimers of sialic acid with many different linkages and a pentamer with four α(2,8) linkages. This method enabled chemical synthesis of components of mammalian glycans involved in brain development, cell adhesion, and immune response. Science , this issue p. 674 , p. 677 ; see also p. 631"
https://openalex.org/W2938012181,"The fragile ecological environment near mines provide advantageous conditions for the development of landslides. Mine landslide susceptibility mapping is of great importance for mine geo-environment control and restoration planning. In this paper, a total of 493 landslides in Shangli County, China were collected through historical landslide inventory. 16 spectral, geomorphic and hydrological predictive factors, mainly derived from Landsat 8 imagery and Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), were prepared initially for landslide susceptibility assessment. Predictive capability of these factors was evaluated by using the value of variance inflation factor and information gain ratio. Three models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and information value model (IVM), were applied to assess the mine landslide sensitivity. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and rank probability score were used to validate and compare the comprehensive predictive capabilities of three models involving uncertainty. Results showed that ANN model achieved higher prediction capability, proving its advantage of solve nonlinear and complex problems. Comparing the estimated landslide susceptibility map with the ground-truth one, the high-prone area tends to be located in the middle area with multiple fault distributions and the steeply sloped hill."
https://openalex.org/W2937343577,"Direct road mortality and the barrier effect of roads are typically identified as one of the greatest threats to wildlife. In addition, collisions with large mammals are also a threat to human safety and represent an economic cost to society. We documented and explored the effects of animal-vehicle crashes on human safety in São Paulo State, Brazil. We estimated the costs of these crashes to society, and we summarized the legal perspectives. On average, the Military Highway Police of São Paulo reported 2,611 animal-vehicle crashes per year (3.3% of total crashes), and 18.5% of these resulted in human injuries or fatalities. The total annual cost to society was estimated at R$ 56,550,642 (US $ 25,144,794). The average cost for an animal-vehicle crash, regardless of whether human injuries and fatalities occurred, was R$ 21,656 (US $ 9,629). The Brazilian legal system overwhelmingly (91.7% of the cases) holds the road administrator liable for animal-vehicle collisions, both with wild and domestic species. On average, road administrators spent R$ 2,463,380 (US $ 1,005,051) per year compensating victims. The logical conclusion is that the Brazilian legal system expects road administrators to keep animals, both wild and domestic species, off the road. We suggest an improved coordination between the laws that relate to animal-vehicle collisions and human safety, and the process for environmental licenses that focusses on reducing collisions with wildlife and providing habitat connectivity. In addition, we suggest better management practices, raising awareness and social change with regard to abandoned domesticated animals including horses, cattle, and dogs. This should ultimately result in a road system with improved human safety, reduced unnatural mortality for both domestic and wild animal species, safe crossing opportunities for wildlife, and reduced monetary costs to society."
https://openalex.org/W2938462422,"The role of microbial dysbiosis in scalp disease has been recently hypothesized. However, little information is available with regards to the association between microbial population on the scalp and hair diseases related to hair growth. Here we investigated bacterial communities in healthy and Alopecia areata (AA) subjects. The analysis of bacterial distribution at the genus level highlighted an increase of Propionibacterium in AA subjects alongside a general decrease of Staphylococcus. Analysis of log Relative abundance of main bacterial species inhabiting the scalp showed a significant increase of Propionibacterium acnes in AA subjects compared to control ones. AA scalp condition is also associated with a significant decrease of Staphylococcus epidermidis relative abundance. No significant changes were found for Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, data from sequencing profiling of the bacterial population strongly support a different microbial composition of the different area surrounded hair follicle from the epidermis to hypodermis, highlighting differences between normal and AA affected the scalp. Our results highlight, for the first time, the presence of a microbial shift on the scalp of patients suffering from AA and gives the basis for a larger and more complete study of microbial population involvement in hair disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2938755990,"Selective breeding of laboratory rats resulted in changes of their behavior. Concomitantly, the albino strains developed vision related pathologies. These alterations certainly occurred on the background of modifications in brain morphology. The aim of the study was to assess and compare volumes of major structures in brains of wild-captive, laboratory albino and laboratory pigmented rats. High resolution T2-weighted images of brains of adult male Warsaw Wild Captive Pisula-Stryjek rats (WWCPS, a model of wild type), laboratory pigmented (Brown Norway strain, BN) and albino rats (Wistar strain, WI) were obtained with a 7T small animal-dedicated magnetic resonance tomograph. Volume quantification of whole brains and 50 brain structures within each brain were performed with the digital Schwarz rat brain atlas and a custom-made MATLAB/SPM8 scripts. Brain volumes were scaled to body mass, whereas volumes of brain structures were normalized to individual brain volumes. Normalized brain volume was similar in WWCPS and BN, but lower in WI. Normalized neocortex volume was smaller in both laboratory strains than in WWCPS and the visual cortex was smaller in albino WI rats than in WWCPS and BN. Relative volumes of phylogenetically older structures, such as hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and olfactory nuclei, also displayed certain strain-related differences. The present data shows that selective breeding of laboratory rats markedly affected brain morphology, the neocortex being most significantly altered. In particular, albino rats display reduced volume of the visual cortex, possibly related to retinal degeneration and the development of blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2939249800,"In lung cancer (LC), alterations in redox balance are extensively observed and are a consequence of disease as well as co-occurrent with smoking. We previously demonstrated that metabolic disturbances such as trace element status and carbohydrate metabolism alterations are linked with redox status. The aim of this study was to evaluate relationships between the serum parameters of lipid metabolism and redox balance in LC patients. Serum parameters of lipid metabolism, i.e. total cholesterol (T-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), T-C:HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and Apo-B:Apo-A1 ratio, as well as systemic redox status, i.e. total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), vitamin E (VE), vitamin C (VC), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CD), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were determined in 92 LC patients and 82 control subjects (CS). LC women had significantly lower T-C and LDL-C, and higher TG, while HDL-C, Apo-A1 and Apo-B were significantly decreased in LC patients regardless of sex, when compared to CS. LC men had alterations in the systemic total redox balance such as lower TAS and higher OSI than CS men. LC women had lower VC, but VE was decreased in LC patients, regardless of sex. We observed higher lipid peroxidation in LC patients expressed via higher 4-HNE and CD. Systemic redox disturbances were associated with serum lipid alterations: TOS and OSI were positively correlated with T-C:HDL-C ratio and Apo-B:Apo-A1 ratio and negatively with HDL-C. The parameters of lipid peroxidation CD and MDA were significantly associated with variables reflecting lipid disturbances. The observed correlations were strengthened by general overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and non-smoking status. In conclusion, parameters related to lipid alterations are associated with oxidative stress in LC patients. The largest contribution from lipid parameters was revealed for T-C:HDL-C ratio, HDL-C and Apo-B:Apo-A1 ratio, while the largest contribution from redox status was revealed for OSI and VE. Overweight, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and non-smoking status intensified these relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2936138869,"Surfactin has antiviral activity against various enveloped viruses by inhibiting viral membrane fusion. However, the potential utility of surfactin as an antiviral drug is limited by its cytotoxicity. In this study, 10 surfactin analogues were obtained by chemical synthesis and evaluated to determine their anti-PEDV activities, hemolytic activities, and critical micelle concentrations. The main goal of our study was to develop a safer drug; a surfactin analogue with high anti-PEDV activity and low hemolytic activity. Compared with surfactin, one of the analogues we developed, SLP5, has lower hemolytic activity, with the same antiviral activity. The selectivity index of SLP5 is 52, while the SI for surfactin is 4, in other words, the safe and effective concentration range of SLP5 is 12 times greater than that of surfactin. Like surfactin, SLP5 has a direct antiviral effect on PEDV. Structurally, SLP5 is a linear lipopeptide with three carboxyl groups. Surfactin derivatives similar to SLP5 could be obtained by lactone bond hydrolyzation of surfactin, as well as total synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2936999470,"The nitrogen (N) cycle is closely related to the stability of marine ecosystems. Microbial communities have been directly linked to marine N-cycling processes. However, systematic research on the bacterial community composition and diversity involved in N cycles in different seas is lacking. In this study, microbial diversity in the Bohai Sea (BHS), Yellow Sea (YS) and South China Sea (SCS) was surveyed by targeting the hypervariable V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. A total of 2,505,721 clean reads and 15,307 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from 86 sediment samples from the three studied China seas. LEfSe analysis demonstrated that the SCS had more abundant microbial taxa than the BHS and YS. Diversity indices demonstrated that Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes were the dominant phyla in all three China seas. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that pH (P = 0.034) was the principal determining factors, while the organic matter content, depth and temperature had a minor correlated with the variations in sedimentary microbial community distribution. Cluster and functional analyses of microbial communities showed that chemoheterotrophic and aerobic chemoheterotrophic microorganisms widely exist in these three seas. Further research found that the cultivable protease-producing bacteria were mainly affiliated with the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. It was very clear that Pseudoalteromonadaceae possessed the highest relative abundance in the three sea areas. The predominant protease-producing genera were Pseudoalteromonas and Bacillus. These results shed light on the differences in bacterial community composition, especially protease-producing bacteria, in these three China seas."
https://openalex.org/W2937117045,"The changing population age structure has a significant influence on the economy, society, and numerous other aspects of a country. This paper has innovatively applied the method of compositional data forecasting for the prediction of population age changes of the young (aged 0–14), the middle-aged (aged 15–64), and the elderly (aged older than 65) in China, India, and Vietnam by 2030 based on data from 1960 to 2016. To select the best-suited forecasting model, an array of data transformation approaches and forecasting models have been extensively employed, and a large number of comparisons have been made between the aforementioned methods. The best-suited model for each country is identified considering the root mean squared error and mean absolute percent error values from the compositional data. As noted in this study, first and foremost, it is predicted that by the year 2030, China will witness the disappearance of population dividend and get mired in an aging problem far more severe than that of India or Vietnam. Second, Vietnam’s trend of change in population age structure resembles that of China, but the country will sustain its good health as a whole. Finally, the working population of India demonstrates a strong rising trend, indicating that the age structure of the Indian population still remains relatively “young”. Meanwhile, the continuous rise in the proportion of elderly population and the gradual leveling off growth of the young population have nevertheless become serious problems in the world. The present paper attempts to offer crucial insights into the Asian population size, labor market and urbanization, and, moreover, provides suggestions for a sustainable global demographic development."
https://openalex.org/W2940410986,"Despite knowledge that seagrass meadows are threatened by multiple global change stressors, significant gaps exist in current knowledge. In particular, little is known about the interactive effects of warming and eutrophication on seagrasses globally, or about responses of African seagrasses to global change, despite these ecosystem engineers providing critical goods and services to local livelihoods. Here, we report on laboratory experiment assessing the main and joint effects of warming and nutrient enrichment on Cape eelgrass (Zostera capensis) from the West coast of South Africa, in which morphological attributes, photosynthetic efficiency and elemental content were assessed. Results indicate that shoot density, leaf length, aboveground biomass and effective quantum yield were negatively impacted by both warming and nutrient enrichment. Growth rate, leaf density and leaf width decreased with increasing nutrient levels but not temperature. In addition, epiphytic fouling on seagrass leaves were enhanced by both warming and nutrient enrichment but with warming eliciting a greater response. Collectively, our findings indicate a stronger effect of enrichment on Z. capensis performance relative to warming, suggesting that the upper levels of coastal eutrophication upon which our experiment was based is likely a stronger stressor than warming. Our findings also highlight limited interaction between warming and nutrient enrichment on Z. capensis performance, suggesting that effects of these stressors are likely to be propagated individually and not interactively. Our findings raise awareness of susceptibility of Z. capensis to eutrophication and the need to manage nutrient inputs into coastal ecosystems to preserve meadows of this seagrass and the critical ecosystem functions they provide."
https://openalex.org/W2937129434,"Although the impacts of climate change on biodiversity are increasing worldwide, few studies have attempted to forecast these impacts on Amazon Tropical Forest. In this study, we estimated the impact of climate change on Amazonian avian assemblages considering range shifts, species loss, vulnerability of ecosystem functioning, future effectiveness of current protected areas and potential climatically stable areas for conservation actions. Species distribution modelling based on two algorithms and three different scenarios of climate change was used to forecast 501 avian species, organized on main ecosystem functions (frugivores, insectivores and nectarivores) for years 2050 and 2070. Considering the entire study area, we estimated that between 4 and 19% of the species will find no suitable habitat. Inside the currently established protected areas, species loss could be over 70%. Our results suggest that frugivores are the most sensitive guild, which could bring consequences on seed dispersal functions and on natural regeneration. Moreover, we identified the western and northern parts of the study area as climatically stable. Climate change will potentially affect avian assemblages in southeastern Amazonia with detrimental consequences to their ecosystem functions. Information provided here is essential to conservation practitioners and decision makers to help on planning their actions."
https://openalex.org/W2940393927,"The primary goal of cattle genomics is the identification of genome-wide polymorphism associated with economically important traits. The bovine genome sequencing project was completed in 2009. Since then, using massively parallel sequencing technologies, a large number of Bos taurus cattle breeds have been resequenced and scanned for genome-wide polymorphisms. As a result, a substantial number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been discovered across European Bos taurus genomes, whereas extremely less number of SNPs are cataloged for Bos indicus breeds. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing, reference-based mapping, functional annotation and gene enrichment analysis of 20 sires representing eleven important Bos indicus (indicine) breeds of Pakistan. The breeds sequenced here include: Sahiwal, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar and Cholistani (tropically adapted dairy and dual purpose breeds), Achai, Bhagnari, Dajal and Lohani (high altitude adapted dual and drought purpose breeds); Dhanni, Hisar Haryana and Gabrali (dairy and light drought purpose breeds). A total of 17.4 billion QC passed reads were produced using BGISEQ-500 next generation sequencing platform to generate 9 to 27-fold genome coverage (average ~16×) for each of the 20 sequenced sires. A total of 67,303,469 SNPs were identified, of which 3,850,365 were found novel and 1,083,842 insertions-deletions (InDels) were detected across the whole sequenced genomes (491,247 novel). Comparative analysis using coding region SNPs revealed a close relationship between the best milking indicine breeds; Red Sindhi and Sahiwal. On the other hand, Bhagnari and Tharparkar being popular for their adaptation to dry and extremely hot climates were found to share the highest number of SNPs. Functional annotation identified a total of 3,194 high-impact (disruptive) SNPs and 745 disruptive InDels (in 275 genes) that may possibly affect economically important dairy and beef traits. Functional enrichment analysis was performed and revealed that high or moderate impact variants in wingless-related integration site (Wnt) and vascular smooth muscle contraction (VSMC) signaling pathways were significantly over-represented in tropically adapted heat tolerant Pakistani-indicine breeds. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathways were found over-represented in highland adapted Pakistani-indicine breeds. Similarly, the ECM-receptor interaction and Jak-STAT signaling pathway were significantly enriched in dairy and beef purpose Pakistani-indicine cattle breeds. The Toll-like receptor signaling pathway was significantly enriched in most of the Pakistani-indicine cattle. Therefore, this study provides baseline data for further research to investigate the molecular mechanisms of major traits and to develop potential genomic markers associated with economically important breeding traits, particularly in indicine cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2952774584,"Soil DNA extraction encounters numerous challenges that can affect both yield and purity of the recovered DNA. Clay particles lead to reduced DNA extraction efficiency, and PCR inhibitors from the soil matrix can negatively affect downstream analyses when applying DNA sequencing. Further, these effects impede molecular analysis of bacterial community compositions in lower biomass samples, as often observed in deeper soil layers. Many studies avoid these complications by using indirect DNA extraction with prior separation of the cells from the matrix, but such methods introduce other biases that influence the resulting microbial community composition. To address these issues, a direct DNA extraction method was applied in combination with the use of a commercial product, the G2 DNA/RNA Enhancer, marketed as being capable of improving the amount of DNA recovered after the lysis step. The results showed that application of G2 increased DNA yields from the studied clayey soils from layers from 1.00 to 2.20 m. Importantly, the use of G2 did not introduce bias, as it did not result in any significant differences in the biodiversity of the bacterial community measured in terms of alpha and beta diversity and taxonomical composition. Finally, this study considered a set of customised lysing tubes for evaluating possible influences on the DNA yield. Tubes customization included different bead sizes and amounts, along with lysing tubes coming from two suppliers. Results showed that the lysing tubes with mixed beads allowed greater DNA recovery compared to the use of either 0.1 or 1.4 mm beads, irrespective of the tube supplier. These outcomes may help to improve commercial products in DNA/RNA extraction kits, besides raising awareness about the optimal choice of additives, offering opportunities for acquiring a better understanding of topics such as vertical microbial characterisation and environmental DNA recovery in low biomass samples."

https://openalex.org/W2937191452,"Understanding biological community distribution patterns and their drivers across different scales is one of the major goals of community ecology in a rapidly changing world. Considering natural forest-grassland ecotones distributed over the south Brazilian region we investigated how ant communities are assembled locally, i.e. considering different habitats, and regionally, i.e. considering different physiographic regions. We used taxonomic and phylogenetic approaches to investigate diversity patterns and search for environmental/spatial drivers at each scale. We sampled ants using honey and tuna baits in forest and grassland habitats, in ecotones distributed at nine sites in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Overall, we found 85 ant species belonging to 23 genera and six subfamilies. At the local scale, we found forests and grasslands as equivalent in ant species and evolutionary history diversities, but considerably different in terms of species composition. In forests, the soil surface air temperature predicts foraging ant diversity. In grasslands, while the height of herbaceous vegetation reduces ant diversity, treelet density from forest expansion processes clearly increases it. At a regional scale, we did not find models that sufficiently explained ant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity based on regional environmental variables. The variance in species composition, but not in evolutionary histories, across physiographic regions is driven by space and historical processes. Our findings unveil important aspects of ant community ecology in natural transition systems, indicating environmental filtering as an important process structuring the communities at the local scale, but mostly spatial processes acting at the regional scale."
https://openalex.org/W2937258353,"Objective The use of the Individual Ventilatory Threshold (IVT), as parameter to prescribe exercise intensity in individuals with obesity, has become more frequent during the last years. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between IVT and Maximal Fat Oxidation (MFO) in women with obesity. Methods Fifty-two obese female adults (age = 43.6±10.9 years; BMI = 38.5±5.2 kg/m2) were included in this study. According to the BMI classification, subjects were divided into three groups: Obese Class I (OBI, n = 16); Obese Class II (OBII, n = 20) and Obese Class III (OBIII, n = 16). All subjects performed an incremental graded exercise test to evaluate peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), IVT and MFO. MFO was evaluated using a stoichiometric equation. Fat max zone was determined for each subject within 10% of fat oxidation rates at MFO. For each HR, %HRmax, VO2 and %VO2peak variable, Pearson’s correlation test was done between IVT and MFO exercise intensity. When statistical correlation was found we used a comparative statistical analysis to assess differences between IVT and MFO. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. Results For each HR, %HRmax, VO2 and %VO2peak variable there was a positive significant correlation (P<0.01) between IVT and MFO. No significant differences were found for HR, %HRmax, and VO2 between IVT and MFO. %VO2peak was significantly higher at IVT than at MFO (P = 0.03). MFO rates were significantly higher in OBIII women than in women of the other two classes. In all subjects, IVT was within the fat max zone. Conclusion The use of HR and VO2 corresponding to IVT could be a useful parameter not only to improve cardiorespiratory fitness but also to prescribe physical activity that maximize fat oxidation in obese subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2939127976,"Seed burial in the sediment is critical for successful seedling establishment in seagrasses because it protects from predation and dispersal into unsuitable sites, and it may enhance germination by exposing the seeds to suitable germination stimuli. However, relatively little is known about the fate of buried seeds and their ability to emerge from greater depths. The goal of this study was to determine seed survival in the sediment, seedling emergence success and initial seedling biomass of Zostera marina in relation to burial depth and to evaluate if large seeds, having larger energy reserves, are more tolerant to burial than small seeds. Seeds from a perennial Z. marina population were buried at 7 different sediment depths (0.1-8 cm), and seeds sorted by size (large and small) were buried at depths of 2, 4 and 6 cm in outdoor mesocosms. Total seedling emergence after 2 months was significantly affected by seed burial depth, with maximum values in the top 2 cm of the sediment (48.1-56.7% of planted seeds), and a marked decline below 4 cm depth to only 5% seedling emergence at the deepest burial depth of 8 cm. Moreover, seeds had shorter time to emergence from shallow compared to deep burial depths. At all burial depths, a small fraction of seeds (<10%) died after germination but before emerging, and 15-30% remained viable after 6 months. Seed mortality was the major limitation to seedling recruitment from the deeper burial depths. The effect of seed size on seedling emergence success and time was not clear, but heavier seeds displayed greater longevity and gave rise to seedlings of significantly higher biomass, indicating that the mobilization of metabolic reserves may be important during initial seedling development."
https://openalex.org/W2940136735,"Hybrid 3D scaffolds composed of different biomaterials with fibrous structure or enriched with different inclusions (i.e., nano- and microparticles) have already demonstrated their positive effect on cell integration and regeneration. The analysis of fibers in hybrid biomaterials, especially in a 3D space is often difficult due to their various diameters (from micro to nanoscale) and compositions. Though biomaterials processing workflows are implemented, there are no software tools for fiber analysis that can be easily integrated into such workflows. Due to the demand for reproducible science with Jupyter notebooks and the broad use of the Python programming language, we have developed the new Python package quanfima offering a complete analysis of hybrid biomaterials, that include the determination of fiber orientation, fiber and/or particle diameter and porosity. Here, we evaluate the provided tensor-based approach on a range of generated datasets under various noise conditions. Also, we show its application to the X-ray tomography datasets of polycaprolactone fibrous scaffolds pure and containing silicate-substituted hydroxyapatite microparticles, hydrogels enriched with bioglass contained strontium and alpha-tricalcium phosphate microparticles for bone tissue engineering and porous cryogel 3D scaffold for pancreatic cell culturing.

https://openalex.org/W2939220580,The virulence plasmid pSLT as exemplified by the 94 Kb plasmid in Salmonella Typhimurium strain LT2 is only found in isolates of serovar Typhimurium. While it occurs commonly among such isolates recent genotyping methods have shown that it is mostly confined to certain genotypes. Although pSLT plasmids are capable of self-transmissibility under experimental conditions their confinement to certain host genotypes suggests that in practice they are maintained by vertical rather than by horizontal transmission. This would imply that evolution of the pSLT plasmid proceeds in parallel with evolution of its host. The development of a phylogenetic evolutionary framework for genotypes of S. Typhimurium based on single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNPs) typing provided an opportunity to test whether the pSLT plasmid coevolves with its host genotype. Accordingly SNPs analysis was applied to the pSLT plasmids from 71 strains S. Typhimurium of Australian and international origins representing most of the genotypes which commonly have a pSLT. The phylogenetic tree showed that pSLT sequences clustered into almost the same groups as the host chromosomes so that each pSLT genotype was associated with a single host genotype. A search for tandem repeats in pSLT plasmids showed that a 9 bp VNTR in the traD gene occurred in the pSLT from all isolates belonging to Clade II but not from isolates belonging to Clade I. Another 9 bp repeat occurred only in three Clade I genotypes with a recent common ancestor. The evidence relating to both of these VNTRs supports the proposition that the pSLT plasmid is only transmitted vertically. Some isolates belonging to one S. Typhimurium genotype were found to have pSLTs which have lost a large block of genes when a resistance gene cassette has been acquired. Examples were found of pSLT plasmids which have recombined with other plasmids to form fusion plasmids sometimes with loss of some pSLT genes. In all cases the underlying genotype of the modified pSLT was the same as the genotype of regular pSLTs with the same host genotype implying that these changes have occurred within the host cell of the pSLT plasmid.

Text messaging, or SMS, allows for the low cost transmission of information, and has been used to send appointment reminders, information about HIV counselling and treatment, messages to encourage adherence and information on nutrition and side-effects. HIV Viral Load (VL) monitoring is recommended by the WHO and has been progressively adopted in many settings. In Zimbabwe, implementation of VL is routine and has been rolled out with support of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) since 2012. An SMS intervention to assist with the management of VL results was introduced in two rural districts of Zimbabwe. After completion of the HIV VL testing at the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory in Harare, results were sent to health facilities via SMS. Consenting patients were also sent an SMS informing them that their viral load results were ready for collection at their nearest health facilities. No actual VL results were sent to patients.A qualitative study was conducted in seven health-care facilities using in-depth interviews (n = 32) and focus group discussions (n = 5) to explore patient and health-care worker experiences of the SMS intervention. Purposive sampling was used to select participants to ensure that male and female patients, as well as those with differing VL results and who lived differing distances from the clinics were included. Data were transcribed, translated from Shona into English, coded and thematically analysed using NVivo software.The VL SMS intervention was considered acceptable to patients and health-care workers despite some challenges in implementation. The intervention was perceived by health-care workers as improving adherence and well-being of patients as well as improving the management of VL results at health facilities. However, there were some concerns from participants about the intervention, including challenges in understanding the purpose and language of the messages and patients coming to their health facility unnecessarily. Health-care workers were more concerned than patients about unintentional HIV disclosure relating to the content of the messages or phone-sharing.This was an innovative intervention in Zimbabwe, in which SMS was used to send VL results to health-care facilities, and notifications of the availability of VL results to patients. Interventions such as this have the potential to reduce unnecessary clinic visits and ensure patients with high VL results receive timely support, but they need to be properly explained, alongside routine counselling, for patients to fully benefit. The findings of this study also have potential policy implications, as if implemented well, such an SMS intervention has the potential to help patients adopt a more active role in the self-management of their HIV disease, become more aware of the importance of adherence and VL monitoring and seek follow-up at clinics when results are high."
https://openalex.org/W2937373889,"Preterm birth is associated with heightened risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, including impairments in performance monitoring. Here, we investigate the cognitive and neurophysiological processes from a performance-monitoring task in preterm-born adolescents and examine whether these processes in preterm-born adolescents reflect identical neurophysiological impairments to those observed in term-born adolescents with ADHD. We compared 186 preterm-born individuals to 69 term-born individuals with ADHD and 135 term-born controls on cognitive-performance measures and event-related potentials (ERPs) of conflict monitoring (N2) and error processing (ERN, Pe) from a flanker task. Preterm-born adolescents demonstrated reduced N2, ERN and Pe amplitudes, compared to controls, and similar ERN and Pe impairments to term-born adolescents with ADHD. While ADHD symptoms correlated with ERN amplitude at FCz among the preterm-born, ERN amplitude at Fz, N2 and Pe amplitude were not associated with ADHD symptoms. Preterm-born individuals show impairments on neurophysiological indices of conflict monitoring (N2) and error processing (ERN and Pe). Early neurophysiological error processing may be a marker underlying the processes linked to the increased risk for ADHD among preterm-born individuals. Error detection processes are malleable and potential targets for non-pharmacological interventions. Preterm-born individuals are likely to benefit from early interventions."

Sample Pregnant women recruited through social media and an online panel. Methods We developed a DCE to assess women’s preferences for four hypothetical birth settings based on seven attributes: reputation, continuity of care, distance from home, time to see a doctor, partner able to stay overnight, chance of straightforward birth and safety for baby. We used a mixed logit model, with setting modelled as an alternative-specific constant, and conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of changes in attribute levels on uptake of birth settings. Main outcome measures Women’s preferences for birth setting. Results 257 pregnant women completed the DCE. All birth setting attributes, except ‘time to see doctor’, were significant in women’s choice (p<0.05). There was significant heterogeneity in preferences for some attributes. Changes to levels for ‘safety for the baby’ and ‘partner able to stay overnight’ were associated with larger changes from baseline uptake of birth setting. If the preferences identified were translated into the real-world context up to a third of those who reported planning birth in an obstetric unit might choose a midwifery unit assuming universal access to all settings, and knowledge of the differences between settings. Conclusions We found that ‘safety for the baby’, ‘chance of a straightforward birth’ and ‘can the woman’s partner stay overnight following birth’ were particularly important in women’s preferences for hypothetical birth setting. If all birth settings were available to women and they were aware of the differences between them, it is likely that more low risk women who currently plan birth in OUs might choose a midwifery unit."
https://openalex.org/W2936955930,"Hearing loss (HL) is a common sensory disorder. More than half of HL cases can be attributed to genetic causes. There is no effective therapy for genetic HL at present, early diagnosis to reduce the incidence of genetic HL is important for clinical intervention in genetic HL. Previous studies have identified 111 nonsyndromic hearing loss genes. The most frequently mutated genes identified in NSHL patients in China include GJB2, SLC26A4, and the mitochondrial gene MT-RNR1. It is important to develop HL gene panels in Chinese population, which allow for etiologic diagnosis of both SHL and NSHL. In this study, a total of 220 unrelated Han Chinese patients with bilateral progressive SNHL and 50 unrelated healthy controls were performed Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique, is to simultaneously detect a total of 32 mutations in ten HL genes, covering all currently characterized mutations involved in the etiology of nonsyndromic or syndromic hearing loss in the Chinese population. The 49 positive samples with known mutations were successfully detected using the iMLDR Technique. For 171 SNHL patients, gene variants were found in 57 cases (33.33%), among which, 30 patients carried mutations in GJB2, 14 patients carried mutations in SLC26A4, seven patients carried mutations in GJB3, and six patients carried mutations in MT-RNR1. The molecular etiology of deafness was confirmed in 12.9% (22/171) of patients carried homozygous variants. These results were verified by Sanger sequencing, indicating that the sensitivity and specificity of the iMLDR technique was 100%. We believe that the implementation of this population-specific technology at an efficient clinical level would have great value in HL diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2938239662,"Purpose To examine the impacts of socio-economic status (SES) on visual impairment (VI), and the mediating role of lifestyles in developed rural areas of China. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among people living in rural districts of Tianjin, a developed municipality in China. An interviewer-administered survey along with free eye screenings was conducted with participants. The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, SES, medical histories and lifestyles. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) and main causes of VI were identified by ophthalmologists. χ2 test was undertaken to determine whether significant differences (p<0.05) exist between VI and demographic, SES, medical history and lifestyle factors. A stepwise regression method was conducted to investigate whether lifestyles play mediating roles between SES and VI. Multivariable logistic and ordinal logistic regression were used contingent on different types of dependent variables in each regression, and adjusted odds ratio (OR) values were estimated. Results Of the 12,233 participants, 6,233 were male (50.59%); the mean age was 34.61 years; 310 (2.54%) had VI. Hypertension, diabetes and cardiopathy were main medical histories, with 1,640 had hypertension (13.41%), 854 had diabetes (6.98%) and 483 had cardiopathy (3.95%). About SES factors, higher education level (Adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.95) and higher income level (Adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39–0.76), were significantly associated with VI in a gradient across severity of VI. Lifestyles including smoking (Adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.31–1.83) and drinking (Adjusted OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06–1.74) played mediating roles between SES and VI when considering the full sample. Besides smoking and drinking, reading every week (Adjusted OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53–2.82) and exercising more than 2h every day (Adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15–1.00) also played mediating roles between SES and VI when considering the subsample (age≥16). Conclusion This study revealed the crucial impacts of SES factors on VI, and the mediating role played by several lifestyles. Targeted public health interventions for reducing VI should thus be proposed in developed rural areas of China."
https://openalex.org/W2935773301,"X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) leads to growth retardation and bone deformities, which are not fully avoided by conventional treatment with phosphate and vitamin D analogs. Pediatric patients have been treated with growth hormone (GH), and recent findings suggest that blocking fibroblast growth factor 23 actions may be the most effective therapy, but its effects on growth are not known. We here report the effect of MAPK inhibition alone or associated with GH on growth and growth plate and bone structure of young Hyp (the XLH animal model) mice. Untreated Hyp mice were severely growth retarded and had marked alterations in both growth plate structure and dynamics as well as defective bone mineralization. GH accelerated growth and improved mineralization and the cortical bone, but it failed in normalizing growth plate and trabecular bone structures. MAPK inhibition improved growth and rickets and, notably, almost normalized the growth plate organization. The administration of a MAPK pathway inhibitor plus GH was the most beneficial treatment because of the positive synergistic effect on growth plate and bone structures. Thus, the growth-promoting effect of GH is likely linked to increased risk of bone deformities, whereas the association of GH and MAPK inhibition emerges as a promising new therapy for children with XLH.-Fuente, R., Gil-Peña, H., Claramunt-Taberner, D., Hernández-Frías, O., Fernández-Iglesias, Á., Alonso-Durán, L., Rodríguez-Rubio, E., Hermida-Prado, F., Anes-González, G., Rubio-Aliaga, I., Wagner, C., Santos, F.

https://openalex.org/W2936412865,"The differential contribution of maternal and paternal acceptance-rejection to children’s psychological adjustment has been explained by differences in interpersonal power and prestige within families; however, there is not yet enough empirical support for this explanation. This study examines the moderating effects of interpersonal power and prestige on the relationship between perceived parental acceptance-rejection and psychological adjustment across children’s sex and age. The sample was composed of 913 children ranging in age from 9 to 16 years. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses in the total sample showed a significant and independent contribution of parental acceptance-rejection and parental power and prestige. No moderating effects of interpersonal power and prestige were found for the total sample. However, when the regression analyses were conducted across different age groups, maternal acceptance had a higher contribution to psychological adjustment in children from nine to ten years old. Interestingly, the moderating effects of interpersonal prestige (not interpersonal power) were also significant in younger participants. Furthermore, the moderating effects of prestige on maternal acceptance-rejection were different in late childhood than in early adolescence. These results suggest how parental prestige may explain the higher contribution of maternal acceptance to younger children’s psychological adjustment."
https://openalex.org/W2936759863,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is marked by arteriovenous fusion comprising hepatic vascular malformations (HVaMs) with the chance of bleeding.We investigated HVaMs in HHT patients by combination of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with perfusion imaging quantification to be able to sub-classify a high risk cohort of asymptomatic HHT patients.The imaging characteristics on CEUS in 34 patients (aged 21-84 years; mean 58.9) with HHT were retrospectively evaluated. Real-time contrast harmonic imaging, sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubbles and motion adjustment were utilized. Cine loops of the liver were digital stored, perfusion was quantified using a software reading DICOM data`s.HVaMs were diagnosed in 31 out of 34 patients. Significant uppermost peak enhancement (PE), wash-in area under the curve (WiAUC) and wash-in perfusion index (WiPI) were identified in the shunt region (100%), next in the hilar region (PE 32.6%; WiAUC 33.9%; WiPI 34.1%), and the lowest in the hepatic parenchyma (PE 10.2%; WiAUC 12.0%; WiPI 9.5%). The perfusion parameters in the shunt region compared to the other regions were significantly increased in one subgroup of patients. Consistent with this, the intrahepatic portal vein diameter and Buscarini grading was significantly higher, while portal vein peak velocity was significantly lower in this patient subset. By statistical analysis, we could correlate PE and WiPI to these clinical parameters, while WiAUC showed no clinical association.For the first time we combined CEUS findings with motion adjustment software to quantitative determine perfusion parameters of a cohort of HHT patients. Hereby, we could identify a subset of HHT patients with two markedly increased parameter values in the shunt region compared to the hilus/hepatic parenchyma. This could contribute to sub-classify a high-risk group of HHT patients with therapeutic indication."
https://openalex.org/W2936898442,"Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a chronic condition diagnosed based on the presence of symptoms, such as suprapubic/ pelvic pain, pressure or discomfort in association with urgency and increased urinary frequency. Confusable diseases must be excluded. However, there is no objective test or marker to establish the presence of the disease. Diagnosis and patient management is often difficult, given the poor understanding of IC pathogenesis and its unknown etiology and genetics. As an attempt to find biomarkers related to IC, we assessed the association between 20 selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) with IC and pain severity.To assess the presence of SNPs in IC patients' blood samples and correlate them with the disease and chronic pain condition.A case-control study was conducted. We selected 34 female patients with IC diagnosed according to NIDDK criteria and 23 patients in the control group (previously healthy women with only stress urinary incontinence). IC patients were allocated into two groups according to reported chronic pain severity. We selected the following SNPs for analysis: rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs1800471, rs1800629, rs361525, rs1800497, rs6311, rs6277, rs6276, rs6313, rs2835859, rs11127292, rs2243248, rs6887695, rs3212227, rs1799971, rs12579350, rs3813034, and rs6746030. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR (q-PCR).The polymorphic allele of SNP rs11127292 exhibited a higher frequency in subjects with IC than in controls (p:0.01). The polymorphic allele of SNP rs6311 was more frequent in patients with severe pain (p:0.03). The frequency of the wild-type allele of SNP rs1799971 was higher in patients with mild to moderate pain (p:0.04).The results indicated differences in SNP frequency among subjects, suggesting that SNPs could serve either as a marker of IC or as a marker of pain severity in IC patients. The study showed promising results regarding IC and polymorphism associations. These associations have not been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2938371473,"We investigated the significance of MUC21 in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Two-hundred forty-one surgically resected LADCs (116 EGFR-mutated and 125 wild-type tumors) were examined for immunohistochemical expression of MUC21 protein. A polyclonal antibody and two monoclonal antibodies (heM21C and heM21D) that bind differentially glycosylated MUC21 epitopes were used, and MUC21 proteins detected by these antibodies were named MUC21P, MUC21C, and MUC21D, respectively. MUC21 mRNA levels were semi-quantified and classified into ""high"" and ""low"". Among the immunohistochemical expression detected by three different antibodies, high expressors tended to be related to EGFR mutations. The three varieties of the immunohistochemical expressions were related to different histological elements in the EGFR-mutated LADCs. Either MUC21P or MUC21C high expressors had a higher proportion of lepidic elements with low papillary structure and micropapillary elements. MUC21D high expressors had a significantly higher proportion of micropapillary elements (Mann-Whitney test P ≤0.0001). Furthermore, MUC21D high expressors showed high incidence of lymphatic canal invasion and lymph node metastasis (Pearson x2 test, P = 0.0021, P = 0.0125), and a significantly higher recurrence rate (5-year recurrence-free survival 50.7% vs. 73.8%, log-rank test P = 0.0495). MUC21 proteins with a specific glycosylation status may be involved in the progression of EGFR-mutated LADCs, particularly at the stage where tumors are transforming from pure lepidic to micropapillary through low papillary lepidic lesions."

Current risk assessment methods are limited by the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose an online method that overcomes this tradeoff based on multimedia data (e.g. videos data from surveillance cameras) and deep learning. The method consists of two parts. The first estimates the evacuee position as input for training the assessment model to then perform risk assessment in real scenarios. The second considers a social force model based on the evacuation simulation for the output of training model. We verify the proposed method in simulation and real scenarios. Model sensitivity analyses and large-scale tests demonstrate the usability and superiority of the proposed method. By the method, the computation time of risk assessment could be decreased from 10 minutes (by traditional simulation method) to 2.18 s."
https://openalex.org/W2939268817,"Background Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and longer-term morbidity. Acute chorioamnionitis (ACA) is a common cause of PTB, however, there are limited data on the prevalence of ACA and its association with PTB in resource limited settings. Methods Data and samples came from a clinical trial evaluating novel strategies for the prevention of malaria in HIV infected pregnant women in Uganda. Women were enrolled between 12–28 weeks of gestation and followed through delivery. For each placenta delivered, three placental tissue types (membrane roll, umbilical cord and chorionic plate/villous parenchyma) were collected. Slides were assessed for diagnosis of maternal and fetal ACA by microscopic evaluation of neutrophilic infiltration using a standardized grading scale. The primary outcomes were PTB (<37 weeks), low birth weight (LBW, <2500 grams), and small-for-gestational age (SGA, birth weight <10th percentile for age). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to estimate associations between 1) maternal characteristics (age, education, wealth, gravidity, gestational age at enrollment, placental malaria, anti-malarial prophylaxis treatment regimen, HIV disease parameters) and ACA, and 2) associations between ACA and adverse birth outcomes. Findings A total of 193 placentas were included in the analysis. The prevalence of maternal and fetal ACA was 44.5% and 28.0%, respectively. HIV infected women between 28–43 years of age had a higher risk of maternal ACA compared to those between 17–21 years of age (50.9% vs. 19.1%; aOR = 4.00 (1.10–14.5), p = 0.04) and the diagnosis of severe maternal ACA was associated with a significantly higher risk of PTB (28.6% vs. 6.0%; aOR = 6.04 (1.87–19.5), p = 0.003), LBW (33.3% vs. 9.4%; aOR = 4.86 (1.65–14.3); p = 0.004), and SGA (28.6% vs. 10.1%; aOR = 3.70 (1.20–11.4), p = 0.02). No maternal characteristics were significantly associated with fetal ACA and the diagnosis of fetal ACA was not associated with adverse birth outcomes. Conclusions Histological evidence of severe maternal ACA was associated with an increased risk of PTB, LBW, and SGA in HIV infected, pregnant Ugandan women."

The rates of growth in weight and length in preterm infants was greater than those in term infants, especially from the first to sixth month. The rates were higher in males compared to females in the first 3 months. The differences of weight and length between preterm and term infants decreased with increasing age, however, these measurements did not reach the level of their term peers until 12 months before adjusting for gestational age. The median values of weight and length were even larger in preterm infants in the first month after adjusting for gestational age."

Outcomes were investigated through a parental questionnaire. The primary outcome was the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire score and secondary outcomes were cerebral palsy and impaired head growth.Response rates were 50% (163 of 328) and 36% (237 of 652) among children with and without necrotizing enterocolitis, respectively. There was a higher rate of abnormal Strength and Difficulties score (23.9 versus 17.8%), moderate/severe cerebral palsy (3.1 versus 0.9%) and small head circumference for age (11.7 versus 7.2%) among children with necrotizing enterocolitis. However, these differences were all statistically insignificant and did not change significantly by adjustment for potential confounders.To our knowledge, this study includes the largest cohort of necrotizing enterocolitis children evaluated for possible long-term complications at school age. The increased risks of behavioural- and neurodevelopmental impairments were statistically insignificant, moderate in magnitude and may be of little clinical importance for management in the neonatal period or when planning follow-up."

However, the exact role of Src-1 and Twist1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is uncertain. In this study, we investigated the possible prognostic value and biological effect of Src-1 and Twist1 in NPC. Src-1 and Twist1 expression was detected in a cohort of NPC patients (n = 134) by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used comparing overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Biologic effect of Src-1 and Twist1 in NPC cell lines was evaluated by western blot, colony formation assay, soft agar assay, scratch wound healing assay, transwell invasion assay and tumor xenografts growth. We have found that Src-1 and Twist1 were aberrantly upregulated in human NPC tissues, and associated with advanced tumor stage, distant metastasis and unfavorable prognosis. Knockdown of Src-1 or Twist1 in human NPC cell line CNE-1 suppressed colony formation, anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, invasion and tumor xenografts growth, while enforced expression of Src-1 or Twist1 in human NPC cell line HNE-2 promotes anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and invasion. In addition, Src-1 and Twist1 could suppress E-cadherin expression and increase Vimentin expression, thus suggested that Src-1 and Twist1 enhanced the malignant behaviors of NPC cells via inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data indicated that Src-1 and Twist1 could be possible prognostic biomarkers and potential therapy targets for patients with NPC."

Materials and methods Blood samples of 23 patients (18 men and five women, mean age 62.9 ± 10.6 years), were collected immediately before (pre-PCI), immediately after (post-PCI), and on the day following PCI (1d-PCI). Lactoferrin, LL-37 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assayed in plasma, in addition to cortisol and chromogranin A (CgA), as well as CK, ASAT and ALAT. Total and differential leukocyte counts were also analysed. Results At all the three time points, the monocyte fractions, the monocyte-to-lymphocyte and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and CgA levels were elevated. We detected significant peri-procedural changes in the plasma levels of our PNI markers: IL-6 (p<0.05), lactoferrin, LL-37 (both: p <0.0001), CgA, (p<0.05), and cortisol (p<0.01). On the first day after PCI, highly significant associations were found of ASAT with IL-6 and neutrophil count (both: r>0.75, p<0.0001), and of CgA with neutrophil count and monocyte count (both: r>0.79, p<0.0001); furthermore, cortisol was also associated with neutrophil count (r>0.7, p<0.0001). Conclusions The findings suggest that myocardial damage could correlate not only with an inflammatory reaction but, via neutrophil count, also with increased level of stress in stable CAD after PCI. Furthermore, 1d-PCI neutrophil count may serve as an easy-to-obtain integrative PNI measure in stable CAD."

One tool that can help us better understand these specializations and interactions is a set of visual stimuli that do not differ along low-level dimensions (e.g., orientation, contrast) but do differ along high-level dimensions, such as whether a real-world object can be detected. The present work creates a set of line segment-based images that are matched for luminance, contrast, and orientation distribution (both for single elements and for pair-wise combinations) but result in a range of object and non-object percepts. Image generation started with images of isolated objects taken from publicly available databases and then progressed through 3-stages: a computer algorithm generating 718 candidate images, expert observers selecting 217 for further consideration, and naïve observers performing final ratings. This process identified a set of 100 images that all have the same low-level properties but cover a range of recognizability (proportion of naïve observers (N = 120) who indicated that the stimulus ""contained a known object"") and semantic stability (consistency across the categories of living, non-living/manipulable, and non-living/non-manipulable when the same observers named ""known"" objects).

https://openalex.org/W2938692642,"The S. cerevisiae Pop2 protein is an exonuclease in the Ccr4-Not complex that is a conserved regulator of gene expression. Pop2 regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally by shortening the poly(A) tail of mRNA. A previous study has shown that Pop2 is phosphorylated at threonine 97 (T97) by Yak1 protein kinase in response to glucose limitation. However, the physiological importance of Pop2 phosphorylation remains unknown. In this study, we found that Pop2 is phosphorylated at serine 39 (S39) under unstressed conditions. The dephosphorylation of S39 was occurred rapidly after glucose depletion, and the addition of glucose to the glucose-deprived culture recovered this phosphorylation, suggesting that Pop2 phosphorylation at S39 is regulated by glucose. This glucose-regulated phosphorylation of Pop2 at S39 is dependent on Pho85 kinase. We previously reported that Pop2 takes a part in the cell wall integrity pathway by regulating LRG1 mRNA; however, S39 phosphorylation of Pop2 is not involved in LRG1 expression. On the other hand, Pop2 phosphorylation at S39 is involved in the expression of HSP12 and HSP26, which encode a small heat shock protein. In the medium supplemented with glucose, Pop2 might be phosphorylated at S39 by Pho85 kinase, and this phosphorylation contributes to repress the expression of HSP12 and HSP26. Glucose starvation inactivated Pho85, which resulted in the derepression of HSP12 and HSP26, together with other glucose sensing mechanisms. Our results suggest that Pho85-dependent phosphorylation of Pop2 is a part of the glucose sensing system in yeast."

Patients were followed according to routine practice and response assessment was performed using RECIST 1.1. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included best confirmed overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS). Adverse events were recorded. An independent dataset was used to validate the results.In all, 59 patients were screened, 57 enrolled, and 54 (36 men; median age 65 years) included in the per-protocol analysis. Median PFS was 1.8 (95% CI 1.4-2.6) months, with 11% (95% CI 5-21%) alive and progression-free at 6 months. The ORR was 0.0% (97.5% CI 0.0-6.8%) and the DCR 34.6% (95% CI 21.9-49.0%).

https://openalex.org/W2937743526,"SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, protects neurons in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative disease. We have previously described a neuroprotective effect by SIRT1 independent of its catalytic activity. To confirm this conclusion we tested a panel of SIRT1 deletion mutant constructs, designated Δ1–Δ10, in cerebellar granule neurons induced to undergo apoptosis by low potassium treatment. We find that deletions of its N-terminal, those lacking portions of the catalytic domain, as well as one that lacks the ESA (Essential for SIRT1 Activity) motif, are as protective as wild-type SIRT1. In contrast, deletion of the region spanning residues 542–609, construct Δ8, substantially reduced the neuroprotective activity of SIRT1. As observed with LK-induced apoptosis, all SIRT1 constructs except Δ8 protect neurons against mutant huntingtin toxicity. Although its own catalytic activity is not required, neuroprotection by SIRT1 is abolished by inhibitors of Class I HDACs as well as by knockdown of endogenous HDAC1. We find that SIRT1 interacts with HDAC1 and this interaction is greatly increased by deleting regions of SIRT1 necessary for its catalytic activity. However, SIRT1-mediated protection is not dependent on HDAC1 deacetylase activity. Although other studies have described that catalytic activity of SIRT1 mediates is neuroprotective effect, our study suggests that in cerebellar granule neurons its deacetylase activity is not important and that HDAC1 contributes to the neuroprotective effect of SIRT1."
https://openalex.org/W2937406892,"In this paper, we put forward a real-time multiple GPUs (multi-GPU) accelerated virtual-reality interaction simulation framework where the reconstructed objects from camera images interact with virtual deformable objects. Firstly, based on an extended voxel-based visual hull (VbVH) algorithm, we design an image-based 3D reconstruction platform for real objects. Then, an improved hybrid deformation model, which couples the geometry constrained fast lattice shape matching method (FLSM) and total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLED) algorithm, is proposed to achieve efficient and stable simulation of the virtual objects' elastic deformations. Finally, one-way virtual-reality interactions including soft tissues' virtual cutting with bleeding effects are successfully simulated. Moreover, with the purpose of significantly improving the computational efficiency of each time step, we propose an entire multi-GPU implementation method of the framework using compute unified device architecture (CUDA). The experiment results demonstrate that our multi-GPU accelerated virtual-reality interaction framework achieves real-time performance under the moderate calculation scale, which is a new effective 3D interaction technique for virtual reality applications."
https://openalex.org/W2939499837,"Both close inbreeding and distant outbreeding may reduce fitness below the level of individuals with intermediate parental relatedness. In the haplodiploid plant-inhabiting predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, which is patchily distributed within and among host plants, fitness is indeed reduced in the short term, i.e. by a single generation of inbreeding. However, in the medium to long term (multiple generations), distant out-breeding should provide for favorable demographic founder effects in isolated populations. We tested this prediction in isolated experimental lineages founded by females mated to a sibling (close inbreeding), a male from the same population (intermediate relatedness) or a male from another population (distant outbreeding) and monitored lineage growth and persistence over four generations. Cross-generationally, lineages founded by distantly outbred females performed the best, i.e. produced the most descendants. However, this was solely due to superior performance from the F2 generation onwards, whereas in the F1 generation, lineages founded by females mated to males from their own population (intermediate relatedness) performed the best, as predicted from short-term in- and out-breeding depression effects. At the genetic level, this result was most likely due to distantly outbred founders introducing higher allelic variability and lower homozygosity levels, counterbalancing inbreeding depression, which inevitably occurs in isolated lineages, from the F2 generation onwards."
https://openalex.org/W2939617988,"This study sought to determine the prevalence of significant liver disease in those subjects with serum alanine aminotransferase levels in the range between the current and the newly suggested upper limit of normal (termed the delta range). The files of the previous study subjects (who underwent at least one alanine aminotransferase measurement in 2002 and followed to 2012) were reviewed for a diagnosis of chronic liver disease; aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index, FIB-4 and alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ratio were used to evaluate liver fibrosis. The prevalence of significant liver disease, by diagnoses and fibrosis scores was compared between subjects with alanine aminotransferase levels in the delta range (men, 42–45 IU/L; women, 26–34 IU/L) and in the newly suggested normal range (men, 15–42 IU/L; women, 10–26 IU/L). The cohort included 49,634 subjects (41% male, mean age 83±6 years) of whom 2022 were diagnosed with chronic liver disease including 366 with cirrhosis. Compared to subjects with alanine aminotransferase levels in the newly suggested normal range, subjects with alanine aminotransferase levels in the delta range had a significantly higher rate of chronic liver disease (men, 15.3% vs. 4.9%; women, 7.8% vs. 3.3%) and of cirrhosis specifically (men, 4.2% vs. 0.9%; women, 1.5% vs. 0.4%) and also had higher mean fibrosis scores (P <0.001 for all). Lowering the current upper limit of normal of serum alanine aminotransferase may help to identify elderly patients at risk of significant liver disease."
