https://openalex.org/W1974707207,"Let us consider, then, some general conclusions that may be drawn from the findings reported in this study. The data allow us to question the view stated by Ortega, Florey, and others that large numbers of average scientists contribute substantially to the advance of science through their research. It seems, rather, that a relatively small number of physicists produce work that becomes the base for future discoveries in physics. We have found that even papers of relatively minor significance have used to a disproportionate degree the work of the eminent scientists. Although the conclusions of this paper may be reasonably clear, the implications of these data for the structure of scientific activity, at least in physics, need careful consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2040695383,"Growing algal and bacterial stromatolites composed of nearly amorphous silica occur around hot springs and geysers in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Some Precambrian stromatolites may be bacterial rather than algal, which has important implications in atmospheric evolution, since bacterial photosynthesis does not release oxygen. Conophyton stromatolites were thought to have become extinct at the end of the Precambrian, but are still growing in hot spring effluents."

This curve demonstrates again the unusualness of the present interval of high temperature within the framework of Quaternary climatic evolution, and the need for a close study of man's impact on climate."
https://openalex.org/W2038354028,"Very-long-baseline interferometry experiments, involving observations of extragalactic radio sources, were performed in 1969 to determine the vector separations between antenna sites in Massachusetts and West Virginia. The 845.130-kilometer baseline was estimated from two separate experiments. The results agreed with each other to within 2 meters in all three components and with a special geodetic survey to within 2 meters in length; the differences in baseline direction as determined by the survey and by interferometry corresponded to discrepancies of about 5 meters. The experiments also yielded positions for nine extragalactic radio sources, most to within 1 arc second, and allowed the hydrogen maser clocks at the two sites to be synchronized a posteriori with an uncertainty of only a few nanoseconds."
https://openalex.org/W2056640336,"In blinded Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) encephalic photoreception of the stimulus from long photoperiods is sufficient to induce and maintain normal gonadal function in females (egg laying) and in males (enlargement of the cloacal gland). However, the termination of sexual activity by short days is dependent on these birds having experienced long days at the time of blinding."
https://openalex.org/W2037420780,A flume 60 feet (18.28 meters) long was employed to study the controls of lateral and vertical incision of a sinuous stream in simulated bedrock. When 100 percent of the available sediment load was entrained the flow incised vertically at bends. When less than 100 percent of the load was entrained the flow downcut laterally outward at bends. The effects of helicoidal currents and shear stress localization explain the loci of erosion and deposition.
https://openalex.org/W2053040420,Measurements of the range to the Beacon Explorer C spacecraft from a single laser tracking system at Goddard Space Flight Center have been used to determine the change in latitude of the station arising from polar motion. A precision of 0.03 arc second was obtained for the latitude during a 5-month period in 1970.
https://openalex.org/W1980401681,"An extract of radial nerves of the sea urchin. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, induces spawning within 1 minute in this species as well as in other echinoids, but a delayed spawning in several asteroid species. The concentration of the spawn-inducing factor in the radial nerves fluctuates annually correlated with the reproductive season of this species along the coast of southern California."
https://openalex.org/W2061807807,"Very-long-baseline interferometric observations of radio signals from the TACSAT synchronous satellite, even though extending over only 7 hours, have enabled an excellent orbit to be deduced. Precision in differenced delay and delay-rate measurements reached 0.15 nanosecond ( approximately 5 centimeters in equivalent differenced distance) and 0.05 picosecond per second ( approximately 0.002 centimeter per second in equivalent differenced velocity), respectively. The results from this initial three-station experiment demonstrate the feasibility of using the method for accurate satellite tracking and for geodesy. Comparisons are made with other techniques."
