https://openalex.org/W2170685293,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs), or tumor-initiating cells, are involved in tumor progression and metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate both normal stem cells and CSCs, and dysregulation of miRNAs has been implicated in tumorigenesis. CSCs in many tumors--including cancers of the breast, pancreas, head and neck, colon, small intestine, liver, stomach, bladder and ovary--have been identified using the adhesion molecule CD44, either individually or in combination with other marker(s). Prostate CSCs with enhanced clonogenic and tumor-initiating and metastatic capacities are enriched in the CD44(+) cell population, but whether miRNAs regulate CD44(+) prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer metastasis remains unclear. Here we show, through expression analysis, that miR-34a, a p53 target, was underexpressed in CD44(+) prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft and primary tumors. Enforced expression of miR-34a in bulk or purified CD44(+) prostate cancer cells inhibited clonogenic expansion, tumor regeneration, and metastasis. In contrast, expression of miR-34a antagomirs in CD44(-) prostate cancer cells promoted tumor development and metastasis. Systemically delivered miR-34a inhibited prostate cancer metastasis and extended survival of tumor-bearing mice. We identified and validated CD44 as a direct and functional target of miR-34a and found that CD44 knockdown phenocopied miR-34a overexpression in inhibiting prostate cancer regeneration and metastasis. Our study shows that miR-34a is a key negative regulator of CD44(+) prostate cancer cells and establishes a strong rationale for developing miR-34a as a novel therapeutic agent against prostate CSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2089924497,"H3K27 methylation mediated by the histone methyltransferase complex PRC2 is critical for transcriptional regulation, Polycomb silencing, Drosophila segmentation, mammalian X chromosome inactivation, and cancer. PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation can spread along the chromatin and propagate the repressive chromatin environment; thus, chromatin components that antagonize the activity of PRC2 are important for restraining Polycomb silencing. Here we report that in HeLa cells, H3 histones unmethylated at Lys-36 are mostly methylated at Lys-27, with the exception of newly synthesized H3. In addition, K27me3 rarely co-exists with K36me2 or K36me3 on the same histone H3 polypeptide. Moreover, PRC2 activity is greatly inhibited on nucleosomal substrates with preinstalled H3K36 methylation. These findings collectively identify H3K36 methylation as a chromatin component that restricts the PRC2-mediated spread of H3K27 methylation. Finally, we provide evidence that the controversial histone lysine methyltransferase Ash1, a known Trithorax group protein that antagonizes Polycomb silencing in vivo, is an H3K36-specific dimethylase, not an H3K4 methylase, further supporting the role of H3K36 methylation in antagonizing PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2050775180,"The essential mammalian enzyme O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, here OGT) couples metabolic status to the regulation of a wide variety of cellular signalling pathways by acting as a nutrient sensor. OGT catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serines and threonines of cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins, including numerous transcription factors, tumour suppressors, kinases, phosphatases and histone-modifying proteins. Aberrant glycosylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetic complications, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Despite the importance of OGT, the details of how it recognizes and glycosylates its protein substrates are largely unknown. We report here two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8 Å resolution) and as a ternary complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95 Å). The structures provide clues to the enzyme mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique domain between the two halves of the catalytic region. This information will accelerate the rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT's functions; it will also help the design of inhibitors for use as cellular probes and help to assess its potential as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2041736631,"The current diagnosis of acute kidney injury involves the measurement of renal biomarkers, such as serum creatinine, which provide a crude means of detecting cellular stress and injury. To determine whether Ngal expression provides an alternate renal biomarker capable of detecting the initial phases of renal injury, Paragas et al. have developed an Ngal reporter mouse that offers a noninvasive and real-time method for the continuous and quantitative reporting of cell stress and injury at the injury site. Many proteins have been proposed to act as surrogate markers of organ damage, yet for many candidates the essential biomarker characteristics that link the protein to the injured organ have not yet been described. We generated an Ngal reporter mouse by inserting a double-fusion reporter gene encoding luciferase-2 and mCherry (Luc2-mC) into the Ngal (Lcn2) locus. The Ngal-Luc2-mC reporter accurately recapitulated the endogenous message and illuminated injuries in vivo in real time. In the kidney, Ngal-Luc2-mC imaging showed a sensitive, rapid, dose-dependent, reversible, and organ- and cell-specific relationship with tubular stress, which correlated with the level of urinary Ngal (uNgal). Unexpectedly, specific cells of the distal nephron were the source of uNgal. Cells isolated from Ngal-Luc2-mC mice also revealed both the onset and the resolution of the injury, and the actions of NF-κB inhibitors and antibiotics during infection. Thus, imaging of Ngal-Luc2-mC mice and cells identified injurious and reparative agents that affect kidney damage."

https://openalex.org/W2043051674,"Agata Smogorzewska and colleagues report mutations in SLX4 in a new subtype of Fanconi anemia. SLX4 is an endonuclease involved in DNA maintenance and repair. Fanconi anemia is a rare recessive disorder characterized by genome instability, congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure and predisposition to hematologic malignancies and solid tumors1. At the cellular level, hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinks is the defining feature in Fanconi anemia2. Mutations in thirteen distinct Fanconi anemia genes3 have been shown to interfere with the DNA-replication–dependent repair of lesions involving crosslinked DNA at stalled replication forks4. Depletion of SLX4, which interacts with multiple nucleases and has been recently identified as a Holliday junction resolvase5,6,7, results in increased sensitivity of the cells to DNA crosslinking agents. Here we report the identification of biallelic SLX4 mutations in two individuals with typical clinical features of Fanconi anemia and show that the cellular defects in these individuals' cells are complemented by wildtype SLX4, demonstrating that biallelic mutations in SLX4 (renamed here as FANCP) cause a new subtype of Fanconi anemia, Fanconi anemia-P."

https://openalex.org/W2087802228,"Direct evidence for the requirement of delay in feedback repression in the mammalian circadian clock has been elusive. Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1), an essential clock component, displays evening-time expression and serves as a strong repressor at morning-time elements (E box/E' box). In this study, we reveal that a combination of day-time elements (D box) within the Cry1-proximal promoter and night-time elements (RREs) within its intronic enhancer gives rise to evening-time expression. A synthetic composite promoter produced evening-time expression, which was further recapitulated by a simple phase-vector model. Of note, coordination of day-time with night-time elements can modulate the extent of phase delay. A genetic complementation assay in Cry1(-/-):Cry2(-/-) cells revealed that substantial delay of Cry1 expression is required to restore circadian rhythmicity, and its prolonged delay slows circadian oscillation. Taken together, our data suggest that phase delay in Cry1 transcription is required for mammalian clock function."

However, many disorders afflict tissues inaccessible to light microscopy in live subjects. Here we introduce cellular-level time-lapse imaging deep within the live mammalian brain by one- and two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy over multiple weeks. Bilateral imaging sites allowed longitudinal comparisons within individual subjects, including of normal and diseased tissues. Using this approach, we tracked CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron dendrites in adult mice, revealing these dendrites' extreme stability and rare examples of their structural alterations. To illustrate disease studies, we tracked deep lying gliomas by observing tumor growth, visualizing three-dimensional vasculature structure and determining microcirculatory speeds. Average erythrocyte speeds in gliomas declined markedly as the disease advanced, notwithstanding significant increases in capillary diameters. Time-lapse microendoscopy will be applicable to studies of numerous disorders, including neurovascular, neurological, cancerous and trauma-induced conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2007988428,"Ketan Patel and colleagues report a new mouse model of Fanconi anemia. The authors show that mice deficient in Btbd12, the mouse ortholog of SLX4 (a new Fanconi anemia gene), phenocopy the human disease. The evolutionarily conserved SLX4 protein, a key regulator of nucleases, is critical for DNA damage response. SLX4 nuclease complexes mediate repair during replication and can also resolve Holliday junctions formed during homologous recombination. Here we describe the phenotype of the Btbd12 knockout mouse, the mouse ortholog of SLX4, which recapitulates many key features of the human genetic illness Fanconi anemia. Btbd12-deficient animals are born at sub-Mendelian ratios, have greatly reduced fertility, are developmentally compromised and are prone to blood cytopenias. Btbd12−/− cells prematurely senesce, spontaneously accumulate damaged chromosomes and are particularly sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents. Genetic complementation reveals a crucial requirement for Btbd12 (also known as Slx4) to interact with the structure-specific endonuclease Xpf-Ercc1 to promote crosslink repair. The Btbd12 knockout mouse therefore establishes a disease model for Fanconi anemia and genetically links a regulator of nuclease incision complexes to the Fanconi anemia DNA crosslink repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2078985284,"Resveratrol is a polyphenolic phytoestrogen that has been shown to exhibit potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-catabolic properties. Increased osteoclastic and decreased osteoblastic activities result in bone resorption and loss of bone mass. These changes have been implicated in pathological processes in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), a member of the TNF superfamily, is a major mediator of bone loss. In this study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on RANKL during bone morphogenesis in high density bone cultures in vitro. Untreated bone-derived cell cultures produced well organized bone-like structures with a bone-specific matrix. Treatment with RANKL induced formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells that exhibited morphological features of osteoclasts. RANKL induced NF-κB activation, whereas pretreatment with resveratrol completely inhibited this activation and suppressed the activation of IκBα kinase and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. RANKL up-regulated p300 (a histone acetyltransferase) expression, which, in turn, promoted acetylation of NF-κB. Resveratrol inhibited RANKL-induced acetylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, activation of Sirt-1 (a histone deacetylase) by resveratrol induced Sirt-1-p300 association in bone-derived and preosteoblastic cells, leading to deacetylation of RANKL-induced NF-κB, inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activation, and osteoclastogenesis. Co-treatment with resveratrol activated the bone transcription factors Cbfa-1 and Sirt-1 and induced the formation of Sirt-1-Cbfa-1 complexes. Overall, these results demonstrate that resveratrol-activated Sirt-1 plays pivotal roles in regulating the balance between the osteoclastic versus osteoblastic activity result in bone formation in vitro thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential for treating osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis-related bone loss."

https://openalex.org/W2080660266,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known inhibitors of wound healing. In this study we report the novel finding that both keratinocytes in vitro and epidermis in vivo synthesize cortisol and how this synthesis regulates wound healing. We show that epidermis expresses enzymes essential for cortisol synthesis, including steroid 11 β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), and an enzyme that controls negative feedback mechanism, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11βHSD2). We also found that cortisol synthesis in keratinocytes and skin can be stimulated by ACTH and inhibited by metyrapone (CYP11B1 enzyme inhibitor). Interestingly, IL-1β, the first epidermal signal of tissue injury, induces the expression of CYP11B1 and increases cortisol production by keratinocytes. Additionally, we found induction of CYP11B1 increased production of cortisol and activation of GR pathway during wound healing ex vivo and in vivo using human and porcine wound models, respectively. Conversely, inhibition of cortisol synthesis during wound healing increases IL-1β production, suggesting that cortisol synthesis in epidermis may serve as a local negative feedback to proinflammatory cytokines. Local GCs synthesis, therefore, may provide control of the initial proinflammatory response, preventing excessive inflammation upon tissue injury.

IntroductionAcute wound healing is a complex biological process mediated by a network of signaling pathways that coordinate multiple cellular processes, including cellular migration and proliferation, ultimately leading to barrier restoration (1Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Wound healing is a tightly spatiotemporally regulated process, and changes in any component of this process can be detrimental, leading to further tissue damage or impairment of healing (2Braun S. Hanselmann C. Gassmann M.G. auf dem Keller U. Born-Berclaz C. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Werner S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5492-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 3Loots M.A. Lamme E.N.

For example, timing of inflammatory response is essential; pro-inflammatory signals are important in the early stage of healing, but they can be detrimental if they persist (4Mast B.A. Schultz G.S. Wound Repair Regen. 1996; 4: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 5Robson M.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1997; 5: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), underscoring a need for tight control of both stimulators and inhibitors during the wound healing process.Upon injury, keratinocytes are the first cells that respond (6Nickoloff B.J.

Dermatol. 1990; 94: 146S-150SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). IL-1 has an autocrine and a paracrine function; that is, to activate keratinocytes and to alert the surrounding cells and tissues. The release of IL-1 by keratinocytes, with subsequent release of additional signaling molecules (9Barrientos S. Stojadinovic O. Golinko M.S. Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. Wound Repair Regen. 2008; 16: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 10Pastar I. Stojadinovic O. Tomic-Canic M. Surg. Technol. Int. 2008; 17: 105-112PubMed Google Scholar), demarcates the proinflammatory phase of wound healing. In response to these signals, activated keratinocytes start migrating and proliferating (7Freedberg I.M. Tomic-Canic M. Komine M. Blumenberg M. J. Invest.

Sci. 1998; 17: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Successful repair after tissue injury requires resolution of inflammatory response, transitioning keratinocyte (HEK) from activated to differentiating phenotype. However, very little is known about endogenous epidermal signals that control keratinocyte activation cycle and inflammatory response.Epidermal keratinocytes have important immunologic functions (8Kupper T.S.

(14Lee B. Tomic-Canic M. Krstic - Demonacos M. Demonacos C. Molecular Mechanisms Of Action Of Steroid Hormone Receptors. Research Signpost, Kerala, India2002: 1-25Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid hormones are known products of the adrenal cortex, and their production is under control of the HPA axis (15Tsigos C. Chrousos G.P. J. Psychosom. Res. 2002; 53: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). Synthesis of GCs, aldosterone, and androgens in adrenal gland proceeds through a shared pathway up to the final step. In this step, 11 β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 enzyme specific for GCs, converts 11-deoxycortisol into cortisol. It has been documented that keratinocytes indeed express different steroidogenic enzymes, StAR protein, and functional MCR2 receptor as well as and a number of components of HPA axis (CRH-R1, POMC, ACTH) (16Rousseau K.

In the acute phase of immune response to injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 act on the hypothalamic, pituitary, or adrenal component of HPA axis causing increased release of cortisol. This cortisol in turn inhibits the synthesis of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, thus, forming a negative feedback loop (24Rhen T. Cidlowski J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). One additional local fine-tuning mechanism of cortisol activity is 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD1/11β-HSD2) enzymes, which catalyze the interconversion of hormonally active cortisol and inactive cortisone and vice versa (25Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere V.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 26Quinkler M. Stewart P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2384-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In vivo, 11β-HSD2 works predominantly as dehydrogenase, converting cortisol to inactive cortisone. Alteration in expression of these 11β-HSD isoenzymes in peripheral tissues can modify glucocorticoid action on the local level by prereceptor modulation of GCs action (27Hardy R.S. Filer A.

In addition, cholesterol, a precursor from which steroid hormones are synthesized, is produced by skin (31Davidson V.L. Sittman D.B. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed.

All major components of HPA axis (CRH, CRH-R, urocortin, POMC, ACTH, MC-R) and critical enzymes necessary for GCs synthesis are produced and identified in skin (32Thiboutot D. Jabara S.

In addition, isolated hair follicles, dermal fibroblasts, and melanocytes secrete cortisol and display HPA axis-like regulatory feedback systems (37Ito N. Ito T. Kromminga A. Bettermann A.

However, cortisol synthesis in keratinocytes and epidermis as well as its biological role has not been previously established.In this report we show that intact human epidermis expresses steroidogenic enzymes and exhibits endogenous activity of the GR-mediated pathway. Surprisingly, we found that both human keratinocytes and skin produce measurable amounts of cortisol. Cortisol synthesis can be regulated; that is, induced by ACTH or by substrate progesterone and blocked by CYP11B1 inhibitor, metyrapone. Additionally, we have found that proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 induced, whereas IGF-1 decreased production of cortisol in HEK due to changes in expression of CYP11B1. Finally, we show induction of steroidogenic enzymes, cortisol synthesis, and activation of GR in the epidermis of acute human wounds ex vivo and confirmed it in acute porcine wounds in vivo. Interestingly, inhibition of GC synthesis during wound healing increases expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 and enhances the rate of epithelialization in comparison to untreated skin. To the best of our knowledge, our results for the first time identify endogenous glucocorticoid synthesis in keratinocytes and epidermis and demonstrate its biological importance in regulation of the wound healing process.DISCUSSIONIn this report we show that epidermis represents an extra-adrenal site of glucocorticoid synthesis. Both epidermis and cultured keratinocytes synthesize cortisol in a tightly regulated manner. They express enzymes essential for its synthesis (CYP11B1), secrete cortisol, and in the intact state maintain a constitutive level of GR nuclear activity. Cortisol synthesis can be increased by stimulation with ACTH or proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and decreased by IGF-1 or metyrapone. Furthermore, epidermal GC synthesis is induced during wound healing. Simultaneous increase in CYP11B1 expression, cortisol, and hormone-activated GR-P was found in acute wounds and may serve as a possible feedback loop that attenuates initial proinflammatory response, preventing excess inflammation that can lead to further tissue damage.The idea of extra-adrenal sources of GC has emerged in recent years. Initially, it was found that the thymic epithelium can synthesize GCs in a paracrine manner, and more recently, intestinal mucosa and skin have been proposed to synthesize GCs (55Vacchio M.S.

Although very little is known about steroidogenesis in non-adrenal tissues, the concept of skin as endocrine organ is well established; it produces other hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, retinoids, and vitamin D, all of which have significant impact on its physiology and pathology (20Zouboulis C.C.

The presence of critical enzymes that participate in the steroidogenesis has been identified in aorta, intestine, and skin, suggesting the possibility of adrenal-independent GC synthesis in situ. Recently, cortisol production by fibroblasts, melanocytes, and isolated hair follicles was demonstrated in vitro (37Ito N. Ito T. Kromminga A. Bettermann A. Takigawa M. Kees F. Straub R.H. Paus R.

These layers of epidermis are the major contributors to tissue repair, as they have the highest proliferative capacity (63Li A. Pouliot N. Redvers R. Kaur P. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and, therefore, can be considered as primary targets for proinflammatory molecules. Interestingly, we found that Ca2+-induced differentiation of cultured HEK leads to decreased production of cortisol (data not shown). Our data support the notion that locally synthesized glucocorticoids may provide a specific subset of cells in the epidermis with a mechanism of negative feedback to limit the inflammation.Skin serves as a barrier to the outside world, and it is constantly exposed to different types of injuries (UV light, mechanical and chemical trauma, microbes, stress). It is in regular contact not only with foreign antigens and commensal bacteria but also with potentially dangerous pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Therefore, epidermis as the “first line of defense” has developed mechanisms of alarming the body when there is tissue damage either mechanical (wound), chemical, physical (UV), or biological (64Tomic-Canic M. Magnus S.A. Oscar M.A. David T.Rovee Maibach H.I. The Epidermis in Wound Healing. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL2004: 25-57Google Scholar). In addition, epidermis is one of the few tissues in the body without its own vascular supply, which in conjunction to its barrier maintenance function points to unique tissue characteristics. One such feature is the protective response, keratinocyte activation, which involves release of prestored IL-1β and a cascade of the timely regulated secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors (7Freedberg I.M. Tomic-Canic M. Komine M. Blumenberg M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 633-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In response, keratinocytes activate a number of processes such as proliferation and migration, differentiation, and DNA repair (11Tomic-Canic M. Komine M. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1998; 17: 167-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the mechanisms that control this rapid inflammatory response. One possibility is receptor unresponsiveness or down-regulation by a high concentration of ligand. Alternatively, factors such as IL-10, IL-RA, TGF-β1, or glucocorticoids may participate in resolution of inflammation and reversal of the activation. Glucocorticoids are known to attenuate the proinflammatory response in the body (30Stojadinovic O. Lee B. Vouthounis C. Vukelic S. Pastar I. Blumenberg M. Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4021-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 65Sapolsky R.M. Romero L.M. Munck A.U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar). It was shown that reduction in local production of GCs in intestinal epithelium increases the susceptibility of mice to compound-induced experimental colitis due to augmented immune response (56Coste A. Dubuquoy L. Barnouin R. Annicotte J.S. Magnier B. Notti M. Corazza N. Antal M.C. Metzger D. Desreumaux P. Brunner T. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13098-13103Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that keratinocytes produce GCs to allow proinflammatory signaling in a controlled, timed fashion while preventing excess inflammation, which can lead to further tissue damage and weakened repair. In our previously published data we have shown that GC treatment of HEK inhibits synthesis or signaling pathways of most cytokines and growth factors involved in the inflammatory phase of wound healing in a precise timely fashion (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-8, EGF, VEGF, INF-γ, TGFβ) (30Stojadinovic O.

We have also shown that GCs utilize a complex molecular mechanism to inhibit the effects of EGF in wound healing (49Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Vouthounis C. Lee B. Fallon J. Stallcup M. Merchant A.

Biol. 2005; 345: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that inhibition of endogenous cortisol synthesis with metyrapone during wound healing increases the expression of IL-1β compared with untreated wound. This result indicates that endogenous cortisol synthesis in skin can serve as a mechanism that limits inflammation during acute wound healing.In view of our data, we propose that GC synthesis acts as paracrine mechanism to increase the tissue level of cortisol. It is well established that the immune response to injury affects ACTH-cortisol secretion, causing increased release of cortisol as proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 act on the hypothalamic, pituitary, or adrenal component of HPA axis (24Rhen T. Cidlowski J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Our results indicate the possibility that the similar mechanism exists locally in tissues such as epidermis. In addition, constitutive epidermal cortisol synthesis changes the paradigm of inflammatory response and brings a new concept; that is, proinflammatory signals need to overcome the endogenous basic levels of GC for inflammation to occur. This further raises a number of interesting possibilities, particularly in chronic inflammatory and stress-mediated skin disorders as well as auto-immune diseases with skin manifestations.De Novo Synthesis of Glucocorticoids in Keratinocytes during Acute Wound HealingAnother surprising finding is the increased presence of CYP11B1 in the epidermis during the time course of wound healing. Interestingly, CYP11B1 protein levels were found to be gradually increasing, with the peak at 48 h post wounding. Increased levels of CYP11B1 at 48 h post wounding coupled with a similar increase of hormone-activated GR-P indicates a linked pattern where the induction of cortisol synthesis leads to the activation of the GR pathway. A possible explanation for this result is induction of cortisol synthesis by proinflammatory signals triggered by wounding.Spatiotemporal cellular organization is especially crucial in the wound healing process; thus, a tight regulatory pattern is essential. Therefore, increased levels of CYP11B1 and cortisol are resolved by 96 h post wounding. Although GCs may be useful for tight control of proinflammatory signals, the prolonged presence of high levels of cortisol would slow down or inhibit wound healing. We showed that dexamethasone treatment blocks epithelialization, whereas metyrapone treatment promotes epithelialization compared with the control wound. This control of GC synthesis during wound healing occurs at two levels. It is induced by IL-1β upon wounding, whereas it is down-regulated by IGF-1, which is released later during wound healing. It is possible that other wound-healing-mediated signals regulate CYP11B1 expression as well. In addition, down-regulation of CYP11B1 occurs by its own negative feedback loop whereby cortisol induces HSD11B1 that converts active cortisol into an inactive form.In summary, data presented in this paper describe de novo synthesis of cortisol by epidermal keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo. Epidermal keratinocytes synthesize and secrete cortisol, express CYP11B1, an enzyme important for the last step of cortisol synthesis, and show constitutive activation of the GR pathway. Furthermore, IL-1 induces the CYP11B1 enzyme and increases cortisol production by epidermis. In contrast, inhibition of cortisol synthesis increases IL-1. Cortisol levels increase upon acute epidermal injury by wounding in both human skin explants and porcine skin samples, possibly to limit initial proinflammatory response. Therefore, we propose that epidermal synthesis of cortisol in situ constitutes a negative feed-back mechanism to curb inflammatory response caused by epidermal injury. IntroductionAcute wound healing is a complex biological process mediated by a network of signaling pathways that coordinate multiple cellular processes, including cellular migration and proliferation, ultimately leading to barrier restoration (1Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Wound healing is a tightly spatiotemporally regulated process, and changes in any component of this process can be detrimental, leading to further tissue damage or impairment of healing (2Braun S. Hanselmann C. Gassmann M.G. auf dem Keller U. Born-Berclaz C. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Werner S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5492-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 3Loots M.A. Lamme E.N.

For example, timing of inflammatory response is essential; pro-inflammatory signals are important in the early stage of healing, but they can be detrimental if they persist (4Mast B.A. Schultz G.S. Wound Repair Regen. 1996; 4: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 5Robson M.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1997; 5: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), underscoring a need for tight control of both stimulators and inhibitors during the wound healing process.Upon injury, keratinocytes are the first cells that respond (6Nickoloff B.J. Naidu Y. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1994; 30: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 7Freedberg I.M. Tomic-Canic M. Komine M. Blumenberg M. J. Invest.

Dermatol. 1990; 94: 146S-150SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). IL-1 has an autocrine and a paracrine function; that is, to activate keratinocytes and to alert the surrounding cells and tissues. The release of IL-1 by keratinocytes, with subsequent release of additional signaling molecules (9Barrientos S. Stojadinovic O. Golinko M.S. Brem H. Tomic-Canic M. Wound Repair Regen. 2008; 16: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 10Pastar I. Stojadinovic O. Tomic-Canic M. Surg. Technol. Int. 2008; 17: 105-112PubMed Google Scholar), demarcates the proinflammatory phase of wound healing. In response to these signals, activated keratinocytes start migrating and proliferating (7Freedberg I.M. Tomic-Canic M. Komine M. Blumenberg M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 633-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 8Kupper T.S. J. Invest.

Intranasal immunization of mice with a fusion of a herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) antigen to an Fc fragment induces long-lasting protection after intravaginal challenge with HSV-2. Almost all infectious diseases are initiated at mucosal surfaces, yet intramuscular or subcutaneous vaccination usually provides only minimal protection at sites of infection owing to suboptimal activation of the mucosal immune system. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) mediates the transport of IgG across polarized epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces. We mimicked this process by fusing a model antigen, herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein gD, to an IgG Fc fragment. Intranasal immunization, together with the adjuvant CpG, completely protected wild-type, but not FcRn knockout, mice after intravaginal challenge with virulent HSV-2 186. This immunization strategy induced efficient mucosal and systemic antibody, B- and T-cell immune responses, with stable protection for at least 6 months after vaccination in most of the immunized animals. The FcRn-IgG transcellular transport pathway may provide a general delivery route for subunit vaccines against many mucosal pathogens."

NosL catalyzed an unprecedented carbon chain reconstitution of L-tryptophan to give MIA, showing removal of the Cα-N unit and shift of the carboxylate to the indole ring. Dissection of the enzymatic process upon the identification of products and a putative glycyl intermediate uncovered a radical-mediated, unusual fragmentation-recombination reaction. This finding unveiled a key step in radical S-AdoMet enzyme-catalyzed structural rearrangements during complex biotransformations.

In this configuration, the loop limits substrate access to the active site. Mutagenesis of the loop stimulates ASH1L histone methyltransferase activity, suggesting that ASH1L activity may be regulated through the loop from the post-SET domain.

https://openalex.org/W2150086467,"Parkinson's disease (PD) involves progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons over an extended period of time. Mitochondrial damage may lead to PD, and neurotoxins affecting mitochondria are widely used to produce degeneration of the nigrostriatal circuitry. Deletion of the mitochondrial transcription factor A gene (Tfam) in C57BL6 mouse DA neurons leads to a slowly progressing parkinsonian phenotype in which motor impairment is first observed at ~12 wk of age. L-DOPA treatment improves motor dysfunction in these ""MitoPark"" mice, but this declines when DA neuron loss is more complete. To investigate early neurobiological events potentially contributing to PD, we compared the neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of the nigrostriatal circuit in behaviorally asymptomatic 6- to 8-wk-old MitoPark mice and age-matched control littermates. Release, but not uptake of DA, was impaired in MitoPark mouse striatal brain slices, and nigral DA neurons lacked characteristic pacemaker activity compared with control mice. Also, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channel function was reduced in MitoPark DA neurons, although HCN messenger RNA was unchanged. This study demonstrates altered nigrostriatal function that precedes behavioral parkinsonian symptoms in this genetic PD model. A full understanding of these presymptomatic cellular properties may lead to more effective early treatments of PD."

Rat livers were perfused with medium containing various concentrations of insulin and/or amino acids. At fasting (1×) or 2× (2×AA) concentrations of amino acids, insulin maximally stimulated Akt phosphorylation but had no effect on global rates of protein synthesis. In the absence of insulin, 4×AA produced a moderate stimulation of protein synthesis and activation of mTORC1. The combination of 4×AA and insulin produced a maximal stimulation of protein synthesis and activation of mTORC1. These effects were accompanied by decreases in raptor and PRAS40 and an increase in RagC associated with mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The studies were extended to a cell culture model in which mTORC1 activity was repressed by deprivation of leucine and serum, and resupplementation with the amino acid and insulin acted in an additive manner to restore mTORC1 activation. In deprived cells, mTORC1 was activated by expressing either constitutively active (ca) Rheb or a caRagB·caRagC complex, and coexpression of the constructs had an additive effect. Notably, resupplementation with leucine in cells expressing caRheb or with insulin in cells expressing the caRagB·caRagC complex was as effective as resupplementation with both leucine and insulin in non-transfected cells. Moreover, changes in mTORC1 activity correlated directly with altered association of mTOR with RagB/RagC, Rheb, raptor, and PRAS40.

https://openalex.org/W2137411152,"Defects in bone homeostasis are a major health problem. Osteoclast differentiation and activation have a crucial role in bone remodeling in health and disease. Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells derived from mononuclear phagocyte progenitors. The key event in osteoclast formation is fusion of mononucleate precursors to form mature multinucleated osteclasts. Here we provide evidence of an absolute requirement for the P2X7 receptor, ATP release, and adenosine signaling in human osteoclast formation, as shown by the following findings: macrophage-colony stimulating factor/receptor activator for nuclear fac-tor-κB ligand (M-CSF/RANKL)-stimulated fusion of human monocytes is fully prevented by an anti-P2X7 mAb, by specific P2X7 pharmacological antagonists, or by inhibition of CD39/NTPDase;fusion-competent monocytes release ATP via the P2X7 receptor; accelerated degradation of released ATP by addition of either apyrase or hexokinase strongly increases fusion; removal of extracellular adenosine by adenosine deaminase blocks, while addition of exogenous adenosine strongly potentiates, fusion; and pharmacologic stimulation of the adenosine A2A receptor increases, while selective A2A blockade inhibits, fusion. These results show that the purinergic axis plays a crucial and as yet undescribed role in osteoclast formation and reconcile previous evidence advocating a keyrole for either ATP or adenosine receptors in multinucleated giant cell formation.—Pellegatti, P., Falzoni, S., Donvito, G., Lemaire, I., Di Virgilio, F.

Presenilin mediates the proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein to release β-amyloid, and mutations in presenilin can cause familial Alzheimer disease. We tested whether presenilin expression affects copper and zinc transport. Studying murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from presenilin knock-out mice or RNA interference of presenilin expression in HEK293T cells, we observed a marked decrease in saturable uptake of radiolabeled copper and zinc. Measurement of basal metal levels in 6-month-old presenilin 1 heterozygous knock-out (PS1(+/-)) mice revealed significant deficiencies of copper and zinc in several tissues, including brain. Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activity was significantly decreased in both presenilin knock-out MEFs and brain tissue of presenilin 1 heterozygous knock-out mice. In the MEFs and PS1(+/-) brains, copper chaperone of SOD1 (CCS) levels were decreased. Zinc-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity was not decreased in the PS null MEFs. These data indicate that presenilins are important for cellular copper and zinc turnover, influencing SOD1 activity, and having the potential to indirectly impact β-amyloid aggregation through metal ion clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2042488089,"The mechanisms whereby the parathyroid hormone (PTH) exerts its anabolic action on bone are incompletely understood. We previously showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 enhanced Smad3-induced bone anabolic action in osteoblasts. These findings suggested the hypothesis that changes in gene expression associated with the altered Smad3-induced signaling brought about by an ERK1/2 inhibitor would identify novel bone anabolic factors in osteoblasts. We therefore performed a comparative DNA microarray analysis between empty vector-transfected mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and PD98059-treated stable Smad3-overexpressing MC3T3-E1 cells. Among the novel factors, Tmem119 was selected on the basis of its rapid induction by PTH independent of later increases in endogenous TGF-β. The levels of Tmem119 increased with time in cultures of MC3T3-E1 cells and mouse mesenchymal ST-2 cells committed to the osteoblast lineage by BMP-2. PTH stimulated Tmem119 levels within 1 h as determined by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry in MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells stably overexpressing Tmem119 exhibited elevated levels of Runx2, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and β-catenin, whereas Tmem119 augmented BMP-2-induced Runx2 levels in mesenchymal cells. Tmem119 interacted with Runx2, Smad1, and Smad5 in C2C12 cells. In conclusion, we identified a Smad3-related factor, Tmem119, that is induced by PTH and promotes differentiation in mouse osteoblastic cells. Tmem119 is an important molecule in the pathway downstream of PTH and Smad3 signaling in osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2150637442,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are in widespread use to treat inflammatory bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Their anti-inflammatory efficacy, however, is accompanied by deleterious effects on bone, leading to GC-induced osteoporosis (GIO). These effects include up-regulation of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) ratio to promote bone-resorbing osteoclasts and include inhibition of bone-forming osteoblasts. We previously identified suppression of osteoblast differentiation by the monomer glucocorticoid receptor (GR) via the inhibition of Il11 expression as a crucial mechanism for GIO. Here we show that the GR-modulating substance compound A (CpdA), which does not induce GR dimerization, still suppresses proinflammatory cytokines in fibroblast-like synovial cells from patients with RA and in osteoblasts. In contrast to the full GR agonist dexamethasone, it does not unfavorably alter the RANKL/OPG ratio and does not affect Il11 expression and subsequent STAT3 phosphorylation in these cells. Notably, while dexamethasone inhibits osteoblast differentiation, CpdA does not affect osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

The Cpx two-component system is the global modulator of cell envelope stress in gram-negative bacteria that integrates very different signals and consists of the kinase CpxA, the regulator CpxR, and the dual function auxiliary protein CpxP. CpxP both inhibits activation of CpxA and is indispensable for the quality control system of P pili that are crucial for uropathogenic Escherichia coli during kidney colonization. How these two essential biological functions of CpxP are linked is not known. Here, we report the crystal structure of CpxP at 1.45 Å resolution with two monomers being interdigitated like ""left hands"" forming a cap-shaped dimer. Our combined structural and functional studies suggest that CpxP inhibits the kinase CpxA through direct interaction between its concave polar surface and the negatively charged sensor domain on CpxA. Moreover, an extended hydrophobic cleft on the convex surface suggests a potent substrate recognition site for misfolded pilus subunits. Altogether, the structural details of CpxP provide a first insight how a periplasmic two-component system inhibitor blocks its cognate kinase and is released from it."

In studies of the distribution of 3-hydroxyproline in type I collagen of rat bone, skin, and tail tendon by mass spectrometry, the repeating sequences of Gly-Pro-Pro (GPP) triplets at the C terminus of α1(I) and α2(I) chains were shown to be heavily 3-hydroxylated in tendon but not in skin and bone. By isolating the tryptic peptides and subjecting them to Edman sequence analysis, the presence of repeating 3-hydroxyprolines in consecutive GPP triplets adjacent to 4-hydroxyproline was confirmed as a unique feature of the tendon collagen.

https://openalex.org/W2046892973,"Chronic liver injury always progresses to fibrosis and eventually to cirrhosis, a massive health care burden worldwide. Delta-like 1 (Dlk1) is well known as an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation. However, whether it is involved in liver fibrosis remains unclear. Here, we provide the first evidence that Dlk1 is a critical contributor to liver fibrosis through promoting activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during chronic liver injury. We found that upon liver injury, Dlk1 was dramatically induced and initially expressed in hepatocytes and then into the HSCs by a paracrine manner. It leads to the activation of HSCs, which is considered to be a pivotal event in liver fibrogenesis. Two forms (∼50 and ∼25 kDa) of the Dlk1 protein were detected by Western blot analysis. In vitro administration of Dlk1 significantly promoted HSC activation, whereas in vivo knockdown of Dlk1 dramatically inhibited HSC activation and the subsequent fibrosis. The large soluble form (∼50 kDa) of Dlk1 was shown to contribute to HSC activation. We were encouraged to find the Dlk1-promoted HSC activation and liver fibrosis can be depressed by transplantation of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that FGF2 was up-regulated in BM-MSCs under injury stimulation, and it probably participated in the inhibition of Dlk1 by BM-MSCs. Our findings provide a novel role of Dlk1 in liver fibrosis leading to a better understanding of the molecular basis in fibrosis and cirrhosis and also give insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of MSC biology in liver repair.

https://openalex.org/W2126027415,"The contribution of plasminogen (Plg)/plasmin, which have claimed to be the main fibrinolytic regulators in the bone metabolism, remains unclear. This study evaluated how the absence of Plg affects the function of osteoblast (OB) and osteoclast (OC). There was a larger population of pre-OCs in bone marrow-derived cells from the Plg(-/-) mice than the population of that from the WT mice. In addition, the absence of Plg suppressed the expression of osteoprotegerin in OBs. Moreover, an exogenous plasmin clearly induced the osteoprotegerin expression in Plg(-/-) OBs. The osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 mouse monocyte/macrophage lineage cells in co-culture with OBs from the Plg(-/-) mice was significantly accelerated in comparison with that in co-culture with OBs from the WT mice. Intriguingly, the accelerated OC differentiation of RAW264.7 cells co-cultured with Plg(-/-) OBs was clearly suppressed by the treatment of an exogenous plasmin. Consequently, Plg(-/-) mice display decreased bone mineral density. These findings could eventually lead to the development of new clinical therapies for bone disease caused by a disorder of the fibrinolytic system."
https://openalex.org/W1994842701,"Leishmania parasites are pteridine auxotrophs that use an NADPH-dependent pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) and NADH-dependent quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) to salvage and maintain intracellular pools of tetrahydrobiopterin (H(4)B). However, the African trypanosome lacks a credible candidate QDPR in its genome despite maintaining apparent QDPR activity. Here we provide evidence that the NADH-dependent activity previously reported by others is an assay artifact. Using an HPLC-based enzyme assay, we demonstrate that there is an NADPH-dependent QDPR activity associated with both TbPTR1 and LmPTR1. The kinetic properties of recombinant PTR1s are reported at physiological pH and ionic strength and compared with LmQDPR. Specificity constants (k(cat)/K(m)) for LmPTR1 are similar with dihydrobiopterin (H(2)B) and quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qH(2)B) as substrates and about 20-fold lower than LmQDPR with qH(2)B. In contrast, TbPTR1 shows a 10-fold higher k(cat)/K(m) for H(2)B over qH(2)B. Analysis of Trypanosoma brucei isolated from infected rats revealed that H(4)B (430 nM, 98% of total biopterin) was the predominant intracellular pterin, consistent with a dual role in the salvage and regeneration of H(4)B. Gene knock-out experiments confirmed this: PTR1-nulls could only be obtained from lines overexpressing LmQDPR with H(4)B as a medium supplement. These cells grew normally with H(4)B, which spontaneously oxidizes to qH(2)B, but were unable to survive in the absence of pterin or with either biopterin or H(2)B in the medium. These findings establish that PTR1 has an essential and dual role in pterin metabolism in African trypanosomes and underline its potential as a drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2008077045,"The vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) plays a major role in organelle acidification and works together with other ion transporters to maintain pH homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. We analyzed a requirement for V-ATPase activity in protein trafficking in the yeast secretory pathway. Deficiency of V-ATPase activity caused by subunit deletion or glucose deprivation results in missorting of newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins Pma1 and Can1 directly from the Golgi to the vacuole. Vacuolar mislocalization of Pma1 is dependent on Gga adaptors although no Pma1 ubiquitination was detected. Proper cell surface targeting of Pma1 was rescued in V-ATPase-deficient cells by increasing the pH of the medium, suggesting that missorting is the result of aberrant cytosolic pH. In addition to mislocalization of the plasma membrane proteins, Golgi membrane proteins Kex2 and Vrg4 are also missorted to the vacuole upon loss of V-ATPase activity.

The yeast plasma membrane ATPase, Pma1, is an electrogenic proton pump that regulates intracellular pH and generates the membrane potential across the plasma membrane. Pma1 is a member of the conserved P-type ATPase family. Because Pma1 is abundant and its activity at the cell surface is essential for cell viability (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), it has served as a model polytopic membrane protein to study protein sorting and quality control in the secretory pathway.

Zhao X. Ramos-Castaneda J. Chang A. Traffic. 2002; 3: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Misfolded Pma1–7 (P434A,G789S) is impaired in plasma membrane targeting and routed instead from Golgi to the endosomal/vacuolar system for degradation (3Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, misfolded Pma1–10 (A165G,V197I) fails to remain stable at the cell surface and undergoes vacuolar degradation through endocytosis (5Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9104-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that wild-type Pma1 is associated with sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains, and both plasma membrane targeting of Pma1 and its stability at the cell surface require sphingolipids (6Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Toulmay A. Schneiter R. Biochimie. 2007; 89: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is a second proton pump, mechanistically distinct from Pma1, that plays a major role in maintaining pH homeostasis (8Catty P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The importance of V-ATPase for acidification of the vacuole/lysosomes, Golgi, and endosomes of eukaryotic cells is well established (10Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 11Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast with Pma1, which is thought to function as a homohexamer (12Kühlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), V-ATPase is composed of two multisubunit subcomplexes, the peripheral catalytic V1 subcomplex and the integral membrane proton-translocating V0 subcomplex (11Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). V-ATPase biogenesis is complex and incompletely understood. Assembly of V1 and V0 sector subunits require a protein complex called RAVE (regulator of the (H+)-ATPase of vacuolar and endosomal membranes), which also regulates V-ATPase activity in response to low extracellular glucose by reversible disassembly of V1 and V0 sectors (13Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A recent structure-function study noted significant vacuolar alkalization and cytosolic acidification in cells lacking the V0 subunits Vma2 or Vma3 (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Pma1 was also mislocalized to the vacuole in vma2Δ and vma3Δ cells (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because Pma1 and V-ATPase work together to maintain cellular pH homeostasis, we carried out studies on vacuolar sorting of Pma1 in V-ATPase-deficient cells. We find missorting is not specific to Pma1; rather, there is cargo-specific missorting from the Golgi that is induced by aberrant pH in cells defective in V-ATPase activity. Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described (15Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 523-585Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (16Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A.

Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For Western blot, cell lysates were prepared by vortexing with glass beads in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as described previously (27Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Samples were normalized to lysate protein by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot. Cells bearing pMET25-HA-PMA1 or pMET25-HA-pma1–7 were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 600 μm methionine. Mid-log cells were harvested, washed once with water, and resuspended in methionine-free medium for 3 h to derepress synthesis of HA-Pma1. Cells were shifted to 37 °C during derepression as Pma1–7 is temperature-sensitive (4Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For detection of ubiquitination, cells were harvested and lysed in the presence of 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Immunoprecipitations with anti-HA antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ) were with 200 μg of lysate protein in RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitations were analyzed by Western blot with anti-ubiquitin (1 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), as described (28Swerdlow P.S. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After chemiluminescence detection, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-HA antibody. For analysis of invertase and Bgl2 secretion, mid-log phase cells were cultured in YPD medium at 25 °C (or shifted to 37 °C for 1 h for the sec14–3 temperature-sensitive mutant). Invertase was induced by resuspending cells in low glucose medium (YEP plus 0.1% glucose) for 5 h. Cells and media were collected, and cells were spheroplasted with 0.1 mg/ml zymolyase at 37 °C for 30 min. Internal and external fractions were analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-invertase (Scott D. Emr, Cornell University) and anti-Bgl2 antibody (Patrick Brennwald, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Cells were grown overnight in minimal medium to mid-log phase. Cells were resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 1 A600/ml and incubated at room temperature for 10 min before pulse-labeling with Expre35S35S (0.4 mCi/A600 cells) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were labeled for 5 min before chase with an equal volume of synthetic complete (SC) medium supplemented with 20 mm methionine and cysteine. At various times of chase, aliquots were removed and added to 10 mm azide on ice. Lysate was prepared by vortexing with glass beads (27Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitations were normalized to acid-precipitable cpm. Immunoprecipitations with anti-Pma1, anti-carboxypeptidase Y (CPY, Rockland Immunochemicals), or anti-carboxypeptidase S (CPS, Scott Emr, Cornell University) antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Cells bearing GFP constructs were grown to mid-log in SC medium, harvested, and visualized with an Olympus fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with monoclonal anti-HA (Covance) and CY3-conjuncated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), as described previously (29Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter F. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 198Google Scholar); fluorescence was visualized with a Texas Red filter. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images were collected with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera. For glucose deprivation prior to imaging, cells were pelleted, washed with water, and resuspended in SC medium with 2% raffinose for various times. For actin depolymerization, 10 μm latrunculin A (Lat-A, Sigma) was added for 3 h. Control cells received an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide. Fractionation on Renografin density gradients was as described (30Chang A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RenoCal-76 (Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ) was substituted for Renografin-76. Fourteen fractions were collected and diluted 10-fold with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a TLA 120.2 rotor and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP (Covance). Fractionation of Gas1 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), markers for plasma membrane and vacuole, was determined using antibodies from Howard Riezman (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) and Greg Payne (UCLA), respectively. Quantitation was performed using NIH Image on scanned Western blots. Previous work has shown mislocalization of Pma1 to the vacuole in a V-ATPase mutant, vma3 (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To address the molecular basis for Pma1 mislocalization, we used an HA-tagged PMA1 construct under the control of a MET25 promoter (26Luo W. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, HA-Pma1, synthesized following derepression of the MET25 promoter, localized to the cell surface in wild-type cells, like endogenous Pma1 (26Luo W. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vma3Δ cells, however, HA-Pma1 appears predominantly coincident with the lumen of the vacuole, visualized as a crater by DIC microscopy. Similarly, a Pma1-GFP construct was observed to localize properly to the plasma membrane in wild-type cells while mislocalizing to the vacuolar lumen in vma3Δ cells (Fig. S1A). Like Pma1-GFP, Can1-GFP, the arginine permease, is also mislocalized from the plasma membrane in wild-type cells to the vacuole in vma3Δ cells (Fig. S1B). Deletion of the Vma3 subunit of the V-ATPase results in loss of more than 95% of the proton pumping activity (31Umemoto N. Yoshihisa T. Hirata R. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mislocalization of Pma1-GFP and Can1-GFP in vma3Δ cells appears to derive from loss of V-ATPase activity because mislocalization of these proteins also occurs in the absence of Vma1, the ATP-binding catalytic subunit of the V1 subcomplex, and in vph1Δ cells lacking a V0 subunit with 30-fold less proton transport activity (32Perzov N. Padler-Karavani V. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). Although Pma1 is predominantly mislocalized to the vacuole in V-ATPase-deficient cells, a fraction necessarily escapes to the cell surface to sustain cell viability (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Proper assembly and activity of the V-ATPase holoenzyme requires the RAVE complex, composed of Rav1, Rav2, and Skp1, which associates with the V1 subcomplex (33Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase activity in rav1Δ or rav2Δ cells is only 1–2% that of wild-type cells (13Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is similar to the level of activity loss in strains lacking one of the structural subunits of the enzyme (34Curtis K.K. Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8979-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both Pma1 and Can1 are localized to the vacuole in rav1Δ cells (Fig. S2). These results suggest a requirement for V-ATPase activity for proper sorting of Pma1 and Can1. Vacuolar mislocalization of Pma1 in vma3Δ cells could occur by Pma1 endocytosis from the cell surface or by routing of newly synthesized Pma1 from Golgi to the vacuole via the endosomal system. To determine whether vacuolar localization of Pma1 in vma3Δ cells requires endocytosis, we used Lat-A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, to block endocytosis (35Ayscough K.R. Protoplasma. 2005; 226: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we visualized Ste3, the α mating factor receptor, which turns over rapidly from the plasma membrane (36Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ste3-GFP was predominantly observed in the vacuole in vma3Δ cells at steady state (Fig. 2A), as in wild-type cells (data not shown). After 3 h in the presence of Lat-A, Ste3-GFP accumulation at the plasma membrane was apparent, indicating an internalization block. By contrast, both Pma1 and Can1 were observed predominantly in the vacuole in vma3Δ cells in the presence or absence of Lat-A (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggest a sorting defect in the absence of V-ATPase activity, causing Pma1 and Can1 to go from the Golgi to the vacuole directly without arriving at the plasma membrane. V-ATPase activity is regulated by disassembly of intact active V-ATPase complexes into V1 and V0 subcomplexes within 5 min of glucose deprivation, resulting in the loss of >60% ATPase activity (33Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 37Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose readdition results in rapid reassembly of the V-ATPase (37Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If Pma1 sorting is dependent on V-ATPase activity, rapid inactivation of the V-ATPase by glucose deprivation should result in Pma1 mislocalization. In Fig. 3, wild-type cells bearing Pma1-GFP were switched from growth in glucose to raffinose. After 30 min of glucose deprivation, Pma1 fluorescence was coincident with vacuoles visualized by DIC. No vacuolar localization was observed when cycloheximide was included during glucose deprivation (Fig. 3C), indicating newly synthesized Pma1 is missorted to the vacuole in V-ATPase-deficient cells. These results are consistent with direct transport of newly synthesized Pma1 from the Golgi to the vacuole; pre-existing Pma1 is not internalized from the cell surface. In vma3Δ cells there is cytosolic acidification and vacuolar alkalization with cytosolic pH decreasing from 6.0 to 5.5 and vacuolar pH increasing from 6.0 to 6.4 (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Indeed, vma3Δ cells, as well as other mutants defective in V-ATPase activity, have impaired growth in medium of pH 7.0 or higher (38Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To determine whether Pma1 missorting is dependent on pH, cells were grown in buffered medium. Previous work has shown that buffering the culture medium at pH 7.5 can restore the cytoplasmic pH of vma3Δ cells, although vacuolar pH still remains as high as 6.6 (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that plasma membrane localization of Pma1 in wild-type cells is not affected by medium pH. In vma3Δ cells, however, vacuolar localization of Pma1-GFP was observed in cells grown in medium buffered to 4.2. Strikingly, vacuolar localization disappears in medium buffered to pH 6.6 (Fig. 4A), and instead, Pma1-GFP was visualized at the plasma membrane in vma3Δ cells under these conditions. Like Pma1, vacuolar localization of Can1-GFP disappears at pH 6.6 in vma3Δ cells, whereas in wild-type cells, Can1-GFP localization to the plasma membrane is not affected by medium pH (Fig. 4B). Under conditions identical to a previous report showing restoration of cytosolic pH in vma3Δ cells by buffering the medium to pH 7.5 (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), plasma membrane localization of both Pma1-GFP and Can1-GFP were restored (Fig. S3). These results suggest that missorting of Pma1 and Can1 is suppressed by buffering the medium to higher pH, increasing cytosolic pH in vma3Δ cells. To confirm the restoration effect, cell fractionation was used to examine Pma1 localization in wild-type and vma3Δ cells buffered at normal and high pH. Renocal-76 density gradients were used to resolve plasma membrane from intracellular membranes (26Luo W. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows density gradients separating the plasma membrane marker Gas1p, maximal in fractions 10–11, from the vacuolar membrane marker ALP, maximal in fractions 3–5. In wild-type cells at both pH 4.2 and 6.6, Pma1-GFP is coincident with Gas1, maximal in fractions 9–12 (Fig. 5). In vma3Δ cells grown at pH 4.2, Pma1-GFP was observed in fractions coincident with ALP and consistent with vacuolar localization. In contrast, in vma3Δ cells grown in pH 6.6 medium, distribution of Pma1-GFP was found coincident with the plasma membrane marker Gas1p (Fig. 5). Therefore, buffering vma3Δ cells at high pH restores normal targeting of Pma1 to the plasma membrane. A battery of marker proteins was examined to determine whether pH perturbation in vma3Δ cells results in mislocalization of other proteins. These markers, including markers for vacuolar membrane and multivesicular body, are localized normally in vma3Δ cells (data not shown). However, mislocalization of two Golgi membrane markers, Kex2 and Vrg4, was detected in vma3Δ cells (Fig. 6). Kex2 cycles between Golgi and endosome, and impaired Golgi-endosome trafficking results in delivery of Kex2 to the vacuole (40Brickner J.H. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 41Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A shows Kex2-GFP in puncta characteristic of Golgi and endosomes in wild-type cells. In vma3Δ cells, some Kex2-GFP is present in puncta but also coincident with vacuolar indentations seen by DIC. Like Kex2-GFP, mislocalization of Vrg4-GFP to the vacuole was also observed in vma3Δ cells (Fig. 6B). Vrg4, a GDP-mannose transporter, cycles between ER and Golgi and undergoes vacuolar delivery when COPI-dependent retrograde transport is impaired (42Abe M. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Other Golgi membrane markers such as Sec7, Sec21, and Sys1 have normal punctate Golgi localization in both WT and vma3Δ cells (data not shown). Additional vesicular transport pathways were examined to determine whether these are also affected by disturbed pH homeostasis in vma3Δ cells. To examine the exocytic pathway in vma3Δ cells, secretion of invertase and Bgl2 was assayed. Invertase and Bgl2 are secreted via different populations of post-Golgi secretory vesicles (43Harsay E. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). No significant difference in release of invertase (upper panel) or Bgl2 (lower panel) to the extracellular space was detected in wild-type and vma3Δ cells (Fig. 7A). As a control, secretion of invertase and Bgl2 is blocked in sec14–3 cells at the restrictive temperature but not at the permissive temperature (44Curwin A.J. Fairn G.D. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7364-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). Pulse-chase analysis was used to follow vacuolar delivery of newly synthesized CPY. CPY transport from ER to Golgi is accompanied by conversion from p1 to p2 forms, and proteolytic processing to the mature form occurs upon vacuolar arrival (45Rothman J.H. Howald I. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 46Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, mature CPY is the predominant form seen by 15 min of chase, whereas p1 and p2 forms are still detectable at this time in vma3Δ cells (Fig. 7B). Either transport from Golgi to vacuole and/or proteolytic processing appear slightly delayed in vma3Δ cells, but ER-Golgi transport is not significantly affected. We examined whether Pma1 missorting from Golgi to vacuole is dependent on GGA proteins, Gga1 and Gga2 (Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, ARF-binding), adaptors for clathrin-coated vesicles forming at the late Golgi (47Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In gga1Δ gga2Δ cells, Pma1-GFP is properly localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 8A). Upon glucose deprivation to impair V-ATPase, Pma1-GFP was observed predominantly at the plasma membrane in gga1Δ gga2Δ cells (Fig. 8A), suggesting rerouting of Pma1 to the cell surface when sorting into clathrin-coated vesicles is blocked. Consistently, Pma1-GFP was also rerouted to the cell surface in the absence of glucose in vps1Δ cells lacking dynamin required for clathrin-coated vesicle formation (48Vater C.A. Raymond C.K. Ekena K. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Fig. S4). The AP-1 complex is another adaptor for Golgi-derived clathrin-coated vesicles (49Yeung B.G. Phan H.L. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3643-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In aps1Δ cells, lacking a subunit of AP-1, Pma1-GFP is not prevented from vacuolar delivery upon glucose deprivation (Fig. 8A). Thus, in cells impaired in V-ATPase activity, Pma1 appears to enter clathrin-coated vesicles via interaction with GGA adaptors for delivery to the vacuole. Because GGA proteins can recognize ubiquitinated cargo for sorting to endosomes (50Scott P.M. Bilodeau P.S. Zhdankina O. Winistorfer S.C. Hauglund M.J. Allaman M.M. Kearney W.R. Robertson A.D. Boman A.L. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we asked whether Pma1 is ubiquitinated in vma3Δ cells. For these experiments, we used a construct in which HA-tagged Pma1 is under the control of the MET25 promoter. Newly synthesized HA-Pma1 was immunoprecipitated and assayed by Western blot with anti-ubiquitin. In wild-type cells, no ubiquitin signal is associated with Pma1 (Fig. 8B, lane 1), consistent with the longevity of wild-type Pma1 (51Benito B. Moreno E. Lagunas R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 52Wang Q. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12853-12858Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a positive control, Pma1–7 was analyzed because it undergoes temperature-sensitive ubiquitination and mislocalization to the vacuole (4Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A series of high molecular weight bands migrating above the position of HA-Pma1–7 was observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 8B, lane 2), as well as in vma3Δ cells (Fig. 8B, lane 4). By contrast, ubiquitination of wild-type Pma1 was not detectable in vma3Δ cells (Fig. 8B, lane 3). To increase detection of ubiquitinated protein, HA-tagged Pma1 was accumulated in pep4 cells, defective in vacuolar proteolysis, and vps27 cells, defective in sorting to multivesicular bodies (53Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although Pma1–7 ubiquitination is enhanced (Fig. 8B, lanes 6 and 8), ubiquitination remains undetectable for wild-type Pma1 in vma3Δ pep4Δ and vma3Δ vps27Δ cells (Fig. 8B, lanes 5 and 7). Although ubiquitinated Pma1 was not detected in vma3Δ cells, Pma1-GFP is localized to the vacuolar lumen, suggesting it undergoes internalization into multivesicular bodies for degradation. Pulse-chase was used to examine Pma1 degradation. Fig. 9A shows that Pma1 is stable at the plasma membrane in wild-type cells. Surprisingly, Pma1 in the vacuole in vma3Δ cells remains stable even after 3 h of chase. Consistent with this result, degradation of missorted Kex2-GFP is also delayed in vma3Δ cells (Fig. S5). Maturation of CPS was analyzed to assess vacuolar proteolysis in vma3Δ cells. CPS is synthesized as a precursor (pCPS), which undergoes ubiquitination, internalization into multivesicular endosomes, and proteolytic processing to a mature form (mCPS) in the vacuolar lumen (54Spormann D.O. Heim J. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8021-8029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, mCPS is formed after an ∼40-min chase (Fig. 9B), consistent with a previous report (55Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both pCPS and mCPS migrate as two differentially glycosylated forms with the lower molecular weight form of pCPS comigrating with the higher molecular weight mCPS (55Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9B, arrow). In vma3Δ cells, CPS processing to the mature form is delayed so that mCPS was not apparent until 2 h of chase (Fig. 9B). Localization of GFP-CPS to the vacuolar lumen is unaffected in vma3Δ cells (Fig. S6). These results are in agreement with previous findings suggesting that V-ATPase activity is important for vacuolar proteolytic activity (55Anand V.C. Daboussi L. Lorenz T.C. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1592-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 61Klionsky D.J. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10564-10572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major finding of this study is pH-dependent cargo sorting from the Golgi in the yeast secretory pathway. Impaired V-ATPase activity perturbs pH homeostasis, causing cytoplasmic acidification and vacuolar alkalization (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Mislocalization of the cell surface proteins Pma1 and Can1 to the vacuole is a result of diminished V-ATPase activity, caused by loss of subunits of the V1 or V0 subcomplex, loss of RAVE complex assembly factors, or glucose deprivation (Figs. S1–S2). Cytoplasmic pH is restored upon growing V-ATPase-deficient cells in medium buffered to high pH (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A role for cytoplasmic pH in regulating cargo sorting is supported by suppression of Pma1 mislocalization in vma3Δ cells upon buffering the medium pH (Fig. 3). Vacuolar mislocalization of Pma1 upon glucose deprivation is prevented by cycloheximide, suggesting a defect in cell surface targeting of newly synthesized Pma1. In V-ATPase-deficient cells, missorting of Pma1 from the Golgi to the vacuole is dependent on GGA adaptor proteins in clathrin-coated vesicles (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 8). Previously, we reported that two misfolded Pma1 mutants, Pma1–7 and Pma1–10, undergo ubiquitination and vacuolar delivery upon recognition by post-ER quality control mechanisms (4Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 56Liu Y. Chang A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To address whether a change in cytoplasmic pH might produce a conformational change in wild-type Pma1, ubiquitination of Pma1 was examined in vma3Δ cells (Fig. 8B). Mutant Pma1–7 was examined as a positive control as it undergoes temperature-sensitive ubiquitination and vacuolar delivery (4Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitination of Pma1–7 was readily observed, ubiquitination of wild-type Pma1 was not detected in vma3Δ cells. Ubiquitination of wild-type Pma1 was undetectable even when vacuolar proteolysis or sorting to multivesicular endosomes was prevented in vma3Δpep4Δ and vma3Δvps27Δ cells, respectively (Fig. 8B). These results are consistent with vacuolar sorting of Pma1 in V-ATPase-deficient cells occurring by a mechanism distinct from that involved in vacuolar targeting of misfolded mutant Pma1. GGA recognition of wild-type Pma1 in V-ATPase-deficient cells appears ubiquitin-independent (50Scott P.M. Bilodeau P.S. Zhdankina O. Winistorfer S.C. Hauglund M.J. Allaman M.M. Kearney W.R. Robertson A.D. Boman A.L. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) whereas GGA adaptors are required for recognition of ubiquitinated Pma1–7 (4Pizzirusso M. Chang A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with substrate recognition by GGA via both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent binding (57Babst M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Vacuolar mislocalization of Pma1 and Can1 suggests that V-ATPase activity is required for sorting of these cargos into post-Golgi secretory vesicles. By contrast, loss of V-ATPase activity does not affect secretion of Bgl2 and invertase (Fig. 7). Thus, post-Golgi vesicles are generated properly when V-ATPase activity is lost or decreased, but sorting of specific cargo into these vesicles is impaired. In addition to missorting of plasma membrane proteins Pma1 and Can1, deficient V-ATPase activity also results in missorting of two Golgi membrane proteins, Kex2 and Vrg4 (Fig. 6). In wild-type cells, localization of Kex2 and Vrg4 is maintained by cycling between Golgi and endosome and Golgi and ER, respectively (40Brickner J.H. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42Abe M. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transport of Kex2 from Golgi to endosome occurs via GGA adaptor-mediated clathrin-coated vesicles, and recycling to the Golgi occurs via retromer-coated vesicles (58Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7981-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 59Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); Vrg4 recycles from Golgi to ER via COPI vesicles (42Abe M. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When their recycling routes are impaired, Kex2 and Vrg4 are delivered to the vacuole (40Brickner J.H. Fuller R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42Abe M. Noda Y. Adachi H. Yoda K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because anterograde pathways for vacuolar delivery of Kex2 and Vrg4 appear unaffected in V-ATPase-deficient cells, our results suggest that retrieval of Vrg4 from Golgi to the ER and Kex2 retrieval from endosome to Golgi are pH-dependent. Of significance to a requirement for V-ATPase activity for proper Golgi function, loss of function mutations in the a2 subunit of V-ATPase are linked to cutis laxa, or wrinkly skin syndrome, and are associated with impaired Golgi-to-ER transport (60Kornak U. Reynders E. Dimopoulou A. van Reeuwijk J. Fischer B. Rajab A. Budde B. Nurnberg P. Foulquier F. Lefeber D. Urban Z. Gruenewald S. Annaert W. Brunner H.G. van Bokhoven H. Wevers R. Morava E. Matthijs G. Van Maldergem L. Mundlos S. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). V-ATPase plays a critical role in membrane trafficking by maintaining cytosolic pH homeostasis (8Catty P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as well as generating acidic intracellular compartments (10Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Impaired V-ATPase activity results in increased luminal pH (14Martínez-Muñoz G.A. Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20309-20319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As a consequence, vacuolar proteolysis is impaired, as revealed by delayed CPY and CPS processing in vma3Δ cells (Figs. 7B and 9) and prolonged vacuolar stability of mislocalized Pma1 and Kex2 (Figs. 9 and S5). Our results are consistent with previous work showing that luminal acidification is required for efficient processing of vacuolar proteins and sorting within endosomes and multivesicular bodies (61Klionsky D.J. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3416-3422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62Klionsky D.J. Nelson H. Nelson N. Yaver D.S. J. Exp.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10564-10572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luminal acidity is also necessary for lipid turnover in vacuoles/lysosomes (65Futerman A.H. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). At the cytosolic face of membranes, there is a requirement for V-ATPase activity for recruitment of the cytosolic regulatory proteins Arf6 and ARNO to initiate transport vesicle formation at endosomal membranes (66Recchi C. Chavrier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our discovery of a requirement for V-ATPase activity in cargo sorting at the Golgi suggests additional pH-regulated mechanisms in protein trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W2014896178,"Arfaptins (arfaptin-1 and arfaptin-2/POR1) were originally identified as binding partners of the Arf small GTPases. Both proteins contain a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which participates in membrane deformation. Here we show that arfaptins associate with trans-Golgi membranes. Unexpectedly, Arl1 (Arf-like 1), but not Arfs, determines the trans-Golgi association of arfaptins. We also demonstrate that arfaptins interact with Arl1 through their BAR domain-containing region and compete for Arl1 binding with golgin-97 and golgin-245/p230, both of which also bind to Arl1 through their GRIP (golgin-97/RanBP2/Imh1p/p230) domains. However, arfaptins and these golgins show only limited colocalization at the trans-Golgi. Time-lapse imaging of cells overexpressing fluorescent protein-tagged arfaptins and golgin-97 reveals that arfaptins, but not golgin-97, are included in vesicular and tubular structures emanating from the Golgi region. These observations indicate that arfaptins are recruited onto trans-Golgi membranes by interacting with Arl1, and capable of inducing membrane deformation via their BAR domains.

Thus, arfaptins appear to function at diverse cellular locations. However, there has been only one report about the subcellular localization of arfaptins; Kanoh et al. (5Kanoh H. Williger B.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5421-5429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) described that FLAG-tagged arfaptin-1, exogenously expressed in COS-7 cells, was localized to the Golgi: in immunofluorescence analysis, its perinuclear staining disappeared upon incubating cells with brefeldin A (BFA).In this study, we first examined the subcellular localization of endogenous arfaptin-1 and arfaptin-2 and attempted to characterize their membrane recruitment by Arfs. However, we found that association of arfaptins with the trans-Golgi membranes is not determined by Arfs, but instead by Arl1.DISCUSSIONArfaptins were originally identified by their interaction with Arf small GTPases but little is known about their functions. In the present study, we showed that both arfaptin-1 and arfaptin-2 associate with the trans-Golgi/TGN. Our analyses using BFA and siRNAs for Arfs suggested that their trans-Golgi association is not determined by Arfs, and we eventually found that an Arf-like small GTPase, Arl1, is responsible for the trans-Golgi recruitment of arfaptins through interacting with their BAR domain-containing region.About a decade ago, two groups reported that arfaptin-2 is able to interact with Arl1 as well as Arfs in their two-hybrid assays (15Van Valkenburgh H. Shern J.F. Sharer J.D. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22826-22837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Lu L. Horstmann H. Ng C. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4543-4555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but since then the Arl1-arfaptin interaction has not been further characterized. Our time-lapse analyses show that exogenous overexpression of arfaptin is able to induce vesicular and tubular intermediates from the Golgi region, although the observation may not represent a physiological cellular event. By contrast, exogenous expression of Arl1 neither induced such intermediates nor enhanced the arfaptin-mediated tubule formation, even though it is required for membrane recruitment of arfaptins. Thus, the active vesicle and tubule formation in cells overexpressing arfaptin suggests that, like other BAR domain-containing proteins (10Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 11Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), arfaptins may have the ability to deform membranes or amplify and stabilize the membrane curvature. We think that Arl1 provides a platform that makes the membrane competent to form vesicles or tubules by recruiting arfaptins, yet is dispensable for maintaining the membrane association of arfaptins and allowing membrane deformation once they have been recruited. In view of the fact that BAR domain proteins by themselves are able to deform liposome membranes in vitro (10Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 11Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and that BAR domain proteins other than arfaptins often have membrane-interacting modules, such as PH and PX domains and amphiphathic α-helices (11Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that Arl1 may have a regulatory role in triggering membrane deformation by recruiting cytosolic arfaptins, which do not contain such modules.Inhibition of membrane fission by inhibiting myosin II activation exaggerates the arfaptin-positive tubular structures, supporting a role for BAR domain-containing arfaptins in membrane deformation. This observation is reminiscent of in vitro tubulation of liposomes induced by BAR domain proteins (10Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 11Frost A. Unger V.M. De Camilli P. Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Even though the BAR domain proteins may deform membranes and stabilize the membrane curvature to induce tubules, they are unable to cause membrane fission. Thus, fission of budding membranes requires proteins other than BAR domain proteins. For example, other BAR domain proteins are known to interact with dynamin and components of the actomyosin system (44Dawson J.C. Legg J.A. Machesky L.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 493-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 45Liu J. Sun Y. Oster G.F. Drubin D.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As arfaptin-2/POR1 is known to regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (6D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sag D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it will be interesting for future studies to address how Rac1 participates in the arfaptin-mediated membrane deformation.To date, Arl1 has been implicated in membrane traffic through its interaction with GRIP domain-containing golgins, including golgin-97 and golgin-245/p230 (46Munro S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These golgins have been proposed to serve as tethering factors (47Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 48Lupashin V. Sztul E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both arfaptins and golgins are recruited onto trans-Golgi membranes through interacting with Arl1, and exogenous expression of arfaptins appears to perturb the function of golgins; this blocks StxB retrograde transport, probably by sequestering endogenous Arl1. However, knocking down arfaptins has no apparent effect on StxB transport, which is under the regulation of Arl1 and golgins. The most plausible explanation for these results is that arfaptins and GRIP domain-containing golgins are involved in distinct transport processes. In support of this, these golgins localize to distinct microdomains of the trans-Golgi and have been implicated in transport of distinct cargoes (39Lock J.G. Hammond L.A. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. Stow J.L. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Lieu Z.Z. Lock J.G. Hammond L.A. La Gruta N.L. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Another possibility is that arfaptins may play a regulatory role in, but be dispensable for, the Arl1-mediated transport by triggering deformation of membranes. In either case, the identification of specific cargo molecules under the regulation of Arl1 and arfaptins is an important issue to be addressed in future studies.

Thus, arfaptins appear to function at diverse cellular locations. However, there has been only one report about the subcellular localization of arfaptins; Kanoh et al. (5Kanoh H. Williger B.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5421-5429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) described that FLAG-tagged arfaptin-1, exogenously expressed in COS-7 cells, was localized to the Golgi: in immunofluorescence analysis, its perinuclear staining disappeared upon incubating cells with brefeldin A (BFA). In this study, we first examined the subcellular localization of endogenous arfaptin-1 and arfaptin-2 and attempted to characterize their membrane recruitment by Arfs. However, we found that association of arfaptins with the trans-Golgi membranes is not determined by Arfs, but instead by Arl1. DISCUSSIONArfaptins were originally identified by their interaction with Arf small GTPases but little is known about their functions. In the present study, we showed that both arfaptin-1 and arfaptin-2 associate with the trans-Golgi/TGN. Our analyses using BFA and siRNAs for Arfs suggested that their trans-Golgi association is not determined by Arfs, and we eventually found that an Arf-like small GTPase, Arl1, is responsible for the trans-Golgi recruitment of arfaptins through interacting with their BAR domain-containing region.About a decade ago, two groups reported that arfaptin-2 is able to interact with Arl1 as well as Arfs in their two-hybrid assays (15Van Valkenburgh H.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4543-4555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but since then the Arl1-arfaptin interaction has not been further characterized. Our time-lapse analyses show that exogenous overexpression of arfaptin is able to induce vesicular and tubular intermediates from the Golgi region, although the observation may not represent a physiological cellular event. By contrast, exogenous expression of Arl1 neither induced such intermediates nor enhanced the arfaptin-mediated tubule formation, even though it is required for membrane recruitment of arfaptins. Thus, the active vesicle and tubule formation in cells overexpressing arfaptin suggests that, like other BAR domain-containing proteins (10Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J.

We think that Arl1 provides a platform that makes the membrane competent to form vesicles or tubules by recruiting arfaptins, yet is dispensable for maintaining the membrane association of arfaptins and allowing membrane deformation once they have been recruited. In view of the fact that BAR domain proteins by themselves are able to deform liposome membranes in vitro (10Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

Cell. 2009; 137: 191-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that Arl1 may have a regulatory role in triggering membrane deformation by recruiting cytosolic arfaptins, which do not contain such modules.Inhibition of membrane fission by inhibiting myosin II activation exaggerates the arfaptin-positive tubular structures, supporting a role for BAR domain-containing arfaptins in membrane deformation. This observation is reminiscent of in vitro tubulation of liposomes induced by BAR domain proteins (10Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

Even though the BAR domain proteins may deform membranes and stabilize the membrane curvature to induce tubules, they are unable to cause membrane fission. Thus, fission of budding membranes requires proteins other than BAR domain proteins. For example, other BAR domain proteins are known to interact with dynamin and components of the actomyosin system (44Dawson J.C. Legg J.A. Machesky L.M.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These golgins have been proposed to serve as tethering factors (47Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Biochim. Biophys.

Both arfaptins and golgins are recruited onto trans-Golgi membranes through interacting with Arl1, and exogenous expression of arfaptins appears to perturb the function of golgins; this blocks StxB retrograde transport, probably by sequestering endogenous Arl1. However, knocking down arfaptins has no apparent effect on StxB transport, which is under the regulation of Arl1 and golgins. The most plausible explanation for these results is that arfaptins and GRIP domain-containing golgins are involved in distinct transport processes. In support of this, these golgins localize to distinct microdomains of the trans-Golgi and have been implicated in transport of distinct cargoes (39Lock J.G. Hammond L.A. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A.

Despite the vast level of consumption of S. thermophilus through yogurt or probiotic functional food, very few data are available about its physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The objective of the present work was to explore both the metabolic activity and host response of S. thermophilus in vivo. Our study profiles the protein expression of S. thermophilus after its adaptation to the GIT of gnotobiotic rats and describes the impact of S. thermophilus colonization on the colonic epithelium. S. thermophilus colonized progressively the GIT of germ-free rats to reach a stable population in 30 days (108 cfu/g of feces). This progressive colonization suggested that S. thermophilus undergoes an adaptation process within GIT. Indeed, we showed that the main response of S. thermophilus in the rat's GIT was the massive induction of the glycolysis pathway, leading to formation of lactate in the cecum. At the level of the colonic epithelium, the abundance of monocarboxylic acid transporter mRNAs (SLC16A1 and SLC5A8) and a protein involved in the cell cycle arrest (p27kip1) increased in the presence of S. thermophilus compared with germ-free rats. Based on different mono-associated rats harboring two different strains of S. thermophilus (LMD-9 or LMG18311) or weak lactate-producing commensal bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Ruminococcus gnavus), we propose that lactate could be a signal produced by S. thermophilus and modulating the colon epithelium.

IntroductionStreptoccocus thermophilus belongs to the group of the thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and is traditionally and widely used as a starter in manufacturing dairy products (Emmental, Gruyere, Parmigiano, mozarella, yogurt, etc.). Yogurt, which results from the fermentation of milk by S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), fulfills the current specifications required to be recognized as a probiotic product (1Guarner F. Perdigon G. Corthier G. Salminen S. Koletzko B. Morelli L. Br. J. Nutr. 2005; 93: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The health beneficial effect of yogurt consumption is linked to the metabolic properties of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. As such, it improves lactose digestion in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) 3The abbreviations used are: GIT, gastrointestinal tract; PCNA, peripheral cell nuclear antigen; GF, germ-free. through their lactose-hydrolyzing activity present in yogurt and in the GIT, thus reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance (2Lomer M.C.

At birth, the Streptococcus genus, with in some studies a precision at the level of S. thermophilus species, is among the first colonizers of the GIT because it has been detected in infant feces and breast milk (11Moreau M.C.

Thus, Streptococcus, as pioneer bacteria colonizing a yet immature GIT, may impact the maturation and homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium after birth.Convergent data show that intestinal bacteria modulate proliferation and differentiation processes of the intestinal epithelium (14Alam M. Midtvedt T. Uribe A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1994; 29: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Nougayrède J.P. Taieb F. De Rycke J. Oswald E.

Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that microbiota increases colonic epithelium crypt depth in concordance with a well orchestrated modulation of the level of proteins involved in life cycle steps like PCNA, Bcl2, and p21cip1, p27kip1 (markers of proliferation, antiapoptotic pathway, and cell cycle arrest, respectively) (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P. Thomas M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G348-G357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite its large utilization and consumption, its probiotic-associated traits, and its presence in the intestinal microbiota, the role of S. thermophilus in the gut is still largely unknown. A previous study (18Drouault S. Anba J. Corthier G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed that, in mono-associated animals, S. thermophilus produced an active β-galactosidase in the GIT, which is responsible for lactose hydrolysis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to expand our view of the metabolic activity of S. thermophilus in the intestinal environment and to investigate its relationship with the host. To do this, we assessed the behavior of two sequenced strains of S. thermophilus, LMD-9 and LMG18311, in gnotobiotic rats. We established the first global protein profile of S. thermophilus after its survival in GIT in mono-associated rats. We also described how S. thermophilus influences colonic epithelium, focusing on monocarboxylic acid transporters and cell cycle arrest proteins. In view of our findings using different mono-associated models, we propose that lactate resulting from the adaptive metabolic activity of S. thermophilus may serve as a biological signal to communicate with host epithelium.DISCUSSIONIn order to gain a better understanding of the behavior of lactic acid bacteria within the intestinal environment and the complex bacterium/host cross-talk system, here we combined in vivo characterization of S. thermophilus metabolism and the resulting host response. This study led to novel insights into the interplay between S. thermophilus and the host through its major metabolite product, lactate.The implantation of S. thermophilus in GF rats occurred progressively, and this trend was observed with both strains studied, LMD-9 and LMG18311. These two strains differ in particular by the presence of a cell wall protease, PrtS, and a sortase, A1, present in the LMD-9 strain. This suggests that the latter proteins were probably not essential for the kinetics of implantation of this bacterium. In contrast to S. thermophilus, the implantation was maximal in a few days for Escherichia coli (32Alpert C. Scheel J. Engst W. Loh G. Blaut M. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), R. gnavus and B. thetaiotaomicron (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P.

Corthier G. Monnet V. Mistou M.Y. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1661-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This adaptive response of S. thermophilus was not accompanied by significant morphological changes, contrary to what was observed with L. sakei or E. coli (28Chiaramonte F. Blugeon S. Chaillou S. Langella P. Zagorec M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 4498-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Giraud A. Arous S. De Paepe M. Gaboriau-Routhiau V. Bambou J.C. Rakotobe S. Lindner A.B. Taddei F. Cerf-Bensussan N. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The proteomic analysis of S. thermophilus before (milk inoculum) and after GIT transit (feces) shed light on its adaptive metabolic profile. Indeed, we showed that the main response to the passage of S. thermophilus through the rat GIT was the massive induction, at the maintenance phase, of the glycolysis pathway leading to formation of lactate in cecum. Here, we propose that S. thermophilus modulates p27kip1 through production of lactate. This hypothesis stems from five observations: 1) the main S. thermophilus metabolic pathway enhanced in GIT compared with a milk culture was the glycolysis leading to production of lactate; 2) two transporters of monocarboxylic acids were induced in Ino-LMD9, suggesting that lactate may be shuttled in colonic cells; 3) the increase of p27kip1 level in the colon was observed in the presence of two S. thermophilus strains producing equivalent amounts of lactate; 4) the increase of p27kip1 level in the colon did not appear in the presence of non-lactate-producing or low lactate-producing bacteria (B. thetaiotaomicron and R. gnavus); and 5) p27kip1 was induced in vitro by the presence of lactate in intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 4A) and in keratinocytes (30Hsiao Y.P. Huang H.L. Lai W.W. Chung J.G. Yang J.H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2009; 54: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Obviously, our hypothesis does not exclude other underlying mechanisms involved in the interplay between S. thermophilus and the host (see below).The massive induction of glycolysis in GIT compared with milk was unexpected for S. thermophilus because these proteins are already present at high levels in the milk (25Derzelle S. Bolotin A. Mistou M.Y. Rul F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 8597-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The capacity for a bacterium to diversify its carbon sources seems to be essential for the colonization in GF rodents (23Roy K. Meyrand M. Corthier G. Monnet V. Mistou M.Y. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1661-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Alpert C. Scheel J. Engst W. Loh G. Blaut M. Environ.

Gordon J.I. Kleerebezem M. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 2747-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). S. thermophilus is particularly well adapted to milk, in particular via the assimilation of lactose, which is its preferential sugar and is present at high and non-limiting concentrations in milk (4.5 g/liter). However, we showed here that S. thermophilus may develop an efficient ability to use other sources of saccharides present in GF rat (38Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) because the rat diet did not contain lactose. This flexibility is rather unexpected because S. thermophilus has a small genome with a large proportion of nonfunctional genes (10% of pseudogenes), in particular genes involved in carbon utilization, in line with the paucity of carbon sources in milk (39Bolotin A. Quinquis B. Renault P. Sorokin A. Ehrlich S.D. Kulakauskas S. Lapidus A. Goltsman E. Mazur M. Pusch G.D. Fonstein M. Overbeek R. Kyprides N. Purnelle B. Prozzi D. Ngui K. Masuy D. Hancy F. Burteau S. Boutry M. Delcour J. Goffeau A. Hols P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1554-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be of interest to determine whether the implantation level and the adaptive responses of S. thermophilus may be improved by using mono-associated rats receiving a diet enriched with lactose, as previously suggested (40Mater D.D. Drouault-Holowacz S. Oozeer R. Langella P. Anba J. Corthier G. Br. J. Nutr. 2006; 96: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The use of mono-associated rats is an efficient tool to reveal the activity of bacterial proteins, especially those with dual functions. For example, EF-Tu is an elongation factor playing a key role in protein synthesis but also in the maintenance in the GIT. The up-regulation of EF-Tu was observed in vivo for L. lactis (41Beganović J. Guillot A. van de Guchte M. Jouan A. Gitton C. Loux V. Roy K. Huet S. Monod H. Monnet V. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Bifidobacterium (42Yuan J. Wang B. Sun Z. Bo X. Yuan X. He X. Zhao H. Du X. Wang F. Jiang Z. Zhang L. Jia L. Wang Y. Wei K. Wang J. Zhang X. Sun Y. Huang L. Zeng M. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and in vitro for L. plantarum (43Ramiah K. van Reenen C.A. Dicks L.M. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2007; 116: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although S. thermophilus reduced most of its translation and protein synthesis machinery, EF-Tu was the sole protein belonging to protein synthesis pathway that was increased at a high level in digestive tract compared with milk (induction factor 12). We thus propose that in Ino-LMD9 rats, EF-Tu, which displays the characteristics of an adhesion factor (21Dallo S.F. Kannan T.R. Blaylock M.W. Baseman J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), is mainly involved in the maintenance of S. thermophilus rather than in the protein synthesis.We have recently demonstrated that the colonization of GF rats with a complex microbiota leads to an increase in the absorptive surface by deepening crypts and splitting bifurcated crypts by a crypt fission process (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P. Thomas M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G348-G357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This trophic effect of microbiota is associated with a modulation of several cell cycle-related proteins. Along the colonization with a complex microbiota, we have previously described a precocious hyperproliferative phase at the level of colonic epithelium that is counterbalanced by an induction of proteins restraining the proliferation and a decrease of antiapoptotic proteins (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P. Thomas M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G348-G357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed with a complex microbial population, the presence of S. thermophilus did not trigger deeper crypts and the division of bifurcating crypts. Thus, as we reported previously (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P. Thomas M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G348-G357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a single strain is not sufficient to switch on proliferation and the associated greater absorptive surface. In contrast, the induction of cell cycle arrest proteins could be triggered by a single bacterium. Indeed, B. thetaiotaomicron and R. gnavus increased p21cip1 (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P. Thomas M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G348-G357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas S. thermophilus increased p27kip1. p21cip1 and p27kip1 are inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and are preponderant cell cycle regulators in the GIT (44Besson A. Dowdy S.F. Roberts J.M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In particular, p27kip1 is involved in the capacity of epithelium and host to attenuate deleterious effects of environmental stimuli (45Zheng Y. Bie W. Yang R. Perekatt A.O. Poole A.J. Tyner A.L. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2008; 7: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, we have shown that p27kip1 is stabilized in vivo by a complex microbial population (17Cherbuy C. Honvo-Houeto E. Bruneau A. Bridonneau C. Mayeur C. Duée P.H. Langella P. Thomas M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G348-G357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and by S. thermophilus (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). The induction of p27kip1 by a complex microbiota or by S. thermophilus may not result from similar mechanisms because no lactate was detected in luminal content of conventional rats (data not shown). It has also been observed that p27kip1 was enhanced by a bacterial cyclomodulin like Cif (cyclin inhibitor factor) (46Samba-Louaka A. Nougayrède J.P. Watrin C. Jubelin G. Oswald E. Taieb F. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2496-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, p27kip1 seems to be sensitive to different bacterial effectors.The expression levels of the two transporters, SLC16A1 and SLC5A8, were stimulated in Ino-LMD9 rats, where luminal lactate was around 10 mm. Our observation is in accord with previous reports suggesting that monocarboxylic acid transporters provide a link between bacteria and the host (47Cresci G.A. Thangaraju M. Mellinger J.D. Liu K. Ganapathy V. J. Gastrointest. Surg. 2010; 14: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 48Ganapathy V. Thangaraju M. Gopal E. Martin P.M. Itagaki S. Miyauchi S. Prasad P.D.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24729-24737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In human healthy adults, no or low (0–2 mm) lactate is detected in fecal samples (50Hove H.

Gut. 1993; 34: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) because the luminal lactate is absorbed by host and is also used as an energy source by other commensal bacteria (52He T. Venema K.

However, increased fecal lactate has been associated with intestinal malabsorption and colitis (55Hove H. Mortensen P.B. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1995; 40: 1372-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It could also be of interest to measure fecal lactate in humans with short bowel syndrome because we have shown that their microbiota is deeply enriched in lactobacilli at the expense of other bacterial members (22Joly F. Mayeur C. Bruneau A. Noordine M.L. Meylheuc T. Langella P. Messing B. Duée P.H. Cherbuy C. Thomas M. Biochimie. 2010; 92: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of lactate that we evidenced here by using a model of lactic acid bacteria in an experimental model may have significance in human digestive diseases.Because S. thermophilus is able to adapt its global metabolism to the gut environment and to induce monocarboxylic acid transporters and p27kip1, this work provides new insights into the functional “panoply” of one of the two yogurt bacteria. Finally, the fact that S. thermophilus emphasizes its carbohydrate metabolism in the digestive tract is in accord with the beneficial role of fermented milk consumption in improving lactose intolerance. IntroductionStreptoccocus thermophilus belongs to the group of the thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and is traditionally and widely used as a starter in manufacturing dairy products (Emmental, Gruyere, Parmigiano, mozarella, yogurt, etc.). Yogurt, which results from the fermentation of milk by S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), fulfills the current specifications required to be recognized as a probiotic product (1Guarner F. Perdigon G. Corthier G. Salminen S. Koletzko B. Morelli L. Br. J. Nutr. 2005; 93: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The health beneficial effect of yogurt consumption is linked to the metabolic properties of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus. As such, it improves lactose digestion in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) 3The abbreviations used are: GIT, gastrointestinal tract; PCNA, peripheral cell nuclear antigen; GF, germ-free. through their lactose-hydrolyzing activity present in yogurt and in the GIT, thus reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance (2Lomer M.C.

Nutr. 2010; 140: 677S-689SCrossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Yogurt cultures have been shown to induce other health benefits, such as reduction of diarrhea or allergic disorders as well as modulation of the immune system (1Guarner F.

Nutrition. 2010; 26: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). S. thermophilus is also present at high concentration in VSL#3, a probiotic mixture of eight different bacterial strains that possesses beneficial effects in several intestinal conditions (5Pagnini C.

Here, we report both exogenous and endogenous functional interaction between deubiquitinating enzyme USP17 and human SDS3 by MALDI-TOF-MS, co-immunoprecipitation assay, and GST pull-down assay. In this study, we demonstrated that SDS3 readily undergoes endogenous polyubiquitination, which is associated specifically with Lys-63-branched polyubiquitin chains and not with Lys-48-branched polyubiquitin chains. Further, we also demonstrated that USP17 specifically deubiquitinates Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from SDS3 and regulates its biological functions. The deubiquitinating activity of USP17 on SDS3 negatively regulates SDS3-associated HDAC activity. The constitutive expression of USP17 and its substrate SDS3 was involved in the inhibition of anchorage-independent tumor growth and blocks cell proliferation, leading to apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we showed that USP17 and SDS3 mutually interact with each other to regulate cancer cell viability. These data support the possibility that SDS3, being a substrate of USP17, may play an important role in developing a novel therapeutic means to inhibit specific HDAC activities in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999482076,"Yeast Yih1 protein and its mammalian ortholog IMPACT, abundant in neurons, are inhibitors of Gcn2, a kinase involved in amino acid homeostasis, stress response, and memory formation. Like Gcn2, Yih1/IMPACT harbors an N-terminal RWD domain that mediates binding to the Gcn2 activator Gcn1. Yih1 competes with Gcn2 for Gcn1 binding, thus inhibiting Gcn2. Yih1 also binds G-actin. Here, we show that Yih1-actin interaction is independent of Gcn1 and that Yih1-Gcn1 binding does not require actin. The Yih1 RWD (residues 1-132) was sufficient for Gcn2 inhibition and Gcn1 binding, but not for actin binding, showing that actin binding is dispensable for inhibiting Gcn2. Actin binding required Yih1 residues 68-258, encompassing part of the RWD and the C-terminal ""ancient domain""; however, residues Asp-102 and Glu-106 in helix3 of the RWD were essential for Gcn1 binding and Gcn2 inhibition but dispensable for actin binding. Thus, the Gcn1- and actin-binding sites overlap in the RWD but have distinct binding determinants. Unexpectedly, Yih1 segment 68-258 was defective for inhibiting Gcn2 even though it binds Gcn1 at higher levels than does full-length Yih1. This and other results suggest that Yih1 binds with different requirements to distinct populations of Gcn1 molecules, and its ability to disrupt Gcn1-Gcn2 complexes is dependent on a complete RWD and hindered by actin binding. Modeling of the ancient domain on the bacterial protein YigZ showed peculiarities to the eukaryotic and prokaryotic lineages, suggesting binding sites for conserved cellular components. Our results support a role for Yih1 in a cross-talk between the cytoskeleton and translation."
https://openalex.org/W2165637159,"Little is known about endogenous estrogen receptor β (ERβ) gene targets in human breast cancer. We reported that estradiol (E2) induces nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) transcription through ERα in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Here we report that 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), with an EC50 of ˜1.7 nM, increases NRF-1 expression by recruiting ERβ, cJun, cFos, CBP, and RNA polymerase II to and dismissing NCoR from the NRF1 promoter. Promoter deletion and transient transfection studies showed that the estrogen response element (ERE) is essential and that an adjacent AP-1 site contributes to maximal 4-OHT-induced NRF-1 transcription. siRNA knockdown of ERβ revealed that ERβ inhibits basal NRF-1 expression and is required for 4-OHT-induced NRF-1 transcription. An AP-1 inhibitor blocked 4-OHT-in-duced NRF-1 expression. The 4-OHT-induced increase in NRF-1 resulted in increased transcription of NRF-1 target CAPNS1 but not CYC1, CYC2,or TFAM despite increased NRF-1 coactivator PGC-1α protein. The absence of TFAM induction corresponds to a lack of Akt-dependent phosphorylation of NRF-1 with 4-OHT treatment. Overexpression of NRF-1 inhibited 4-OHT-induced apoptosis and siRNA knockdown of NRF-1 increased apoptosis, indicating an antiapoptotic role for NRF-1. Overall, NRF-1 expression and activity is regulated by 4-OHT via endogenous ERβ in MCF-7 cells.—Ivanova, M. M., Luken, K. H., Zimmer, A. S., Lenzo, F. L., Smith, R. J., Arteel, M. W., Kollenberg, T.

https://openalex.org/W2160891475,"The catabolite repressor/activator (Cra) protein is a global sensor and regulator of carbon fluxes through the central metabolic pathways of Gram-negative bacteria. To examine the nature of the effector (or effectors) that signal such fluxes to the protein of Pseudomonas putida, the Cra factor of this soil microorganism has been purified and characterized and its three-dimensional structure determined. Analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and mobility shift assays showed that the effector-free Cra is a dimer that binds an operator DNA sequence in the promoter region of the fruBKA cluster. Furthermore, fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) was found to most efficiently dissociate the Cra-DNA complex. Thermodynamic parameters of the F1P-Cra-DNA interaction calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the factor associates tightly to the DNA sequence 5′-TTAAACGTTTCA-3′ (KD = 26.3 ± 3.1 nm) and that F1P binds the protein with an apparent stoichiometry of 1.06 ± 0.06 molecules per Cra monomer and a KD of 209 ± 20 nm. Other possible effectors, like fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, did not display a significant affinity for the regulator under the assay conditions. Moreover, the structure of Cra and its co-crystal with F1P at a 2-Å resolution revealed that F1P fits optimally the geometry of the effector pocket.

Thermodynamic parameters of the F1P-Cra-DNA interaction calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the factor associates tightly to the DNA sequence 5′-TTAAACGTTTCA-3′ (KD = 26.3 ± 3.1 nm) and that F1P binds the protein with an apparent stoichiometry of 1.06 ± 0.06 molecules per Cra monomer and a KD of 209 ± 20 nm. Other possible effectors, like fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, did not display a significant affinity for the regulator under the assay conditions. Moreover, the structure of Cra and its co-crystal with F1P at a 2-Å resolution revealed that F1P fits optimally the geometry of the effector pocket. Our results thus single out F1P as the preferred metabolic effector of the Cra protein of P. putida. The central metabolism of bacteria is controlled through the interplay of global and specific regulators, the outcome of which depends on the nature of the carbon and energy sources and the particular culture conditions (1Downs D.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 533-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The catabolite repressor/activator (Cra) protein (also known as FruR) is a pleiotropic regulatory protein that plays a key role in the control of carbon flow in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (2Saier Jr., M.H. Ramseier T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This factor was first identified as a repressor that inhibited expression of the fructose operon of these two bacteria when the sugar was not available, thereby the earlier name FruR (3Ramseier T.M. Nègre D. Cortay J.C. Scarabel M. Cozzone A.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Later work, however, revealed that the same protein represses genes for many other enzymes of the central metabolism (pfkA, pykA, pykF, acnB, edd, eda, mtlADR, and gapB; Refs. 2Saier Jr., M.H.

Microbiol. 1996; 33: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting a dual character of Cra as both a transcriptional repressor and an activator. From a structural point of view, the Cra protein has been classified as a member of the GalR-LacI superfamily of DNA-binding transcriptional regulators (11Penin F. Geourjon C. Montserret R. Böckmann A. Lesage A. Yang Y.S. Bonod-Bidaud C. Cortay J.C. Nègre D. Cozzone A.J. Deléage G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Scarabel M. Penin F. Bonod-Bidaud C. Nègre D. Cozzone A.J. Cortay J.C. Gene. 1995; 153: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the Cra monomer is organized in two functional domains. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix module accounts for the binding of the protein to the cognate DNA operator sequence, whereas the C-terminal portion mediates the interactions between subunits and triggers changes in the protein upon effector binding (12Scarabel M. Penin F. Bonod-Bidaud C. Nègre D. Cozzone A.J. Cortay J.C. Gene. 1995; 153: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of the Cra proteins of E. coli and S. typhimurium suggested that the regulator is a tetramer that recognizes an imperfect palindromic DNA sequence to which it binds asymmetrically (2Saier Jr., M.H. Ramseier T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that promoters containing a Cra operator upstream of the RNA polymerase binding site might become activated by the factor, thereby stimulating transcription of downstream genes. In contrast, Cra binding sites overlapping those bound by RNA polymerase originate a typical negative regulation scenario (2Saier Jr., M.H. Ramseier T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Whether positive or negative, the effects of Cra on transcription can be counteracted in vitro by micromolar concentrations of fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) 3The abbreviations used are: F1P, fructose 1-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-phosphate; PTSFru, phosphoenol pyruvate phosphotransferase carbohydrate system of P. putida; ITC, isothermal microcalorimetry; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ΔH, reaction enthalpy; ΔG, change in free energy; ΔS, change in entropy; T, absolute temperature; KA, binding constant. or millimolar concentrations of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP, Refs. 2Saier Jr., M.H.

Michotey V. Feghali R. Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1157-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In fact, the nature of the metabolic effector(s) alleged to make Cra release target DNA sites is intriguing. This is because F1P and FBP are originated by different metabolic routes and produced at levels that depend on the consumed carbon source. Furthermore, electronic densities of these two chemicals are not alike, making it puzzling that the same effector recognition pocket can bind both of them. Conflicting publications on this matter bear witness of such a problem in the relevant literature. Gel retardation experiments with a labeled DNA fragment bearing a Cra operator (3Ramseier T.M. Nègre D. Cortay J.C. Scarabel M. Cozzone A.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Bledig S.A. Ramseier T.M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 280-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could authenticate F1P as one bona fide effector, but not FBP. Some studies suggest that the in vitro response of Cra to FBP is due to a possible contamination of FBP with F1P (3Ramseier T.M. Nègre D. Cortay J.C. Scarabel M. Cozzone A.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Yet, other authors have produced evidence that FBP is an authentic effector of Cra (5Bledig S.A. Ramseier T.M. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 280-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kotte O. Zaugg J.B. Heinemann M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The consensus at this point is that F1P is the major agonist of the enterobacterial regulator, but FBP can do the same at much higher concentrations. But what is the situation in other types of bacteria? This work addresses the nature of the metabolic signal(s) that control(s) binding of Cra to its genomic binding sites in the soil microorganism Pseudomonas putida. This bit of information is important for setting reliable connections between the central fluxes for catabolism/anabolism of carbohydrates (which are often reported by FBP levels, Ref. 3Ramseier T.M. Nègre D. Cortay J.C. Scarabel M. Cozzone A.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the metabolic and non-metabolic transcriptome (14Kotte O. Zaugg J.B. Heinemann M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) in this bacterium. The Cra regulator of P. putida is an ortholog of the virtually identical gene/protein found in E. coli. But in contrast to the protein of E. coli, crystals of the purified CraP. putida diffracted at a very high resolution (see below), thereby revealing an unprecedented structural detail of the effector-protein interaction that could not be attained with the enterobacterial variant (11Penin F. Geourjon C. Montserret R. Böckmann A. Lesage A. Yang Y.S. Bonod-Bidaud C. Cortay J.C. Nègre D. Cozzone A.J. Deléage G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown below, analysis of such a structure along with other biochemical and biophysical tests indicates that F1P is the preferred metabolic effector of CraP. putida. As a sidelight, we could produce evidence that this Cra variant represses expression of the fructose-related phosphoenol pyruvate phosphotransferase carbohydrate system of P. putida in a fashion (predictably) dependent on F1P binding. The DNA sequence encoding the Cra protein of P. putida KT2440 (PP0792) was amplified from the chromosome of this bacterium with primers Cra-F (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGAAACTCAGCGATATCGCCCGT-3′) and Cra-R (5′-CCGGCTCGA GTCAGGCCACTGAGAT-3′). The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI/XhoI and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen), which adds six histidines to the N terminus of the encoded protein. Note that we included a stop codon (TCA) in the Cra-R primer immediately after the XhoI sequence to avoid addition of more His residues in the C terminus by the vector. The resulting plasmid (pET28aCra) was transformed into the specialized host strain E. coli BL21(DE3). For expression of the His6-tagged protein, the transformed strain was grown at 37 °C in LB to A600 = 0.5, and 0.5 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added, after which the cultures were grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and the pellets frozen at −80 °C until further use. For purification, cells were thawed, resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 200 mm NaCl (1 ml of culture, A600 = 0.5 in 50 μl), and mechanically lysed using a French press (Thermo Electron Corp.). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and the native His6-Cra protein isolated to apparent homogeneity from the supernatant of the cell lysate using TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions (see supplemental Fig. S1 for details). The purified protein was kept in the elution buffer at 4 °C until its utilization as indicated in each case. On the other hand, selenium-methionine (Se/Met)-derivatized P. putida Cra was purified as before from cells grown in M9 minimal medium (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 431-432Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2% glucose, selenium-methionine, and other amendments known to inhibit methionine biosynthesis (for protocol details see Ref. 16Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). All buffers for (Se/Met)-Cra purification were supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol, but the isolation procedures were otherwise identical to those employed for the non-derivatized protein. The reference E. coli consensus sequence for Cra binding sites was retrieved from the PRODORIC database (17Münch R. Hiller K. Barg H. Heldt D. Linz S. Wingender E. Jahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA motif (Fig. 1A) was then searched in the genome of P. putida KT2440 (18Nelson K.E. Weinel C. Paulsen I.T. Dodson R.J. Hilbert H. Martins dos Santos V.A. Fouts D.E. Gill S.R. Pop M. Holmes M. Brinkac L. Beanan M. DeBoy R.T. Daugherty S. Kolonay J. Madupu R. Nelson W. White O. Peterson J.

Microbiol. 2002; 4: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) by means of the Virtual Footprint software (version 3.0, Ref. 19Münch R. Hiller K. Grote A. Scheer M. Klein J. Schobert M. Jahn D. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 4187-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which revealed the presence of at least 89 possible Cra binding sites. One of these sites (5′TTAAACGTTTCA3′) happened to occur within the intergenic and divergent promoter region of the fruR/fruBKA gene cluster (P. putida chromosomal coordinates 908211–915030, Fig. 1B) which, because of its proximity to the cra (fruR) gene of this bacterium was likely to be functional. This plausible operator was synthesized as part of a 22-bp double-stranded DNA fragment (see below) and employed in the mobility shift and isothermal microcalorimetry (ITC) assays described under “Results.” The 22-bp DNA fragment used for EMSA with the Cra protein was prepared by heating an equimolar (50 nmol) mixture of complementary oligonucleotides containing the presumed Cra binding site of the fruR/fruBKA promoter region (forward, 5′-TCAGATTAAACGTTTCAGCTGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCAGCTGAAACGTTTAATCTGA-3′) in 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 1 mm EDTA) at 95 °C for 10 min and then keeping the annealed product chilled on ice until further use. The Cra-DNA binding reaction was assembled in a final volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of TGED binding buffer 10× (final concentrations, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% v/v glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml poly (deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic), 200 μg/ml BSA, 0.75 μm Cra site-containing DNA fragment) and increasing amounts of the pure Cra. Mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and electrophoresed in a nondenaturing 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide (bisacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer 1× (pH 8.9)). Finally, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using a Gel Doc XR (Bio-Rad). In the experiments for identification of potential effectors, Cra was incubated with the DNA fragment in the presence of 1 mm fructose (Fluka, 99% purity), 1 mm F1P (Sigma, 100% purity), FBP (Sigma, 98% purity), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P, Sigma, 98% purity), glucose 6-phosphate (G6P, Sigma, 100% purity), and then the samples were run in a gel and analyzed as described before. ITC experiments were performed on a VP microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. Prior to experiments, Cra was thoroughly dialyzed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT (pH 8.0). After dialysis, the protein solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and its concentration was determined by UV absorption spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of 1.217 × 105 cm M−1 at 280 nm (20Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, 2005: 571-607Google Scholar). Effectors were prepared by diluting pure powdered products in filtered dialysis buffer so that the ligand and protein solvent were the same. Each titration involved a single 1.6-μl injection and a series of 4.8-μl injections of a 250 μm preparation of each of the effectors into a 7.5 μm protein solution deposited in the 1.4-ml chamber of the apparatus. For DNA binding studies, the 22-bp DNA fragment used in EMSA experiments (see above) was dialyzed so that the DNA and protein solvent were the same. In this case, the assays consisted of the injection of 4.8-μl aliquots of 60 μm DNA into a protein solution of 10 μm in the same 1.4-ml chamber. The mean enthalpies measured from injection of the ligands into the buffer were subtracted from raw titration data prior to data fitting using the One Binding Site model of the MicroCal version of the ORIGIN software. From the curves thus fitted, the parameters ΔH (reaction enthalpy), KA (binding constant, KA = 1/KD), and n (reaction stoichiometry) were determined. From the values of KA and ΔH, the change in free energy (ΔG) and in entropy (ΔS) were calculated with the equation: ΔG = -RT lnKA = ΔH - TΔS, where R is the universal molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with a UV-visible absorbance detection system. Sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out on an An50Ti eight-hole rotor in phosphate buffer with 150 mm imidazole and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) (elution buffer in protein purification) at 45,000 rpm, with 400 μl of protein solution (0.5, 1, and 1.3 mg/ml) in each cell, using double-sector Epon-charcoal centerpieces. Differential sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s) were calculated by least squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the SEDFIT program (21Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 22Schuck P. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From this analysis, the experimental sedimentation coefficients (s) were corrected for solvent composition and temperature to obtain the corresponding standard s values (s20,w, standard solvent conditions, pure water at 20 °C) using the SEDNTERP program (23Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein. Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Partial specific volume of 0.7312 ml g−1 at 20 °C was calculated from the amino acid composition (24Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S. Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, England1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C by centrifugation of 80-μl samples of Cra at 11,000, 13,000, and 19,000 rpm in the Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge. Conservation of mass in the cell was verified in all the experiments. After the equilibrium scans, a high-speed centrifugation run (45,000 rpm) was done to estimate the corresponding baseline offsets. Weight-average buoyant molecular weights were determined by fitting a single-species model to the experimental data using the Hetero-Analysis program (25Cole J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 212-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The absolute molecular weight of the Cra protein was determined using the partial specific volume (0.7312 ml g−1) and the solvent density (1.0207 mg/ml). In addition, the oligomerization form of P. putida Cra was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography. To this end, a protein solution of 1.0 mg/ml was run through a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl (pH 8.0). The molecular weight markers were run under the same conditions. Proteins in the eluted fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The affinity-purified His-tagged Cra protein (see above) was concentrated to 15 mg/ml for its crystallization. During concentration, the sample buffer was diluted ∼50 times against 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. This procedure allowed a high concentration of the protein and avoided amorphous precipitation while simultaneously clearing the samples of the potentially disturbing imidazole left after eluting the protein from the metallo-affinity column. Crystals of the native Cra protein were then generated from a 15-mg/ml protein sample by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. Drops were prepared by mixing 150 nl of protein with 150 nl of crystallization solution and equilibrated against 100 μl of the crystallization solution in Greiner plates. Crystals appeared after 2 days in drops prepared with a solution containing 15% (w/v) of polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 6.5). Selenium-methionine (Se/Met)-derivatized Cra protein was crystallized using identical conditions. The resulting crystals were dialyzed against the same solution supplemented with 20% glycerol before cryofreezing in liquid nitrogen (see below). For the ligand binding experiments, native Cra protein crystals were soaked for 4–7 h in the cryofreezing solution containing 1 mm of each tested candidate effectors (F1P, FBP, F6P, G6P, and fructose). Datasets from the native, effector-less Cra protein, its (Se/Met)-derivatized variant, and the ligand-containing complexes F1P and FBP were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at beamlines ID14–1, ID23–1, and ID14–2 (crystals soaked with F6P, G6P, and fructose did not show any diffraction). The crystals, which belonged to the space group P21, contained two Cra molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content around 43%. Diffraction data were processed with X-ray detector software (XDS) (26Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (27Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure of the protein without effector was solved first by the Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using the Autorickshaw server (28Panjikar S. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Weiss M.S. Tucker P.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and diffraction data extending up to a 2.5-Å resolution. Structure resolution and phasing in the server was carried out by the SHELX programs (29Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The initial model built by RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) gave R-factor/R-free values of 22 and 28%, respectively. The model was manually adjusted using Coot (31Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17675) Google Scholar) and refined using PHENIX 1.6-289 (32Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16817) Google Scholar) with data up to a 2.0-Å resolution to a final R-factor and R-free of 18.4 and 21.8, respectively (supplemental Table S1). Crystal structures of the Cra protein in complex with F1P and FBP were determined by the molecular replacement method using the effector-less structure and the PHASER program (33McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar), followed by refinement with PHENIX 1.6-289 (32Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16817) Google Scholar, supplementary Table S1). The structure of the Cra protein prepared by soaking the crystal with FBP gave an electron density map in the effector binding site that was indistinguishable from the Cra-F1P complex and therefore has not been included separately in supplemental Table S1 (not shown). All residues are in the most favored region (91.7%) or the additional allowed regions (7.9%) of the Ramachandran plot, except the effector-binding Asp-148 that lies in a disallowed region in all structures. Coordinates of the Cra structure and its complex with F1P have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the following codes: PP-Cra, 3O74 and PP-Cra/F1P, 3O75. The genome of the soil bacterium P. putida bears an ORF for a protein (PP0792) of 331 amino acid residues (coordinates 909206–908211) and 38.4-kDa molecular mass that shares 74% similarity and 48% identity with the E. coli Cra protein (supplemental Fig. S2). This identity goes up to 70% in the predicted DNA binding domain of the proteins, suggesting that the target genomic sequences ought to be similar (if not identical) as well. All these criteria qualifies PP0792 as a bona fide ortholog of the reference enterobacterial counterpart. Yet, unlike E. coli and S. typhimurium, the craP. putida variant maps adjacent and divergently oriented to the fruBKA operon (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S3). This gene cluster encodes proteins for phosphorylation and transport of fructose (34Velázquez F. Pflüger K. Cases I. De Eugenio L.I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) through the phosphoenol pyruvate phosphotransferase carbohydrate system of P. putida (Ref. 34Velázquez F. Pflüger K.

To ensure the functional assignment, the craP. putida sequence was amplified, a metallo-affinity His6-tag was added, and the protein was purified to apparent homogeneity as explained under “Experimental Procedures” (see supplemental Fig. S1). On the other hand, analysis of the intergenic region (Fig. 1B) revealed the presence of a motif (5′-TTAAACGTTTCA-3′) with a high score to the consensus binding site for the Cra regulator of E. coli and Salmonella (Fig. 1A, Refs. 3Ramseier T.M.

To examine whether such a sequence was in fact the operator of CraP. putida, a 22-bp double-stranded DNA fragment containing the candidate target was synthesized and employed in the mobility shift assay shown in Fig. 2. The results indicated the formation of one specific complex between the DNA and the CraP. putida, the abundance of which increased with Cra concentration (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W1978935711,"Type 2 diabetes results from an impairment of insulin action. The first demonstrable abnormality of insulin signaling is a decrease of insulin-dependent glucose disposal followed by an increase in hepatic glucose production. In an attempt to dissect the relative importance of these two changes in disease progression, we have employed genetic knock-outs/knock-ins of the insulin receptor. Previously, we demonstrated that insulin receptor knock-out mice (Insr−/−) could be rescued from diabetes by reconstitution of insulin signaling in liver, brain, and pancreatic β cells (L1 mice). In this study, we used a similar approach to reconstitute insulin signaling in tissues that display insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Using GLUT4-Cre mice, we restored InsR expression in muscle, fat, and brain of Insr−/− mice (GIRKI (Glut4-insulin receptor knock-in line 1) mice). Unlike L1 mice, GIRKI mice failed to thrive and developed diabetes, although their survival was modestly extended when compared with Insr−/−. The data underscore the role of developmental factors in the presentation of murine diabetes. The broader implication of our findings is that diabetes treatment should not necessarily target the same tissues that are responsible for disease pathogenesis.

The data underscore the role of developmental factors in the presentation of murine diabetes. The broader implication of our findings is that diabetes treatment should not necessarily target the same tissues that are responsible for disease pathogenesis. Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes arises as a consequence of complex changes in insulin action in different target tissues. Although the factors that favor disease progression are heterogeneous, evidence from prospective human studies and from animal models indicates that an impairment of insulin-dependent glucose uptake and utilization is an early event in the pathogenesis of diabetes (1Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To analyze the contribution of individual organs and cell types to the integrated physiology of insulin action, we and others have used gene targeting by homologous recombination to carry out gain- and loss-of-function experiments affecting insulin signaling (2Nandi A. Kitamura Y. Kahn C.R. Accili D. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In view of its cardinal position in the insulin signaling cascade, the insulin receptor (InsR) 3The abbreviations used are: InsR, insulin receptor; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue. represents an ideal target to manipulate insulin action and study the systemic consequences of insulin resistance in any given tissue (3Okamoto H. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28359-28362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Insr−/− mice can be rescued from neonatal diabetic ketoacidosis by restoring InsR expression in liver, brain, and pancreatic β cells (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Okamoto H. Obici S. Accili D. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings are surprising as they ostensibly indicate that insulin action in tissues with insulin-dependent glucose uptake, such as muscle and fat, is dispensable for metabolic control. However, it can be argued that the restoration of insulin sensitivity in L1 mice is simply an effect of mass action rather than a specific effect of the triple tissue combination. In other words, it does not matter where insulin action is restored so long as a certain minimal number of insulin-sensitive cells are present. Although our mosaic analysis of InsR signaling fails to support this view (6Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Nakae J. Giordano A. Cinti S. Kahn C.R. Efstratiadis A. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility has not been formally excluded. Moreover, we have recently shown that InsR inactivation in Glut4-expressing cell types gives rise to insulin-resistant diabetes (47Lin H.V. Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D. Diabetes. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). For these reasons, we sought to determine the metabolic consequences of reconstituting InsR expression in Glut4-expressing cell types of Insr−/− mice. In this study, we generated InsR knock-in mice in which insulin action was selectively restored in muscle, adipocytes, and Glut4-expressing brain cells. The data show that restoring insulin signaling in these tissues is not sufficient to rescue Insr−/− from diabetes and that the phenotype of these mice does not differ from that of mice with brain-restricted InsR reactivation.

Insr+/−::βac/INSR mice were intercrossed with Insr+/−::Synapsin-Cre or Insr+/−::GLUT4-Cre mice to generate Insr−/−::βac/INSR::Synapsin-Cre (NIRKI) and Insr−/−:: βac/INSR::GLUT4-Cre (GIRKI lines 1 and 2) mice. WT (Insr+/+::βac/IR, Insr+/+::Synapsin-Cre, Insr+/+::GLUT4-Cre, Insr+/+::βac/INSR::Synapsin-Cre, or Insr+/+::βac/INSR:: GLUT4-Cre) littermates were used as controls. Animals were maintained on a mixed background derived from 129/Sv, C57BL/6, and FVB strains. Genotyping was performed as described previously (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I.

All animal procedures have been approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee. Blood glucose was measured by the OneTouch Ultra meter (LifeScan). Urine ketone bodies and glucose were measured by Ketostix and Diastix (Bayer). Free fatty acids and triglycerides were measured by NEFA-HR test reagents (Wako Chemicals) and a serum triglyceride determination kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Insulin was measured by ELISA; adiponectin, leptin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) were measured by Luminex (Linco Research). C-peptide was measured by the Hormone and Metabolite Core at the New York Obesity Research Center. Hepatic glycogen and triglycerides were measured as described previously (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Detergent extracts were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration of extracts was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (40–100 μg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with antibodies against InsR β (C-19) and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total tissue RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit and RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and an AffinityScript cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using a DNA Engine Opticon 3 system (Bio-Rad) and DyNAmo HS SYBR green quantitative PCR kit (New England Biolabs). See supplemental Table 1 for primer sequences. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using standard curves, with the PCR product for each primer set normalized to 36B4 for muscle and liver and Rps3 for fat. Pancreata were fixed in formalin overnight and embedded in paraffin, and consecutive sections 5 μm in thickness were mounted on slides. Sections were stained with antibodies against insulin, glucagon, Ki-67, active caspase-3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and FoxO1 (11Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D.

The β cell area and islet cell proliferation were determined using three sections spanning 200 μm/pancreas as described previously (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D.

Data sets were analyzed for statistical significance with one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Bonferroni test using the SPSS software. To analyze whether reconstitution of insulin action in Glut4-expressing tissues sufficed to prevent diabetes in Insr−/− mice, we used a genetic knock-in approach to reactivate InsR expression (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Insr+/− mice bearing a β-actin locus modified to encode a loxP-stop-LoxP INSR cassette were bred with two different lines of GLUT4-Cre transgenic mice. The knock-in allele encodes INSR-B, the predominant isoform in muscle and fat that includes exon 11 of the human INSR gene (13Seino S. Bell G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 14Moller D.E. Yokota A. Caro J.F. Flier J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Line GLUT4-Cre 546 exhibits recombination in muscle, fat, and brain, whereas line GLUT4-Cre 535 differs from line 546 by the absence of recombination in fat (47Lin H.V. Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D. Diabetes. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, we generated mice in which InsR expression was restricted to muscle, fat, and brain (Glut4-insulin receptor knock-in line 1, henceforth GIRKI-1) or to skeletal muscle and brain (henceforth, GIRKI-2). Western blot analyses showed reconstitution of InsR expression in skeletal muscle of GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice (levels were estimated at 134 ± 23 and 113 ± 15% of WT, respectively), whereas only GIRKI-1 mice displayed InsR reconstitution in white adipose tissue (WAT) (levels were 60 ± 8% of WT) (Fig. 1A). InsR expression was not detected in brown adipose tissue (BAT), heart, and liver of GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice (Fig. 1A). We also detected InsR expression in total brain lysates of GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice (Fig. 1A). More detailed analyses indicated that InsR was expressed in cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and the olfactory bulb (Fig. 1B and data not shown), consistent with our previous findings that Glut4-Cre induces recombination in selected neuronal subpopulations (47Lin H.V. Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D. Diabetes. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar) overlapping with endogenous Glut4 expression (15Vannucci S.J. Koehler-Stec E.M. Li K.

Brain Res. 2005; 1049: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a control for the specificity of the findings in GIRKI-1 and -2 mice, we also generated knock-in mice expressing InsR in neurons only (NIRKI) using Synapsin-Cre mice (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Zhu Y. Romero M.I. Ghosh P. Ye Z. Charnay P. Rushing E.J. Marth J.D. Parada L.F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 859-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). As shown previously, we detected widespread InsR reconstitution in the brain but not in peripheral tissues (Fig. 1B) (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice were born in Mendelian ratios without apparent abnormalities. When compared with Insr−/− mice, whose median lifespan is 4 days (7Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P. Asico L.D. José P.A. Taylor S.I. Westphal H. Nat.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1542-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice displayed significant lifespan extensions (Fig. 2A). The median lifespan of the three groups was similar (11–12 days), with the GIRKI-2 group attaining the longest mean lifespan (15 versus 10.6 and 11 days in GIRKI-1 and NIRKI mice, respectively). A small fraction of GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice (3, 16, and 7%, respectively) survived longer than 3 weeks, and few GIRKI-2 and NIRKI mice survived up to 4 months. GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice were stunted, attaining 47–69% of WT body weight at postnatal day 9 and ∼30% of WT body weight at 4 weeks of age (Fig. 2, B and C), similar to InsR mosaic mice (6Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Nakae J. Giordano A. Cinti S. Kahn C.R. Efstratiadis A. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was correlated with 7–10-fold increases in hepatic insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (Igfbp1) mRNA levels when compared with WT (Fig. 2D) (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). More than 80% of GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice became hyperglycemic within 2 weeks of birth (Fig. 3A), with attendant glycosuria (Table 1) and 30–40-fold increases in plasma insulin levels (Fig. 3A). The increases in plasma C-peptide levels (Table 1) were more modest (2.2–2.8-fold), resulting in >20-fold increases in the insulin/C-peptide ratios (Table 1) and indicating that increased insulin secretion and defective insulin clearance contribute to hyperinsulinemia in these mice. 1–2-week-old NIRKI mice also displayed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia similar to those observed in GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice (Fig. 3A). In addition, 50–80% of 1–2-week-old GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice showed ketonuria (Table 1), indicating that ketoacidosis is a likely cause of death.TABLE 1Metabolic characteristics of experimental animals (7–12 days old)GenotypeWTGIRKI-1GIRKI-2NIRKIKetonuriaNone9/115/108/11Liver steatosisNone16/2215/2215/18LipemiaNone6/226/147/20GlycosuriaNone10/1021/2213/13FFA (meq/liter)0.78 ± 0.101.28 ± 0.14*1.23 ± 0.17*1.38 ± 0.18*Adiponectin (mg/ml)8.23 ± 1.634.37 ± 0.17*4.37 ± 0.16*4.77 ± 0.85*Leptin (ng/ml)2.12 ± 0.390.59 ± 0.31*1.16 ± 0.560.24 ± 0.08**MCP-1 (pg/ml)≤25†≤156 ± 44*≤113 ± 85≤25TNFα (pg/ml)62.2 ± 4.594.6 ± 13.8*63.1 ± 2.255.3 ± 6.2C-peptide (nm)1.15 ± 0.172.55 ± 0.49*3.20 ± 0.67**NDInsulin/C-peptide (arbitrary units)1.0 ± 0.222.5 ± 7.3*38.6 ± 15.5*ND Open table in a new tab The rare GIRKI-2 and NIRKI survivors at 3–5 weeks (the GIRKI-1 group did not have sufficient survivors for statistical analysis) displayed a further 40% increase in glycemia accompanied by a 60–70% decrease in insulin levels (Fig. 3B) when compared with 1–2-week-old mice, indicating progressive exhaustion of the pancreatic β cell compensatory capacity. These data indicate that InsR reconstitution in brain (NIRKI), in brain/muscle (GIRKI-2), and in brain/muscle/WAT (GIRKI-1) prolongs survival of Insr−/− mice but fails to prevent diabetes and premature death. The similarities in survival and metabolic phenotypes between NIRKI and GIRKI-1 or GIRKI-2 mice suggest that the predominant effect in these mice is due to restored CNS insulin signaling. Histological analyses of skeletal muscle in 1–2-week-old GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice showed normal fiber composition (Fig. 4A and data not shown). This is consistent with restoration of InsR signaling to FoxO1, which can disrupt myogenesis and reduce slow-twitch fibers (19Kitamura T. Kitamura Y.I. Funahashi Y. Shawber C.J. Castrillon D.H. Kollipara R. DePinho R.A. Kitajewski J. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2477-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, mRNA expression of PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) coactivator 1α (Ppargc1a), a transcriptional coactivator promoting the formation of slow-twitch fibers (20Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), was modestly increased in GIRKI-1 and tended to be increased in GIRKI-2 muscles (Fig. 4B), thus restoring the formation of slow-twitch fibers. Histological analyses in 1-week-old GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI pups revealed interscapular BAT with normal morphology (Fig. 5A) but a substantial reduction of subcutaneous WAT and absent visceral WAT (21Cinti S. Eberbach S. Castellucci M. Accili D. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cellular infiltration, occasionally of granulomatous appearance, and fibrosis were present in the residual fat pads (Fig. 5, B and C), consistent with lipodystrophy (22Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 23Pajvani U.B. Trujillo M.E. Combs T.P. Iyengar P. Jelicks L. Roth K.A. Kitsis R.N. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Circulating leptin levels were significantly decreased in GIRKI-1 and NIRKI mice, as were adiponectin levels in all three groups of knock-in mice when compared with WT controls (Table 1) (9Lin H.V. Kim J.Y. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Accili D. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1969-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 27–43% of 1–2-week-old GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice were hyperlipidemic (Table 1), and serum free fatty acids were increased by 57–76% in all three groups when compared with WT (Table 1), consistent with increased lipolysis. Expression of Pparg, the master adipogenic regulator, was normal in subcutaneous WAT of GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice, and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) expression was reduced in GIRKI-1 mice (Fig. 5D). MCP-1 and TNFα, both pro-inflammatory cytokines, were significantly increased in GIRKI-1 mice but not in GIRKI-2 or NIRKI mice (Table 1). Expression of F4/80, a macrophage marker, and Cd3e, a T cell marker, was not affected in WAT of GIRKI-1 mice (Fig. 5D), suggesting that adipocytes are the source of increased cytokines as a consequence of restored InsR signaling and excess nutrient flux. In addition, glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (Chop), key mediators of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum, were reduced in GIRKI-1 mice, as was uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) (Fig. 5D). A majority of 1-week-old GIRKI-1, GIRKI-2, and NIRKI mice had pale livers (Table 1); Oil Red O staining revealed extensive accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets (Fig. 6A) and a 5–14-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride (TG) content when compared with WT (Fig. 6C). Conversely, all three groups of mice showed significant decreases in liver glycogen content (Fig. 6, B and D). Interestingly, lipid accumulation was accompanied by significant decreases in hepatic mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1) and its target genes Fasn and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (Acaca) (Fig. 7, A–C) in GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice, consistent with decreased triglyceride synthesis. Although Ppara mRNA was modestly decreased in GIRKI-1 mice (Fig. 7D), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a) expression was normal (Fig. 7E), and acyl-CoA oxidase-1 (Acox1) was increased 2-fold in both GIRKI-1 and GIRKI-2 mice when compared with WT (Fig. 7F), indicative of increased free fatty acid oxidation. These data suggest that lipid accumulation in GIRKI and NIRKI mice primarily results from increased free fatty acids and lipoprotein flux to the liver. The decrease of lipogenic gene expression is likely to result from hepatic InsR deficiency (24Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol.

The pancreatic β cell area was increased 2–3-fold in all three groups when compared with WT (Fig. 8C). By 4 weeks of age, islets displayed reduced insulin immunoreactivity and decreased size in all genotypes (Fig. 8, D and E), consistent with the relative decrease in plasma insulin levels at this age (Fig. 3B). In addition, cellular infiltration and islet loss were apparent in a subset of all three groups of knock-in mice (Fig. 8, F and G and data not shown). The number of Ki-67-positive cells detected by immunohistochemistry increased in all mutant mice, indicating that the increase of the β cell area likely results from hyperproliferation (Fig. 9, A and D). These data indicate that InsR signaling in β cells is dispensable for β cell hyperproliferation in response to insulin resistance, as shown previously (27Okada T. Liew C.W. Hu J. Hinault C.

That skeletal muscle is an important site of insulin resistance in humans, leading to adaptive changes in nutrient utilization from carbohydrates to lipids and to compensatory β cell hyperplasia, is beyond dispute (32Petersen K.F. Dufour S. Savage D.B. Bilz S. Solomon G. Yonemitsu S. Cline G.W. Befroy D. Zemany L. Kahn B.B. Papademetris X. Rothman D.L. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12587-12594Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, targeted mutagenesis of genes required for insulin-dependent glucose disposal in muscle and/or fat of mice has limited metabolic consequences (33Lauro D. Kido Y. Castle A.L. Zarnowski M.J.

Invest. 2004; 114: 1666-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, gain-of-function experiments show that diabetes due to InsR knock-out can be “cured” by restoration of InsR function in liver, brain, and β cells despite the absence of InsR in muscle and fat (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Okamoto H. Obici S. Accili D. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These data indicate that mice can overcome the insulin resistance of muscle and adipose tissue as long as hepatic insulin action is preserved and there are no additional strains on the β cell. The truism that mice are different from humans and that this set of observations amounts to little more than a quirk of comparative physiology brings little solace to the urgency of developing effective diabetes treatments and does not change the fact that only rodent models combine the ability to modify genes with advanced phenotyping capabilities and a detailed understanding of integrated physiology. The lesson learned from the failure of muscle- and fat-specific InsR knock-outs to develop either insulin resistance or diabetes is that additional insulin target tissues must be involved in the primary defect of insulin action. A prime, if overlooked, candidate in that regard is the CNS as a reemerging body of work indicates that insulin signaling in hypothalamic neurons accounts for its indirect effects on hepatic glucose production (5Okamoto H. Obici S. Accili D. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Obici S. Feng Z. Karkanias G. Baskin D.G. Rossetti L. Nat.

Interestingly, although the nature of the effects of insulin on these neurons remains unclear, the fact that both insulin and glucose regulate their electrical activity would appear to link insulin signaling to glucose sensing (39Könner A.C.

Nature. 2005; 434: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Based on evidence demonstrating that the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter Glut4 is scattered throughout the CNS (41Maher F. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we developed transgenic mice in which Cre-mediated DNA excision occurred under the transcriptional control of the GLUT4 promoter in muscle, fat, and Glut4-expressing CNS neurons. Consistent with the prediction, we found that Glut4-InsR knock-out mice (GIRKO) recapitulated all aspects of insulin resistance and developed diabetes with high frequency (47Lin H.V. Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D. Diabetes. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). These data indicate that insulin resistance can singlehandedly cause diabetes, regardless of primary defects of β cell function, when it involves Glut4-expressing cells in CNS, muscle, and fat. However, are the sites of onset of insulin resistance necessarily the same sites that should be targeted to treat diabetes? The question has more than academic interest as prospective data indicate that the contribution of different tissues to hyperglycemia changes as a function of disease progression and control (42Monnier L. Colette C. Dunseath G.J. Owens D.R. Diabetes Care. 2007; 30: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To address this question, we asked whether restoring InsR function in InsR-deficient mice would suffice to rescue them from diabetes. In other words, the loss-of-function experiment explored the pathophysiology of insulin-resistant diabetes, whereas the gain-of-function experiment addressed its treatment. The finding that the muscle/fat/GLUT4 neuron combination is insufficient to rescue Insr−/− mice from diabetes provides several useful lessons. First, comparison of the phenotype of GIRKI-1 and -2 mice with those of NIRKI mice suggests that the admittedly modest metabolic amelioration seen in the former, when compared with Insr−/− mice, is likely to reflect the contribution of the brain (4Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Second, the absence of InsR in pancreatic β cells accelerates their failure and is accompanied by the loss of FoxO1 expression, consistent with a protective role of FoxO1 against β cell failure and the role of hyperglycemia to promote FoxO1 degradation (11Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These data add to a body of evidence indicating that InsR function in β cells promotes compensatory hyperplasia and survival (12Okamoto H. Hribal M.L. Lin H.V. Bennett W.R. Ward A. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Okada T. Liew C.W. Hu J. Hinault C. Michael M.D. Krtzfeldt J. Yin C. Holzenberger M. Stoffel M. Kulkarni R.N. Proc. Natl.

Why is the outcome of the knock-out different from that of the knock-in? We show that the levels of InsR expression in GIRKI-1 and -2 mice are similar to WT controls, indicating that the experiment worked from a technical standpoint. INSR-B, the isoform used in this study, is the predominant splicing isoform in muscle and fat, which also express the 12-amino acid-shorter isoform INSR-A at lower levels (14Moller D.E. Yokota A. Caro J.F. Flier J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It remains formally possible that certain INSR-A-specific functions may not have been rescued by re-expression of INSR-B. However, unlike its specific prenatal role in response to high affinity binding of IGF-II (45Nakae J. Kido Y. Accili D. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 818-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), it is unclear that the postnatal metabolic role of INSR-A is sufficiently different from INSR-B to engender the differences seen in this study. Therefore, we propose that the differences between the knock-out and the knock-in have a developmental basis. Newborn mice depend on liver for conversion of triglycerides into ketones for brain growth, whereas insulin-dependent glucose uptake is less important in the neonatal period (46Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In fact, adipose tissue begins to form in earnest only after birth, whereas skeletal muscle can compensate for the lack of InsR through contraction-stimulated glucose uptake (1Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, Insr−/−mice can survive if their hepatic insulin action is restored, but they are relatively unresponsive to restoration of insulin action in muscle and fat. Conversely, in adult mice, muscle and fat have achieved their target mass and account for a significant fraction of glucose disposal, and thus impairments of their insulin sensitivity are bound to have metabolic consequences. In addition, the CNS can affect hepatic glucose production; hence, the combination of impaired glucose uptake and excessive glucose production is the likely cause of diabetes in the GIRKO mice (47Lin H.V. Ren H. Samuel V.T. Lee H.Y. Lu T.Y. Shulman G.I. Accili D. Diabetes. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). In future studies, it will be important to address whether, in addition to the established mechanisms of insulin resistance, there are developmental circuits involving brain, liver, and β cells, whose disruption by the congenital deficiency of InsR may prevent restoration of insulin sensitivity in GIRKI mice. In view of the growing interest in the role of the uterine environment on adult metabolism, such studies are likely to have wide-ranging implications in the fight against metabolic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2026212936,"Mineralized matrix formation is a well orchestrated event requiring several players. Glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein that has been implicated in functional roles ranging from involvement in cancer biology to serving as a receptor for viruses. In the present study we explored the role of GRP-78 in mineralized matrix formation. Differential expression of GRP-78 mRNA and protein was observed upon in vitro differentiation of primary mouse calvarial cells. An interesting observation was that GRP-78 was identified in the secretome of these cells and in the bone matrix, suggesting an extracellular function during matrix formation. In vitro nucleation experiments under physiological concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions indicated that GRP-78 can induce the formation of calcium phosphate polymorphs by itself, when bound to immobilized type I collagen and on demineralized collagen wafers. We provide evidence that GRP-78 can bind to DMP1 and type I collagen independent of each other in a simulated extracellular environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate the cell surface localization of GRP-78 and provide evidence that it functions as a receptor for DMP1 endocytosis in pre-osteoblasts and primary calvarial cells. Overall, this study represents a paradigm shift in the biological function of GRP-78."

J. 1998; 336: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). In addition, it functions as a secretagogue for hormones, such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin (2Alba-Roth J. Müller O.A.

Under normal conditions, endogenous arginine synthesis in adult mammals suffices to sustain daily requirements (5Visek W.J. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but a dietary source of arginine may become necessary when demand increases under anabolic or catabolic conditions (5Visek W.J. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For this reason, arginine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid. Arginine deficiency represents a significant metabolic problem in premature infants (6Wu G. Jaeger L.A. Bazer F.W. Rhoads J.M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2004; 15: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but its cause remains unknown. In rapidly growing suckling rodents, endogenous arginine biosynthesis is crucial to compensate for the insufficient supply of arginine via the milk (7Davis T.A. Fiorotto M.L. Reeds P.J. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The intestine rather than the kidney is primarily responsible for endogenous arginine synthesis in suckling piglets (8Wu G. Am. J.

In suckling rodents, the enterocytes of the small intestine also express all enzymes necessary to synthesize arginine (10De Jonge. W.J. Dingemanse M.A. de Boer P.A. Lamers W.H. Moorman A.F. Pediatr.

Furthermore, the features of the “arginine-deficiency syndrome” are not seen in mice that are deficient in all three nitric-oxide synthases (18Tsutsui M. Shimokawa H. Morishita T. Nakashima Y.

This leaves two functions of arginine as likely candidates to account for the highly characteristic phenotype of arginine deficiency in suckling mice, viz. its role as a building block in protein synthesis and as a secretagogue of hormones. Amino acids, including arginine, control translation by two well-established mechanisms. Whenever the intracellular concentration of free arginine decreases below ∼20 μm, the charging process of its corresponding tRNA slows down and the concentration of uncharged tRNA increases (19Vellekamp G. Sihag R.K. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9843-9847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uncharged tRNAs activate the ubiquitously expressed “general control non-derepressible2” (GCN2) stress kinase, which then phosphorylates the α-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) and thereby initiates the “integrated stress response” (20Ron D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 21Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 22Zhang P. McGrath B.C. Reinert J. Olsen D.S. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S.A. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This response blocks cap-dependent protein synthesis, facilitates the translation of specific mRNAs, such as Atf4 and Cat-1, from internal ribosome entry sites, and increases expression of specific transcription factors such as ATF2, ATF4, and CHOP (23Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which, in turn, induce the transcription of genes necessary for amino acid synthesis and transport. The other mechanism senses, instead, increases in amino acid concentration, probably via the Rag GTPase complex (24Shaw R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 565-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and results in the activation of the mTORC1 kinase. mTORC1, in turn, regulates cap-dependent translation through the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1 (25Avruch J. Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Rapley J. Papageorgiou A. Dai N. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E592-E602Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Ma X.M. Blenis J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The essential amino acid leucine is the prototypic regulator of both branches of amino acid-dependent translational regulation (22Zhang P. McGrath B.C. Reinert J. Olsen D.S. Lei L. Gill S. Wek S.A. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 27Drummond M.J. Rasmussen B.B. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2008; 11: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, for a non-essential amino acid, arginine has an unexpectedly strong effect on mTORC1-dependent signaling (28Yao K. Yin Y.L. Chu W. Liu Z. Deng D. Li T. Huang R. Zhang J. Tan B. Wang W. Wu G. J. Nutr. 2008; 138: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and quantitatively rivals leucine in vitro (29Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 30Nakajo T. Yamatsuji T. Ban H. Shigemitsu K. Haisa M. Motoki T. Noma K. Nobuhisa T. Matsuoka J. Gunduz M. Yonezawa K. Tanaka N. Naomoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The F/A2 phenotype could, therefore, be mediated by activation of GCN2 signaling and/or inhibition of mTORC1-mediated signaling. The more remarkable phenotypic features of F/A2 mice, namely impaired muscle and hair growth and impaired B-cell maturation, are all also affected by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling (31Foulstone E.J. Huser C. Crown A.L. Holly J.M. Stewart C.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Kim H. Barton E. Muja N. Yakar S. Pennisi P. Leroith D.

Dermatol. 2005; 125: 873-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Like amino acids, growth factor signals, including those arising from IGF1, stimulate protein synthesis via the mTORC1 pathway (36Soulard A. Hall M.N. Cell. 2007; 129: 434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The production of IGF1, in turn, is largely dependent on growth-hormone (GH) signaling (37Rodriguez S. Gaunt T.R. Day I.N. Hum. Genet. 2007; 122: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Arginine, finally, is also a potent growth-hormone secretagogue (38Laron Z. Drugs. 1995; 50: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Arginine deficiency could, therefore, also cause insufficient signaling via the mTORC1 pathway due to an inactive somatotropic axis. In the present study, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to test the hypotheses that arginine deficiency activates GCN2 signaling or blocks mTORC1 signaling, or both. Our findings demonstrate that arginine deficiency in the neonatal and suckling period activates the GCN2 stress-kinase pathway, without affecting the mTORC1 pathway. Transgenic mice that overexpress arginase-I in their small-intestinal enterocytes (F/A2 line (14de Jonge W.J. Hallemeesch M.M. Kwikkers K.L. Ruijter J.M. de Gier-de Vries C. van Roon M.A. Meijer A.J.

Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar) originated from the colony of D. Ron (New York, NY). Control animals were littermates of the experimental animals. Animal studies were reviewed and approved by the committee for animal care and use of Maastricht University. Litters were limited to 5 animals on neonatal day 1 (ND1) and weighed daily. Starting on ND3, 3 mg/kg body weight of human recombinant growth hormone (hrGH; Humatrope, Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was administered subcutaneously in 25 μl of vehicle twice daily (40Liu J.L. Yakar S. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4436-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Control animals were injected with vehicle alone. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Blood was collected into heparin-containing tubes and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. IGF-1 protein concentrations were measured in plasma, whereas amino acids were measured in deproteinized plasma. 80 μl of plasma was added to 6.4 mg of lyophilized sulfosalicylic acid, vortexed, and stored at −20 °C. For amino acid measurements, the tissues were homogenized with silica mini-beads in 0.33 m sulfosalicylic acid. Tissues were collected at ND0, ND10, ND17, and ND21. Amino acid concentrations were determined by HPLC (41van Eijk H.M. Rooyakkers D.R. Deutz N.E. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 620: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Tissues for protein and mRNA analysis were isolated, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For histological analysis, tissues were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Mouse IGF-1 concentration in plasma and muscle was measured by the m/r IGF-1 E25 enzyme immunoassay, as detailed by the manufacturer (Mediagnost, Reutlingen, Germany). This assay eliminates IGFBP interference with the IGF-1 measurement. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Sigma). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences (supplemental Table S1) were optimized for an annealing temperature of 60 °C, except for the Igf1 primers that were annealed at 70 °C. cDNA samples for mRNA determination were diluted 60-fold before use and those for 18 S rRNA 200-fold. Primary fluorescent data were exported and analyzed with the Lin-Reg Analysis program (42Ruijter J.M. Ramakers C. Hoogaars W.M. Karlen Y. Bakker O. van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). If reverse transcriptase was omitted, no product formed. mRNA concentrations were expressed relative to 18 S rRNA content. Between session variations in replicate experiments were corrected using factor correction (43Ruijter J.M. Thygesen H.H. Schoneveld O.J. Das A.T. Berkhout B. Lamers W.H. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For Western blot assays, 100 μg of protein were loaded per lane. Antibody (supplemental Table S2) binding was visualized using the Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). For detection of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of eIF2α, the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (Li-cor Bioscience, UK) was used. For immunostaining, 5-μm sections of tissues were prepared. After deparaffinization, sections were preincubated with Teng-T (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Tween-20)/10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 30 min, followed by an overnight incubation with the primary antibody diluted in Teng-T/10% NGS. Slides were then washed with PBS and incubated with Teng-T/10% NGS for 15 min, followed by 90 min incubation with the secondary antibody (supplemental Table S2) in Teng-T/10% NGS. After washing, the slides were incubated with alkaline phosphatase substrate (NBT/BCIP tablets; Roche) at 37 °C. Digital images of the sections were analyzed with the Leica Quantimet 500 Image Analysis System, v3.2 (44van Straaten H.W. He Y. van Duist M.M. Labruyère W.T. Vermeulen J.L. van Dijk P.J. Ruijter J.M. Lamers W.H. Hakvoort T.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The significant difference for one variable between two distinct groups was analyzed using an unpaired Student's t test. For more complex analyses of significance for variables with different controls, each gene was analyzed using Gaussian linear regression, including 18 S as housekeeping gene. When appropriate, additional explanatory variables such as tissue type, strain, and time were included in the model. Finally, interactions among the included variables were considered. The inference criterion used for comparing the models is their ability to predict the observed data, i.e. models are compared directly through their minimized minus log-likelihood. When the numbers of parameters in models differ, they are penalized by adding the number of estimated parameters, a form of the Akaike information criterion (45.Akaike, H., (1973) Second International Symposium on Information Theory, Akademia Kiado.Google Scholar). If the most likely model contains the treatment effect, the fold change representing the ratio between the variable of the treated group and the same variable for the control is computed, as well as its 95% confidence interval. The phenotype of F/A2 mice is compatible with a deficiency of GH and/or IGF1. We, therefore, investigated the GH content in the pituitary gland by quantitative immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A). The somatotropes of 3-week-old hemi- and homozygous F/A2 mice contained 1.4- and 2.2-fold more GH, respectively, than those of their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1B), indicating an inverse correlation with the severity of the F/A2 phenotype (14de Jonge W.J. Hallemeesch M.M. Kwikkers K.L. Ruijter J.M. de Gier-de Vries C. van Roon M.A. Meijer A.J. Marescau B. de Deyn P.P. Deutz N.E. Lamers W.H. Am. J. Clin Nutr. 2002; 76: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16de Jonge W.J. Marescau B. D'Hooge R. De Deyn P.P. Hallemeesch M.M. Deutz N.E. Ruijter J.M. Lamers W.H. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2732-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We then used the rat pituitary cell line GH3, which produces GH (46Adrião M. Chrisman C.J. Bielavsky M. Olinto S.C. Shiraishi E.M. Nunes M.T. Neuroendocrinology. 2004; 79: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 47Liu Y.L. Zhong Y.Q. Chi S.M. Zhu Y.L. Sheng. Li Xue Bao. 2005; 57: 254-258PubMed Google Scholar), to assess the direct effects of arginine on GH production and secretion. GH content in the GH3 cells was assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) and ELISA (supplemental Fig. S1C). Both assays showed that, after 24 h of culture, the cellular GH content was inversely correlated with extracellular arginine concentration and decreased from ∼50 to ∼25 pg of GH per cell at 0 and 200 μm arginine in the medium, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1C; significant at ≥50 μm arginine). This decrease in cellular GH content was accounted for by a 1.5-fold increase in concentration of GH in the medium (significant at ≥25 μm arginine). Because the total GH content of the cells and the medium combined did not vary with arginine concentration in the medium, these findings reveal a pronounced concentration-dependent effect of arginine on GH secretion. The dependence of GH secretion on the ambient concentration of arginine after 72 h of culture was similar to that observed after 24 h (not shown). These data show that, below a concentration of 50 μm ambient arginine, GH secretion is reduced, with a half-maximal effect at ∼20 μm arginine. As early as 3 days after birth (ND3), F/A2 mice can be distinguished from their wild-type littermates by a lower body weight (14de Jonge W.J. Hallemeesch M.M. Kwikkers K.L. Ruijter J.M. de Gier-de Vries C. van Roon M.A. Meijer A.J. Marescau B. de Deyn P.P. Deutz N.E. Lamers W.H. Am. J. Clin Nutr. 2002; 76: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To assess whether the typically hypomorphic tissues of F/A2 mice (muscle, hair, and B-cells (15de Jonge W.J. Kwikkers K.L. te Velde A.A. van Deventer S.J. Nolte M.A. Mebius R.E. Ruijter J.M. Lamers M.C. Lamers W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) respond to GH supplementation, mice were subcutaneously injected twice daily with 3 mg/kg recombinant human (rh)GH from ND3 onwards. This dose of rhGH mediates growth in liver IGF-1-deficient mice (40Liu J.L. Yakar S. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4436-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that the growth rate of homozygous F/A2 mice was ∼50% of that of wild-type mice and that treatment with rhGH had no effect on the growth rate of either wild-type or F/A2 mice. GH action is mediated by GH receptors (GHR) and results in the synthesis and secretion of IGF1 in target tissues. Ghr mRNA concentrations in the livers of ND1, ND10, and ND21 mice increased with age, but were not different in wild-type and F/A2 mice (supplemental Fig. S2). To assess the functionality of these GHRs and their downstream signaling pathway, Igf1 mRNA concentrations were quantified in liver and muscle of GH-treated and control mice (Fig. 1D). In both tissues, Igf1 mRNA concentrations in F/A2 mice were only 10–15% of those in wild-type mice. Although the rhGH injections increased Igf1 mRNA concentration in liver and muscle of both F/A2 and wild-type mice considerably (∼8- and ∼2.5-fold, respectively; p < 0.01), Igf1 mRNA levels in the liver and muscle of treated F/A2 mice increased to only ∼65 and ∼25%, respectively, of that in untreated wild-type mice. We then measured plasma and tissue IGF1 concentrations to assess whether F/A2 mice suffer from a low production of IGF1 (Fig. 2). In wild-type and F/A2 ND1 mice, no differences in plasma, muscle, or liver IGF1 protein were detected (Fig. 2A). However, plasma IGF1 levels increased ∼7-fold faster in wild-type than F/A2 mice during the first 5 postnatal weeks (Fig. 2B, left panel; p < 0.001)). Plasma IGF1 levels reflect hepatic IGF1 production, but liver IGF1 does not affect growth until 6 weeks postnatally (48Sjögren K. Liu J.L. Blad K. Skrtic S. Vidal O. Wallenius V. LeRoith D. Törnell J. Isaksson O.G. Jansson J.O. Ohlsson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7088-7092Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 49Yakar S. Liu J.L. Stannard B. Butler A. Accili D. Sauer B. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7324-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). We, therefore, measured IGF1 levels in an affected tissue (calf muscle) of the same mice (Fig. 2B, right panel). Muscular IGF1 concentration decreased gradually between 1 and 3 weeks after birth, without difference between F/A2 and wild-type mice. After weaning, the IGF1 concentration in muscle increased again, with a ∼1 week delay in F/A2 relative to wild-type mice. Although the age-dependent changes in muscle IGF1 content were significant (p < 0.01), they did not differ between F/A2 and wild-type mice. Because IGF1 in skeletal muscle affects growth only after the 3rd postnatal week (32Kim H. Barton E. Muja N. Yakar S. Pennisi P. Leroith D. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), that is, coincident with the resumption of growth in F/A2 mice (14de Jonge W.J. Hallemeesch M.M. Kwikkers K.L. Ruijter J.M. de Gier-de Vries C. van Roon M.A. Meijer A.J. Marescau B. de Deyn P.P. Deutz N.E. Lamers W.H. Am. J. Clin Nutr. 2002; 76: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we further concluded that, although the GH-IGF-1 axis did not function properly in F/A2 mice, its disturbed function could not account for the marked hypotrophy seen in these animals. F/A2 skeletal muscles have an immature appearance (14de Jonge W.J. Hallemeesch M.M. Kwikkers K.L. Ruijter J.M. de Gier-de Vries C. van Roon M.A. Meijer A.J. Marescau B. de Deyn P.P. Deutz N.E. Lamers W.H. Am. J. Clin Nutr. 2002; 76: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated if arginine directly affects muscle development in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts that were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of arginine. Supplemental Fig. S3A shows representative pictures after 4 days of myogenic differentiation in the presence (200 μm) or absence of arginine. Both the myogenic index (the fraction of nuclei residing in cells with three or more nuclei and considered an early differentiation parameter; supplemental Fig. S3B) and the cellular concentration of the late differentiation marker creatine kinase-M (supplemental Fig. S3C) increased with increasing arginine concentration to plateau at 25–50 μm arginine. Myogenic differentiation is, therefore, clearly dependent on arginine availability, with a half-maximal effect at 10–20 μm arginine in the medium. Amino acid deficiency can activate the GCN2 stress kinase pathway (50Gebauer F. Hentze M.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). An early step is the phosphorylation of translation factor eIF2α (51Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). As anticipated, arginine deprivation of C2C12 cells at 80% confluence induced phosphorylation of eIF2α on serine 51 within 30 min. The protein remained phosphorylated for at least 2 h (supplemental Fig. S4A). Furthermore, arginine depletion induced the accumulation of the transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, which are well-established downstream mRNA targets of the GCN2 stress-kinase pathway (23Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 52Ameri K. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), in a concentration-dependent way in both C2C12 and GH3 cells (supplemental Fig. S4B). In both cell types, Chop mRNA concentration increased more gradually with declining arginine concentration in the medium than Atf4 mRNA, indicating that Chop mRNA accumulation was more sensitive to arginine removal than that of Atf4 mRNA. The adaptive response of Atf4 and Chop mRNA expression in primary cultures of mouse B-lymphocytes, another hypomorphic tissue in F/A2 mice, to arginine deprivation was similar to that of C2C12 and GH3 cells (not shown). Supplemental Fig. S4C, finally, shows that ATF4 protein accumulates at arginine concentrations below 25 μm (see Ref. 52Am"
