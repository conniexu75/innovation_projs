https://openalex.org/W2082802847,The 5′ flanking DNA of the rat insulin I gene contains sequences controlling cell-specific expression. Analysis of this region by replacement of specific portions with nondiscriminatory control elements from viral systems shows that a transcriptional enhancer is located in the distal portion of the 5′ flanking DNA; its position has been mapped by deletion analysis. Additional experiments suggest that another distinct regulatory element is located more proximal to the transcription start site. The activity of both elements is restricted to pancreatic B cells. The combinatorial effect of multiple control elements could explain the cell-specific expression of insulin genes.

https://openalex.org/W1864683138,"Two phosphoproteins are adsorbed to protein-A-Sepharose when cytosol from 32P-labeled L-cells is incubated with a monoclonal antibody against the glucocorticoid receptor: one is a 98-100-kDa phosphoprotein that contains the steroid-binding site and the other is a 90-kDa nonsteroid-binding phosphoprotein that is associated with the untransformed, molybdate-stabilized receptor (Housley, P. R., Sanchez, E. R., Westphal, H.M., Beato, M., and Pratt, W.B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, in press). In this paper we show that the 90-kDa receptor-associated phosphoprotein is an abundant cytosolic protein that reacts with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the 90-kDa phosphoprotein that binds steroid receptors in the chicken oviduct. The 90-kDa protein immunoadsorbed from L-cell cytosol with this antibody reacts on Western blots with rabbit antiserum prepared against the 89-kDa chicken heat shock protein. Immunoadsorption of molybdate-stabilized cytosol by antibodies against the glucocorticoid receptor results in the presence of a 90-kDa protein that interacts on Western blots with the antiserum against the chicken heat shock protein. The association between the 90-kDa protein and the receptor is only seen by this technique when molybdate is present to stabilize the complex; and when steroid-bound receptors are incubated at 25 degrees C to transform them to the DNA-binding state, the 90-kDa protein dissociates. These observations are consistent with the proposal that the untransformed glucocorticoid receptor in L-cells exists in a complex with the murine 90-kDa heat shock protein."
https://openalex.org/W1997179440,"The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans switches heritably and at high frequency between at least seven general phenotypes identified by colony morphology on agar. Spontaneous conversion from the original smooth to variant phenotypes (star, ring, irregular wrinkle, hat, stipple, and fuzzy) occurs at a combined frequency of 1.4 X 10(-4), but is increased 200 times by a low dose of ultraviolet light that kills less than 10 percent of the cells. After the initial conversion, cells switch spontaneously to other phenotypes at a combined frequency of 2 X 10(-2). Switching is therefore heritable, but also reversible at high frequency. The genetic basis of this newly discovered process and its possible role in Candida pathogenesis are considered."

https://openalex.org/W1993330131,"Antigens that bind to erythrocytes were identified in the supernatant fluids of a cultured human malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum). A 175-kilodalton (175K) antigen bound only to erythrocytes susceptible to invasion. The 175K antigen from the Camp or the FCR-3 strain also bound to merozoites. However, the antigen did not bind to merozoites when merozoites and supernatant antigens were from different strains unless proteinase inhibitors were present. Moreover, erythrocytes coated with supernatant antigens from the Camp or FCR-3 strain were invaded normally by merozoites of the homologous strain but were partially resistant to invasion by merozoites of the heterologous strain. The 175K antigen may be a receptor acting as a ""bridge"" between erythrocytes and merozoites."

https://openalex.org/W1520684992,"The protein product of the CUP1 locus in Cu-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been purified and characterized. The protein was found to lack the first 8 amino acids predicted by the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The residues removed from the amino-terminal region include 5 hydrophobic residues, two of which are aromatic. The unique amino terminus starting at Gln9 of the putative DNA translation product was observed for metallothionein purified in the presence of various protease inhibitors or from a pep4 mutant yeast strain deficient in vacuolar proteases. The remainder of the primary structure of the protein is equivalent to the decoded DNA sequence, so yeast metallothionein is a 53-residue polypeptide of molecular weight 5655. The isolated protein contained 8 copper ions ligated by 12 cysteines/molecule. Reconstitution studies of the apo-molecule revealed that 8 mol eq of Cu(I) conferred maximal stability against proteolysis and depleted the zinc content of zinc-saturated metallothionein. These assays suggested that the protein has 8 binding sites for Cu(I). Ag(I) ions bound to the protein with the same stoichiometry. Yeast metallothionein was also observed to coordinate Cd(II) and Zn(II) ions in vitro. In studies of direct binding, protection against proteolysis, and metal ion exchange, these divalent ions were found to associate with the protein with a maximal stoichiometry of 4 ions/molecule. Yeast metallothionein thus exhibits two distinct binding configurations for Cu(I) and Cd(II) as does the mammalian protein."
https://openalex.org/W1605496649,"The half-life of insulin mRNA at various glucose concentrations was determined by filter hybridization techniques in isolated rat islets incubated with 3H-labeled uridine followed by a chase incubation at 3.3 or 17 mM glucose. High glucose induced a greater stabilization of insulin mRNA than of other poly(A) + RNAs or total cellular RNA. In RIN-5F insulinoma cells, an insulin-producing cell line, cholera toxin, but not glucose, induced a stabilization of insulin mRNA. After 24 h of culture of islets with actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin at several glucose concentrations, insulin mRNA content was decreased in comparison to controls only at higher glucose concentrations. The biosynthesis of islet proteins other than insulin was strongly decreased by actinomycin D at all glucose concentrations. Insulin biosynthesis was inhibited proportionately to the observed decreases in insulin mRNA content. We conclude that inhibition of insulin mRNA degradation is an important component in increasing the insulin mRNA content in response to glucose, thereby augmenting the effects of glucose stimulation on insulin gene transcription (5). This stabilization may be partly mediated by cAMP as evidenced by the similar responses to cholera toxin in the RIN-5F cells. Furthermore, the results of experiments with actinomycin D suggest that the degradation of insulin mRNA may require the continuous production of a factor(s) which could be either RNA or protein in nature."

https://openalex.org/W1542395301,"Utilizing yeast strains containing insertion mutations in each of the three glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structural genes, the level of expression of each gene was determined in logarithmically growing cells. The contribution of the TDH1, TDH2, and TDH3 gene products to the total glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in wild type cells is 10-15, 25-30, and 50-60%, respectively. The relative proportions of expression of each gene is the same in cells grown in the presence of glucose or ethanol as carbon source although the total glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in cells grown in the presence of glucose is 2-fold higher than in cells grown on ethanol. The polypeptides encoded by each of the structural genes were identified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The TDH3 structural gene encodes two resolvable forms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase which differ by their net charge. The apparent specific activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by the TDH3 structural gene is severalfold lower than the enzymes encoded by TDH1 or TDH2. The polypeptides encoded by the TDH2 or TDH3 structural genes form catalytically active homotetramers. The apparent Vmax for the homotetramer encoded by TDH3 is 2-3-fold lower than the homotetramer encoded by TDH2. Evidence is presented that isozymes of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase exist in yeast cells, however, the number of different isozymes formed was not established. These data confirm that the three yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes encode catalytically active enzyme and that the genes are expressed at different levels during logarithmic cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1486029121,"The relationship between cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) activity ratios and lipolysis in the presence of insulin was compared to the standard relationship between these two parameters established with a variety of adenylate cyclase modulators (Honnor, R. C., Dhillon, G., and Londos, C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15130-15138). Three phases of insulin action were observed. First, when tested in control cells exhibiting A-kinase activity ratios up to approximately 0.25, insulin inhibition of lipolysis could be accounted for by the decrease in A-kinase activity. Second, in cells exhibiting A-kinase activity ratios greater than 0.3, the decrease in kinase activity by insulin did not account for the decrease in lipolysis. Finally, as the A-kinase activity ratio approached 0.6 the insulin effect on lipolysis was lost. The data suggest that protein phosphatase activation accounts for the cAMP-independent insulin action. Moreover, the insulin effect not accounted for by a decrease in A-kinase activity appears to be elicited only upon elevation of A-kinase activity. The method by which cells were stimulated determined the IC50 for insulin inhibition of: 1) A-kinase activity ratios, 2) lipolysis explained by the decrease in A-kinase activity ratios, and 3) lipolysis not explained by a decrease in A-kinase activity ratios. For all three parameters, cells stimulated by lipolytic hormones were approximately 5 times more sensitive to insulin than cells stimulated by incubation in a ligand-free environment achieved with adenosine deaminase; insulin IC50 values were approximately 120 and 600 pM, respectively. Such data establish a link between insulin actions in modifying cAMP concentrations and in modifying events apparently independent of changes in cAMP. It is proposed that the receptors and regulatory components associated with adipocyte adenylate cyclase are associated also with components of the insulin response system separate from cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1545540883,"A strain of Escherichia coli has been constructed which greatly overproduces the enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase. This strain has a deletion in the pyrB region of the chromosome and also carries a leaky mutation in pyrF. Although this strain is a pyrimidine auxotroph, it will grow very slowly without pyrimidines if a plasmid containing the pyrB gene is introduced into it. Derepression occurs when this strain exhausts its uracil supply during exponential growth. Under extreme derepression, aspartate transcarbamylase can account for as much as 60% of the total cellular protein. This host strain/plasmid system can be utilized for the rapid purification of wild-type aspartate transcarbamylase or plasmid-born mutant versions of the enzyme. This system is particularly well-suited for analysis of the latter since the control of overproduction resides exclusively on the bacterial chromosome. Therefore, any plasmid bearing the pyrBI operon can be made to overproduce aspartate transcarbamylase in this host strain. Based on this system, a rapid purification procedure has been developed for E. coli aspartate transcarbamylase. The purification scheme involves an ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by a single precipitation of the enzyme at its isoelectric point. In a similar fashion, this strain can also be employed to produce exclusively the catalytic subunit of the enzyme if the plasmid only carries the pyrB gene. This system may be adapted to overproduce other proteins as well by using this host strain and the strong pyrB promoter linked to another gene."

https://openalex.org/W1501701976,"Procoat, the precursor form of the major coat protein of coliphage M13, assembles into the Escherichia coli inner membrane and is cleaved to mature coat protein by leader peptidase. This assembly process has previously been reconstituted using lipids and purified leader peptidase in a cell-free protein synthesis reaction (Watts, C., Silver, P., and Wickner, W. (1981) Cell 25, 347-353; Ohno-Iwashita, Y., and Wickner, W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1895-1900). We now report that procoat can also cross a liposomal membrane composed of only purified phospholipids; leader peptidase is not needed to catalyze insertion. When procoat is synthesized in vitro in the presence of liposomes with encapsulated chymotrypsin, the procoat inserts spontaneously through the membrane and is degraded. The protease was shown by several criteria to be in the lumen of the liposomes. These results demonstrate that the precursor form of an E. coli integral membrane protein can cross a membrane without the aid of leader peptidase or any other membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1558415794,"A method for the synthesis of a photoactivatable, iodinatable, and thiol-cleavable derivative of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is described using sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)-1,3'-dithiopropionate. The method described is applicable to LPS from both smooth and rough bacteria. Evidence is presented that the coupling reaction occurs primarily to phosphoethanolamine residues localized to the inner core region of the LPS. Radioiodination of the derivatized LPS results in a product with a specific activity of 1.8-2.5 microCi/micrograms. Experiments comparing the activity of native and derivatized S-form LPS suggest that the synthesis has not introduced major alterations in the biological properties of the LPS. The feasibility of this derivatized LPS as a molecular probe to investigate LPS binding targets in biological systems is suggested by experiments showing ultraviolet light-dependent cross-linking, thiol-dependent cleavage, and subsequent transfer of radioiodine to both monoclonal anti-LPS antibody and bovine serum albumin. The latter interaction has been demonstrated to be highly selective in protein mixtures containing serum albumin in solution with LPS."
https://openalex.org/W1565278730,"Rabbits exhibit phenotypic differences, 21H and 21L, in the rate of hepatic progesterone 21-hydroxylation that reflect 10-fold higher microsomal concentrations of cytochrome P-450 1 in 21H rabbits. A cDNA library in pBR322 was prepared from liver mRNA isolated from a 21H rabbit. A clone, p1-8, producing a hybrid protein resulting from the insertion of the cDNA into the beta-lactamase gene of the plasmid expressed 5 distinct epitopes that were recognized by a panel of monoclonal antibodies developed toward P-450 1. RNAs selected from total hepatic mRNA by filter hybridization with p1-8 yield at least two electrophoretically distinct proteins when translated in vitro and immunoprecipitated with the 3C3 monoclonal antibody. Only one of the two proteins is recognized by the 1F11 monoclonal antibody, which is highly specific for P-450 1, and the immunoprecipitated protein exhibits the electrophoretic mobility of P-450 1. The other protein remains unidentified. Northern blot analysis indicates that the 3' noncoding portion of p1-8 hybridizes to higher steady state concentrations of polyadenylated RNA in the 21H as compared to 21L rabbits. This correspondence in expression with that of P-450 1 in the 21H and 21L phenotypes further suggests that p1-8 encodes P-450 1 or a closely related protein. The cDNA is 1871 base pairs in length and encodes a protein of 487 amino acids. Southern blot analysis indicates that several independent, gene-like sequences hybridize with the 3' noncoding region of p1-8 under conditions of high stringency. These results indicate that P-450 1 is a member of an extensive multigene family."
https://openalex.org/W2159029339,"Using a whole cell extract from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast) we have been able to detect a selective RNA polymerase activity originally identified in purified yeast mitochondria (Levens, D., Morimoto, R., and Rabinowitz, M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1466-1473). We have shown that in in vitro transcription reactions this activity recognizes a consensus mitochondrial promoter sequence ATA-TAAGTA (Osinga, K. A., DeHaan, M., Christianson, T., and Tabak, H. F. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 7993-8006) in the upstream region of the nuclear GAL10 gene as well as promoters from yeast mitochondrial DNA. Using these promoter-containing templates for in vitro assays, we have chromatographically separated the mitochondrial specific RNA polymerase activity from the three nuclear RNA polymerases (I, II, and III). Further characterization has revealed that this preparation has distinctive properties on two different types of DNA templates, poly[d(AT)] and cloned DNA containing mitochondrial promoters. Salt and divalent cation optima and substrate saturation kinetics are different for the two types of templates. Using promoter-containing DNA as an assay template, we have chromatographically dissociated the RNA polymerase activity into two nonfunctional components. Selective transcription of the GAL10 template is restored when the two components are recombined. It is possible that the RNA polymerase active on poly[d(AT)] is a nonspecific component of the selective transcription apparatus or that two distinct RNA polymerases are present in the preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2120983759,"We have studied the export kinetics of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) of Escherichia coli, the malE gene product, when it is synthesized with either a wildtype signal sequence or with a mutationally altered signal sequence that affects the efficiency of secretion to the periplasm. Our results confirm a very rapid export process for the wild-type protein and, in contrast, reveal a relatively slow post-translational mode of export for the altered precursor species. For each different signal sequence mutant, a fraction of the precursor MBP pool that is proportional to the strength of the export defect appears to never exit the cytoplasm. We have also analyzed MBP export in strains harboring prl mutations that suppress malE signal sequence mutations and are thought to somehow alter the specificity of the cell's protein export machinery. The introduction of different prl alleles has no apparent effect on wild-type MBP export but increases both the amount of mutant MBP that is exported and the rate at which this is accomplished. In fact, the presence of two different prl alleles in the same strain can act synergistically in suppressing MBP export defects. The inhibition of total protein synthesis with chloramphenicol can also increase the proportion of pMBP that is post-translationally exported in these strains. A model that describes the initial steps in MBP export is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1527013029,"The effects of protein synthesis inhibitors and the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine on the metabolism of the insulin receptor were examined. Through the use of the heavy-isotope density shift technique, cycloheximide was found to inhibit both the synthesis of new insulin receptor and the inactivation of old cellular insulin receptor. Upon investigation of the locus of this effect of protein synthesis inhibition, it was found that cycloheximide did not inhibit 1) the translocation of receptor from the cell surface to an intracellular site, 2) the recycling of receptor from the internal site back to the plasma membrane, nor 3) the degradation of insulin. Cycloheximide did, however, rapidly and completely inhibit the inactivation of the insulin receptor. In the presence of extracellular insulin, this effect of cycloheximide resulted in the long-term (6 h) accumulation of receptor in a trypsin-resistant intracellular compartment. Puromycin and pactamycin, protein synthesis inhibitors with mechanisms of action which differ from cycloheximide, produced the same effects on insulin receptor metabolism as cycloheximide, indicating that this effect on receptor metabolism is due to the inhibition of protein synthesis and not a secondary effect of cycloheximide. Actinomycin D also inhibited the inactivation of receptor. Chloroquine inhibited the receptor-mediated degradation of insulin, but had no effect on either the internalization or inactivation of the insulin receptor. The insulin-induced recycling of the internalized receptor was inhibited by chloroquine, possibly through the inhibition of the discharge of insulin from the insulin-receptor complex. From these observations, we suggest that 1) a protein factor is required to inactivate the insulin receptor, 2) this protein and the messenger RNA coding for the protein have short cellular half-lives, and 3) insulin degradation and insulin receptor inactivation are distinct, separable processes which not only occur at different rates, but possibly occur in distinct subcellular locations."
https://openalex.org/W1565642676,"The interaction between rat serosal mast cells and low density lipoproteins (LDL) was studied in vitro. When rat 125I-LDL was incubated with mast cells, it was bound to a binding site on the mast cell surface but was not internalized by the cells. Even though 125I-LDL was not internalized, its protein component, apolipoprotein B, was rapidly degraded. The proteolytic activity responsible for the degradation of apolipoprotein B was present in the extracellular fluid of mast cells. It could be shown that the degradation was caused entirely by specific cell organelles of mast cells, the granules, which were spontaneously released into the extracellular fluid during preparation and incubation of the cells. In contrast to uncontrolled spontaneous degranulation, a controlled specific degranulation of mast cells can be induced by treating the cells with the compound 48/80. When increasing amounts of 48/80 were added to mast cell suspensions, a dose-dependent release of granules was observed and an increase in the rate of 125I-LDL degradation resulted. The increase in 125I-LDL degradation closely followed the increase in granule release. Thus, a quantitative relationship between the amount of granules present in the extracellular fluid and the amount of degradation of 125I-LDL could be established. The apolipoprotein part of LDL was extensively degraded by isolated mast cell granules. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that upon incubation of LDL with isolated granules, the apolipoprotein B band rapidly disappeared with simultaneous appearance of several low molecular weight bands. The degradation of 125I-LDL by mast cell granules proceeded optimally at neutral pH and at physiological ionic strength. The results show that mast cell granules are able to efficiently degrade LDL in vitro, once released from mast cells into the extracellular fluid."
https://openalex.org/W1585699199,"We have investigated the self-association properties of human apolipoprotein A-IV using several complementary physical techniques. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis demonstrated that human apolipoprotein A-IV formed oligomeric species in aqueous solution at physiologic pH. Computer analysis established that the best model of self-association is a monomer-dimer-tetramer scheme, with an unusually large monomer-dimer association constant of 2.9 X 10(5) liters/mol. Fluorescence spectroscopy and electrophoretic analysis demonstrated that the rate of monomer-oligomer interconversion is sufficiently slow that a stable population of dimeric protein exists in solution, even at low total protein concentrations, and that the extent of dimerization is minimally influenced by pH. Moreover, these techniques established that the dissociation of oligomeric forms and the unfolding of the monomeric form are discrete and sequential events. In experiments where apolipoprotein A-IV was incubated with human high density lipoproteins, fractionated by gradient gel electrophoresis, and localized by immunoblotting, dimer formation occurred, but very little binding to lipoproteins was observed. Immunoblots of human serum fractionated on acrylamide gradient gels and isopycnic density gradients demonstrated an apolipoprotein A-IV band of size and density consistent with a circulating dimeric form, unassociated with lipid. We conclude that human apolipoprotein A-IV undergoes high affinity self-association in aqueous solutions, and that such self-association likely occurs in vivo. Self-association may thus be important in determining the biologic behavior of human apolipoprotein A-IV by influencing both the kinetics and distribution of its association with plasma lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1616064606,"Anthranilate synthase is a glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the first reaction in tryptophan biosynthesis. Conserved amino acid residues likely to be essential for glutamine-dependent activity were identified by alignment of the glutamine amide transfer domains in four different enzymes: anthranilate synthase component II (AS II), p-aminobenzoate synthase component II, GMP synthetase, and carbamoyl-P synthetase. Conserved amino acids were mainly localized in three clusters. A single conserved histidine, AS II His-170, was replaced by tyrosine using site-directed mutagenesis. Glutamine-dependent enzyme activity was undetectable in the Tyr-170 mutant, whereas the NH3-dependent activity was unchanged. Affinity labeling of AS II active site Cys-84 by 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine was used to distinguish whether His-170 has a role in formation or in breakdown of the covalent glutaminyl-Cys-84 intermediate. The data favor the interpretation that His-170 functions as a general base to promote glutaminylation of Cys-84. Reversion analysis was consistent with a proposed role of His-170 in catalysis as opposed to a structural function. These experiments demonstrate the application of combining sequence analyses to identify conserved, possibly functional amino acids, site-directed mutagenesis to replace candidate amino acids, and protein chemistry for analysis of mutationally altered proteins, a regimen that can provide new insights into enzyme function."
https://openalex.org/W1550371002,"Based on the distribution of 125I-insulin between the cell surface and the cell interior, it was found that insulin rapidly binds (t 1/2 = 0.4 min) to surface receptors at 37 degrees C, and after an initial lag period of about 1 min, accumulates intracellularly until steady state is reached (t 1/2 = 3.5 min). At this time about 40% of the total cell-associated 125I-insulin resides in the cell interior reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between the rate of insulin endocytosis and the rate at which internalized insulin is processed and extruded from cells. Since this percentage decreased to 15% at 16 degrees C, it appears that internalization is more temperative-sensitive than the intracellular processing of insulin. When 125I-insulin was preloaded into the cell interior, it was found that internalized insulin was rapidly released to the medium at 37 degrees C (t 1/2 = 6.5 min) and consisted of both degraded products and intact insulin (as assessed by trichloroacetic acid precipitability and column chromatography). Since 75% of internalized insulin was ultimately degraded, and 25% was released intact, this indicates that degradation is the predominant pathway. To determine when incoming insulin enters a degradative compartment, cells were continually exposed to 125I-insulin and the composition of insulin in the cell interior over time was assessed. After 2 min all endocytosed insulin was intact, between 2-3 min degradation products began accumulating intracellularly, and by 15 min equilibrium was reached with 20% of internalized insulin consisting of degraded products. Degraded insulin was then released from the cell interior within 4-5 min after endocytotic uptake, since this was the earliest time chloroquine was found to inhibit the release of degradation products. Moreover, the final release of degraded insulin was not inhibitable by the energy depleter dinitrophenol. Thus, within the degradative pathway, insulin enters lysosomes by 2.5-3 min and is released to the medium by simple diffusion after an additional 1.5-2 min."

https://openalex.org/W1984168381,"Substantial evidence suggests that calcium has a pivotal role in regulating the initial events through which insulin alters plasma membrane metabolism. Because binding of insulin to its receptor represents the initial site of insulin action in the plasma membrane, studies were undertaken to determine whether the insulin receptor is a calmodulin-binding protein. Preparations enriched in the insulin receptor and calmodulin-binding proteins were isolated from detergent-solubilized rat adipocyte membranes by chromatography with wheat germ agglutinin agarose and calmodulin-conjugated Sepharose, respectively. Substantial purification of a manganese-dependent, insulin-sensitive phosphoprotein of 95K identified as the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was accomplished. Binding and photocovalent cross-linking of iodine-125-labeled calmodulin to these affinity-purified preparations and to isolated plasma membranes, followed by immunoadsorption with insulin receptor antibodies bound to protein A Sepharose, resulted in significant purification of a binding complex of 110K to 140K. These results indicate that the adipocyte insulin receptor or a polypeptide closely associated with the receptor is a calmodulin-binding protein."

After 90-120 days, one group of chronic diabetic animals was treated with insulin for chronic diabetic animals was treated with insulin for 10 days. The lipid fluidity and composition of microvillus membranes prepared from ileal enterocytes of control, diabetic, and insulin-treated diabetic animals were determined. Lipid fluidity, as assessed by steady-state fluorescence polarization techniques using the probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, DL-2-(9-anthroyl)stearic acid and DL-12-(9-anthroyl)stearic acid, was decreased in membranes of diabetic animals compared to membranes of control and insulin-treated diabetic membranes. The differences in fluidity resulted from an increased cholesterol content and cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio in membranes of diabetic animals. The activities of sucrase and alkaline phosphatase were also found to be higher in membranes of diabetic animals. Insulin treatment, however, failed to significantly influence the enzymatic activities of these membranes. These studies, therefore, demonstrate that alterations in the lipid fluidity, lipid composition, and certain enzymatic activities exist in microvillus membranes of enterocytes prepared from chronic streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Administration of insulin for 10 days to these animals restored membrane fluidity and lipid composition but not enzymatic activities to control membrane levels."
https://openalex.org/W1583030932,"Chicken gizzard extract contains a macromolecular glycoprotein that promotes neurite outgrowth of dissociated neurons from the ciliary ganglia of chick embryos. Using conventional purification procedures, the factor responsible for the neurite outgrowth (neurite outgrowth factor (NOF)) was purified about 2000-fold to an apparent single protein band (as judged by agarose-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Twenty fmol/cm2 of the purified NOF bound to the culture well was sufficient to exert maximal neuritic response of cultured ciliary ganglia neurons from 8-day-old chick embryos. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that NOF migrated as a single polypeptide of 700 and 210 kDa under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively. NOF stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and had a sedimentation coefficient of 12 s, a Stokes radius of 114 A, and an isoelectric point of about 5.1. Gizzard NOF was trypsin-sensitive, but resistant to treatment with heparinase, beta-galactosidase, and neuraminidase. Antibody prepared against the purified NOF blocked NOF activity in a dose-dependent manner. The antibody did not inhibit the biological activity of mouse laminin, although it cross-reacted weakly with laminin. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the antibody against NOF strongly stained the extracellular matrix of cells in thin sections of gizzard, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and ciliary ganglion, and also the membrane and the cytoplasm of cultured gizzard muscle cells. The present data suggest that gizzard NOF is a novel extracellular matrix glycoprotein which has a role in neurite outgrowth promotion from peripheral neurons in vivo. Although unlikely, the possibility that the NOF is a chick laminin could not be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1532493403,"Abstract Myosin homodimers, molecules containing either the A1 or the A2 light chain, do not exchange their light chains under conditions approximating physiological temperature and ionic strength. Myosin heterodimers, molecules containing both A1 and A2 light chains, are therefore formed at the time of synthesis rather than by a labile subunit exchange. Antibodies specific for the amino-terminal region of the alkali light chains were used to localize these subunits in myosin by immunoelectron microscopy. The close proximity of the alkali light chain to the 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) light chain in the neck region of the myosin head is consistent with the finding that the 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) light chain influences subunit interactions between the alkali light chain and heavy chain in vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1526908367,"We have purified an ATP-dependent protease with protein-dependent ATPase activity from bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria to near homogeneity. The subunit molecular weight is 108,000 and the enzyme appears to be a hexamer with approximately identical subunits. Based on the experiments using various nucleoside triphosphates and their related compounds, it is concluded that hydrolysis of the high-energy bond in nucleoside triphosphates is not an absolute requirement for proteolysis. Nucleotide specificity of this enzyme varies, depending on the protein or peptide substrates used. When casein was the substrate, ATP and dATP were quite effective, but other nucleotides were not. When insulin and angiotensinogen were used as substrate, ATP, other nucleoside triphosphates, ADP, inorganic triphosphate, pyrophosphate, and phosphate were effective. One of the cleaving linkages hydrolyzed by this enzyme was revealed to be the Leu-Leu bond of angiotensinogen. However, the specificity appears to be broad in view of the hydrolysis pattern of glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1485815016,"An electrochemical method of hydrogenase activity measurement is developed. It permits a new approach to the activation/inactivation process of the Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase. A monolayer of hydrogenase is grafted onto a glassy carbon electrode which is both the support of the enzyme and the detector of the activity. The physicochemical composition of the enzyme microenvironment is thus well defined and easily controlled by the electrode potential. Successive periods of inactivation and activation are applied to the same hydrogenase molecules, thus the activity can be correlated to the chronology of the experiments. We distinguish two kinds of activation/inactivation processes. The first one, already described for the enzyme stored for some months in aerobic conditions, is a slow activation by molecular hydrogen or a reducing medium (half-reaction time = 2 h). The second one is an anaerobic inactivation by an oxidizing potential. This first order inactivation (half-reaction time = 10 min) is fully reversible. This modulation of the activity level is controlled by an Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox couple (Eh = -455 mV/calomel-saturated KCl electrode at pH 8.3) involving one electron and one proton. This work proposes an explanation for the activation of the hydrogenase taking into account the participation of an [Fe-S] cluster and of the nickel atom."
https://openalex.org/W1490621345,"Mammalian adenosine deaminase has been shown by genetic and biochemical evidence to be essential for the development of the immune system. For the purpose of studying the function and structure of this enzyme, we have isolated by genetic selection a mouse cell line, B-1/50, in which adenosine deaminase levels were increased 4,300-fold over the parent cell line. The enzyme was purified from these cells in large quantity and high yield by a simple two-step purification scheme. The enzyme derived from the B-1/50 cells was indistinguishable from that of the parental cells as judged by several biochemical criteria. The Km (30 microM) and Ki (4 nM) values using adenosine as substrate and 2'-deoxycoformycin as inhibitor, respectively, were identical for the enzyme derived from the parental cells as well as the adenosine deaminase gene amplification mutants. The enzyme from both cell types exhibited multiple isoelectric focusing forms which co-purified using our purification protocol. Electrophoretic analysis using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels showed that adenosine deaminase migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 41,000 or 36,000 depending on whether the enzyme was reduced or oxidized, respectively. This shift was reversible, indicating that proteolysis was not responsible for the faster migrating form. Monospecific antibodies raised against purified adenosine deaminase cross-reacted with the enzyme derived from the parental cells and precipitated 37% of the total soluble protein in the B-1/50 cells. Continued genetic selection resulted in the isolation of cells in which adenosine deaminase was overproduced by 11,400-fold and accounted for over 75% of the soluble protein."
https://openalex.org/W1611746722,"A collection of monoclonal antibodies against Dictyostelium myosin was screened to identify an antibody that could distinguish monomeric from polymeric myosin. An antibody was found that reacted only with monomeric myosin, provided that the antigen-antibody reaction was carried out in solution. This antibody was used in competition radioimmunoassays to probe the supramolecular structure of myosin in Triton-extracted cell models, or cytoskeletons, of Dictyostelium amoebae. The competition assay showed that, as isolated, cytoskeletal myosin was entirely filamentous, but could be converted to monomeric form by increasing the ionic strength of the surrounding buffer. As monomer, it remained associated with the cytoskeleton and could be cycled back to filament form by a second change of buffer. The ability of cytoskeletons to carry out ATP-dependent contraction was examined as a function of the assembly state of myosin. The results suggested that filamentous myosin is responsible for contraction of the cortical filament matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1561181330,"Abstract The accumulation and localization of four developmentally regulated membrane glycoproteins were examined in a glycosylation mutant of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. As judged by immunoblot procedures using antipeptide antibodies, the levels of three of the glycoproteins, WGA80B, SP29A, and SP29B, were unaffected, but their apparent molecular masses were reduced by 14,000, 3,500 and 3,500 daltons, respectively. The level of the fourth glycoprotein, gp80, was reduced to below detectable limits. The reduced molecular sizes were apparently due to the absence of certain carbohydrate structures as judged by labeling Western blots with anti-carbohydrate antibodies and a lectin. Using immunofluorescence labeling of permeabilized and intact cells, the localization of WGA80B, SP29A, and SP29B, in intracellular vesicles and on the cell surface of prespore cells, was observed to be unaffected in the mutant cells. The developmentally regulated oligosaccharide structure(s) affected by the modB locus does not influence the subcellular localization and accumulation of these three glycoproteins in the prespore cells of this phylogenetically primitive organism."
https://openalex.org/W1482733083,"Whole tendons of chick embryos synthesize procollagens V which consist of three pro-alpha chains: pro-alpha 1'(V), pro-alpha 1(V) and pro-alpha 2(V). This report shows that while the pro-alpha 1'(V) chain is similar to the pro-alpha 1(V) chain in many respects, such as similar but not identical peptide maps, it also distinctly differs from it in size and in other ways. The new chain is denoted as pro-alpha 1' to indicate the relationship. We have failed to see conversion of one chain into the other and they are regarded as variants, although we do not know whether they are different transcripts of one gene or products of two closely related genes. The pro-alpha(V) chains are assembled into the disulfide-linked homotrimer (pro-alpha 1'(V))3 and the heterotrimer [(pro-alpha 1'(V)S-S-pro-alpha 2(V))pro-alpha 1(V)] and a smaller amount of [(pro-alpha 1(V)2pro-alpha 2(V)]. The pro-alpha 1'(V) chains are processed similarly to the pro-alpha 1(V) by the initial removal of the presumed carboxyl propeptide yielding p-alpha 1'(V) and then by reduction in the size of the noncollagenous, presumed amino propeptide to yield alpha 1'(V). A size difference between the alpha 1'(V) and alpha 1(V) series of molecules is demonstrated by velocity sedimentation and by electrophoretic mobility of the reduced molecules. This difference is ascribed to a difference in the size of the propeptides because after pepsin digestion the products of both series of molecules are the same size and electrophorese like alpha 1(V)(pepsin). The carboxyl propeptides of pro-alpha 1(V) and pro-alpha 1'(V) are the same size, but the amino propeptide of pro-alpha 1'(V) is smaller than that of pro-alpha 1(V). The amino propeptide of pro-alpha 1'(V) and p-alpha 1'(V) also lacks asparagine-linked complex carbohydrate, which is linked to propeptides of the p-alpha 1(V) and p-alpha 2(V) chains. Differences between the alpha 1(V) and alpha 1'(V) series of molecules remain in material synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin. Primary cultures of tendon cells synthesize procollagen V consisting of the above three chains, but the procollagen V made by cultured tendon sheath synovial cells predominantly contains [(pro-alpha 1(V))2pro-alpha 2(V)]."
https://openalex.org/W1511310541,"The pyruvate oxidase of Escherichia coli is a homo-tetrameric enzyme which can be activated greater than 500-fold (kcat/Km) by limited proteolytic digestion with alpha-chymotrypsin in the presence of pyruvate and thiamine pyrophosphate. The cleavage produces an Mr 2000 peptide (the alpha-peptide) from each subunit and mimics the physiologically important activation of the enzyme by phospholipids. Moreover, the proteolytic cleavage results in the loss of the high affinity lipid-binding site of the enzyme. We now report the isolation and characterization of the alpha-peptide fragment which is cleaved from the carboxyl terminus of each subunit by protease activation. Both the site of cleavage and the sequence of the alpha-peptide have been determined by a combination of Edman degradation of the purified peptide and DNA sequence analysis of the gene encoding the oxidase. The cleavage site lies within a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids predicted to form a beta-sheet. Another segment of the alpha-peptide is predicted to form an amphipathic alpha-helix. Quantitative assessment of the amphipathic nature of this alpha-helix (Eisenberg, D. (1984) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53, 595-623) gives a value very similar to the values for several helical peptides which spontaneously bind to the surface of phospholipid vesicles. From these analyses, we propose that the alpha-peptide may play a role in binding pyruvate oxidase to cell membrane phospholipids in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1535195354,"Sulfonylurea compounds are hypoglycemic agents which by unknown mechanisms alter the amount of insulin receptor and the rate of glucose utilization in tissues exposed to the drugs. In this study the effects on insulin binding and uptake of 2-deoxyglucose by 3T3-L1 adipocytes were assessed after maintaining cell monolayers for 1-3 days in medium containing different concentrations of the sulfonylurea, tolbutamide. The amount of 125I-insulin bound by treated monolayers gradually increased to values 150-250% of those of control monolayers after 2-3 days of exposure to 1.5 mM tolbutamide. Such increases in insulin binding capacity arose primarily from an increase in receptor number and not from an alteration in the affinity of the receptor for insulin. Concomitant with the changes observed for the insulin receptor, tolbutamide-treated monolayers expressed 1.5-2-fold higher rates of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose relative to control monolayers at concentrations of insulin between 0 and 10(-10) M. This study thus demonstrates the responsiveness of adipocytes to tolbutamide and also establishes the usefulness of 3T3-L1 cells as a model system in which to study the mechanism of tolbutamide action, both as it relates to the use of sulfonylurea compounds in clinical applications and as possible probes for perturbing and studying relatively uncharacterized regulatory pathways controlling receptor level and biological responses to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1559677723,"When the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli is reduced by NADH and alkylated by N-[14C]ethylmaleimide, 19-20 nmol of N-[14C]ethylmaleimide are bound per mg of complex. This is in accord with the presence of 10 nmol of functional lipoyl moieties per mg of complex as previously reported. Thus the lipoyl groups are all coupled via dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) to reduction by NADH. As previously reported, the complex reductively acetylated by pyruvate and containing 10 nmol of acetyldihydrolipoyl groups per mg of complex produces about 5 nmol of NADH/mg of complex when challenged with CoA and NAD+ in a fast burst. Under anaerobic conditions a slow secondary process extending over 1 h produces another 5 nmol of NADH/mg of complex. The relationship between the two classes of acetyldihydrolipoyl groups is unknown but could reflect either intrinsic structural inequivalence of lipoyl groups (2/subunit of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, E2). Alternatively, the acetyldihydrolipoyl groups may undergo reversible isomerization to structurally distinct forms. The purified complex catalyzes the cleavage of acetyl-CoA by two processes. The trace contaminant phosphotransacetylase catalyzes cleavage by phosphate to acetyl-P. The complex itself catalyzes hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA in a reaction that requires all three enzymes, NADH, thiamin pyrophosphate, and the lipoyl groups of E2. The hydrolytic pathway evidently involves overall reversal of the reaction, leading ultimately to the formation of acetyl-thiamin pyrophosphate, which undergoes hydrolysis to acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2131782623,"The production of 3H2O from alpha- and beta-D-[5-3H]glucose and that of 14CO2 from either alpha- and beta-D-[1-14C] or alpha- and beta-D-[6-14C]glucose were measured in rat pancreatic islets and tumoral insulin-producing cells incubated at 7 degrees C. The ratio in 14CO2 output from D-[1-14C]glucose/D-[6-14C]glucose, the fraction of glucose metabolism occurring through the pentose cycle, and the flow rate through such a cycle were always higher in the presence of beta- than alpha-D-glucose. This indicates that the anomeric specificity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is operative in intact islet cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554960841,"The complex between ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase and its proposed membrane-binding protein (Vallejos, R. H., Ceccarelli, E., and Chan, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8048-8051) was isolated from spinach thylakoids and compared with isolated cytochrome b/f complex containing associated ferredoxin NADP+ oxidoreductase (Clark, R. D., and Hind, G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10348-10354). There was no immunological cross-reactivity between the 17.5-kDa binding protein and an antiserum raised against the 17-kDa polypeptide of the cytochrome complex. Association of ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase with the binding protein or with the thylakoid membrane gave an allotopic shift in the pH profile of diaphorase activity, as compared to the free enzyme. This effect was not seen in enzyme associated with the cytochrome b/f complex. Identification of the 17.5-kDa binding protein as the 17-kDa component of the cytochrome b/f complex is ruled out by these results."
https://openalex.org/W1606380230,"Energy inhibitors block translocation of pulse-labeled core lipopolysaccharide to outer membrane under conditions which allow maintenance of constant specific radioactivity of intracellular precursor pools throughout the chase period. Under the conditions used, approximately 75% of the total cellular label was membrane-bound at initiation of chase. Translocation of core lipopolysaccharide from inner to outer membrane showed apparent first order kinetics (t1/2 = 1.2 min, 32 degrees C). Translocation was blocked by arsenate (5-10 mM) under conditions where proton motive force was unchanged, while the uncouplers 2,4-dinitrophenol (0.1 mM to 0.8 mM) and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (12-30 microM) inhibited translocation with no apparent effect on the ATP pool. Therefore, core lipopolysaccharide translocation appears to require maintenance of both proton motive force and high energy phosphate pools. Electron microscopic experiments show no gross disruption of zones of adhesion, the putative sites of lipopolysaccharide translocation, in the presence of arsenate or 2,4-dinitrophenol suggesting that energy is not required simply for maintenance of these structures."
https://openalex.org/W1595911657,"The alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli utilizes pyruvate as a poor substrate, with an activity of 0.082 units/mg of protein compared with 22 units/mg of protein for alpha-ketoglutarate. Pyruvate fully reduces the FAD in the complex and both alpha-keto[5-14C]glutarate and [2-14C]pyruvate fully [14C] acylate the lipoyl groups with approximately 10 nmol of 14C/mg of protein, corresponding to 24 lipoyl groups. NADH-dependent succinylation by [4-14C]succinyl-CoA also labels the enzyme with approximately 10 nmol of 14C/mg of protein. Therefore, pyruvate is a true substrate. However, the pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate activities exhibit different thiamin pyrophosphate dependencies. Moreover, 3-fluoropyruvate inhibits the pyruvate activity of the complex without affecting the alpha-ketoglutarate activity, and 2-oxo-3-fluoroglutarate inhibits the alpha-ketoglutarate activity without affecting the pyruvate activity. 3-Fluoro[1,2-14C]pyruvate labels about 10% of the E1 components (alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenases). The dihydrolipoyl transsuccinylase-dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase subcomplex (E2E3) is activated as a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by addition of E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase, the E1 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. All evidence indicates that the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex purified from E. coli is a hybrid complex containing pyruvate dehydrogenase (approximately 10%) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (approximately 90%) as its E1 components."
https://openalex.org/W1936142772,"Heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) was obtained in large quantities (several-gram amounts) and great purity from Escherichia coli C600 carrying the LT-coding multicopy plasmid EWD299. By growing this strain on a medium that allows high cell densities in the early stationary phase, we increased the net LT production per milliliter by a factor of 200, compared to natural porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli. Adsorption and redesorption on Controlled-Pore Glass usually resulted in a 50-100-fold purification of LT in one simple step, which was followed by established purification procedures. LT shows a natural tendency to form large crystals, which, however, are disordered. After numerous trials, conditions were found which virtually eliminated the disorder. Much better crystals were obtained by employing CdCl2 and KF as coprecipitating agents. CdCl2 yielded crystals which did not contain A subunits as judged by electrophoresis of dissolved crystals. Adding KF results in beautifully shaped crystals which diffracted beyond 2 A and are suitable for a high resolution structure determination."
https://openalex.org/W2126584472,"Abstract The structural and enzymatic aspects of renin are of great interest in hypertension research. In this paper, we examine the solution accessibility of the three tryptophan (Trp) residues of mouse submaxillary gland renin by solute collisional fluorescence quenching. Our studies indicate that there are two classes of Trp residues in renin: class I, a class of Trp residues which are at or near the surface of renin and fully accessible to the fluorescence quencher iodide; and class II, a class of Trp residues which are, for practical experimental conditions, totally inaccessible to the aqueous solution. The former class contains 2 Trp residues, while only a single Trp is identified in the latter class. The presence of a tetradecapeptide substrate or a nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue (peptide H-77) lowers the accessibility of iodide to the class I Trp residues. These data indicate that the class I Trp residues are at or near the peptide-binding site of renin. In addition, the finding that the class I Trp residues are quantitatively quenched more efficiently than the Trp model compound indole suggests that the environment of the class I tryptophans may be positively charged, and thus have a higher local concentration of iodide. These data, taken together with the available sequence and computer-generated three-dimensional structure of renin, permit us to speculate that the class I Trp residues are Trp-39 and Trp-300. This solution study of renin structure is discussed in light of the known information about renin catalysis and physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1519795526,"The 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonic acid (KDO) region of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the heptoseless mutant Salmonella minnesota R595 and inner core and heptoseless mutants derived from Escherichia coli K12 was studied by 13C NMR spectroscopy. A spin-echo spectral editing technique was employed for the selective detection of the quaternary anomeric carbon of ketosidically linked KDO. Only two quaternary carbon resonances attributable to KDO were detected in the anomeric carbon spectral region of each LPS from heptoseless mutants E. coli D31m4 (99.7 and 100.8 ppm) and S. minnesota R595 (100.0 and 100.9 ppm). Integrated signal intensities from fully relaxed normal 13C spectra showed that equivalent molar quantities of KDO and glucosamine (i.e. 2 mol of each) were present in each of these samples. Similarly, only two KDO anomeric carbon resonances were detected in the LPS from the inner core mutants E. coli D21f1 (100.8 and 101.2 ppm) and E. coli D21e7 (100.8 and 101.2 ppm). These data confirm the presence of a KDO disaccharide structure rather than a trisaccharide as determined by others using thiobarbituric acid-based assays. The LPS of E. coli D21 (complete inner core oligosaccharide) exhibited four quaternary anomeric carbon resonances (99.4, 100.7, 101.8, and 102.7 ppm). The unequal intensities of these resonances, however, demonstrated that significant heterogeneity exists with respect to KDO substitution in this LPS. A third KDO moiety present in substoichiometric amounts could be consistent with this observation. However, this possibility could not be distinguished from other modes of substitutional heterogeneity involving only 2 KDO residues."
