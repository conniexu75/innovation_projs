https://openalex.org/W2028772401,"Self-organization of liquid crystalline and crystalline-conjugated materials has been used to create, directly from solution, thin films with structures optimized for use in photodiodes. The discotic liquid crystal hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene was used in combination with a perylene dye to produce thin films with vertically segregated perylene and hexabenzocoronene, with large interfacial surface area. When incorporated into diode structures, these films show photovoltaic response with external quantum efficiencies of more than 34 percent near 490 nanometers. These efficiencies result from efficient photoinduced charge transfer between the hexabenzocoronene and perylene, as well as from effective transport of charges through vertically segregated perylene and hexabenzocoronene π systems. This development demonstrates that complex structures can be engineered from novel materials by means of simple solution-processing steps and may enable inexpensive, high-performance, thin-film photovoltaic technology."
https://openalex.org/W2078028724,"Genes constitute only a small proportion of the total mammalian genome, and the precise control of their expression in the presence of an overwhelming background of noncoding DNA presents a substantial problem for their regulation. Noncoding DNA, containing introns, repetitive elements, and potentially active transposable elements, requires effective mechanisms for its long-term silencing. Mammals appear to have taken advantage of the possibilities afforded by cytosine methylation to provide a heritable mechanism for altering DNA-protein interactions to assist in such silencing. Genes can be transcribed from methylation-free promoters even though adjacent transcribed and nontranscribed regions are extensively methylated. Gene promoters can be used and regulated while keeping noncoding DNA, including transposable elements, suppressed. Methylation is also used for long-term epigenetic silencing of X-linked and imprinted genes and can either increase or decrease the level of transcription, depending on whether the methylation inactivates a positive or negative regulatory element."
https://openalex.org/W2111833940,"Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations that may play an important role in numerous cellular processes including transport, signaling, and tumor suppression. By targeted disruption of caveolin-1, the main protein component of caveolae, we generated mice that lacked caveolae. The absence of this organelle impaired nitric oxide and calcium signaling in the cardiovascular system, causing aberrations in endothelium-dependent relaxation, contractility, and maintenance of myogenic tone. In addition, the lungs of knockout animals displayed thickening of alveolar septa caused by uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation and fibrosis, resulting in severe physical limitations in caveolin-1-disrupted mice. Thus, caveolin-1 and caveolae play a fundamental role in organizing multiple signaling pathways in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2142766228,"Hypertension is a major public health problem of largely unknown cause. Here, we identify two genes causing pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, a Mendelian trait featuring hypertension, increased renal salt reabsorption, and impaired K + and H + excretion. Both genes encode members of the WNK family of serine-threonine kinases. Disease-causing mutations in WNK1 are large intronic deletions that increase WNK1 expression. The mutations in WNK4 are missense, which cluster in a short, highly conserved segment of the encoded protein. Both proteins localize to the distal nephron, a kidney segment involved in salt, K + , and pH homeostasis. WNK1 is cytoplasmic, whereas WNK4 localizes to tight junctions. The WNK kinases and their associated signaling pathway(s) may offer new targets for the development of antihypertensive drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2047509178,"In the ventral premotor cortex of the macaque monkey, there are neurons that discharge both during the execution of hand actions and during the observation of the same actions made by others (mirror neurons). In the present study, we show that a subset of mirror neurons becomes active during action presentation and also when the final part of the action, crucial in triggering the response in full vision, is hidden and can therefore only be inferred. This implies that the motor representation of an action performed by others can be internally generated in the observer's premotor cortex, even when a visual description of the action is lacking. The present findings support the hypothesis that mirror neuron activation could be at the basis of action recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2168096237,"The Shank family of proteins interacts with NMDA receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor complexes in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Targeted to the PSD by a PDZ-dependent mechanism, Shank promotes the maturation of dendritic spines and the enlargement of spine heads via its ability to recruit Homer to postsynaptic sites. Shank and Homer cooperate to induce accumulation of IP3 receptors in dendritic spines and formation of putative multisynapse spines. In addition, postsynaptic expression of Shank enhances presynaptic function, as measured by increased minifrequency and FM4-64 uptake. These data suggest a central role for the Shank scaffold in the structural and functional organization of the dendritic spine and synaptic junction."
https://openalex.org/W2126972955,"Fractalkine (CX3CL1) is an unusual member of the chemokine family that is synthesized with its chemokine domain at the end of a mucin-rich, transmembrane stalk. This membrane-bound localization allows fractalkine to function as an adhesion molecule for cells bearing its receptor, CX3CR1. In addition, fractalkine can be proteolytically released from the cell surface, generating a soluble molecule that functions as a chemoattractant similar to the other members of the chemokine family. In this study, we have examined the mechanisms that regulate the conversion between these two functionally distinct forms of fractalkine. We demonstrate that under normal conditions fractalkine is synthesized as an intracellular precursor that is rapidly transported to the cell surface where it becomes a target for metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage that causes the release of a fragment containing the majority of the fractalkine extracellular domain. We show that the cleavage of fractalkine can be markedly enhanced by stimulating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and we identify tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17) as the protease responsible for this PMA-induced fractalkine release. In addition, we provide data showing that TACE-mediated fractalkine cleavage occurs at a site distinct from the dibasic juxtamembrane motif that had been suggested previously based on protein sequence homologies. The identification of TACE as a major protease responsible for the conversion of fractalkine from a membrane-bound adhesion molecule to a soluble chemoattractant will provide new information for understanding the physiological function of this chemokine."
https://openalex.org/W1974193054,"Methylation of histones at specific residues plays an important role in transcriptional regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of dimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 across 53 kilobases of the chicken beta-globin locus during erythropoiesis shows an almost complete anticorrelation between regions of elevated lysine 9 methylation and acetylation. Lysine 9 is methylated most over constitutive condensed chromatin and developmentally inactive globin genes. In contrast, lysine 4 methylation of histone H3 correlates with H3 acetylation. These results lead us to propose a mechanism by which the insulator in the beta-globin locus can protect the globin genes from being silenced by adjacent condensed chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2107835025,"We demonstrate polarization mode selection in a two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal laser by controlling the geometry of the unit cell structure. As the band diagram of the square-lattice photonic crystal is influenced by the unit cell structure, calculations reveal that changing the structure from a circular to an elliptical geometry should result in a strong modification of the electromagnetic field distributions at the band edges. Such a structural modification is expected to provide a mechanism for controlling the polarization modes of the emitted light. A square-lattice photonic crystal with the elliptical unit cell structure has been fabricated and integrated with a gain media. The observed coherent 2D lasing action with a single wavelength and controlled polarization is in good agreement with the predicted behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2124517960,"GABA(B) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type B) receptors are important for keeping neuronal excitability under control. Cloned GABA(B) receptors do not show the expected pharmacological diversity of native receptors and it is unknown whether they contribute to pre- as well as postsynaptic functions. Here, we demonstrate that Balb/c mice lacking the GABA(B(1)) subunit are viable, exhibit spontaneous seizures, hyperalgesia, hyperlocomotor activity, and memory impairment. Upon GABA(B) agonist application, null mutant mice show neither the typical muscle relaxation, hypothermia, or delta EEG waves. These behavioral findings are paralleled by a loss of all biochemical and electrophysiological GABA(B) responses in null mutant mice. This demonstrates that GABA(B(1)) is an essential component of pre- and postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors and casts doubt on the existence of proposed receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2042036678,"T-type Ca(2+) currents have been proposed to be involved in the genesis of spike-and-wave discharges, a sign of absence seizures, but direct evidence in vivo to support this hypothesis has been lacking. To address this question, we generated a null mutation of the alpha(1G) subunit of T-type Ca(2+) channels. The thalamocortical relay neurons of the alpha(1G)-deficient mice lacked the burst mode firing of action potentials, whereas they showed the normal pattern of tonic mode firing. The alpha(1G)-deficient thalamus was specifically resistant to the generation of spike-and-wave discharges in response to GABA(B) receptor activation. Thus, the modulation of the intrinsic firing pattern mediated by alpha(1G) T-type Ca(2+) channels plays a critical role in the genesis of absence seizures in the thalamocortical pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1518126931,"Amino acids have emerged as potent modulators of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway. The involvement of this pathway in the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport was investigated in the present study. Acute exposure (1 h) to a balanced mixture of amino acids reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport by as much as 55% in L6 muscle cells. The effect of amino acids was fully prevented by the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Time course analysis of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity revealed that incubation with amino acids speeds up its time-dependent deactivation, leading to a dramatic suppression (−70%) of its activity after 30 min of insulin stimulation as compared with its maximal activation (5 min of stimulation). This accelerated deactivation of PI 3-kinase activity in amino acid-treated cells was associated with a concomitant and sustained increase in the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. In marked contrast, inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin maintained PI 3-kinase maximally activated for up to 30 min. The marked inhibition of insulin-mediated PI 3-kinase activity by amino acids was linked to a rapamycin-sensitive increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and a decreased binding of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to IRS-1. Furthermore, amino acids were required for the degradation of IRS-1 during long term insulin treatment. These results identify the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase signaling pathway as a novel modulator of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells.

First discovered as a target of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, mTOR (also known as FRAP (FK506-binding protein-rapamycin-associated protein) or RAFT1 (rapamycin and FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12) targets)) is thought to act as a sensor of ambient amino acid concentrations (3Xu G.

Indeed, cells deprived of amino acids show a rapid decline in the phosphorylation of p70S6k and 4E-BP1, which is rapidly reversed after amino acid re-addition in a rapamycin-sensitive manner (4Iiboshi Y.

Furthermore, amino acid starvation did not affect the activity of a mutant form of p70S6k that is resistant to the action of rapamycin (5Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C.

Reciprocally, amino acid supplementation was still able to promote p70S6k phosphorylation in the presence of rapamycin in cells expressing a rapamycin-resistant mutant form of mTOR (4Iiboshi Y.

Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that amino acids signal to p70S6k via mTOR or an mTOR-controlled element. The mTOR nutrient pathway also integrates signal arising from phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase triggered by insulin or mitogenic signaling (9Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

This is achieved through the phosphorylation of mTOR by the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also termed protein kinase B), which requires the lipid products of PI 3-kinase, PI 3,4-bisphosphate, and/or PI 3,4,5-triphosphate for its activation (13Vanhaesebroeck B.

Recent advances in our understanding of mTOR regulation have shown that both hormonal and nutrient signals are prerequisite inputs necessary to fully activate this pathway (5Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 7Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing insulin receptors, insulin-induced phosphorylation of p70S6k and 4E-BP1 is greatly increased in the presence of amino acids (5Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this occurred without any amino acid-dependent modulation of IR/IRS tyrosine phosphorylation or PI 3-kinase and Akt activation by insulin (5Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), suggesting that both stimuli signal to mTOR via different pathways. In marked contrast, it was found that amino acids impair the ability of insulin to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins and PI 3-kinase activity in hepatoma and muscle cells (7Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was observed in the face of normal insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6k, and 4E-BP1 (7Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether such discrepant findings are solely a matter of cellular context remains to be established. The regulatory role of amino acids on cellular processes is not without precedent. For instance, amino acids have been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis (18Anthony J.C. Yoshizawa F.

In addition, amino acids were shown to blunt insulin effect on whole-body and skeletal muscle glucose disposal in humans (23Tessari P. Inchiostro S. Biolo G. Duner E. Nosadini R. Tiengo A.

Although there is accumulating evidence that the positive effect of amino acids on translational events occurred via an mTOR-dependent pathway, the mechanism whereby amino acids negatively modulate glucose transport is still obscure. Insulin stimulates glucose transport in muscle and fat cells by activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and phosphorylation of intracellular substrates of the IRS family (mainly IRS-1) (27Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins propagate the signal to Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins such as the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, which in turn activates its p110 catalytic subunit (27Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It is believed that PI 3-kinase activation is essential for the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin (17Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase includes Akt, which is thought to participate in the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin in muscle cells (28Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J.

The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that amino acids impair insulin action on glucose transport by specifically activating the mTOR/p70S6k-signaling pathway in L6 muscle cells. Furthermore, we examined whether amino acids modulate glucose transport by altering component(s) of the insulin signal transduction pathway in an mTOR/p70S6k-dependent fashion.

A line of L6 skeletal muscle cells (kind gift of Dr. Amira Klip, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada) clonally selected for high fusion potential was used in the present study. The L6 cell line was derived from neonatal rat thigh skeletal muscle cells and retains many morphological, biochemical, and metabolic characteristics of skeletal muscle. Cells were grown and maintained in monolayer culture in α-MEM containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotic/antimycotic solution (10000 units/ml penicillin, 10000 μg/ml streptomycin and 25 μg/ml amphotericin B) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Fully differentiated L6 myotubes were deprived of serum 4 h before experimental treatments. Then cells were incubated either in amino acid-free medium (Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS)) or in EBSS containing 1× or 2× amino acids either individually or as a mixture, as found in MEM for 1 h. The concentrations (in μm) of amino acids (1×) in MEM were as follows: Arg, 126; Cys, 100; Gln, 2000; His, 200; Ile, 400; Leu, 400; Lys, 400; Met, 100; Phe, 200; Thr, 400; Trp, 50; Tyr, 200 and Val, 400.

Briefly, after experimental treatments, cells were rinsed once with HEPES-buffered solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mmCaCl2) and were subsequently incubated for 8 min in HEPES-buffered solution containing 10 μm 2-deoxyglucose and 0.3 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose. After the incubation in transport medium, cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution and then disrupted by adding 50 mm NaOH. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method, and the results were expressed in pmol/min/mg. Glucose uptake values were corrected for non-carrier-mediated transport by measuring hexose uptake in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B (5–10% of total uptake). After experimental treatment, medium was removed, and cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmNaF. 500 μg of lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-IRS-1 coupled to protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with wash buffer I (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm Na3VO4), twice with wash buffer II (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, and 2 mmNa3VO4), and twice with wash buffer III (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Beads were resuspended in 70 μl of kinase buffer (8 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm EDTA, 15 mmMgCl2, 180 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 10 μl of sonicated PI mixture (20 μg of l-α-PI, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EGTA) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 m HCl mixed with 160 μl of CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1) and centrifuged. The lower organic phase was spotted on an oxalate-treated silica gel TLC plate and developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.6:2). The plate was dried and visualized by autoradiography with intensifying screen at −80 °C. After experimental treatment, the medium was removed, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mmNaF. 200–300 μg of lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-Akt1 coupled to protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed 3 times in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm Na3VO4 and 2 times in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was started by adding 30 μl of kinase buffer (containing 8 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm Crosstide) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction product was resolved on 40% acrylamide-urea gel and visualized by autoradiography with intensifying screen at −80 °C. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated as described for PI 3-kinase assay. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) coupled to protein A-Sepharose from 500 μg of cell lysate. Immune complexes were washed 3 times in PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mmNa3VO4, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then washed for 30 min followed by a 1-h incubation with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBS containing 2% nonfat milk. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were washed for 30 min in TBS, and the immunoreactive bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The effects of amino acids, insulin, and rapamycin were compared by analysis of variance tests followed by least mean square determination. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. The inhibitory action of amino acids on glucose transport in skeletal muscle has been observedin vivo (23Tessari P.

Res. 1982; 32: 453-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test whether such effect can be reproduced in vitro, L6 myocytes were either incubated in an amino acid-free medium or in a 1× or 2× amino acids mixture for 1 h (a 1× amino acid mixture was defined as the concentration of amino acids found in MEM (See “Experimental Procedures”)). After experimental treatments, glucose transport was measured in cells that were stimulated or not with insulin (100 nm). Increasing the concentrations of amino acids had no significant effect on basal glucose transport (Fig. 1A). However, the effect of a submaximal concentration of insulin (100 nm) on glucose transport was inhibited by as much as 30 and 55% in myocytes treated with 1× or 2× amino acid mixtures as compared with cells deprived of amino acids, respectively (Fig.1A). We next determined if the effect of amino acids could be observed over a wide range of insulin concentrations. Amino acid-treated cells were exposed to increasing doses of insulin, and glucose transport was determined. As depicted in Fig. 1B, the suppressive effect of amino acids was noticeable at 5 nm insulin and could still be observed at maximal doses of the hormone (0.5–1 μm). These results clearly indicate that acute exposure (1 h) to amino acids impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport in muscle cells. To identify which amino acids were responsible for insulin resistance, we measured glucose transport in cells treated with individual amino acids at the concentration found in 2× amino acid mixtures. It was found that Cys, His, Leu, Met, Thr, and Tyr were inhibitory, whereas the remaining (Arg, Glu, Ile, Lys, Phe, Trp, and Val) amino acids failed to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig. 1C). It is noteworthy that the inhibitory influence of amino acids were neither limited to a particular chemical group (e.g. branched-chain, cationic, neutral, or polar) nor to a particular amino acid transport system (e.g. A, ASC, or L). Interestingly, glutamine, an amino acid known to activate the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and to cause insulin resistance in rat adipocytes (31Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Traxinger R.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20910-20916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was without effect in L6 muscle cells. This indicates that build-up of hexosamines is unlikely to be involved in the acute inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by amino acids in muscle cells. Amino Acids Impair Insulin-stimulated Glucose Transport via themTOR Pathway—We next tested the hypothesis that amino acids impair insulin-stimulated glucose transport via the activation of mTOR. The involvement of the mTOR pathway in amino acid-induced insulin resistance was evaluated by using rapamycin, a highly specific inhibitor (33Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3937) Google Scholar) that forms a complex with FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12), which binds and inactivates mTOR (34Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In cells deprived of amino acids for 1 h, neither basal nor insulin-stimulated glucose transport was affected by the addition of rapamycin to the medium (Fig.2, lane 1 versus 2and lane 3 versus 4). Strikingly, the inhibitory effects of amino acids on insulin-stimulated glucose transport (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 versus 7) were completely prevented by treatment with rapamycin (Fig. 2, lanes 7 versus 8). These results indicate that the inhibitory amino acids (Fig.1C) contained in the 2× amino acids mixture decrease insulin-stimulated glucose transport by activating the mTOR pathway. Furthermore, the observation that rapamycin regulates glucose transport only in medium enriched in amino acids strengthened the hypothesis that rapamycin specifically acts on mTOR to antagonize amino acid-dependent signaling. In an attempt to understand how amino acids induced insulin resistance, we next examined the activation of key signaling proteins involved in insulin action. Among them, IRS-1 and its associated PI 3-kinase activity play a prominent role in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle (35Higaki Y. Wojtaszewski J.F. Hirshman M.F. Withers D.J. Towery H. White M.F. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20791-20795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). L6 cells were incubated in media containing either no amino acids or a 2× amino acid mixture with or without rapamycin for 1 h and stimulated with insulin during the last 5 min. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.3A, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was not affected by amino acids or rapamycin treatments. Similarly, the amount of p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase recovered in IRS-1 immune complexes was strongly increased by insulin and was not affected by amino acids and/or rapamycin (Fig.3B). Consistent with the lack of effect of amino acids on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and p85 recruitment, we observed no effects of amino acids or rapamycin on basal or insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 precipitates (Fig. 3C). It has been recently reported that dephosphorylation and/or relocalization of PI 3,4,5-triphosphate reduced Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin despite the fact that PI 3-kinase activity was intact (37Yang C. Watson R.T. Elmendorf J.S. Sacks D.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 38Nakashima N. Sharma P.M. Imamura T. Bookstein R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12889-12895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, although incubation with amino acids failed to affect PI 3-kinase activity, it was of interest to evaluate the modulation of Akt phosphorylation and activity by amino acids and/or rapamycin. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we found that insulin robustly enhanced the phosphorylation state of Akt in cells incubated with or without amino acids and/or rapamycin (Fig. 4A). In accordance with Akt phosphorylation data, insulin-stimulated Akt kinase activity was unaffected by either amino acids or rapamycin (Fig.4B). Since the acute burst (5 min) of PI 3-kinase activity in response to insulin was not impaired by amino acids (Fig. 3), we sought to determine whether there was any relationship between insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and mTOR/p70S6k activation over time. L6 cells were placed in 2× amino acid medium for 1 h and treated with insulin for the last 5, 15, or 30 min of incubation. It was found that IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase is maximally activated after 5 min of insulin stimulation and progressively decrease, reaching ∼30% of maximal activity after 30 min (Fig. 5A). In contrast to PI 3-kinase, th"

Induction of synaptic plasticity, arising via generally accepted mechanisms, is modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Properly timed nicotinic activity at pyramidal neurons boosted the induction of long-term potentiation via presynaptic and postsynaptic pathways. On the other hand, nicotinic activity on interneurons inhibited nearby pyramidal neurons and thereby prevented or diminished the induction of synaptic potentiation. The synaptic modulation was dependent on the location and timing of the nicotinic activity. Loss of these synaptic mechanisms may contribute to the cognitive deficits experienced during Alzheimer's diseases, which is associated with a loss of cholinergic projections and with a decrease in the number of nicotinic receptors."

Some of these modifications are initiated in the germ line. Comparative genomic analysis at imprinted domains is emerging as a powerful tool for the identification of conserved elements amenable to more detailed functional analysis, and for providing insight into the emergence of imprinting during the evolution of mammalian species.

Hosp. Pract. (Off. Ed.). 1998; 33: 131-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Attacks typically last 1–3 days and are accompanied by a massive influx of neutrophils into specific anatomical sites, most commonly in the abdomen (peritoneal membranes), chest (pleural membranes), and joints (synovial membranes). The gene responsible for FMF is calledMEFV, and its protein product has been named pyrin (2The International FMF Consortium Cell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar) or marenostrin (3The French FMF Consortium Nat.

Pyrin is a 781-amino acid protein that is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner in neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils and in fibroblasts of skin, synovium, and peritoneum (2The International FMF Consortium Cell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 3The French FMF Consortium Nat.

Urieli-Shoval S. Blood. 2000; 96: 727-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the nature of FMF attacks, it has been speculated that wild type pyrin acts as a negative regulator of the inflammatory response (1Kastner D.L. Hosp. Pract. (Off. Ed.). 1998; 33: 131-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Pyrin mutations, it is proposed, could compromise this function, resulting in inappropriate inflammatory responses to otherwise innocuous triggers. However, the nature of this regulatory pathway and the identity of the trigger(s) that incite attacks remain to be identified. The C-terminal half of the pyrin molecule (amino acids 300–781) harbors several motifs found in other proteins including a B-box zinc finger (thought to be a protein-protein interaction domain), an α helical region, which may adopt a coiled coil configuration, and a C-terminal rfp or B30.2 domain speculated to function in ligand binding (6Henry J. Mather I.H. McDermott M.F. Pontarotti P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or signal transduction (7Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). This tripartite structure is found in a variety of genes, including transcription factors (STAF50 and estrogen-responsive finger protein), Mid1 (a cytosolic protein important in development of midline structures), and Ro52 (an autoantigen) (6Henry J. Mather I.H. McDermott M.F. Pontarotti P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). What common molecular functions or pathways (if any) might be attributed to these shared domains in these apparently diverse proteins is still unclear. However, a recent report suggests that some of these elements define a family (TRIM) and are important in subcellular localization (8Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L.

In the case of pyrin, of the 21 mutations now identified, 66% fall in the C-terminal rfp domain, a fact that attests to the functional importance of this domain. At the time that the MEFV gene was cloned, the N-terminal portion of pyrin (amino acids 1–300) appeared to be unique; there were no characterized proteins with homology to this region. Recently, however, several proteins have been found to contain a sequence domain with similarity to the N terminus of pyrin; this domain has been called a pyrin domain (PyD) (9Bertin J.

Interestingly most of these proteins contain additional domains that are commonly found in proteins of the apoptosis pathway (CARDs, caspase domains, and nucleotide binding domains). Thus, pyrin is a member of a family of PyD-containing proteins, and it has been speculated that these function in apoptosis, inflammation, and innate immunity (9Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Martinon F. Hofmann K. Tschopp J. Curr.

To begin to explore the molecular function of pyrin, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using the entire wild type pyrin molecule as a bait. Screening of a cDNA library generated from human neutrophils identified ASC (also known as TMS1) as one of several pyrin-interacting proteins. ASC was first identified as a protein that aggregates into a cytosolic “speck” during apoptosis of HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line (13Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). ASC is a 195-amino acid protein that contains two domains, a C-terminal CARD and an N-terminal PyD. In 293 cells, speck formation occurs upstream of caspase 9 activation and eventual apoptosis, suggesting that ASC is a proapoptotic protein (19McConnell B.B. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6243-6247PubMed Google Scholar). In HL-60 cells, antisense ASC oligonucleotides block etoposide-induced apoptosis, confirming that endogenous ASC is proapoptotic (13Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The interaction between pyrin and ASC was confirmed using immunoprecipitation and cellular co-localization studies. By transient transfection, we show that speck-positive HeLa cells transfected with ASC are destined for apoptosis. When cells are co-transfected with both pyrin and ASC, speck formation is accelerated but fewer speck-positive cells succumb to apoptotic death. Thus, pyrin alters the ASC death machinery. Pyrin co-localizes with ASC in specks, and exon 1 of pyrin is necessary and sufficient for this targeting phenomenon. However, exon 1 of pyrin is not sufficient to modulate ASC-induced death; this requires additional regions of the pyrin molecule. Apoptotic proteins often share structural domains that provide interaction interfaces (e.g. the death domain, the death effector domain, and the CARD, Ref. 20Hofmann K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here we present structural modeling data to show that the homologous first exons of both pyrin and ASC encode a six-helix structure closely related to a death domain. When the exon 1 sequences for pyrin and ASC are threaded onto the FADD death domain structure, analysis of the resulting electrostatic charge distribution reveals probable interaction surfaces. These findings in combination suggest that pyrin functions in an apoptotic pathway. All myc-tagged pyrin constructs were cloned into pCMVTag3a (Stratagene). β-Galactosidase-myc (lacZ-myc) and heat shock protein 27-myc (hsp27-myc) were gifts from Yi-feng Jia and Dr. Michael Welsh (University of Michigan).

Mouse anti-Myc, rabbit anti-Myc, rabbit anti-HA, and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-mouse AF568, goat anti-rabbit AF68, phalloidin AF488, and mouse anti-tubulin were purchased from Molecular Probes. Goat anti-mouse-FITC was purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals. A yeast two-hybrid library was constructed using poly(dT)-primed Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from cells recovered from the knee of a patient with gout. Microscopic examination of the aspirate confirmed that the majority of cells were neutrophils. The library was cloned into the pAD-GAL4–2.1 vector (Stratagene), which enables the expression of cDNA clones as a fusion product with the GAL4 activation domain (the “prey” library). The unamplified library consisted of 2 × 106 clones. Full-length wild type pyrin was cloned into the “bait” vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH), which directs expression of pyrin as a fusion product with the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and transformed into Y187 cells. The prey library was then transformed into pyrin-expressing Y187 cells; putative interactants were selected as colonies that grew in triple dropout selection, His(−)Leu(−)Trp(−), and were blue upon testing with Xgal. Individual prey plasmids were isolated from His(+)LacZ(+) clones and retransformed into yeast in the absence of the pyrin bait to determine that they did not directly activate the Hisand lacZgenes. Candidates were also retested in the presence of pyrin to confirm their interaction with pyrin. Individual prey plasmids were also cotransformed with heterologous baits (p53 and lamin) to rule out nonspecific interactions. Clones passing these tests were sequenced. A total of 132 clones were further examined. 1 × 106 293T cells were plated on 10-cm plates and transfected via the CaPO4method. A total of 6 µg of DNA was used for transfections. Cells were harvested at 48 h and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v), and 2 mm EDTA to which 0.5% (v/v) of various detergents were added (detailed in Fig. 1). Lysate and pellet fractions were saved. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates as follows. 2–10 µg of antibody were added to each lysate and incubated for 1 h on ice. Lysates were then incubated with Protein A/G Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight. Western blots were probed with the antibodies indicated in the text. 293T or HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated onto microscope coverslips placed in six-well culture plates. Cells were either transfected (with 6 µg of DNA) via the CaPO4 method or (with 5 µg of DNA) via the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce the macrophage phenotype. Under these conditions, cells adhere to glass coverslips placed in six-well plates. After 24 h, most cells were attached and the culture medium was replaced. Cells were transfected with the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a total of 4 µg of plasmid DNA and 20 µl of transfection reagent. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium, fresh culture medium was added with or without 10 µg/ml etoposide or 1 µg/ml camptothecin (Sigma), and cells were incubated for an additional 8–12 h. For co-localization studies, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline; permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline; and blocked in 5% goat serum, 0.1% Tween20, phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were done with antibodies as described in the text, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot 2 microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. HL-60 cells were processed for the TUNEL assay (21Gorczyca W. Gong J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1945-1951PubMed Google Scholar) using the ApoTag Kit (Intergen Co.) following the manufacturer's protocol. For immunodetection of transfected proteins, cells were incubated simultaneously with the primary antibody and the anti-digoxigenin conjugate, washed, then incubated with the secondary antibody, and counterstained with DAPI. The rate of speck formation was examined in HeLa and 293T cells transfected with CMV-GFP and either (a) myc-pyrin, (b) ASC-FLAG, or (c) ASC-FLAG plus myc-pyrin. Several subfragments of the myc-tagged pyrin cDNA were also tested, including exon 1 alone. At several time points after transfection (24, 48, and 72 h) immunofluorescence (to detect the FLAG epitope) and DAPI staining (to stain nuclei) were carried out. Low power microscopy was used to randomly select multiple fields on the DAPI channel (where specks are not detectable), and a picture of the field was recorded. The GFP channel was then selected, and another picture was taken to visualize transfected cells. Finally the rhodamine channel was used to visualize specks (via staining of FLAG-ASC), and a third picture was taken. Each channel was then superimposed, and total cells (DAPI), transfected cells (GFP), and speck-positive cells (rhodamine) were counted. At least 500 cells/well were scored in this way for each condition tested. The percentage of speck-positive cells was calculated as the number of specks divided by the total number of transfected cells. At least three independently transfected wells were analyzed per experiment. The statistical significance of differences between means was determined using the Student's t test. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of PyD-containing proteins (including pyrin, ASC, CARD7, NBS1, and zebrafish caspase) were submitted to the protein fold recognition server (22Fischer D. (2000) Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 119–130.Google Scholar) at Ben Gurion University (www.cs.bgu.ac.il/∼bioinbgu/) as well as the 3D-PSSM fold server (23Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Scores >5 were considered significant for the Ben Gurion server; lower scores were considered more accurate than higher scores for the 3D-PSSM server. Since the death domain of FADD (PDB code 1fad) was the top scoring solution from both servers, the structure of the PyD of pyrin was modeled onto the coordinates of the solution structure of the FADD death domain. Due to the high sequence similarity between the PyDs of pyrin and ASC (42%), the structure of ASC was derived from the modeled pyrin structure. The sequence alignment of FADD, pyrin, and ASC reveals a 5-residue insert in a loop region of the pyrin and ASC structures. This insert could not accurately be modeled; its position is shown as a // on the resulting ribbon diagram. Modeling was completed using the graphics program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and molecular dynamics program XPLOR (25Brunger A.T. XPLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1987Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid screen resulted in the identification of several putative pyrin-interacting proteins. One of these, ASC, is described here. ASC clones represented 6 of the 132 final isolates. To confirm an interaction between ASC and pyrin, immunoprecipitation assays were carried out. C-terminal HA-tagged pyrin was co-transfected into 293T cells in the presence or absence of N-terminal FLAG-tagged ASC. Cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was accomplished with anti-FLAG. Immunoprecipitates were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotted. Blots were probed with anti-HA to recognize immunoprecipitated pyrin. Fig.1 shows that pyrin is co-precipitated by antibodies to epitope-tagged ASC. A variety of different detergents were used in the immunoprecipitation assays. Co-precipitation of pyrin was detectable with 0.5 and 0.1% Triton X-100,N-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, CHAPS, and Zwittergent 3-14 (Fig. 1) as well asN-acetyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside (not shown). However, in the presence of deoxycholic acid, no immunoprecipitation was detectable (not shown). The fact that the immunoprecipitation is less pronounced or not seen under more stringent conditions (deoxycholic acid and 0.5% Triton X-100) suggests that the interaction may be relatively weak. We note, however, that a significant amount of immunoprecipitated pyrin remains in the pellet (not shown). Since the relative insolubility of both pyrin and ASC makes it difficult to accurately assess the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation, we turned to cellular co-localization assays. Transfection of HeLa cells with full-length pyrin tagged with several different epitope tags (myc-pyrin, YFP-pyrin, and pyrin-HA) revealed a cytosolic distribution of the transfected pyrin protein (Fig.2, A and B). No staining was visible in the nucleus by confocal microscopy (data not shown). No speck-like structures were ever observed after transfection of cells by epitope-tagged pyrin alone. Cytosolic distribution of full-length pyrin has been observed previously (26Chen X. Bykhovskaya Y. Tidow N. Hamon M. Bercovitz Z. Spirina O. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 224: 32-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Papin S. Duquesnoy P. Cazeneuve C. Pantel J. Coppey-Moisan M. Dargemont C. Amselem S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that when HL-60 cells are induced by a variety of different agents to undergo apoptosis, the native ASC protein in these cells aggregates into large hollow-centered structures called specks (13Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The number of specks is directly correlated with the number of apoptotic cells, indicating that the formation of specks is associated with the apoptotic process. We transfected HeLa cells with FLAG-ASC alone and observed two distinct types of staining (Fig. 2, C and D). In some cells, ASC exhibited a nuclear staining pattern. In other cells, FLAG-ASC was found in cytosolic specks similar to those reported earlier (13Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 19McConnell B.B. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6243-6247PubMed Google Scholar). In every cell in which specks were seen, the nuclear staining of ASC was no longer visible as if all of the protein had collected into the speck structure. Spontaneous speck formation after transfection of ASC in the absence of chemical induction of apoptosis has also been observed after transfection of COS cells (28Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Nakayama K. Ayukawa K. Sagara J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 293T cells (see below). When cells were co-transfected with myc-pyrin and FLAG-ASC, both proteins were co-localized in specks 24 h after transfection (Fig. 2, E–G). While ASC appeared to be localized exclusively in specks (Fig. 2E), pyrin staining was observed to be concentrated in specks, but additional diffuse staining was observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2F). A similar pattern of co-localization was observed with eYFP-pyrin and eCFP-ASC, although eCFP-ASC specks seem to lose the hollow quality of the speck by confocal microscopy (data not shown). This finding may indicate that the relatively large CFP moiety disrupts the ability of the ASC to form normal speck architecture. Consequently we used small epitope-tagged constructs for further experiments. A set of deletion constructs was used to determine the region of pyrin that is necessary for interaction with specks. Constructs were designed using intron/exon borders since such borders often mark functional domains. As shown in Fig.3, A and B, exon 10 of pyrin fails to localize to specks. This is the region of the pyrin protein that harbors most of the known mutations. However, exon 1 of pyrin (the region that contains the PyD) is clearly targeted to specks (Fig. 3, C–E). In contrast, a pyrin molecule lacking exon 1 (exons 2–10) was not targeted to specks (Fig. 3, F andG). A nonspecific control protein (LacZ-Myc) also failed to localize to specks (data not shown). Constructs encoding exons 1 and 2, 1–4, and 1–9 were also tested, and in each case the epitope-tagged encoded protein was localized to specks (data not shown). These studies confirm that exon 1 is necessary and sufficient for localization of pyrin to specks. We tested whether exon 1 of ASC (which also encodes a PyD) is sufficient to form specks and whether this domain is sufficient for recruitment of pyrin. However, transfection of exon 1 of ASC does not result in the formation of specks. Rather, long filamentous structures are observed (Fig. 3, H and I). Co-transfection of exon 1 of pyrin and exon 1 of ASC does not result in the recruitment of pyrin to these filaments (Fig. 3, K andL). Thus, it is possible that although exon 1 of pyrin is sufficient for interaction with ASC, the corresponding PyD of ASC (contained within its exon 1) is not sufficient to mediate this interaction. Alternatively, oligomerization of exon 1 of ASC may sterically prohibit its interaction with pyrin. We also observed that the CARD of ASC forms similar oligomerized filamentous structures (data not shown). The formation of filaments by both halves of the ASC protein has been recently demonstrated (29Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Sagara J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the filaments seen in our studies were much more extended than those observed by Masumoto et al. (29Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Sagara J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), who observed more aggregated filamentous structures similar to expanded-appearing specks. This may be a consequence of the different cell types that were used in the two studies, HeLa (this work) and COS7 (29Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Sagara J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Additional cell-specific proteins may interact with the aggregates to determine their final morphology. Specks generated by co-transfection of full-length myc-pyrin and full-length FLAG-ASC were examined at higher magnification at several time points after transfection. Condensations are first visible 6 h after transfection (Fig. 4, A andB); early condensations consist of fibrillar structures at the cell periphery. More mature specks are rounded with a hollow-appearing center. Filamentous structures are seen to flay out from the periphery of the specks (Fig. 4, C andD). A view of the top of the speck reveals interwoven filaments resembling a bird's nest (Fig. 4E). To determine whether specks consist of aggregates of cytoskeletal material, ASC-transfected cells were stained with anti-tubulin (Fig. 4,F and G) or with AF488 phalloidin (Fig. 4,H and I). Neither of these cytoskeletal markers were associated with specks. Specks appeared to displace microtubules; a hollow region of the anti-tubulin staining pattern was seen at the location of the speck. In contrast, actin distribution was not disrupted by the speck, but neither was actin recruited to the speck. Thus, specks likely result from protein oligomerization. The number of cells with specks was examined in HeLa cells co-transfected with CMV-GFP plus either myc-pyrin, FLAG-ASC, or both constructs. At 24 h after transfection, immunofluorescence studies were carried out to assess (a) total number of cells, (b) number of transfected cells, and (c) number of cells with specks as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specks are never seen after transfection of pyrin alone. After transfection of ASC alone, 2.6% of cells exhibit specks (Fig.5A). Co-transfection"
https://openalex.org/W1963733435,"Functional heterogeneity of ionotropic glutamate receptors arises not only from the existence of many subunits and isoforms, but also from combinatorial assembly creating channels with distinct properties. This heteromerization is subtype restricted and thought to be determined exclusively by the proximal extracellular N-terminal domain of the subunits. However, using functional assays for heteromer formation, we show that, besides the N-terminal domain, the membrane sector and the C-terminal part of S2 are critical determinants for the formation of functional channels. Our results are compatible with a model where the N-terminal domain only mediates the initial subunit associations into dimers, whereas for the assembly of the full functional tetramer, compatibility of the other regions is required."
https://openalex.org/W2015840690,"<h2>Abstract</h2> Although T-type calcium channels were first described in sensory neurons, their function in sensory processing remains unclear. In isolated rat sensory neurons, we show that redox agents modulate T currents but not other voltage- and ligand-gated channels thought to mediate pain sensitivity. Similarly, redox agents modulate currents through Ca<sub>v</sub>3.2 recombinant channels. When injected into peripheral receptive fields, reducing agents, including the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine, induce thermal hyperalgesia. This hyperalgesia is blocked by the oxidizing agent 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and the T channel antagonist mibefradil. DTNB alone and in combination with mibefradil induces thermal analgesia. Likewise, L-cysteine induces mechanical DTNB-sensitive hyperalgesia in peripheral receptive fields. These data strongly suggest a role for T channels in peripheral nociception. Redox sites on T channels in peripheral nociceptors could be important targets for agents that modify pain perception."
https://openalex.org/W1591129275,"Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) is activated by stimuli that increase its tyrosine phosphorylation, including neurotransmitters that initiate fluid secretion in salivary gland (parotid) epithelial cells. Rottlerin, a compound reported to be a PKCδ-selective inhibitor, rapidly increased the rate of oxygen consumption (QO2) of parotid acinar cells and PC12 cells. In parotid cells, this was distinct from the effects of the muscarinic receptor ligand carbachol, which promoted a sodium pump-dependent increase in respiration. Rottlerin increased the QO2 of isolated rat liver mitochondria to a level similar to that produced when oxidative phosphorylation was initiated by ADP or when mitochondria were uncoupled by carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). The effects of rottlerin on mitochondrial QO2 were neither mimicked nor blocked by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Rottlerin was not effective in blocking PKCδ activity in vitro. Exposure of freshly isolated parotid acinar cells to rottlerin and FCCP reduced cellular ATP levels and reduced stimuli-dependent increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Neither rottlerin nor FCCP reduced stimuli-dependent PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in RPG1 cells (a salivary ductal line) or PC12 cells, consistent with their dependence on glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy-dependent processes.

Although peptide-specific substrate motifs for different PKCs have been determined (4Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), a number of factors probably determine the biological substrates of these kinases, including the stimulus, enzyme location, and other conditions related to the cellular context. PKC family members are composed of three groups: the classical (cPKC) subtype (α, βI, βII, and γ), the novel (nPKCs) subtype (δ, ε, η, and θ), and the atypical (aPKCs) subtype (ζ and λ/ι ). The cPKCs and nPKCs are activated by the production of diacylglycerol or by phorbol esters. These agents bind to the two C2 domains found in the structure of these PKCs. The diversity of PKC family members and the expression of multiple PKC family members in most cells suggest that each PKC isoform may play a particular biological role in a cell type. Recent data utilizing a variety of techniques indicate that PKCs may play distinct and sometimes antagonist roles within a particular cell (1Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P.

Some of the inhibitors have various degrees of specificity for different PKC family members. Rottlerin, one of these inhibitors, has been reported to exhibit a specificity for PKCδ such that concentrations of rottlerin which are effective for PKCδ might not be expected to block a significant fraction of other PKC family members (6Gschwendt M.

We examined the effects of rottlerin on a variety of cells including freshly isolated rat parotid acinar cells, which initiate fluid and electrolyte secretion in the parotid salivary gland. Fluid secretion is mediated by the activation of muscarinic, substance P, and α-adrenergic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that are linked to phospholipase C. The phospholipase C-mediated production of diacylglycerol (DAG) results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ, and this increases the enzymatic activity of this PKC family member in parotid acinar cells and PC12 cells (14Benes C.

Initially we were interested in examining whether rottlerin affected various biological events that were downstream of receptor activation, and we were surprised to find that rottlerin itself produced an increase in the rate of O2consumption (QO2) in multiple cells. Further studies were initiated to understand its mechanism of action on respiration. These studies indicated that rottlerin acts directly to uncouple mitochondria in a PKC-independent manner and facilitates a reduction in the levels of intracellular ATP. In some cells this may indirectly block PKCδ at rottlerin concentrations that are ineffective in blocking PKCδ activity in vitro.

Igepal was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Bio Whittaker. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. Parotid acinar cells were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Kingston, NY, or Taconic, Germantown, NY; 175–225 g) using previously established techniques (22Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat parotid glands were removed and treated with trypsin and collagenase to yield a suspension of single cells and small groups of cells. Cells were suspended at 1–2 mg of protein/ml in solution A, composed of the following: 116.4 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mmNaHEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm sodium butyrate, 5.6 mmglucose, pH 7.4. Cells were maintained on ice prior to use. PC12 cells were cultured on 100-mm cell culture dishes and grown in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin. PC12 cells used for Western blotting were serum starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% serum. When used for QO2measurements, PC12 cells growing in cell culture dishes were washed in solution A, triturated off their dishes, and suspended in fresh solution A. Rat parotid gland 1 cells (RPG1), which are an immortalized rat parotid ductal cell line (24Soltoff S.P. Grubman S.A. Jefferson D.M. Saliv. Gland Biogen. Funct. 1998; 842: 100-107Google Scholar), were cultured on 100-mm cell culture dishes and grown in a DMEM:Ham's F-12 medium (3:1, v/v) mixture supplemented with 1.8 × 10−4m adenine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2 × 10−9mtriiodothyronine, 1.1 × 10−6mhydrocortisone, 1.64 × 10−6m epidermal growth factor, 5.5 × 10−6m epinephrine, and 10% fetal calf serum. RPG1 cells used for Western blotting were serum starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% serum. Rat livers from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in isolation medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% essentially fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.4. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation for 3 min at 1,075 × g. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 11,750 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in isolation medium and sedimented again at 11,750 × gfor 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in fresh isolation medium and maintained on ice prior to measuring the QO2 (see below). Conditions were similar to those reported previously (22Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, parotid acinar cells and PC12 cells suspended in solution A were prewarmed for 15 min at 37 °C prior to placing them in a stirred chamber maintained at 37 °C. A Clark-type O2 electrode (model 125/05, Instech Laboratories) was used to record the disappearance of O2from the closed 400-μl chamber. The output from the O2electrode amplifier (Instech) was recorded using a Kipp & Zonen flatbed chart recorder. The oxygen tension was calculated by measuring the amount of room air oxygen that was dissolved in 150 mm NaCl at 37 °C. At the end of each measurement, a sample of the cell suspension was collected for protein analysis (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that each QO2 could be normalized to the protein content of the cells. Fraction V BSA was used as the protein standard. The QO2 value was calculated as the maximum linear QO2 upon the addition of an agent to the chamber. The ΔQO2 values for parotid cells are the differences between the sustained O2 consumption rates under particular conditions (control or ouabain) and the new maximal linear rates upon the addition of various agents (see figures). For measurements of mitochondrial respiration, aliquots of mitochondria suspended in isolation medium were diluted ∼1:9 with solution B, composed of the following: 120 mm KCl, 10 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. 10 mm pyruvate and 0.5 mm malate were added as substrates during the incubation of mitochondria at 37 °C for 4 min prior to closing the 1.85-ml chamber to commence the measurement of the QO2. In some experiments the mitochondria were added to solution B that contained sufficient essentially fatty acid-free BSA for a final concentration of 5%. At the end of each QO2 measurement, a sample of the mitochondrial suspension was collected for protein analysis. Parotid cells were exposed to various agents or vehicle (water or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)) and then were collected by sedimentation in a microcentrifuge (Brinkmann). The supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% v/v Igepal) containing the following phosphatase and protease inhibitors: 1 mm vanadate, 4.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 47.6 mm NaF, 9.26 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotenin, and 2 μg/ml AEBSF. The lysates were vortexed and then sedimented at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants were transferred to fresh microfuge tubes and incubated with monoclonal PKCδ antibody (∼0.5 μg/ml) for 3 h at 4 °C. The proteins were collected by exposure to 4 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose for an additional hour. At the end of this period, proteins were collected by sedimentation, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Igepal. The pelleted proteins were diluted with 2× sample buffer, boiled for 4 min, and stored at −20 °C prior to electrophoresis. Samples were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an 8% separating gel and a 3% stacking gel as described previously (14Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1498-C1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were sequentially probed overnight with 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody and polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody (∼0.5 μg/ml). Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and x-ray film (Kodak). In experiments conducted using PC12 and RPG1 cells, the cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% serum. Inhibitors/uncouplers were added to this medium for 30–45 min followed by the addition of vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or 100 nm PMA for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (136.9 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, and 15.65 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4), lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer, vortexed, and then sedimented at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. PKCδ was immunoprecipitated and analyzed as was done for parotid acinar cells. PC12 cells growing on 100-mm dishes in normal serum-containing medium were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. After clearing the lysates by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g, the lysates were pooled and realiquoted into fresh tubes. Monoclonal anti-PKCδ antibody (∼0.5 μg/ml) was added to each lysate for 2–3 h at 4 °C, and 4 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose was added for 1–2 h to collect PKCδ. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% Igepal, once in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5m LiCl, and twice in phosphate-buffered saline. All wash solutions were ice-cold. The beads were resuspended in assay buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 μm PKCδ synthetic substrate peptide (AKRKRKGSFFYGG), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). As noted, in some experiments the assays were conducted in the presence of lipid cofactors (10 μm DAG plus 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS)) in the assay buffer. Immunoprecipitates were exposed to vehicle (0.02% Me2SO) or various concentrations of rottlerin or GF109203X for 15 min at 30 °C prior to initiating the assay with the addition of ATP (50 μm ATP, 10 μCi [32P]ATP (specific activity 10 μCi/μl)). The final volume of the assay mixture was 100 μl. Background activity was measured using protein A-Sepharose beads that were incubated with PC12 cell lysates without antibody. The samples were incubated for 30 min with intermittent mixing, and then duplicate 10-μl aliquots of each sample were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper. The P-81 papers were washed five or six times in 0.425% phosphoric acid, and the amount of 32P was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The duplicate values from each immunoprecipitate were averaged and treated as one sample. Usually two or three immunoprecipitates were collected for each of the various conditions in each experiment. The samples were averaged and treated as the results from one experiment (n = 1). In each experiment, all values were normalized to the basal PKCδ activity in the presence of DAG and PS, which was 119,515 ± 13,618 cpm (n = 3 experiments). These assay conditions were similar to those used in a previous study in which the sequence of the substrate peptide, which is based on the pseudosubstrate region of PKCδ, was determined to be optimal for PKCδ (4Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This assay also was used previously to analyze PKCδ activity in parotid and PC12 cells (14Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1498-C1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results from two or three experiments were averaged, and the S.E. was calculated (wheren = 3). Suspensions of parotid acinar cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10–20 min, after which they were exposed to 10 μm rottlerin or 10 μm FCCP for 2, 5, and 15 min at 37 °C. Control cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO). For each sample, cells were rapidly sedimented, and ATP was extracted from the cell pellets by lysing the cells in 6% perchloric acid. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and neutralized using K2CO3, and the perchloric acid-precipitated proteins were saved for quantification via Lowry assay. The ATP content in the neutralized supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically (26Chamberlin M. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the day of the experiment or after storing the sample at −20 °C. In each experiment, four samples of unstimulated (basal) cells were collected, and one or two samples of FCCP- and rottlerin-treated cells were collected at multiple time points. The results from two or three individual acinar cell preparations were averaged, and the S.E. was calculated (wheren = 3). For QO2 measurements, the mean ± S.E. of n number of replicates from a single preparation of cells or mitochondria are shown in the figures. The numbers of different preparations are as indicated in the figure legends. Western blots are representative of at least three different experiments. 10 μm rottlerin produced a large increase in the QO2 of intact parotid acinar cells (Fig.1A). 10 μmcarbachol, a ligand that activates the M3 muscarinic receptor in these cells, also increased the QO2 of intact parotid cells. The changes in the QO2 were rapid for both agents, although the time to reach the maximal linear peak QO2 occurred somewhat more rapidly in response to carbachol compared with rottlerin. Initially, the reason for the response to rottlerin was unclear, but it was presumed to involve PKCδ and/or other PKC family members. The QO2 response to carbachol was caused by the activation of the sodium pump and was secondary to increases in intracellular Na+ and decreases in intracellular K+ which occur upon the activation of Na+ entry pathways and K+ channels in carbachol-treated parotid acinar cells. In many epithelial cells, the sodium pump is tightly and functionally coupled to mitochondrial respiration because of the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation by the ADP (and perhaps inorganic phosphate) generated from ATP hydrolysis by the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) (27Mandel L.J. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: F357-F371PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, inhibition of the sodium pump with ouabain will block the sodium pump component of oxidative phosphorylation (22Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Soltoff S.P. Mandel L.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 623-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The addition of ouabain to unstimulated parotid cells reduced the basal QO2 (Fig. 1B). Although the response to carbachol was substantially blocked by pretreatment of the parotid acinar cells with ouabain, the increase in QO2 by exposure of the cells to rottlerin was equally effective in the absence or presence of ouabain (Fig. 1, B and D). This characteristic of the effects of rottlerin on parotid cell QO2 suggested that rottlerin might be acting as a mitochondrial uncoupler, analogous to the equivalent effects of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP on the QO2 of isolated renal epithelial cells in the presence and absence of ouabain (29Soltoff S.P. Mandel L.J. J. Membr. Res. 1986; 94: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact, FCCP also stimulated the QO2 of parotid acinar cells independent of the presence of ouabain (Fig. 1). Rottlerin also increased the QO2 in cells that first were exposed sequentially to carbachol, which increases the sodium pump activity, and ouabain, which blocks the activated sodium pump (Fig.1C). Rottlerin also increased the QO2 when cells were treated sequentially with nystatin and ouabain (not shown). Nystatin, a cationophore, produces a rapid increase in the QO2 of parotid acinar cells in a ouabain-sensitive manner because of its effects on increasing Na+ and decreasing K+ within the cell (22Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Lechleiter J.D. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 76-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the effects of rottlerin were not mediated by alterations in the concentrations of intracellular Na+ and K+. In contrast to the stimulatory effects of rottlerin on the QO2, 10 μm GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor effective on a broad spectrum of PKC isoforms, did not increase the QO2 (Fig. 1D). In addition, rottlerin stimulated the QO2 in the presence of GF109203X (Fig. 1D). These results indicated that the effects of rottlerin were not caused by inhibiting or stimulating PKC activity. These results, which were obtained with freshly isolated rat parotid acinar cells, suggested that rottlerin directly or indirectly uncoupled mitochondrial respiration from oxidative phosphorylation. Like the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP, rottlerin was effective in the presence of ouabain and under conditions in which the normally low concentrations of intracellular Na+ and high concentrations of K+ were reversed. Freshly isolated rat parotid acinar cells rely primarily on oxidative metabolism to supply energy for the sodium pump and other ATP-dependent processes. Therefore, we tested the effects of rottlerin on the respiration of PC12 cells, which rely heavily on glycolysis (31Reynolds E.E. Melega W.P. Howard B.D. Biochem. 1982; 21: 4795-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Kang D. Miyako K. Kuribayashi F. Hasegawa E. Mitsumoto A. Nagano T. Takeshige K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Basma A.N. Heikkila R.E. Saporito M.S. Philbert M. Geller H.M. Nicklas W.J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1052-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for their energetic needs. Rottlerin also produced a rapid increase in the QO2 of PC12 cells (Fig. 2). The basal QO2of PC12 cells (19.8 ± 2.0 nmol of O2/mg/min,n = 3) increased by 12.1 ± 0.3 (n= 3) nmol of O2/mg/min in the acute presence of 10 μm rottlerin. Thus, rottlerin promoted respiratory increases in cells that rely heavily on glycolysis for ATP production as well as in cells that rely primarily on oxidative metabolism. To determine if rottlerin had effects directly on mitochondria, the QO2 of isolated rat liver mitochondria was measured. Rottlerin produced a large and rapid increase in the QO2 of the isolated mitochondria (Fig.3A). Similar increases were produced by FCCP and ADP (Fig. 3, A and B). The ADP-stimulated QO2, in which O2 consumption is coupled to the production of ATP, was classified by Chance and Williams (34Chance B. Williams C.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar) as the state 3 rate of mitochondrial O2 consumption. The QO2 of ADP-treated mitochondria returned to a slower rate upon the conversion of ADP to ATP (Fig. 3A). However, the enhanced QO2 produced by rottlerin or FCCP continued until the O2 levels in the chamber were depleted. The effectiveness of rottlerin in stimulating the QO2 of both intact cells and isolated mitochondria indicated that rottlerin promoted the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration from the production of ATP. In contrast to the effects of 10 μmrottlerin, 10 μm GF109203X did not alter the mitochondrial QO2 and also did not block the effects of rottlerin (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that the effects of rottlerin on respiration were not mediated by blocking (or stimulating) PKC activity. The dependence of the mitochondrial respiration on the concentration of rottlerin was compared with that of FCCP (Fig. 3C). At 1 and 10 μm, both compounds stimulated the largest rates, which were similar to the ADP-stimulated state 3 rate of respiration; but FCCP was more effective than rottlerin at 0.1 μm. High (5%) concentrations of BSA in the mitochondrial solution did not alter the effectiveness of 10 μm FCCP and rottlerin, but the responses to 1 μm FCCP were reduced more than responses to 1 μm rottlerin. BSA did not reduce the response to ADP, consistent with BSA acting by binding to both uncoupling agents rather than by compromising the ability of the mitochondria to respond with an increase in QO2. These results demonstrate that the potency of the uncouplers is affected by high levels of proteins, a consideration to bear in mind when cells are in serum-containing medium. BSA has been shown to lower the potency of many compounds, including mitochon"
https://openalex.org/W2061060121,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are commonly propagated by extracerebral inoculation of the infectious agent. Indirect evidence suggests that entry into the central nervous system occurs via the peripheral nervous system. Here we have investigated the role of the sympathetic nervous system in prion neuroinvasion. Following intraperitoneal prion inoculation, chemical or immunological sympathectomy delayed or prevented scrapie. Prion titers in spinal cords were drastically reduced at early time points after inoculation. Instead, keratin 14-NGF transgenic mice, whose lymphoid organs are hyperinnervated by sympathetic nerves, showed reduction in scrapie incubation time and, unexpectedly, much higher titers of prion infectivity in spleens. We conclude that sympathetic innervation of lymphoid organs is rate limiting for prion neuroinvasion and that splenic sympathetic nerves may act as extracerebral prion reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W1990486199,"Short- and long-term synaptic facilitation induced by serotonin at Aplysia sensory-motor (SN-MN) synapses has been widely used as a cellular model of short- and long-term memory for sensitization. In recent years, a distinct intermediate phase of synaptic facilitation (ITF) has been described at SN-MN synapses. Here, we identify a novel intermediate phase of behavioral memory (ITM) for sensitization in Aplysia and demonstrate that it shares the temporal and mechanistic features of ITF in the intact CNS: (1) it declines completely prior to the onset of LTM, (2) its induction requires protein but not RNA synthesis, and (3) its expression requires the persistent activation of protein kinase A. Thus, in Aplysia, the same temporal and molecular characteristics that distinguish ITF from other phases of synaptic plasticity distinguish ITM from other phases of behavioral memory."
https://openalex.org/W2132755552,"We examined the phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 in ovarian granulosa cells stimulated to differentiate by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). We found that protein kinase A (PKA) mediates H3 phosphorylation on serine 10, based on inhibition exclusively by PKA inhibitors.

Most of the actions of FSH are mediated by cAMP formation and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), based on the ability of cell-permeable cAMP analogs to mimic the known differentiation responses to FSH in granulosa cells (2Hsueh A.J.W.

Further elucidation of the FSH signaling pathways that lead to the induction of immediate early genes would be useful to understand how FSH initiates granulosa cell differentiation.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3353-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and downstream phosphorylation of the heat shock protein (HSP) 27, leading to granulosa cell rounding (10Maizels E.T.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) have recently identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) as a downstream target of FSH and cAMP. The transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is also phosphorylated in response to FSH in a cAMP-dependent manner (3Gonzalez-Robayna I. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L.

We recently reported that histones H1 and H3 are also downstream targets of FSH and PKA in granulosa cells (14DeManno D.A. Cottom J.E. Kline M.P. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which FSH stimulates granulosa cell differentiation and not proliferation (2Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 15Dorrington J. Chuma A.V. Bendell J.J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), histone H3 is transiently phosphorylated exclusively on serine 10 (14). The addition of factors that do not promote granulosa cell differentiation (2Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), does not lead to histone H3 phosphorylation (14DeManno D.A. Cottom J.E. Kline M.P. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event appears to represent an early marker of differentiation and is distinct from the well established marker of chromosome condensation during mitosis (16Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. VanHooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 17Bradbury E.M.

Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) in granulosa cells as these cells undergo differentiation and not proliferation in response to FSH in serum-free cultures. While histone H3 phosphorylation on serine 10 has traditionally been viewed as a marker for mitosis (16Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. VanHooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 17Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), there were also reports in the early 1980s that histone H3 was phosphorylated in response to differentiative stimuli such as nerve growth factor in PC-12 cells and cAMP/isoproterenol in C6 glioma cells (19Halegoua S. Patrick J. Cell. 1980; 22: 571-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Harrison J.J. Suter P. Suter S. Jungmann R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ten years later, the rapid phosphorylation of a small fraction of histone H3 on serine 10 was reported in quiescent C3H 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts in response to phorbol esters, okadaic acid, EGF, and protein synthesis inhibitors coincident with the induction of immediate early genes such as c-fos and c-jun (21Mahadevan L.C.

A. 1994; 91: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent reports have identified two related histone H3 kinases as likely mediators in these pathways. Both ribosomal S6 kinase-2 (RSK-2), which is downstream of p42/p44 MAPK/ERK, and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1), which is downstream of both MAPK/ERK and p38 MAPK (23Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro (24Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L.

EGF-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation was restored after the addition of the RSK-2 gene to a fibroblast cell line derived from patients with Coffin-Lowry syndrome with mutations in the RSK-2 gene (24Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 295: 886-891Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In quiescent C3H 10T½ mouse fibroblasts, anisomycin- and phorbol ester-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation was inhibited by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (27Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar) and the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (28Dudley D.T. Pang L.

Both phorbol ester- and anisomycin-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation were inhibited by H89, based on the ability of this kinase inhibitor to inhibit MSK-1 (25Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) rather than its well recognized inhibition of PKA (30Hidaka H. Watanabe M. Kobayashi R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Similarly in JB6 epidermal C1 cells, ultraviolet B-induced histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (32Zhong S.-P. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These reports thus establish a prominent role for RSK-2 and MSK-1 downstream of the p38 MAPK and/or ERK/MAPK pathways in growth factor- and phorbol ester-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation. As FSH stimulates the MAPK/ERK pathway in granulosa cells in a PKA-dependent manner (9Das S. Maizels E.T. DeManno D. St. Clair E. Adam S.A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that, as in fibroblasts and epidermal cells, histone H3 phosphorylation in granulosa cells might be mediated by either RSK-2 and/or MSK-1 activated by a MAPK pathway downstream of PKA. We additionally sought direct evidence that histone H3 phosphorylation is functionally linked to the induction of characteristic FSH-responsive immediate early genes. Finally, based on abundant evidence that histone acetylation is associated with transcriptional activation (33Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 34Walia H. Chen H.Y. Sun J.-M. Holth L.T. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 23: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 14 and/or lysine 9 is stimulated by FSH. Ovine FSH (oFSH-19) was kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow of the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (Torrence, CA). The following were purchased: H89, AG1478, GF109203X, KT5720, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), phorbol myristic acid (PMA), and okadaic acid from LC Laboratories (San Diego, CA); PD98059, SB203580, myristoylated PKA inhibitor (PKI) 14–22 amide, and wortmannin from Calbiochem; anti-histone H3 acetylated on lysines 9 and/or 14 (anti-H3AcLys-9/Lys-14), anti-histone H3 acetylated on lysine 14 (anti-H3AcLys-14) or lysine 9 (anti-H3AcLys-9), anti-histone H3 phosphorylated on serine 10 (anti-H3PhSer-10), anti-histone H3 both phosphorylated on serine 10 and acetylated on lysine 14 (anti-H3PhSer-10/AcLys-14), anti-CREB phosphorylated on serine 133, and anti-CREB antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); anti-histone H3, anti-MAPK/ERK phosphorylated on threonine 202 and tyrosine 204, anti-p38 MAPK phosphorylated on threonine 180 and tyrosine 182, anti-MSK-1 phosphorylated on serine 376, and anti-RSK phosphorylated on serine 381 (which detects RSK-1 and RSK-2) antibodies from New England Biolabs/Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); anti-p38 MAPK antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-MAPK/ERK antibody from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Equivalent results for SDS-PAGE and acid urea gel blots were obtained with anti-H3PhSer-10 and anti-H3PhSer-10/AcLys-14 antibodies obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (and licensed from Dr. David Allis) and directly from the Allis laboratory. Recognition by anti-H3PhSer-10 antibody of H3 phosphorylated on serine 10 was not affected by acetylation of lysines 9 and/or 14 (16, 37); recognition by anti-H3PhSer-10/Lys-14 antibody was selective for H3 phosphorylated on serine 10 and acetylated on lysine 14 (37). An expression vector containing PKI fused to the cell entry leader sequence TAT was constructed by PCR. Oligonucleotides 5′-GCCGTTACCTCCCTGCTATGTGGATATTTG and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCTTTCAGATTTTGCTGCTTCTC, which add the restriction sites KPN and XHO, respectively, were used to amplify PKI using Jurkat cell cDNA as template. The fragment was cut with the above restriction enzymes and subcloned into the pTAT vector (38Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 12: 1449-1452Crossref Scopus (887) Google Scholar) generously provided by Dr. Steven Dowdy. TAT-PKI protein was expressed in BL21 DE3 pLysS bacteria and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. The protein was labeled with FITC and determined to enter cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Beckman Instruments). Expressed, purified protein was tested for functionality by adding it to anin vitro PKA assay. PKA activity in cell lysates was stimulated 3.7-fold by the addition of cAMP. This stimulation was inhibited 84% by 250 nm TAT-PKI, which is equivalent to the 83% inhibition obtained using the PKI inhibitor peptide. Granulosa cells were isolated from the ovaries of 26-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats that had been primed with subcutaneous injections of 1.5 mg of estradiol-17β on days 23–25 to promote the growth of preantral follicles (5Carr D.W.

Cells were either plated on 33-mm plastic dishes (Falcon) at a density of ∼3 × 106 cells/dish (14DeManno D.A. Cottom J.E. Kline M.P. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol.

For subsequent Western blotting, treatments were terminated by aspirating medium, rinsing cells once with phosphate-buffered saline, and collecting total cell extracts in 0.5 ml of SDS sample buffer (39Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12185-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by heat denaturation. Protein concentrations were controlled by plating identical cell numbers per plate in each experiment and then loading equal volumes of total cell extract per gel lane. Ponceau S staining of the final blot was used to confirm equal protein loading. Granulosa cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 or 12% acrylamide in running gel) (40Hunzicker-Dunn M. Cutler Jr., R.E. Maizels E.T. DeManno D.A. Lamm M.L.G. Erlichman J. Sanwal B.D. LaBarbera A.R. J. Biol.

Blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For acid urea gels, cells were lysed, and acid-soluble histones were extracted from nuclei (37Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Chueng W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Acid-soluble histones and H3 standard (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were loaded in sample buffer containing 6 m urea, 5% acetic acid, and 12.5 mg/ml protamine sulfate and then electrophoresed through a 1-cm stacking gel and 17.5-cm separating gel (15% acrylamide, 6m urea, 5% acetic acid) for 24 h at 200 V (37Cheung P.

Histones were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), stained with Ponceau S, and subjected to Western blotting. For immunofluorescence, cells were treated as indicated and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with anti-H3PhSer-10 antibody (1:50 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum. Coverslips were washed and incubated for 1 h at 37° C with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells on coverslips were washed and mounted on slides in diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane antifading medium (41Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Slides were analyzed by a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope. For introduction of TAT-PKI, cells were plated in 1 ml of Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) on 6-well plastic dishes (Falcon). Approximately 20 h after plating, TAT-PKI was added, and cells were incubated for 3 h. Opti-MEM I medium was then aspirated off cells, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (5Carr D.W. DeManno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added, and cells were treated as indicated. Treatments were terminated as above, and total cell extracts were collected in 0.1 ml of SDS sample buffer (39Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12185-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following indicated treatments, granulosa cells were incubated (15 min at room temperature) in 1% formaldehyde to cross-link DNA and proteins and then sonicated in cell lysis buffer as described previously (36Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). One-tenth of the total lysate was used for purification of total genomic DNA. The rest of the lysate was incubated with anti-H3PhSer-10, anti-H3AcLys-9/Lys-14, or anti-H3PhSer-10/AcLys-14 antibodies at 4 °C for 18 h. Following the collection of immunoprecipitates using protein A-agarose, DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and PCR was performed using either total DNA or immunoprecipitated DNA in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (36Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Primers used for PCR correspond to sequences within the inhibin α promoter region (36Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson L.J. Mol.

Phospho-histone H3 is undetectable in vehicle-treated granulosa cells (Fig. 1C). Treatment of cells with FSH for 1 h results in the detection of phospho-histone H3 in small foci in the nuclei of most but not all granulosa cells (compare Fig. 1, B and D). Overexposure results in complete nuclear staining, as seen in the cell nucleus detected in Fig. 1 D, lower portion. Recent evidence in fibroblasts has identified both RSK-2, downstream of p42/p44 MAPK/ERK, and MSK-1, downstream of both p42/p44 MAPK/ERK and p38 MAPK, as histone H3 kinases (24Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 295: 886-891Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 25Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We first compared the rates of phosphorylation/activation of the p42/p44 MAPK/ERK pathway, histone H3 phosphorylation on serine 10, and CREB phosphorylation on serine 133. Increased phosphorylation of CREB, an established PKA target (46Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 66: 807-822Crossref Scopus (860) Google Scholar), is first detected by Western blot at 1 min and increases further at 10 min after FSH addition; increased phosphorylation of histone H3 and MAPK/ERK is detected by 10 min, and increased RSK-2 phosphorylation is detected at 20 min post-FSH (Fig.2). Histone H3 phosphorylation peaks at 1 h. By 2 h, MAPK/ERK and RSK-2 phosphorylations have returned to basal levels; CREB and histone H3 phosphorylations returned to basal levels by 4 h post-FSH. MSK-1 phosphorylation is also detected in vehicle-treated cells but is not affected by FSH (not shown). These results show that FSH promotes both MAPK/ERK and RSK-2 phosphorylation, consistent with our previous evidence that FSH stimulates RSK phosphorylation in granulosa cells incubated with32Pi (9Das S. Maizels E.T. DeManno D. St. Clair E. Adam S.A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on evidence in fibroblasts and epidermal cells that histone H3 phosphorylation is blocked by inhibitors of the p38 MAPK and/or the MAPK/ERK pathways, we tested inhibitors of these and other pathways on FSH-stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 30, 60, or 90 min, as indicated in the legend for Fig. 3, and then treated for 1 h with FSH, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, the protein kinase C activator PMA, or the cell-permeable cAMP analog CPT-cAMP. Although a 1-h treatment with FSH is optimal for H3 phosphorylation, MAPK/ERK phosphorylation is declining or has declined to basal levels by this time (Fig. 2). Neither the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (28Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), separately or together, inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). Similarly histone H3 phosphorylation is not altered by the RSK-2/protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X (47Alessi D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), although this agent does inhibit the modest stimulation by PMA of histone H3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 21). PD98059 inhibits all detectable MAPK/ERK phosphorylation stimulated by FSH and forskolin as well as FSH- and forskolin-stimulated RSK-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, which has previously been shown to inhibit FSH-stimulated p38 signaling to HSP27 (10Maizels E.T. Cottom J. Jones J.R. Hunzicker-Dunn M.

No previous study has directly compared the kinetics of dark adaptation with rates of the various chemical reactions that influence it. To accomplish this, we developed a novel rapid-quench/mass spectrometry-based method to establish the initial kinetics and site specificity of light-stimulated rhodopsin phosphorylation in mouse retinas. We also measured phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, regeneration of rhodopsin, and reduction of all-trans retinal all under identical in vivo conditions. Dark adaptation was monitored by electroretinography. We found that rhodopsin is multiply phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated in an ordered fashion following exposure to light. Initially during dark adaptation, transduction activity wanes as multiple phosphates accumulate. Thereafter, full recovery of photosensitivity coincides with regeneration and dephosphorylation of rhodopsin."

After sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster, one gene, dpgA, for a predicted polyketide synthase (PKS) was identified, sharing 20–30% identity with plant chalcone synthases. Inactivation of dpgAresulted in loss of balhimycin production, and restoration was achieved by supplementation with 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which is both a possible product of a PKS reaction and a likely precursor of Dpg. Enzyme assays with the protein expressed in Streptomyces lividans showed that this PKS uses only malonyl-CoA as substrate to synthesize 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. The PKS gene is organized in an operon-like structure with three downstream genes that are similar to enoyl-CoA-hydratase genes and a dehydrogenase gene. The heterologous co-expression of all four genes led to accumulation of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglyoxylic acid. Therefore, we now propose a reaction sequence. The final step in the pathway to Dpg is a transamination. A predicted transaminase gene was inactivated, resulting in abolished antibiotic production and accumulation of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglyoxylic acid. Interestingly, restoration was only possible by simultaneous supplementation with (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and (S)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, indicating that the transaminase is essential for the formation of both amino acids.

Monro R. Sorrell T.C. Shankar S. Toohey M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983; 11: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the recent emergence of vancomycin-resistant strains raises the possibility that vancomycin may soon be rendered ineffective over time and that other therapeutic agents must be developed (2Tenover F.C. J. Hosp. Infect. 1999; 43: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One obvious approach to obtain new antibiotics is the chemical modification of the existing structures to yield semi-synthetic glycopeptides (3Cooper R.D.G. Snyder N.J. Zweifel M.J. Staszak M.A. Wilkie S.C. Nicas T.I. Mullen D.L. Butler T.F. Rodriguez M.J. Huff R.C. Thompson R.C. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1996; 49: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Another attractive alternative is the specific manipulation of the biosynthetic pathway of the producing organism. This, however, requires detailed knowledge of glycopeptide biosynthesis. Recently, the gene cluster for balhimycin (4Nadkarni S.R Patel M.V. Chatterjee S. Vijayakumar E.K.S. Desikan K.R. Blumbach J. Ganguli B.N. J. Antibiot.

It has been shown that the aromatic amino acids (2S,3R)-m-chloro-β-hydroxytyrosine and (R)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine in the aglycone of vancomycin group antibiotics are derived from tyrosine (10Hammond, S. J., Williamson, M. P., Williams, D. H., Boeck, L. D., and Marconi, G. G. (1982) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 344–346.Google Scholar), and all enzymes in the biosynthesis of the latter amino acid were identified recently (11Choroba O. Williams D.H. Spencer J.B. J. Am. Chem.

The backbone of a third unusual amino acid in these antibiotics, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, was shown to be derived from acetate, and a polyketide synthase (PKS)1 reaction was proposed (10Hammond, S. J., Williamson, M. P., Williams, D. H., Boeck, L. D., and Marconi, G. G. (1982) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 344–346.Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of considerable interest that the biosynthetic gene cluster of balhimycin does not contain genes for typical bacterial PKS (type I or II) but a gene for a protein related to the plant-specific polyketide synthases of the chalcone synthase family (reviewed in Ref.13Schröder J. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Putative proteins with 20–30% identity with those plant proteins have been discovered in several different bacteria (reviewed in Ref.14Moore B.S. Hopke J.N. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 2: 35-38Google Scholar), but the precise enzyme function is known in only one case (15Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the function of the chalcone synthase-related polypeptide encoded in the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster and the genes involved in the post PKS modification steps, which lead to (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. Chemicals were obtained routinely from Sigma-Aldrich or from Merck and were of analytical grade. [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (1.85 GBq/mmol) and [2-14C]acetyl-CoA (1.85 GBq/mmol) were obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine was obtained from ICN Biomedicals GmbH, Eschwege, Germany), and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid methyl ester with pig liver esterase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Media constituents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and OXOID (Wesel, Germany). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biosystems (Frankfurt on Main, Germany) and MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. Cloning experiments were performed inEscherichia coli XL1Blue by standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Heterologous expression experiments were carried out withStreptomyces lividans T7, kindly provided by J. Altenbuchner (Stuttgart, Germany). Enzyme activity was determined after cultivation in CRM medium (103 g of saccharose, 20 g of tryptic soy broth, 10 g of yeast extract, and 10.12 g of MgCl2·6H2O in 1.0 liter of distilled water) for 24 h at 30 °C and 180 rpm in baffled shake flasks. Thiostrepton and kanamycin were added to a final concentration of 25 mg/liter, where appropriate. A. mediterranei strains were grown in R5 medium (22Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T.

Liquid/solid media were supplemented with 50 µg/ml erythromycin to select for strains carrying the integrated antibiotic resistance gene. Supplementation of mutants was carried out with 100 µm3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 41 µm(S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, and 41 µm(S)-4-hydroxyphenylglycine.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyRelevant characteristicsReferenceStrainsE. coliXL1BluerecA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac [F′ proAB lacIqZΔM15Tn10(Tetr)]16Bullock W.O.

The PCR mixture (100 µl) contained 200 µm each primer, 1.0 µg of template DNA (cosmid16.1), desoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates at a final concentration of 200 µm each (DNA polymerization mix;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10× reaction buffer, and 2.5 units of HerculaseTM enhanced DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To decrease secondary structures in template DNA, dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 3% (v/v) was added to the reaction mixture. The primer pairs were: IFCS1.1, 5′-GGC GAGGAA TTC TCG CTG CCG ATG TAC-3′, and IFCS1.2, 5′-GTC GAGGAT ATC GAG GAC CTC GGA CTG-3′; and IFCS2.1, 5′-GGC TCCGAT ATC GAA ATG GCG CTG ATC-3′, and IFCS2.1, 5′-CGC GCATCT AGA TGC CCT GGT CGA TC-3′. Restriction sites introduced into the sequence are underlined in the primer sequences. After restriction, the amplified DNA fragments were fused over their commonEcoRV restriction site, resulting in an in-frame transition between the two PCR products. The 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XbaI restriction sites of the fusion product were used to clone it into the gene replacement vector pSP1, resulting in the plasmid pIFCS (Fig. 1). For transformation of A. mediterranei DSM5908, a modified direct transformation method was used as described previously (6Pelzer S. Huppert M. Reichert W. Heckmann D. und Wohlleben W. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 56: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After transformation, the clones harboring the erythromycin selection marker had integrated the pIFCS plasmid over a single cross-over into the chromosome. To obtain an in-frame deletion mutant, a second cross-over event at the other site of the deleted fragment was required. To increase the probability of detecting such a second cross-over event, ultrasound treatment (Branson Sonifier 250, Danbury, CT) was performed with the transformed mycelium in liquid medium. A clone (A. mediterranei VP1–2) that had lost erythromycin resistance was selected, and the correct second cross-over event was verified by PCR and Southern hybridization. For in-frame deletion of pgat in A. mediterranei, the fragment IFbat1 (1070 bp) and the fragment IFbat2 (1029 bp) were amplified by PCR (same reaction mixture as described above). The following primer pairs were used: IFbat1.1, 5′-TCT AGA TCG CCC GGT AGG CCT-3′, and IFbat1.2, 5′-A GAT CTC CGT ACA AGA GCG TG-3′; and IFbat2.1, 5′-A GAT CTC CGG GAA GCT GCT CCT C-3′ and IFbat2.1, 5′-GCA TGC GCC GGC TGC CCT TCC-3′. As described for construction of pIFCS, the two fragments IFbat1 and IFbat2 were fused over their common restriction site BglII and cloned into the gene replacement vector pSP1 over the 5′-XbaI and the 3′-SphI site of the fusion product of IFbat1 and IFbat2, resulting in the plasmid pIFbat (Fig.1). After transformation of A. mediterranei, the same selection procedure was used to obtain a double cross-over event in theA. mediterranei chromosome with the plasmid pIFbat, resulting in the strain A. mediterranei JR1. To obtain plasmids replicating in E. coli as well as in S. lividans, all expression plasmids were generally constructed byHindIII fusion of pRSETB derivatives (replicative in E. coli) with the streptomycetes vector pGM9. To prevent plasmid instability, all the genes in the resulting fusion plasmids were oriented in the same direction. The control plasmid pVP1 was constructed by fusing just the pRSETBvector with pGM9. For construction of the expression plasmid pVP2, PCR was performed with the primer pair DPGA1 (5′-CATATG GGG GTG GAT GTA TCG-3′) and DPGA2 (5′-AAGCTTTCA CCA TTG GAT CAG CGC-3′) and with cosmid16.1 as template (Fig. 1). The deduced start and stop codons ofdpgA are bold face in the primer sequences. The amplified 1128 bp fragment, coding for dpgA, was cloned into the pRSETb vector over the primer-derivedNdeI-HindIII restriction sites. The fusion of the resulting plasmid pRSETdpgA with pGM9 yielded pVP2. The co-expression plasmid pVP5 was constructed by cloning a 7-kilobase pair ClaI-XbaI fragment containingdpgBCD and a C-terminal dpgA fragment from cosmid16.1 into pSLE61 (ClaI-XbaI), resulting in pSLEK7. The 7-kilobase pair ClaI-HindIII fragment from pSLEK7 was then cloned into pRSETdpgA (ClaI-HindIII), replacing 1102 bp of thedpgA PCR insert and creating a full dpgABCDfragment. S. lividans T7 was transformed with the resulting plasmids pVP1, pVP2, and pVP5 by protoplast transformation as described (22Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulations of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK1985Google Scholar). Culture filtrates of induced expression and control strains of S. lividans orA. mediterranei (wild type or mutant strain JR1) were extracted with ethyl acetate at pH 1.0. After evaporation of the solvent, the residual material was redissolved in methanol to get a 25-fold concentration relative to the original culture volume. The concentrated extracts (20 µl) were separated via HPLC (Thermo Request System, Egelsbach, Germany) using a Nucleosil C18 column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The solvents used were solvent A (double distilled H2O, 0.1% phosphoric acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile). The profile for separation was a linear gradient from 100% A/0% B to 90% A/10% B at run-time 13.3 min, a linear gradient to 0% A/100% B at run-time 16 min, and a re-equilibration time of 4 min at 100%A/0% B. The elution was monitored with a multi-wavelength detector between 200 and 350 nm. Balhimycin production was determined by bioassays withBacillus subtilis ATCC6633 as the test organism. Filter disks of 5-mm diameter soaked with liquid medium were placed on balhimycin test medium (3.0 g of KH2PO4, 7.0 g of K2HPO4, 0.5 g of sodium citrate 2-hydrate, 0.1 g of MgSO4·7 H2O, 1.0 g of (NH4)2SO4, 2.0 g of glucose, and 17.0 g of agar in 1.0 liters of distilled water, inoculated with a spore suspension of B. subtilis after sterilization and cooling). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Induced cells were washed and resuspended in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithioerythritol, final pH 7.5) on ice. Resuspended cells (4 ml of assay buffer/1 g wet weight of cells) were broken by passage through a French press cell, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min at 25,000 ×g). A 100-µl reaction mixture contained 20 µl (150 µg of protein) and additions as detailed in the figure legends. Reactions mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of 5 µl of concentrated HCl. The mixtures were then extracted 2 times with 200 µl of ethyl acetate. After evaporation of the solvent, the resultant material was dissolved in 10 µl of methanol and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Merck TLC aluminum sheets Silica gel 60 F254, solvent, ethyl acetate:petrol ether:acetic acid, 9:9:1, v/v/v). The dried plates were developed by 1-h exposure with a phosphorimaging plate to the thin layer plate followed by a quantitative scan with a phosphorimaging plate reader (Fujifilm Bio-imaging Analyzer System BAS-1800 II, Raytest GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany). Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was carried out with a GC-MS system of Hewlett-Packard (Waldborn, Germany; HP6890 (GC) coupled with HP5973 (MS); column, H4–5MS (30 m × 250 µm, 0.25-µm film thickness)) The substances to be analyzed were derivatized by trimethylsilylation withN,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide in pyridine (30 min, 60 °C). 1H NMR of the purified component with the retention time of 2.6 min was carried out with a AMX600 NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Sequence data of the genes described in this study were obtained by standard sequencing procedures (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using cosmid16.1 as template. Alignment of sequence contigs and examination for open reading frames (ORFs) were performed by applying the programs gap4 and nip4 (26Staden R. Mol. Biotechnol. 1996; 5: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The NCBI BLASTP (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) net service for homology search was used with the following parameters: non-redundant protein data base; expect threshold 10; word size 3; blosum62 matrix; gap costs, existence 11 and extension 1. To identify the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residue in balhimycin, we focused our search in the balhimycin biosynthetic gene cluster on polyketide synthase-like genes. Typical PKSs of either type I or II were absent: BLASTP searches with the used parameters resulted in no significant similarities over the first 1000 hits of every detected ORF. But we detected a gene predicting a protein of significant similarity with the plant polyketide synthases of the chalcone synthase type. This gene was called dpgA because it is the first gene in an operon-like structure that plays the key role indihydroxyphenylglycine biosynthesis (dpg). The highest identity score with functionally characterized proteins was obtained with the plant PKS GHCHS2 fromGerbera hybrida (26% identity (ID)/44% similarity (SM)), which uses acetyl-CoA and two malonyl-CoA to synthesize the backbone of the plant secondary metabolite gerberin, a 2-hydroxy-pyrone derivative (28Eckermann S. Schröder G. Schmidt J. Strack D. Edrada R.A. Helariuatta Y. Elomaa P. Kotilainen M. Kilpeläinen I. Proksch P. Teeri T.H. Schröder J. Nature. 1998; 396: 387-390Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to the significant overall similarity, DpgA contained in the expected positions the key amino acids necessary for activity of these plant-specific type PKSs (29Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), suggesting that bacterial protein shared basic similarities in the function with the plant enzymes. DpgA also was very similar (95% ID/97% SM) to the functionally not-characterized gene product of orf27 from the biosynthetic gene cluster of the glycopeptide chloroeremomycin (30Van Wageningen A.M.A. Kirkpatrick P.N. Williams D.H. Harris B.R. Kershaw J.K. Lennard N.J. Jones M. Jones S.J.M. Solenberg P.J. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 155-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which has the same backbone as balhimycin. High similarities (45–49%) were also obtained to functionally uncharacterized sequences fromMycobacterium tuberculosis (Pks11 and Pks18) (31Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C.

Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar); these proteins are also considered as chalcone synthase-related PKSs (14Moore B.S. Hopke J.N. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 2: 35-38Google Scholar). Downstream ofdpgA the biosynthetic gene cluster of balhimycin contains three open reading frames named dpgB (654 bp),dpgC (1299 bp), and dpgD (804 bp). The start (GTG) and stop (TGA) codons of the four genes overlap with the sequence GTGA. The translational coupling suggests that these genes are arranged in an operon structure (Fig. 1). The alignment of the DpgB sequence with protein sequence data bases showed similarity (24% ID/43% SM) to an enoyl-CoA hydratase with 3-hydroxybutryl-CoA dehydratase activity from Clostridium acetobutylicum (33Boynton Z.L. Bennet G.N. Rudolph F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3015-3024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal 160 amino acid residues of DpgC revealed no similarity to described protein sequences. Its C terminus (from amino acid residue 161), however, displayed a high degree of similarity (46% ID/62% SM) to Orf6, a 3- and 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from an uncultured bacterium (34Henne A.

Lower scores of similarity (≤49% SM) were obtained to enoyl-CoA hydratases (highest score obtained for a crotonase fromThermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, accession number P97087). The alignment of DpgD resulted in a significant similarity (40% ID/54% SM) to an enoyl-CoA hydratase, as well namely, to a carnitine racemase from E. coli (35Eichler K. Bourgis F. Buchet A. Kleber H.P. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DpgB and DpgD resemble each other (32% SM). Again, very high similarities (>91% SM) were found between DpgBCD and the corresponding deduced proteins Orf28, Orf29, and Orf30 of the biosynthetic gene cluster of the glycopeptide chloroeremomycin (30Van Wageningen A.M.A. Kirkpatrick P.N.

A dpgAdeletion mutant of A. mediterranei was used to test whether the gene was necessary for balhimycin formation. We constructed an in-frame deletion because the analysis of the operon suggested a transcriptional and translational coupling (see “Discussion”). The genotype of the mutant was verified by PCR and Southern hybridization (data not shown). The mutant strainA. mediterranei VP1–2 has a 954-bp chromosomal deletion in the 1119-bp-coding region, resulting in the deletion of amino acid residues 48–365 of the DpgA protein. The balhimycin phenotype of the VP1–2 mutant strain was analyzed in a bioassay, with the glycopeptide-sensitive B. subtilis as the indicator strain. In contrast to the wild-type strain, the mutant was unable to produce a biologically active substance, demonstrating that DpgA is involved in balhimycin biosynthesis. Supplementation of the VP1–2 mutant strain with 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid restored antibiotic formation (Fig.2), indicating that this compound is either a direct intermediate of balhimycin biosynthesis or a derivative of an intermediate. Several attempts to express DpgA in E. coli yielded insoluble protein. We therefore decided to express DpgA in S. lividansT7, which contains a chromosomal copy of a thiostrepton-inducible T7-RNA polymerase gene. The bacteria were transformed with the DpgA expression plasmid pVP2, which carries the PCR-amplified coding region of dpgA downstream of the T7-promoter (details under “Experimental Procedures”). By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of S. lividans VP2, a band was detected at 39.5 kDa that corresponded to the calculated molecular mass of DpgA. This protein was absent in the control strain S. lividans VP1 (not shown). Ethyl acetate extracts of the culture filtrates were prepared and analyzed by HPLC to investigate whether the DpgA expression resulted in a changed pattern of excreted compounds. Comparison of the chromatograms revealed a new peak in the culture extract of S. lividans VP2 (Fig.3C, retention time 4.5 min) at the same position as authentic 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (Fig.3A). The identity was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis in comparison with the authentic substance. 3,5-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid biosynthesis can be explained by a PKS reaction that involves acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA as starter substrates and three condensation reactions with malonyl-CoA (Fig. 4). We used extracts from S. lividans VP2 (DpgA expression) and VP1 (control) to test whether the protein synthesized 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and whether acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA or both were used in its biosynthesis. Representative results are summarized in Fig. 5. Incubations with radioactive malonyl-CoA led to 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid formation with VP2 but not with VP1, indicating that DpgA was responsible for the activity. More importantly, the result showed that the addition of other CoA esters was not necessary. This did not exclude the possibility that residual acetyl-CoA in the extracts participated in the reaction, and therefore, a series of additional experiments were carried out to investigate that possibility. Experiments with radioactive acetyl-CoA and unlabeled malonyl-CoA led to barely detec"

In this study, we have isolated a mouse cDNA coding for a fourth isoform (a4) of V-ATPase subunit a. Isoforma4 exhibits high similarities with the a1,a2, and a3 isoforms and is expressed exclusively in kidney. Furthermore, a4 was localized immunochemically in the apical and basolateral plasma membranes of cortical α- and β-intercalated cells, respectively. These results suggest that the V-ATPase with the a4 isoform is a kidney-specific proton pump important for acid/base homeostasis. A mouse EST (expressed sequence tag) clone, 2099716 (19Suzuki Y. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Maruyama K. Suyama A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), coding for a part of thea4 isoform, was sequenced. To obtain the 5′-region of thea4 cDNA, total RNA was prepared from C57BL/6J male mouse kidneys (age, 8 weeks; Japan SLC). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was carried out using gene-specific primers, and the product was ligated with the EST clone to create a full-length cDNA for the a4 isoform. The nucleotide sequence reported in this study will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBankTM data bases with the accession numberAB050903. Northern blot analysis was carried out with multiple tissue blots (CLONTECH) as described by Toyomura et al. (7Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A probe was prepared from the cDNA clone (between +1660 and +2167 bp, numbering from the first letter of the initiation codon), and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using rediprimeTM II random prime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each filter was hybridized with the probe using ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 60 min. Genomic DNA (10 µg) from C57BL/6J mice was digested with restriction enzymes, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and then blotted onto a filter. A DNA fragment (between +792 and +1073 bp) of thea4-coding region was used to prepare a labeled probe. Hybridization was performed as described above, and radioactivity was analyzed with a BAS-1000 (Fuji Film). All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Kidney cortex (about 2.7 g) was obtained from ten ICR mice (age, 8 weeks), and suspended in 14 ml of 10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.4 containing 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (amount recommended by the Company) (Roche Diagnostics). The suspension was homogenized in a Wheaton homogenizer. The supernatant fraction, obtained by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate was suspended in 2.4 ml of PBS containing 1 mmEDTA and 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C until use. The synthetic peptide KHQKSQLQSFTIHEDAVEGDH (positions 665–685 of the a4 isoform a region, not homologous to a1, a2, or a3) was used to immunize albino rabbits for antibodies against the a4 isoform. The resulting serum was applied to a peptide-conjugated column, and antibodies were further purified using a recombinant protein-conjugated column. Antibodies against human Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (AE1) were obtained by injecting a human polypeptide (His834–Val911) into a rabbit (20Kawano Y. Okubo K. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 263: 8232-8238Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Immunoblot was carried out as described previously (7Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, kidney cortex membranes (2 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 2% octylglucoside, and 200 mm NaCl. The supernatant fraction, obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, contained solubilized V-ATPase. ICR mice (age, 8–10 weeks; Japan SLC) were anesthetized and perfused briefly with PBS, pH 7.4 and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The kidneys were removed, incubated in the same solution overnight at 4 °C, and cut transversely into 5-mm thick blocks. They were successively infiltrated with 30% sucrose in PBS, embedded in OCT compound (Miles), and stored frozen. Frozen blocks were sectioned at 4-µm thickness and mounted on MAS-coated slides (Matsunami Glass). The sections were rinsed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and incubated for 30 min with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. They were blocked with PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum and incubated at 4 °C with anti-a4 antibodies (1 µg/ml) in PBST containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After washing with PBST, the sections were further incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (VECTOR Laboratories) in PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum, and then developed using VectaStain Elite ABC reagent (VECTOR Laboratories). After washing with PBST, the sections were stained with 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.005% H2O2 in 0.05m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 1 to 2 min. The immunostained sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with Eukitt (Kindler). Renal sections were also stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peanut agglutinin (10 µg/ml) (VECTOR Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature, and mounted by PermaFluor (Shandon) after washing with PBST. The pre-embedding silver enhancement immunogold method was used, as described previously (21Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with ether and perfusion-fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). The fixed kidneys were removed and incubated for another 50 min in the same solution. Cryo sections (6 µm in thickness) were reacted with 5 µg/ml anti-a4 antibodies overnight, followed by incubation with colloidal gold (1.4-nm diameter)-conjugated secondary antibodies. The gold labeling was intensified using a silver enhancement kit (Nano Probes). Three subunit a isoforms have been identified in mouse and chicken (7Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M.

Analysis of the mouse kidney EST library (19Suzuki Y. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Maruyama K. Suyama A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) led us to identify a clone 2099716, coding for a protein highly homologous to mouse a1, a2, or a3 isoforms. The clone encoded an open reading frame of 280 amino acid residues, but apparently lacked a 5′-terminal region. The 5′-region was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from mouse kidney RNA. The entire cDNA was 3014 bp (not including polyadenylation) and contained a coding region for 833 amino acid residues with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn367and Asn489). The predicted protein exhibited 63, 54, and 48% identity with the mouse a1, a2, anda3 isoforms, respectively. A hydropathy plot of the protein suggested a structure with nine transmembrane regions (Fig.1, I-IX), i.e. similar to other isoforms. The amino-terminal domain (∼60 residues) and all transmembrane regions (except VI) of the protein were highly similar to other isoforms (a1, 74.2%; a2, 65.6%;a3, 64.6%). Mutational analysis of the yeastVPH1 gene showed 11 amino acid residues that are essential for activity, assembly, or intracellular sorting of subunit a (22Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All of them except His729(yeast numbering) were completely conserved in all mouse isoforms (Fig. 1). Replacement of His729 affects V-ATPase activity (22Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but this residue was replaced by Asn in all mouse isoforms (Fig. 1, asterisk). Based on the structure and sequence similarities, the protein encoded by the cDNA was named the a4 isoform. Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA gave a single band (Fig.2A), indicating that only one gene for a4 is present in the mouse genome.Figure 2Kidney-specific expression of the mousea4 isoform. A, genomic Southern blot analysis of the a4 isoform. Mouse genomic DNA (10 µg) was digested with various endonucleases and electrophoresed on an agarose gel.

A 3.3-kb single transcript was detectable exclusively in kidney (Fig.2 B), i.e. no signals were observed in heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, or testis even after longer exposure of the filter (data not shown). These results were consistent with the EST clone 2099716 (19Suzuki Y. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Maruyama K. Suyama A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) as isolated from the kidney library. These findings suggest that the a4 isoform is a kidney-specific subunit a. During embryonic development, thea4 gene was transcribed from 15-dpc embryos, whereas no significant signal was detectable in 7- and 11-dpc (Fig.2 B). Antibodies were generated using a synthetic peptide for immunochemical studies on the localization of the a4 isoform. The affinity-purified antibodies specifically recognized a single 94-kDa protein in a lysate of yeast cells carrying an a4 expression plasmid (Fig.2 C); i.e. they did not react with other isoforms (data not shown). The position of the band matched the molecular weight (95,603) calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. Bands corresponding to 95∼106 kDa were observed for kidney membranes (Fig.2 C), whereas no significant bands were detectable for other tissues. The multiple bands may correspond to glycosylated forms because bovine subunit a is known to acquireN-linked oligosaccharides (23Apps D.K. Percy J.M. Perez-Castineira J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The a4 isoform was detected mainly in the cortical membrane fraction of kidney (Fig.2 D). Other isoforms and subunits including subunitA that have a catalytic site were distributed equally in cortical and medullar fractions (Fig. 2 D and data not shown). Membranes were obtained from kidney cortex and treated with octylglucoside. The soluble fraction was incubated with antibodies against thea4 isoform, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. As shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 3), the precipitate contained subunit A of membrane extrinsic V1sector and the c subunit of Vo, suggesting that the a4 isoform is a component of kidney cortical V-ATPase. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to identify the renal cells expressing the a4 isoform. No significant signal was observed in glomeruli or proximal and distal convoluted tubules (Fig.4A). The a4 isoform was strongly expressed in the cortical collecting ducts (Fig.4 A) and found specifically on the apical and basolateral surfaces of certain epithelial cells (Fig. 4 B,arrowheads). The signal diffused through the cytoplasm was often observed in the cortical collecting ducts (Fig. 4 B,arrow). Two types of epithelial cells (principal and intercalated cells) are present in cortical collecting ducts (24Madsen K.M. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1-F15Crossref Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that the a4 isoform was concentrated on the apical (Fig.5A) and basolateral (Fig.5 B) surfaces of intercalated cells detected as mitochondria-rich epithelial cells (24Madsen K.M. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1-F15Crossref Google Scholar), whereas no signal was found in principal cells (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Electron microscopic localization of thea4 isoform in intercalated cells of the cortical collecting ducts.

Only a weak significant signal was detected in principal cells (C).IC, intercalated cell; PC, principal cell. The immunogold particles are detectable on the apical surface (Fig. 4) or on the basolateral (Fig. 4) of the intercalated cell (seearrows, for examples).

Scale, 1 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the cortical collecting ducts, two kinds (α and β) of intercalated cells are responsible for proton and bicarbonate secretion, respectively (8Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α and β cells have V-ATPase localized on their apical and basolateral plasma membranes, respectively (25Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2114-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Peanut lectin agglutinin (PLA) is associated with the apical membranes of rabbit β cells but not with those of α cells (26Schuster V.L. Stokes J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F203-F212PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not a specific marker in rodent, double immunostaining indicated that all intercalated cells expressing thea4 isoform at the basolateral surface were apical PLA-positive (Fig. 4 C). Electron micrographs (Fig. 5) showed that the cells expressing the a4 isoforms in the basolateral surface exhibit extensive invagination in the basolateral membranes and a few microvilli in the apical surface (Fig. 5 B). This morphology is reported to be characteristic of rat β-intercalated cells (24Madsen K.M. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1-F15Crossref Google Scholar, 27Brown D. Roth J. Orci L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: C348-C356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering both the immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy evidence, we suggest that the mouse β cells have basolateral a4 isoforms. The α cells have Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (AE1) on their basolateral membranes (28Drenckhahn D. Schluter K. Allen D.P. Bennett V. Science. 1985; 230: 1287-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All intercalated cells having the apical a4 isoform were basolateral AE1-positive, indicating that α cells have apical a4 (Fig.4 D). These results indicate that the V-ATPase with thea4 isoform is localized specifically on the apical and basolateral surfaces of α- and β-intercalated cells, respectively. The subunit a is forming the intrinsic membrane Vo sector of V-ATPase. Three a isoforms (a1, a2, and a3) were found previously in chicken, mouse, cow, and human (7Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C.

Transcripts of the a4 isoform were found in 15- and 17-dpc embryos, but not in 7- and 11-dpc embryos. The differentiation of mouse kidney proceeds after 14-dpc when primitive glomeruli are observed. At the same time, the number of collecting tubules also increases in association with the development of glomeruli (31Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, London1998: 177-181Google Scholar). Considered with the finding that the a4 isoform was expressed in collecting ducts, these observations suggest thata4 gene expression is closely related to the differentiation of renal collecting tubules. Renal intercalated cells in cortical collecting ducts have been classified into at least two cell types (α and β) (8Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Madsen K.M. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1-F15Crossref Google Scholar, 32Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev.

For acid/base homeostasis, α- and β-intercalated cells are thought to be involved in proton and bicarbonate secretion, respectively (8Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The α cells express V-ATPase on their apical membranes and AE1 on their basolateral membranes (8Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Drenckhahn D.

Physiol. 1991; 260: F506-517PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the V-ATPase with the a4 isoform is required for apical proton secretion in α cells. On the other hand, β cells are thought to be mirror images of α-intercalated cells, with apical Cl−/HCO3− exchanger and basolateral V-ATPase (8Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As described above, a4 was clearly detectable on the β cell basolateral membrane. A new Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (AE4) was recently been found in the apical surface of β cells (33Tsuganezawa H. Kobayashi K. Iyori M. Araki T. Koizumi A. Watanabe S. Kaneko A. Fukao T. Monkawa T. Yoshida T. Kim D. Kanai Y. Endou H. Hayashi M. Saruta T. J. Biol.

Smith et al. (34Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have reported recently that the mutations in the human ATP6N1B gene cause recessive distal renal tubular acidosis. The ATP6N1B gene product is highly expressed in kidney and exhibits 85.8% identity with the mousea4 isoform, suggesting that the ATP6N1B gene codes for a human counterpart of the mouse a4 isoform (Fig.1). The ATP6N1B product has been suggested to be present on the apical surface of intercalated cells in cortical collecting ducts. In contrast, the mouse a4 isoform was clearly detectable not only on the apical surface of α-intercalated cells but also on the basolateral surface of β cells, implying that human a4 may be also present on the basolateral surface of β cells. Two isoforms (B1 and B2) of subunit Bhave been identified in the mammalian V-ATPases V1 sector (35Nelson R.D. Guo X.L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1994047748,"Cutaneous sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, while those innervating muscle stretch receptors project to the ventral horn. DRG11, a paired homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed in both the developing dorsal horn and in sensory neurons, but not in the ventral spinal cord. Mouse embryos deficient in DRG11 display abnormalities in the spatio-temporal patterning of cutaneous sensory afferent fiber projections to the dorsal, but not the ventral spinal cord, as well as defects in dorsal horn morphogenesis. These early developmental abnormalities lead, in adults, to significantly attenuated sensitivity to noxious stimuli. In contrast, locomotion and sensori-motor functions appear normal. Drg11 is thus required for the formation of spatio-temporally appropriate projections from nociceptive sensory neurons to their central targets in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2042881415,"Considerable controversy exists in determining the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) in obesity. Two purebred congenic strains of PPARα-null mice were developed to study the role of this receptor in modulating lipid transport and storage. Weight gain and average body weight in wild-type and PPARα-null mice on either an Sv/129 or a C57BL/6N background were not markedly different between genotypes from 3 to 9 months of age. However, gonadal adipose stores were significantly greater in both strains of male and female PPARα-null mice. Hepatic accumulation of lipids was greater in both strains and sexes of PPARα-null mice compared with wild-type controls. Administration of the peroxisome proliferator WY-14643 caused hepatomegaly, alterations in mRNAs encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, and reduced serum triglycerides in a PPARα-dependent mechanism. Constitutive differences in serum cholesterol and triglycerides in PPARα-null mice were found between genetic backgrounds. Results from this work establish that PPARα is a critical modulator of lipid homeostasis in two congenic mouse lines. This study demonstrates that disruption of the murine gene encoding PPARα results in significant alterations in constitutive serum, hepatic, and adipose tissue lipid metabolism.

Administration of peroxisome proliferators to rodents results in numerous hepatic alterations, including an increase in the number and size of peroxisomes; hepatomegaly; increased expression of genes encoding peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and microsomal fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes; and subsequent modulation of lipid homeostasis characterized by increased oxidation of fatty acids, decreased serum lipids, and reduced adipose stores (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). All of these effects are mediated by PPARα1 since PPARα-null mice are refractory to these changes when administered the prototypical peroxisome proliferator WY-14643 (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J.

In addition to modulation of lipid metabolism induced by peroxisome proliferators, a central role for PPARα in lipid homeostasis during periods of fasting and in response to dietary fatty acids has also been established (6Leone T.C.

Thus, it is clear that PPARα regulates lipid homeostasis in response to treatment with peroxisome proliferators, dietary fatty acids, and possibly endogenous fatty acids released during fasting.

However, due to the strategy used to generate PPARα-null mice (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar), backcrossing to the C57BL/6N background requires backcrossing mice at least 10 generations to obtain a fully congenic mouse line (47Papaioannou V. Johnson R. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 106-146Google Scholar). The construction of the PPARα-null mouse used recombinant DNA and cells from two strains of mice, Sv/129 Jae and C57BL/6N (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). For the PPARα-null mouse line, the Sv/129 mouse was the source of the genomic DNA library used to construct a targeting vector and the embryonic stem cells used for transfection of a targeting vector, whereas the C57BL/6N mouse (NIH substrain) was the source of donor blastocysts used for microinjecting the heterozygous embryonic stem cells. Thus, the F1 offspring from mating the chimeric mice generated by this approach were not congenic, but contained the genetic background of both Sv/129 and C57BL/6N mice. Although many published phenotypes for the PPARα-null mouse have been reported that have significant influence on lipid metabolism, many of these reports focused on mice that were either of mixed genetic background or congenic Sv/129 mice. In this work, the phenotypic characterization of lipid metabolism in wild-type or PPARα-null mice on either a pure Sv/129 or C57BL/6N genetic background was performed in both male and female mice to determine if the phenotype is consistent between congenic mouse lines. Male chimeric mice for the targeted PPARα allele (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) were bred with Sv/129 Jae females since this line is the same genotype as the embryonic stem cells used to generate the chimeric mice. The heterozygous F1agoutioffspring from this breeding were subsequently crossed using brother-sister matings to obtain F2 purebred wild-type or PPARα-null mice. The homozygous F2 wild-type or PPARα-null mice were used to generate F3 homozygotes, which were then randomly assigned to breeding cages to establish a larger colony of mice to perform experiments. The Sv/129 mice used for this work were from the F6 generation of mice from this colony. The male chimeras described above were mated with purebred C57BL/6N females to obtain F1offspring. The heterozygous F1agouti offspring from this breeding were then backcrossed with purebred C57BL/6N mice (either heterozygous male × wild-type female or heterozygous female × wild-type male). The heterozygous F2offspring with black coat color were then removed and backcrossed with either male or female wild-type mice, and this process was continued until the F10 generation of mice was obtained. Heterozygous F10 mice were then crossed to produce homozygous wild-type or PPARα-null mice, and the homozygous F11 mice were randomly distributed to make a breeding colony of mice to obtain F12 mice for phenotypic analysis. 4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthioacetic acid (WY-14643) was purchased commercially (ChemSyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa, KS). Pelleted mouse chow containing either 0.0 (control) or 0.1% WY-14643 (Bioserv, Frenchtown, NJ) was prepared and provided to mice ad libitum. 6–8-week-old male or female PPARα+/+ or PPARα−/− mice on either a C57BL/6N (F12generation) or an Sv/129 (F6 generation) background were housed four to five animals per cage in a temperature- and light-controlled environment (T = 25 °C, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle). Mice were weighed every month for 9 months. Cohorts of mice were killed at the age of 12–14 weeks or 9 months by overexposure to carbon dioxide. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture for isolation of serum. Serum analysis of lipids and lipoproteins was performed as described below. Liver and gonadal fat pads were removed, weighed, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. An additional section of liver was fixed in phosphate-buffered formaldehyde for analysis of liver lipid accumulation as previously described (48Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). 10–12-week-old male or female PPARα+/+ or PPARα−/− mice on either a pure C57BL/6N (F12 generation) or an Sv/129 (F6 generation) background were housed three to five animals per cage as described above. Mice from both strains were fed either a control diet or one containing 0.1% WY-14643 for 7 days. Mice were killed by overexposure to carbon dioxide, and livers were removed, weighed, and snap-frozen until further use. Serum was obtained from whole blood collected from individual mice and used fresh for analysis of serum lipids and lipoproteins. Gonadal adipose was removed, and the weight was recorded for each mouse. Serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured as previously described (48Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J.

Monthly body weight measurements revealed small differences in average body weight between wild-type and PPARα-null mice on either the Sv/129 or C57BL/6N background (Fig.1). Body weight was significantly higher in male PPARα-null mice on an Sv/129 background compared with the respective wild-type controls at 3–4 months of age (Fig. 1). Although average body weight tended to be higher in male and female PPARα-null mice on both genetic backgrounds, these differences were not statistically different (Fig. 1). Liver weights were similar between PPARα-null and wild-type mice of both sexes compared with the respective controls (Tables I and II). Although liver weights were not significantly different between genotypes, hepatic accumulation of lipids was considerably higher in the livers of male PPARα-null mice of both strains after 6 months (Fig. 2). Similar results were observed with female mice (data not shown). PPARα-null mice had significantly larger gonadal adipose stores than the respective wild-type controls, and this effect was slightly more pronounced in female PPARα-null mice compared with male mice (Tables I and II). Although internal adipose stores were significantly greater in PPARα-null mice than in controls, the overall sizes of 7–8-month-old male and female wild-type and PPARα-null mice were not markedly different on either an Sv/129 or a C57BL/6N background (Fig.3).Table IBody, liver, and gonadal adipose weights in male or female wild-type (+/+) or PPARα-null (−/−) mice on either an Sv/129 or a C57BL/6N genetic backgroundGenotypeSexTreatment groupnBWLiverAdiposegggC57BL/6N+/+MControl1024 ± 11.1 ± 0.10.43 ± 0.04(4.5 ± 0.1%)(1.8 ± 0.1%)+/+MWY621 ± 11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).2.1 ± 0.11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).0.17 ± 0.011-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(9.9 ± 0.5%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(0.8 ± 0.1%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−MControl1025 ± 11.1 ± 0.10.67 ± 0.031-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(4.4 ± 0.1%)(2.7 ± 0.1%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−MWY525 ± 11.2 ± 0.10.72 ± 0.051-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(4.5 ± 0.2%)(2.8 ± 0.2%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).+/+FControl920 ± 10.99 ± 0.10.24 ± 0.03(4.9 ± 0.2%)(1.2 ± 0.1%)+/+FWY617 ± 11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).1.8 ± 0.11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).0.07 ± 0.021-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(10.4 ± 0.4%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(0.4 ± 0.1%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−FControl1022 ± 11.1 ± 0.10.67 ± 0.031-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(5.1 ± 0.2%)(3.1 ± 0.2%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−FWY521 ± 11.1 ± 0.10.58 ± 0.101-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(5.1 ± 0.1%)(2.8 ± 0.4%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).Sv/129+/+MControl1026 ± 11.1 ± 0.10.50 ± 0.03(4.3 ± 0.1%)(1.9 ± 0.1%)+/+MWY1022 ± 11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).1.9 ± 0.11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).0.14 ± 0.031-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(8.7 ± 0.3%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(0.7 ± 0.1%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−MControl1027 ± 11.2 ± 0.10.65 ± 0.041-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(4.2 ± 0.1%)(2.4 ± 0.1%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−MWY1028 ± 11.2 ± 0.10.60 ± 0.051-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(4.3 ± 0.2%)(2.2 ± 0.1%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).+/+FControl522 ± 11.2 ± 0.10.32 ± 0.02(5.2 ± 0.2%)(1.5 ± 0.1%)+/+FWY520 ± 12.0 ± 0.11-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).0.09 ± 0.041-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(10.8 ± 0.6%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(0.5 ± 0.2%)1-aSignificantly different from wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−FControl523 ± 10.9 ± 0.10.41 ± 0.031-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(3.9 ± 0.3%)(1.8 ± 0.1%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).−/−FWY522 ± 10.7 ± 0.10.43 ± 0.061-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).(3.3 ± 0.1%)(1.9 ± 0.2%)1-bSignificantly different from control and WY-14643-treated wild-type controls (p < 0.05).Treatment group indicates a control or WY-14643 (WY) diet.n, number of mice examined; BW, body weight.

Liver and gonadal adipose weights are expressed as grams and relative to body weight ((grams of adipose/g of body weight) × 100). Serum concentrations of cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher in 9-month-old purebred Sv/129 PPARα-null mice than in wild-type controls (TableII). This effect was observed in both male and female mice, with no apparent difference in the magnitude of these effects (Table II). Serum levels of triglycerides were similar in Sv/129 PPARα-null and wild-type mice (Table II). Serum concentrations of cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar in 9-month-old purebred C57BL/6N PPARα-null mice and wild-type controls (Table II). This was observed in both male and female mice (Table II). In contrast to Sv/129 mice, serum levels of triglycerides were significantly higher in both male and female PPARα-null mice compared with the respective wild-type controls (Table II). Constitutive hepatic levels of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes (very long chain and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases) were significantly lower in both C57BL/6N and Sv/129 PPARα-null mice of both sexes compared with wild-type controls (Fig.4), consistent with previous results (5Aoyama A.

Constitutive hepatic levels of apoC-III were not different between genotypes or sexes in either the C57BL/6N or Sv/129 mouse strain (Fig.4). Similarly, constitutive hepatic levels of mRNA encoding PPARγ were not different between either genotype in both strains and sexes of mice (Fig. 4). Liver weight was significantly higher in male and female wild-type mice fed WY-14643 compared with controls in both C57BL/6N and Sv/129 mice, and this effect was not different between strains (Table I). In contrast, liver weight was not different between male and female null mice compared with controls, and again there was no difference in this effect between C57BL/6N and Sv/129 mice (Table I). Consistent with previous studies, gonadal adipose stores were significantly lower in male and female wild-type mice fed WY-14643 for 1 week compared with controls, and this effect was not found in either strain of PPARα-null mice fed WY-14643 (TableI). Administration of WY-14643 to mice caused a significant decrease in serum triglycerides in both strains of purebred wild-type mice compared with untreated controls (Table II). Hepatic levels of mRNAs encoding acyl-CoA oxidase; bifunctional enzyme; 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; cytochrome P450 4A1; and very long chain, long chain, and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases were higher in wild-type mice fed WY-14643 than in controls, and these effects were not different between wild-type C57BL/6N and Sv/129 mice of both sexes (Fig. 4). The PPARα-null mice were refractory to increased levels of these mRNAs, and there was no difference in this effect between strains (Fig. 4). Hepatic mRNA for apoC-III was reduced in wild-type mice fed WY-14643 compared with controls (Fig. 4), and this effect was absent in both strains and sexes of the PPARα-null mice. The original phenotypic assessment of PPARα-null mice on a mixed genetic background (C57BL/6N × Sv/129) provided strong in vivo evidence that PPARα mediates the pleiotropic response to peroxisome proliferators, including hepatomegaly, peroxisome proliferation, and induction of genes encoding peroxisomal and microsomal lipid-metabolizing enzymes (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Although constitutive expression of peroxisomal and microsomal lipid-metabolizing enzymes was not influenced by targeted disruption of the PPARα gene, hepatic accumulation of lipids was described in PPARα-null mice, suggesting that constitutive lipid homeostasis is altered in the absence of a functional PPARα (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Evidence that constitutive gene expression is altered in PPARα-null mice on an Sv/129 background was provided by the report that mRNAs encoding mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes are reduced compared with wild-type mice, whereas constitutive expression of mRNAs encoding peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes is unaffected (5Aoyama A.

This study also confirmed that many of the observations made in mixed background PPARα-null mice are consistently found in purebred Sv/129 mice, including an absence of peroxisome proliferator-induced hepatomegaly and induction of mRNAs encoding peroxisomal and microsomal lipid-metabolizing enzymes (5Aoyama A.

This suggests that hepatic lipid accumulation found in PPARα-null mice may be the result of reduced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Results from the present study confirm and extend this characterization by demonstrating that male and female C57BL/6N PPARα-null mice are refractory to the pleiotropic response induced by peroxisome proliferators and that constitutive hepatic lipid accumulation occurs as previously described. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that this response is similar between male and female PPARα-null mice on either a pure Sv/129 or C57BL/6N genetic background. Serum lipids in mixed background PPARα-null mice were also reported to be altered compared with wild-type controls. PPARα-null mice on a mixed genetic background exhibit significantly higher serum levels of cholesterol, in particular high density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with wild-type controls (4Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Similar results were found in this study in both male and female PPARα-null mice on a pure Sv/129 genetic background, consistent with the observations made in mixed background mice. In contrast, higher levels of serum cholesterol were not found, whereas serum levels of triglycerides were significantly higher than controls in both male and female PPARα-null mice on a C57BL/6N background. These results suggest that the genetic background of the PPARα-null mouse can significantly influence serum lipid biochemistry, likely through interactions with other genes. The mechanisms underlying this difference are unclear. Nevertheless, purebred Sv/129 and C57BL/6N PPARα-null mice provide unique tools for studies investigating the role of altered serum cholesterol and triglycerides in the etiology of atherosclerosis. The C57BL/6 mouse strain is better suited for evaluating the mechanisms contributing to atherosclerosis since atherosclerotic plaques can be induced by feeding a high fat diet (49Rubin E.M. Krauss R.M. Spangler E.A. Verstuyft J.G. Clift S.M. Nature. 1991; 353: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 50Shimano H. Ohsuga J. Shimada M. Namba Y. Gotoda T. Harada K. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, the PPARα-null mouse line on a C57BL/6N genetic background may be well suited for this purpose since constitutively higher levels of lipids are a known risk factor for this disease (51Assmann G. Cullen P. Jossa F. Lewis B. Mancini M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1819-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As PPARα-null mice exhibit significant lipid accumulation that may be due in part to impaired mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids, it is not surprising that adipose stores are significantly greater in this mouse line as well. Although it is clear from these results that purebred PPARα-null mice on a pure Sv/129 or C57BL/6N genetic background have larger stores of adipose and accumulate lipids in the liver, differences in body weight are not of sufficient magnitude to be indicative of an obese phenotype. In the original mixed background PPARα-null mouse line, it was noted that adipose stores were significantly greater than controls with little difference in overall body weight (52Gonzalez F.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 422: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar reports of PPARα-null mice on an Sv/129 background are consistent with this observation in that large differences in body weight were not found even in male mice that are >1-year-old (26Nakajima T. Kamijo Y. Usuda N. Liang Y. Fukushima Y. Kametani K. Gonzalez F.J. Aoyama T. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Conflicting reports suggest that this phenotype may be influenced by other factors, including diet and genetics. Costet et al. (42Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) provided evidence suggesting that the PPARα-null mouse may be a useful model to study obesity and that this phenotype is more prevalent in female mice than in male mice. In contrast to results presented in the present study, these investigators reported that body weight of PPARα-null mice is significantly greater than controls in both sexes after 7 months of age. Consistent with previous work (4Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and the present study, alterations in serum lipids, adipose stores, and hepatic lipid accumulation were also detected in PPARα-null mice compared with controls (42Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The difference in body weight between male and female PPARα-null mice was attributed in part to differences in hepatic PPARγ expression and differences in hepatic lipid accumulation (42Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar); however, these changes were not detected in the present study. It is critical to emphasize that the genetic background of the PPARα-null mice used for the analysis performed by Costet et al. (42Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) is unclear, as the substrain of the C57BL/6 mouse used for backcrossing was not identified, and the extent of backcrossing described (<10 generations) theoretically would not result in a congenic line of mice. Thus, the congenic control C57BL/6 mice of unknown substrain used for controls are likely inappropriate and may have resulted in incorrect comparisons. Indeed, significant differences in the functional properties of another xenobiotic receptor (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) are known to exist between C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J mouse lines (53Poland A. Palen D. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 915-921PubMed Google Scholar, 54Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 306-312PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating the importance of backcrossing mice with the identical line used for blastocyst transfer in this case. Differences in control mouse chow may also have contributed to the difference in body weight observed in PPARα-null mice between the present study and that of Costet et al. (42Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), although the percentage of fat was similar (4.5%), suggesting that the genetic background is more likely a confounding variable in this work. That dietary fatty acids may influence the phenotype of PPARα-null mice is also suggested by another report showing that purebred Sv/129 PPARα-null mice have larger adipose stores than controls (29Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In contrast to data presented in this study and that of Costet et al. (42Costet P. Legendre C. More J. Edgar A. Galtier P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29577-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), these investigators reported that gonadal adipose stores and average body weight were greater in male PPARα-null mice compared with female PPARα-null mice (29Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Although increased adipose stores and body weight in PPARα-null mice are consistent with this work, the fact that male PPARα-null mice on an Sv/129 background were reported to have larger adipose stores than female mice (29Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) illustrates how significant variation can occur between laboratories using an identical mouse line. The most likely explanation for this difference is the source of fat used for the control diet, which can significantly influence lipid metabolism in these mice (7Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Given the conflicting accounts of phenotypes for the PPARα-null mouse lines with respect to obesity, it is critical that investigators indicate the source of fat used for control and experimental diets in the future and the strain of congenic mouse used for analysis. This study provides details of the backcrossing performed at the National Institutes of Health with the original line of mice, which to date has been the sole source for distribution of PPARα-null mice to independent investigators."

We present Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations of the line of sight to the quasar HE2347-4342 in the 1000 to 1187 angstrom band at a resolving power of 15,000. We resolve the He II Lyman alpha (Lyalpha) absorption as a discrete forest of absorption lines in the redshift range 2.3 to 2.7. About 50 percent of these features have H I counterparts with column densities N(H I) > 10(12.3) per square centimeter that account for most of the observed opacity in He II Lyalpha. The He II to H I column density ratio ranges from 1 to >1000, with an average of approximately 80. Ratios of <100 are consistent with photoionization of the absorbing gas by a hard ionizing spectrum resulting from the integrated light of quasars, but ratios of >100 in many locations indicate additional contributions from starburst galaxies or heavily filtered quasar radiation. The presence of He II Lyalpha absorbers with no H I counterparts indicates that structure is present even in low-density regions, consistent with theoretical predictions of structure formation through gravitational instability."

The dissimilar organization, gene content, and regulation of the X and Y chromosomes are thought to reflect selective forces acting on original pairs of identical chromosomes (1-3).

ASK1 sequestered Daxx in the cytoplasm and inhibited the repressive activity of Daxx in transcription. In addition, Daxx was bound to the activated Fas only in the presence of ASK1, accelerating the Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that Daxx requires ASK1 for its cytoplasmic localization and Fas-mediated signaling.

Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Upon cellular activation by Fas ligand, the ligated Fas forms death-induced signal complex (DISC)1 composed of Fas, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), and caspase-8 (2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6293) Google Scholar, 3Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Recruitment of procaspase-8 to DISC leads to its proteolytic activation initiating a cascade of caspase activation that finally induces apoptosis. The activated Casp-8 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of Bcl-2 interacting protein (BID) that initiates cytochrome crelease in the mitochondria (4Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome ctriggers the formation of a complex containing Apaf1 and procaspase-9, which is then autocleaved to process the downstream effector procaspases such as caspase-3 (5Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6257) Google Scholar). The processing of these caspases is followed by the cleavage of apoptotic substrates, leading to the disruption of important cellular processes, changes in cellular and nuclear morphology, and ultimately to cell death (2Hengartner M.O.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). In addition to caspase activation cascade, Fas ligation initiates the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) (6Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 7Ko Y.-G. Kim E.-K. Kim T. Park H. Park H.-S. Choi E.-J. Kim S J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6030-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After Fas ligation, Fas recruits an adaptor protein called Daxx that interacts with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activating JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK by phosphorylation (8Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 9Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijde P.T. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. MIyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). The death domain of Fas interacts with Daxx, not competing with FADD (10Chang H.Y. Yang X. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of Daxx sensitizes the Fas-mediated apoptosis, it is tempting to speculate that Daxx is an adaptor protein for Fas-mediated apoptosis (6Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). However, the role of Daxx as an adaptor linking ASK1 to Fas has been challenged because Daxx has not been localized in the cytoplasm but detected mainly in the nucleus, interacting with nuclear proteins such as centromeric protein (CENP-C), Pax3, and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) (11Li J.

The nuclear Daxx represses transcription possibly by recruiting histone deacetylase (11Li J. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.-J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It is finally thought that the Daxx-ASK1-JNK pathway would not be essential for Fas-mediated apoptosis because the Daxx-disrupted mice are embryonic lethal with extensive apoptosis (16Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and JNK1/2-disrupted mice show no inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis (17Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Despite the results from Daxx-disrupted mice, Daxx might be an important proapoptotic molecule because it induces cell cycle arrest and cell death and sensitizes Fas-mediated apoptosis (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang A. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We suspected that Daxx might play a diverse role in apoptosis depending on its cellular localization and cell type. To solve the seemingly paradoxical and discrepant results for the role of Daxx, we investigated whether the cellular localization and function of Daxx can be controlled by its interacting kinase, ASK1. The data of this work showed how the cellular localization of Daxx may be controlled and thus finally give a clear solution to the controversy on the cellular location and function of Daxx. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA), -ASK1, -Daxx, and -Fas antibodies for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-JNK/SAPK antibody was from New England Biolabs. Anti-Fas antibody for Fas ligation was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Plasmids for pcDNA-Myc-Daxx, and -Fas were generous gifts from Dr. D. Baltimore (California Institute of Technology). Plasmids for pcDNA-HA-ASK1 and -FLAG-ASK1(K709R) were from Dr. H. Ichijo (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). Gal4-tk-luciferase and Gal4-Daxx were generous gifts from Dr. R. Evans (Salk Lake Institute), and tk-β-galactosidase was from Dr. D. Moore (Baylor University Medical School). 100-mm dishes of 293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 12 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 µg/ml aprotinin. ASK1 or Fas in the cell lysate was reacted with the indicated primary antibody (5 µg) at 4 °C for 1 h. After addition of 50 µl of protein A-agarose, the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for an additional 4 h. The beads were washed four times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The precipitated proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated primary antibodies. The kinase activity of ASK1 was determined as described previously (7Ko Y.-G. Kim E.-K. Kim T. Park H. Park H.-S. Choi E.-J. Kim S J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6030-6036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For Gal4-tk-luciferase reporter gene assay, 293 cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids, Gal4-tk-luciferase (50 ng), and tk-β-galactosidase (50 ng). After an incubation of 24 h, cells were lysed in 150 µl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 µl of the lysate was assayed in a Luminometer (MicrolumatPlus, EG&G) with a luciferase and β-galactosidase assay system (Promega). Cellular localizations of Daxx and HA-ASK1 were investigated using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (µ Radiance, Bio-Rad). The cells were grown to about 60% confluency on 5 × 5-mm coverslips and then transfected for 24 h with the indicated plasmids. The immunofluorescence procedure was previously described (19Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 293 cells grown in 6-well plate were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids and 0.5 µg of pcDNA-EGFP. Total amount of the transfected DNA was adjusted to be the same with pcDNA3. The transfected cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 24 h after transfection, and then the cell death was determined by counting the apoptotic nuclei using fluorescence microscopy. Endo- and exogenous Daxx has been found in the nucleus, especially in the discrete nuclear structures known as PML oncogenic domains (PODs) (11Li J. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.-J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar,12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 14Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Since Daxx induces apoptosis only when it is localized to PODs, it is thought that Daxx would mediate apoptosis in the nucleus (14Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It associates, however, with membrane-bound Fas and cytoplasmic ASK1 to transduce Fas-induced apoptosis signal (6Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 8Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In this case, Daxx should be localized in the cytoplasm. To address this paradoxical issue, we reinvestigated subcellular localization of Daxx by immunostaining with anti-Daxx antibody after transient expression of Daxx alone or both of Daxx and HA-ASK1 in 293 cells. Daxx was predominantly found in the nucleus with a diffused pattern when only Daxx was expressed. The diffused staining pattern instead of speckled nuclear pattern in the nucleus was previously observed in 293 cells (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, Daxx localization was changed to the cytoplasm when Daxx and ASK1 were co-overexpressed, suggesting that ASK1 could trap Daxx in the cytoplasm. On the contrary, the cytoplasmic localization of ASK1 was not affected by the expression of Daxx (Fig.1A). Since Torii et al. (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) were unable to demonstrate the interaction of Daxx with ASK1 and did not detect the effect of Daxx on the JNK activation or on the ASK1 kinase activity in 293 cells, we reinvestigated the molecular interaction of Daxx and ASK1. HA-tagged ASK1 was co-expressed with Daxx in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-Daxx antibodies. The immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Daxx or anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, ASK1 was associated with Daxx. The molecular interaction between ASK1 and Daxx was specific because the interaction was not detected by immunoprecipitation with mock IgG antibody. To investigate the effect of Daxx on the ASK1 activity, immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibody were subjected to a kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate of ASK1. ASK1 was strongly activated by Daxx (Fig. 1C), supporting the previous results shown by Chang et al. (8Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Daxx is known to control basal transcription (11Li J. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.-J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 13Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. Mcpherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus the repression of basal transcription by Daxx could be abolished if expression of ASK1 is increased because Daxx bound to ASK1 would be sequestered in the cytoplasm. To explore this possibility, we tested whether ASK1 regulates transcriptional control by Daxx. Expression of the Gal4DBD (DNA-binding domain) fused to the full-length Daxx (Gal4-Daxx) strongly inhibited the basal transcription of the Gal4-tk-luciferase reporter in 293 cells (Fig.2). However, the repressive effect of Gal4-Daxx was abolished by the co-expression of ASK1. Thus, this result further supports the cytoplasmic interaction of ASK1 and Daxx observed by immunostaining (Fig. 1A). Daxx has been demonstrated to be a mediator recruiting ASK1 to Fas after Fas ligation, but the interaction between Daxx and Fas has not been observed in the cells overexpressing Daxx and Fas (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Based on the data above, we thought that Daxx is not available for the association with Fas if it is located in the nucleus. Daxx could interact, however, with Fas if it is trapped in the cytoplasm associated with ASK1. To test this hypothesis, we transfected 293 cells with Daxx alone, ASK1 alone, or both of Daxx and ASK1 and investigated the molecular interaction of Fas and Daxx after Fas ligation. As shown in Fig.3, Daxx was recruited to Fas in the cells co-expressing both of Daxx and ASK1 whereas it was not in the cells expressing either one of the two proteins, suggesting that the molecular interaction between Daxx and Fas requires ASK1. We then tested the role of Daxx in recruiting ASK1 to Fas after Fas ligation. As shown in Fig. 3, more ASK1 was recruited to Fas after Fas ligation in the cells with Daxx and ASK1 than in the cells with ASK1 alone, implying that Daxx is a mediator for helping the recruitment of ASK1 to Fas after Fas ligation. Since cytoplasmic Daxx and ASK1 are recruited to Fas after Fas ligation, it is likely that co-overexpression of Daxx and ASK1 accelerates Fas-mediated apoptosis. To address this issue, we transiently expressed Daxx and ASK1 with different combinations into 293 cells and treated them with anti-Fas antibody to induce apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4, Daxx or ASK1 alone did not increase the Fas-mediated apoptosis compared with control. Unlike other report showing that Daxx increases Fas-mediated apoptosis in HT1080 (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), apoptosis of 293 cells was not increased by the expression of Daxx alone. The discrepant results could reflect that apoptosis depends on the cell type and culture condition. In this regard, it is worth noting that difference in the nuclear localization of Daxx in 293 cells (Fig. 1A) from those reported in other cell types (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 15Pluta A.F. Earnshaw W.C. Goldberg I.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the localization of Daxx into PODs is required for Daxx-mediated apoptosis (14Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Daxx was not found in the PODs in the case of 293 cells, Daxx alone could not accelerate the Fas-mediated apoptosis of 293 cells. On the contrary to the effect of Daxx or ASK1 on the Fas-mediated apoptosis, co-expression of Daxx and ASK1 increased the apoptosis, suggesting that Daxx requires ASK1 for cytoplasmic localization and acceleration of the Fas-mediated apoptosis. We also showed that ASK1 was necessary for the Fas-mediated apoptosis by transient expression of dominant negative ASK1, ASK1(K709R) (Fig.4), consistent with previous works (8Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Since ASK1(K709R) completely abolished Fas-mediated apoptosis, it is possible that ASK1(K709R) may be defective in the interaction with Daxx and thus can not control the cytoplasmic localization of Daxx. To address this issue, we investigated the localization of Daxx after transient expression of Daxx and ASK1(K709R). As shown in Fig.5A, Daxx was found in the cytoplasm when it was co-expressed with ASK1(K709R), suggesting that ASK1(K709R) could also recruit Daxx to the cytoplasm like its wild type. We also tested whether Daxx is recruited to the activated Fas in the presence of ASK1(K709R). Fig. 5B demonstrated that Daxx and ASK1(K709R) were recruited to Fas. With all of these data, we conclude that ASK1(K709R) can still control cytoplasmic localization of Daxx and then be recruited to Fas with Daxx. Thus, the inactivity of ASK1(K709R) results from its inability to activate its downstream effector molecules. Taken together, we concluded that Daxx requires ASK1 for its cytoplasmic localization and the molecular interaction with the activated Fas to mediate apoptosis signal. Since ASK1 also prevents the transcriptional role of Daxx (Fig. 2), ASK1 could switch the function of Daxx from the regulation of nuclear transcription to the cytoplasmic apoptosis. Even though the Daxx-disrupted mice show an apoptosis in embryonic stages, arguing against a role for Daxx in promoting Fas-induced cell death and suggesting that Daxx either directly or indirectly suppresses apoptosis in early embryo (16Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), many other groups showed that Daxx is really involved in apoptosis induction. For example, transient expression of Daxx increases Fas-induced apoptosis in 293, HeLa, L929, and HT1080 (6Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and a dominant negative form of Daxx (DaxxC) abrogates Fas-induced apoptosis (12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Daxx up-regulated by interferon could be a major protein to induce apoptosis because Daxx antisense oligonucleotides rescue the interferon-treated pro-B cells from apoptosis (18Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang A. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of these data demonstrated the significant role of Daxx in apoptosis induction, and our data also demonstrated that co-expression of ASK1 with Daxx augmented this process in 293 cells (Fig. 4), indicating their functional linkage. Since Daxx was shown to interact with diverse nuclear proteins such as PML, CENP-C, and Pax-3 (11Li J. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.-J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 13Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. Mcpherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the physiological role of Daxx would be more complex than what we currently know. That is why it is so important how the cellular localization and function of Daxx can be controlled and we have clearly shown that Daxx can be trapped by ASK1 in the cytoplasm to mediate Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1). To mediate Fas signaling, Daxx should be in the cytoplasm. Our data demonstrated that ASK1 controls the cytoplasmic localization of Daxx (Fig. 1). Recruitment of Daxx to Fas and Fas-mediated apoptosis is accelerated only when Daxx is in the cytoplasm with the help of ASK1 (Figs. 3 and 4). These whole data clearly show that the cytoplasmic localization of Daxx is necessary for Fas-mediated apoptosis. Landry and co-workers also showed that Daxx could be translocated to the cytoplasm from the nucleus after Fas ligation (20Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). When translocation of Daxx to the cytoplasm is inhibited by Hsp27, Fas-mediated apoptosis is decreased, suggesting that cytoplasmic retention of Daxx is important for Fas-mediated apoptosis. The expression level of ASK1 is varied spatiotemporally in developing mouse (21Tobiume K. Inage T. Takeda K. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For instance, ASK1 is highly expressed in suprabasal layer of epidermis and hypertrophic region of cartilage primordium of nucleus pulposus and vertebrate body, in which apoptotic cell death is implicated for the renewal of developing skin and the remodeling of cartilage and bone, respectively (21Tobiume K. Inage T. Takeda K. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, ASK1 is up-regulated during keratinocyte differentiation (22Sayama K. Hanakawa Y. Shirakata Y. Yamasaki K. Sawada Y. Sun L. Yamanishi K. Ichijo H. Hashimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 999-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The variation of the ASK1 level in specific developmental stages and tissues may play an important role in controlling the cellular function of Daxx. ASK1 plays a pivotal role in apoptosis because its overexpression induces apoptosis and its kinase-inactive mutant prevents the TNF-, Fas-, and Daxx-meditated apoptosis (8Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 9Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. Dijde P.T. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. MIyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). ASK1 is negatively regulated by glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, thioredoxin, glutathioneS-transferase Mu, 14–3-3, Akt, p21Cip1/WAF1, or HIV-1 Nef (7Ko Y.-G. Kim E.-K. Kim T. Park H. Park H.-S. Choi E.-J.

It is also responsible for vectorial H+ transport across the cell surface of specialized epithelia at several sites including bone and the distal nephron (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The general structure of the pump comprises a V1 “head” and a V0 “stalk.” V1 hydrolyzes ATP, providing the energy for H+transport across the membrane-anchored V0 domain. The complete identity of all of the pump components has yet to be elucidated, but there are at least 13 different subunits. The V1 domain comprises subunits A–H, whereas V0includes subunits a, d, c, c′, and c"". A number of subunits have been shown to have multiple isoforms in a variety of species (2Oka T. Yamamoto R.

The resulting 2.7-kb product was cloned into the TA vector pGEM®-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two clones from each of two cDNA preparations were sequenced using ABI Prism® BigDye™ Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems) employing primers designed from available mouse expressed sequence tags. Clustal alignment of murine a1–a4 proteins with human ATP6N1B was performed and percent identity determined by Belvu using the Blosum 62 algorithm. 3The hyperlinks used are: Belvu, www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Registered/Option/belvu.html; Clustal, www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Registered/Option/clustal.html; GenBank™, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html; Map Manager, mapmgr.roswellpark.org/mapmgr.html; and TMpred, www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a Clustal alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of a-subunit family members from both higher and lower eukaryotes. Genetic distances, computed by PAUP 4.0 Beta version 8 using the neighbor-joining algorithm and with Saccharomyces cerevisiae vph1p chosen as an outgroup, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The Atp6n1b gene was mapped by genotyping 57 progeny of a (B10×NOD)F1 × B10 backcross using the single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 14 (Table II). Primary PCR, using genomic DNA from backcross mice as template, was carried out with the primers GAACCTGGCTTCAAACAAGCTTAC (forward) and GTTCACAATTACCAGTGACTCCAG (reverse). This was followed by hemi-nested PCR using primary PCR product diluted 1:50 as template, the same reverse primer, and the primer GTCATCCTGGGAATCGCTCATATG (forward). PCR products were digested with BsmA I (New England BioLabs Ltd.), and restriction fragments were resolved on a 4% agarose gel. Genotypes were entered into Map Manager, and Atp6n1b was positioned with respect to previously typed microsatellite markers.Table IISingle nucleotide sequence differences between NOD and B6 mouse strainsExonNucleotide numberNODB6RFLPSequenceResidueSequenceResidueEnzymeCuts 4294aThrgThrPle1,Hinf1, Mly1B6 4321tLeugLeuBbv1,Tse1, Sfc1, Pst1B6 5481gAlaaThrMwo1NOD 9966cIletIleBsrD1B614 aThis single nucleotide polymorphism, as indicated in bold, was used to localize Atp6n1b on the mouse genome.1677tSercSerBsmA1NOD151830cProtProBfa1B6192361cLeutLeuBseR1NODa This single nucleotide polymorphism, as indicated in bold, was used to localize Atp6n1b on the mouse genome.

Positive bacterial artificial chromosome clones thus identified were used to construct vectorette libraries (20Munroe D.J. Haas M. Bric E. Whitton T. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Ward D. Housman D.E. Genomics. 1994; 19: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and these were employed to determine exon-intron boundaries using primers located within putative exons predicted by the genomic organization of human ATP6N1B. Vectorette PCR products were sequenced as described above. The m3′a4 probe described above was used to hybridize to a mouse Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN®) Blot (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was prepared from freshly harvested mouse tissues, and 2 μg each of kidney, liver, testis, bone, brain, skeletal muscle, heart, pancreas, spleen, small intestine, lung, and thymus were treated with DNase I and reverse transcribed as described above. An aliquot of each cDNA preparation was used as template for PCR with forward and reverse primers GACTCTTCCAACGCACCCCTG and CTCAGTTAGGTGGCTAAGTCCTG. These primers lie in exon 15 and the 3′-untranslated region of Atp6n1b, respectively; the expected product spans several introns and is 791 base pairs in size. To confirm successful reverse transcription, a 540-base pair fragment of β-actin was amplified in parallel using primers GTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCAC and CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC. Reverse transcription reactions performed in the absence of enzyme provided a negative control sample for each tissue (data not shown). PCR fragments were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum RA2922 had been previously raised against the C-terminal 14 amino acid residues of human ATP6N1B (6Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S.

Western blot analysis was carried out by standard methods, using nonfat dried milk as the blocking agent, and antiserum (affinity-purified against the immunizing peptide) at a 1:100 dilution. Extracts of mouse kidney and brain were prepared by thawing 1 cm3 of snap-frozen tissue in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, with one CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of buffer), homogenizing at 15,000 rpm with a Polytron® homogenizer (Kinematica) for 1 min, and centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min. To separate membrane and cytosolic fractions, supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a SW 55 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 1 h. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and 40 μg of each were used. Anesthetized mice were perfused via the left ventricle with phosphate-buffered saline followed by PLP fixative (21McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). Tissues were removed and fixed overnight at 4 °C by immersion in PLP. Tissues were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and, following cryoprotection with 2.3 m sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 12 h, 5-μm sections were cut on a cryostat. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (22Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified RA2922 was used at 1:150 dilution, and affinity-purified goat polyclonal antiserum recognizing the C terminus of human and mouse AQP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:100 dilution. Secondary antibodies (cy3-labeled anti-rabbit, cy5-labeled anti-goat, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc.) were employed at 1:1000 and 1:100 dilutions, respectively. Sections were mounted with VectaShield diluted 1:1 with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0 (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and viewed with a Zeiss confocal LSM 410 microscope. We used the amino acid sequence of human ATP6N1B to search for homologous mouse expressed sequence tags, with particular focus on those of renal tract origin. A number of homologous expressed sequence tags that did not correspond to the known murine a1, a2, and a3 isoforms were identified almost exclusively from kidney. Clones containing sequence from either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions were used to design primers to allow PCR amplification of the entire coding region from NOD mouse kidney cDNA. The DNA sequence of the resulting product contained an open reading frame of 2499 base pairs, encoding an 833-amino acid protein. This protein (designated a4) is 85% identical and 91% similar to human ATP6N1B, with 61, 52, and 47% identity to the other murine 116-kDa subunits a1, a2, and a3, respectively. This relationship is almost identical to that between the four human 116-kDa subunits. An alignment of the mouse a4 protein with the previously described a1–a3 isoforms and the human a4 ortholog ATP6N1B is shown in Fig. 1. Hydropathy analysis using the TMpred program (Fig. 2) predicts that mouse a4 has a 6-transmembrane-spanning structure almost identical to the prediction for its human ortholog (6Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), with large N-terminal and short C-terminal intracellular domains.Figure 2Hydropathy analysis of a4. The predicted hydropathy profile of murine a4 as determined using the TMpred program is shown. Positive values indicate hydrophobicity. Similar to human ATP6N1B and other members of the a-subunit family, the protein is predicted to have a large intracellular N-terminal domain, six likely transmembrane domains, and a short intracellular C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having aligned our murine a4 amino acid sequence with those described in higher eukaryotes, together with several from lower eukaryotic organisms, phylogenetic tree construction shows clustering into four a-subunit families (or clades) among vertebrate species, with the a4 clade most resembling a1 (Fig. 3). Four a-subunit isoforms have now been identified in man, mouse, C. elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster (the latter based on public data base searches). However, this phylogenetic analysis indicates that the development of multiple a-subunit genes has occurred independently in vertebrates and different classes of invertebrates, subsequently to the divergence of these groups from a common ancestor. Furthermore, the degree of conservation between vertebrate and yeast a-subunits (up to 41% amino acid identity) indicates the functional importance of these proteins. In comparing Atp6n1b sequences obtained from B6 and NOD mice, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were evident, as listed in TableII. Six of these are silent, and one results in either Ala or Thr at residue 161. We were able to use the silent exon 14 single nucleotide polymorphism to screen a panel of 57 offspring of a (B10×NOD)F1 to B10 backcross (B6 and B10 are identical at this position). This permitted localization of Atp6n1b to the region of mouse chromosome 6 between D6Mit179 and D6Mit184, ∼3.7 centimorgans centromeric to the latter marker. This region is part of a larger segment syntenic with the location of human ATP6N1B on 7q33-34 (23Karet F.E. Finberg K.E. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Medina J.F. Lifton R.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1656-1665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), confirming that the two genes are orthologs. Screening the RPCI 23 B6 mouse bacterial artificial chromosome library using a unique 3′-untranslated region probe identified four genomic clones (9J17, 97N23, 174C2, and 178B23) that contained the entire Atp6n1b gene. From these we established that Atp6n1b is organized into 20 coding exons, where all boundary positions are identical to human ATP6N1B. Table III shows the exon-intron boundary sequences and residue positions at the start of each exon. The human gene contains three additional alternatively spliced 5′-untranslated exons (6Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat.

As shown in Fig. 4, Northern blotting of a panel of 8 mouse tissues revealed a ∼3.7-kb transcript solely in kidney. This finding was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification of RNA extracted from 12 different mouse tissues (Fig. 5) in which a single band of the expected size of 791 base pairs can be seen in kidney alone.Figure 5RT-PCR amplification of a4 in mouse tissues. RT-PCR amplification of 12 different mouse tissues was performed using both Atp6n1b- and β-actin-specific primers. In the case of Atp6n1b (a), a fragment of the expected size (791 base pairs) is seen only in kidney (arrow), whereas for β-actin (b) an expected 540-base pair fragment can be seen in all 12 tissues (arrow), confirming successful reverse transcription. In each panel the samples were as follows: DNA ladder in kb (M), liver (lane 1), testis (lane 2), kidney (lane 3), bone (lane 4), brain (lane 5), heart (lane 6), skeletal muscle (lane 7), pancreas (lane 8), lung (lane 9), small intestine (lane 10), spleen (lane 11), thymus (lane 12), and negative control (lane 13).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously reported a polyclonal antiserum (RA2922) that recognizes the C terminus of human ATP6N1B (6Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We assessed its immunoreactivity in mouse by performing Western blot analysis of murine kidney and brain extracts (Fig. 6). As in human studies, this demonstrated a specific band in the renal membrane fraction alone, ∼105 kDa in size. This is slightly smaller than the observed human protein and suggests that the mouse a4 protein may contain fewer glycosylation sites than its human ortholog. RA2922 was employed to localize a4 in mouse kidney sections co-stained with an antibody to AQP2 (an apical marker of principal cells) (Fig. 7). High intensity a4 signal was found at the apical surface of α-intercalated cells in the cortical and outer medullary collecting duct with no staining of AQP2-positive cells (panels a–c). A small minority of cells in the cortical collecting duct displayed basolateral a4 immunoreactivity, representing β-intercalated cells. Interestingly, additional specific staining was present at the base of the brush border of proximal convoluted tubule cells (panels b–e), and the junction between glomerulus and proximal tubule delineated the limit of a4 immunofluorescence. This distribution of immunoreactivity contrasts with the previously reported expression of ATP6N1B in human kidney in which significant immunolocalization was not observed in nephron segments other than the collecting duct (6Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We also examined tissue from the mouse male reproductive tract, in which apical H+-ATPase immunolocalization has previously been noted (24Brown D. Lui B. Gluck S. Sabolic I. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C913-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hermo L. Adamali H.I. Andonian S. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 376-391PubMed Google Scholar), to assess whether proton pumps at these sites contain the a4 isoform. High intensity a4 immunofluorescence was visible at the luminal surface of scattered epithelial cells in both epididymis and vas deferens (Fig. 7, f–i), an appearance identical to previous reports employing other H+-ATPase subunit antibodies (24Brown D. Lui B. Gluck S. Sabolic I. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C913-C916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hermo L. Adamali H.I. Andonian S. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 376-391PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of Atp6n1b reported here extends the number of a-subunit family members in mouse to four, in parallel with the human ATP6N1 gene group as we have described (6Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As in man, only this and the B-subunit are presently known to have tissue-specific isoforms in normal (i.e. non-malignant) tissues. Much of the earlier work localizing proton pumps has necessarily employed antibodies directed against ubiquitously expressed H+-ATPase subunits. However, for the a-subunit (and also the B-subunit) isoform-specific reagents such as RA2922 are now available. These will provide refined tools to investigate expression and function of this critically important pump and to evaluate the roles of individual subunits. The kidney is one of the few sites in which a high density of H+-ATPases is seen at the plasma membrane of specialized polarized cells. A figure of several thousand pumps/μm2has been estimated from freeze-fracture electron micrographic studies of α-intercalated cells in the turtle urinary bladder, which has in the past proven a useful model system for the study of vectorial proton transport (26Steinmetz P.R. Kohn O.F. Hand A.R. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1655-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We show that, as with its human ortholog, the a4 a-subunit isoform forms part of the proton pump at the plasma membrane of intercalated cells in the murine kidney. However, in contrast to the human renal cortex, there appears in mouse to be not only high intensity intercalated cell expression of a4, but also additional expression at the base of the brush border of proximal tubular cells. Although it is possible that this reflects differences in tissue preservation and preparation, species differences have been reported for the distribution of other renally expressed proteins (for example, the endothelin receptor ETA, Ref. 27Karet F.E. Davenport A.P. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1994; 9: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and this may have some implications for direct functional extrapolation between different mammals in vivo. We have shown that mutations that alter ATP6N1B in humans cause autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis, implying that this protein is essential for the integrity of apical H+-ATPase function in the distal nephron. Given the caveat described above, the identification of the murine ortholog of ATP6N1B reported here should therefore provide a novel tool for addressing both structural and functional questions concerning this important proton pump subunit, both in vitro and in vivo, especially because direct studies of human renal function at the molecular level may not always be achievable. In male genital tissue, an acidic environment is recognized to be necessary for sperm maturation and maintenance, and H+-ATPase blockade has been shown to inhibit proton flux in rat vas deferens in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 28Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that a4 is the apical 116-kDa accessory subunit isoform in a proportion of epithelial cells in murine genital tract just as in the kidney. Whether apical proton pumps in human male genital tissues also contain a4 has not yet been investigated, but this may have future implications for the maintenance of fertility in male patients with distal renal tubular acidosis caused by defects in ATP6N1B. The differences in tissue specificity among different a-subunits is of interest in terms of the potential function(s) of these proteins, especially because proton pumps require targeting either to intracellular compartments or to specific domains at the surface of the different polarized cell types that share a requirement for an acidic gradient. In terms of overall proton pump structure and function, a role for this large accessory a-subunit has not yet been identified. The sequence differences that exist between a-subunit family members may result in variations in trafficking pathways, in interaction with adjacent proteins, or in some other function yet to be elucidated. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies of VPH1, a yeast ATP6N1 ortholog, suggest not only that this subunit is required to stabilize the complete pump structure in the membrane, but also that the a-subunit may be required for activity and/or assembly of the V-ATPase complex (29Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Extrapolation between such diverse species must be approached with some caution, especially as the major differences in cell polarity between yeast and mammalian epithelia must be considered, and V-ATPases localize intracellularly in yeast. However, it is notable that many of the residues in vph1p that have been shown to be important for activity or assembly of the V-ATPase complex in yeast (29Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) are conserved in the isoforms shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, recent topographical analysis of the yeast vph1p protein resulted in a different structural model from that predicted in mammals, where the yeast a-subunit would have 9 transmembrane regions, with the N terminus located in the cytoplasm and the C terminus facing the lumen (31Leng X.-H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, such a model has yet to be verified in the a-subunits of any higher eukaryote. Thus, much remains to be elucidated regarding the proper role of the a-subunit in maintenance of mammalian acid-base homeostasis and other H+-ATPase-dependent processes, and the identification of this novel murine a-subunit isoform provides new potential for further studies.

We found that Id-1, an inhibitor of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, regulates mammary epithelial cell growth, differentiation, and invasion in culture. Here, we show that Id-1 is expressed highly during mammary development in virgin mice and during early pregnancy, when proliferation and invasion are high. During mid-pregnancy, Id-1 expression declined to undetectable levels as the epithelium differentiated fully. Surprisingly, Id-1 increased during involution, when the epithelium undergoes extensive apoptosis. To determine whether Id-1 regulates both proliferation and apoptosis, we constitutively expressed Id-1 in mammary epithelial cell cultures. Id-1 stimulated proliferation in sparse cultures but induced apoptosis in dense cultures, which reflect epithelial cell density during early pregnancy and involution, respectively. To understand how Id-1 acts, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library from differentiating mammary epithelial cells and identified ITF-2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as an Id-1-interacting protein. Overexpression of ITF-2 significantly reduced Id-1-stimulated proliferation and apoptosis. We show further that, in contrast to Id-1, Id-2 was expressed highly in differentiated mammary epithelial cells in vivo and in culture. In culture, Id-2 antisense transcripts blocked differentiation.

During each menstrual cycle, and particularly during pregnancy, mammary epithelial cells undergo cycles of proliferation, invasion, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death. During pregnancy, mammary epithelial cells proliferate, invade the surrounding stromal extracellular matrix (ECM),1 and form lobulo-alveolar structures that prepare the gland for lactation (1Traurig H.H. Anat. Rec. 1967; 159: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Borst D.W. Mahoney W.B. J. Exp. Zool. 1982; 221: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 3Zwierzchowski L. Kleczkowska D. Niedbalski W. Grochowska I. Differentiation. 1984; 28: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). At late pregnancy, prior to parturition, breast epithelial cells cease proliferation and invasion and functionally differentiate into cells that express and secrete milk proteins. Throughout lactation, epithelial cells remain quiescent but continue to express milk proteins (4Traurig H.H. Anat. Rec. 1967; 157: 489-504Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After weaning, the mammary gland undergoes involution, a phase of extensive remodeling characterized by degradation of ECM and epithelial cell death by apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms that regulate and coordinate the changes in mammary epithelial cell phenotypes are poorly understood. Genes that are up- or down-regulated at different developmental stages have been identified, but little is known about how they are regulated and coordinated. The identification of tissue-specific transcriptional regulators in mammary epithelial cells is crucial, not only for deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of normal growth and differentiation but also for understanding how breast cancer develops. We have shown that Id-1 is a crucial regulator of the growth, invasion, and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells in culture. Id proteins are members of a small family of low molecular mass polypeptides (13–20 kDa) that function as dominant negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (5Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Of the four mammalian Id proteins identified thus far, two (Id-1 and Id-3) are nearly ubiquitously expressed, whereas two (Id-2 and Id-4) show a restricted pattern of expression. The targets of Id proteins, bHLH transcription factors, comprise a large family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Some bHLH proteins are ubiquitously expressed (e.g. E-proteins), whereas others are lineage-specific (e.g. MyoD) (for review, see Ref. 6Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). bHLH proteins activate transcription of tissue-specific genes and thus direct cell-lineage commitment and terminal differentiation. bHLH proteins act as obligate dimers; they heterodimerize through the HLH domains and bind to specific DNA sequences (E-boxes) through the composite basic domains. Id proteins contain an HLH domain but lack a basic region. Id proteins can dimerize with bHLH proteins, but the resulting heterodimers cannot bind DNA. Thus, Id proteins negatively regulate bHLH transcription factors. Accordingly, Id proteins have been shown to inhibit the differentiation of trophoblasts (7Cross J.C. Flannery M.L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To understand the differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, we developed a line of murine mammary epithelial cells, SCp2, which originated from a mid-pregnant mouse mammary gland (13Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Myers C.A. Casperson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9118-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Danielson K.G. Oborn C.J. Durban E.M. Buetel J.S. Medina D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). SCp2 cells do not grow in semi-solid media in culture or form tumors in nude mice. When given lactogenic hormones and ECM, SCp2 cells aggregate, arrest growth, and form alveolar structures that, within a few days, express and secrete several milk proteins (15Desprez P.Y. Roskelley C. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell Differ. 1993; 1: 99-110Google Scholar, 16Roskelley C.D. Desprez P.Y. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12378-12382Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The morphology of differentiated SCp2 cells is similar to the epithelial alveoli in pregnant and lactating mammary glands in vivo. We found that Id-1 expression declines rapidly when SCp2 differentiate and that ectopic expression of Id-1 stimulates proliferation and blocks differentiation (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic Id-1 expression stimulated SCp2 cell migration and invasion, at least in part because of its ability to induce a novel metalloproteinase (17Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a potential role for Id-1 in the progression of some breast cancers toward aggressive malignant stages (18Lin C.Q. Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Parrinello S. Liang S.H. Gillett C.E. Campisi J. Desprez P.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1332-1340PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that Id-1 is expressed highly during the initial stages of mammary gland development in vivo, when epithelial cells of the ductal trees proliferate and invade the stroma. Thereafter, Id-1 is down-regulated during mid-pregnancy and remains undetectable during much of lactation. Surprisingly, Id-1 is re-expressed early in involution, suggesting a role in apoptosis. In support of this idea, we show that ectopic expression of Id-1 in SCp2 cells triggers either proliferation or apoptosis, depending on the cell culture density. These effects of Id-1 were partly reversed by coexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix factor, ITF-2, which we isolated as an Id-1-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system. We show further that, in contrast to Id-1, Id-2 is up-regulated during mammary epithelial cell differentiation in culture and during the second part of pregnancy in vivo. This up-regulation was crucial for full differentiation, because antisense Id-2 blocked milk production in culture. Our results suggest that Id-1, Id-2, and ITF-2 comprise a network of interacting HLH proteins in mammary epithelial cells and imply very different roles for Id-2 and Id-1 in determining breast epithelial cell phenotypes. Mammary tissues were obtained from BALB/C female mice, purchased either from Simonsen Laboratories, Inc. (Gilroy, CA) or Harlan (San Diego, CA). To obtain mammary tissue during pregnancy, lactation, and involution, 12-week-old virgin females were mated. Mammary gland involution was induced by removing the pups 20 days after birth. In all cases, the two fourth inguinal mammary glands were harvested. Virgin animals were sacrificed at 5, 7, and 12 weeks of age; pregnant animals were sacrificed at 2, 5, 12, and 18 days after onset of pregnancy; lactating animals were sacrificed at 2, 7, 12, and 20 days after onset of lactation; and involuting animals were sacrificed at 2, 3, and 5 days after weaning. Mammary glands were immediately frozen at −70 °C. RNA and proteins were extracted using TriPure isolation reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The derivation of SCp2 cells has been described (15Desprez P.Y. Roskelley C. Campisi J. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell Differ. 1993; 1: 99-110Google Scholar). SCp2-Id-1 cells were generated by transfecting SCp2 cells with the MMTV-Id-1 expression vector, as described (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 media (1:1) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, insulin (5 µg/ml), and gentamicin (50 µg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 5% atmosphere. To induce apoptosis, cells were shifted to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 media plus insulin and gentamicin for 5 days. For the retroviral infection experiments, vectors were packaged in TSA-54 cells (Cell Genesis, Foster City, CA). Full-length human ITF-2 cDNA (obtained from Dr. T. Kadesch) was cloned in a LXSN vector. LXSN-control (LXSN-ctl) and LXSN-ITF-2 vectors were used to infect SCp2-Id-1 cells. Full-length mouse Id-2 cDNA was cloned in a sense, as well as an antisense, orientation in the same LXSN vector, and constructs were used to infect SCp2 cells. Cells were plated at 3 × 104 (low density) or 3–5 × 105 (high density) on 22-mm2 coverslips, allowed to grow in complete medium for 2 days, and then serum-starved as described above. Cells were washed once in PBS and fixed for 10 min in 1% paraformaldehyde; after two washes in PBS, 5-min each, cells were permeabilized in ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) for 5 min at −20 °C and washed twice for 5 min in PBS. TUNEL assay was performed using the indirect Apotag fluorescein kit (Oncor), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma), and coverslips were mounted in glycerol-gelatin (Sigma) for viewing by fluorescence. Cells were plated at 5 or 50% confluency, grown for 2 days in complete medium, and serum-deprived as described above. Cells and media were harvested on ice, washed once with PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 s. Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were collected. Supernatants were treated with RNase A (5 µg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 56 °C in 1% SDS and proteinase K (2.5 µg/ml; Sigma) at 37 °C for 2–4 h. The DNA was precipitated with 0.5 volume of 10 m ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight. DNA was collected by centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in Tris-EDTA, and DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Total cellular RNA was isolated and purified as described (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+mRNA was prepared according to the protocol published by New England BioLabs, Inc. Samples (20 µg for total RNA and 4 µg for poly(A)+ mRNA) were electrophoresed through formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with32P-labeled murine β-casein and Id-1 cDNA probes (17Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and murine ITF-2 and Id-2 cDNA probes obtained by screening the SCp2 library. Membranes were washed and exposed to XAR-5 film for autoradiography, as described (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA are shown as controls for RNA integrity and quantitation. Murine ITF-2 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR, essentially as described (17Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA, and 2 µg were amplified using 20 µm of the 5′ and 3′ primers, 5′-ACGACGACAAGAAGGATATC and 5′-ATAATACAGCTGTTAAGGAA. PCR was performed using 0.05 units/µlPfu DNA polymerase and 18 cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 55 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C. For Southern analysis, one-fifth of the PCR reaction product was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+), and hybridized with the mouse ITF-2 cDNA. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, scraped, and lysed in SSC and 0.25% SDS at 37 °C overnight. Lysates were heated at 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate proteases. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was measured. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% acrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with anti-β-casein (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), anti-Id-1 (18Lin C.Q. Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Parrinello S. Liang S.H. Gillett C.E. Campisi J. Desprez P.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1332-1340PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Id-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-actin (Chemicon) antibodies. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, and binding was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5 µm) from mouse mammary glands were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated with ethanol, rinsed in PBS, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.1% trypsin. Sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Id-1 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an antibody that works on paraffin sections (18Lin C.Q. Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Parrinello S. Liang S.H. Gillett C.E. Campisi J. Desprez P.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1332-1340PubMed Google Scholar). Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. Tissue sections were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Slides were then incubated for 30 min with an anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the reaction was revealed by incubating with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Sections were briefly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared in methyl cyclohexane, and mounted. Cells cultured on coverslips were given [3H]thymidine (10 µCi/ml, 60–80 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the last 16 h of the experiments, unless otherwise indicated, were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1), and were stained with DAPI. Radiolabeled nuclei were developed as described (17Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The percentage of labeled nuclei was calculated by dividing the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled nuclei with the number of DAPI-stained nuclei in a given field, using phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. For cell growth experiments, SCp2-control and SCp2-Id-1 cells were plated at 5 × 104 (low density) onto 35-mm diameter dishes, allowed to attach overnight in complete medium, and then cultured in serum-free medium plus insulin. The cell numbers were determined by counting triplicates on a hemocytometer at daily intervals to 4 days. To isolate proteins that interact with Id-1, we used yeast two-hybrid screening (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), with components provided by CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and Dr. S. Elledge (22Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). We constructed a cDNA library from SCp2 cells 12 to 24 h after they were induced to differentiate, which just precedes the appearance of β-casein mRNA. The cDNA library was fused to the yeast expression vector containing the Gal4 transactivation domain (pGAD424). The human Id-1 cDNA was cloned into the GAL-4 DNA-binding domain vector (pGBT9). The cDNA library in pGAD424 was transformed into yeast containing pGBT-Id-1, and screening was carried out as per CLONTECHguidelines. Colonies that grew in His medium containing 3-aminotriasol (>10 mm) were characterized. Interaction was confirmed by expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Plasmids from colonies that grew in 3-aminotriazole and expressed β-galactosidase were isolated, and the inserts were sequenced. We examined Id-1 expression during normal mouse mammary gland development in vivo, using sequentially probed Northern blots of total RNA from virgin (V), pregnant (P), lactating (L), and involuting (I) BALB/C mice (Fig.1A). As expected, β-casein mRNA was evident only during late pregnancy and lactation. Id-1 expression was inversely correlated with β-casein expression, suggesting a role for Id-1 in vivo similar to that observed in cultured SCp2 cells. To confirm that Id-1 was specifically expressed by epithelial cells in vivo, we performed immunohistochemistry using an Id-1-specific antibody (18Lin C.Q. Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Parrinello S. Liang S.H. Gillett C.E. Campisi J. Desprez P.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1332-1340PubMed Google Scholar). A strong signal was detected only in the epithelial cells at the end buds of growing ductal structures (Fig. 1B), confirming that proliferating and invading mammary epithelial cells express high levels of Id-1. Surprisingly, we found that Id-1 was re-expressed during involution (Fig. 1A), a time when mammary epithelial cells undergo extensive apoptosis (23Lund L.R. Romer J. Thomasset N. Solberg H. Pyke C. Bissell M.J. Dano K. Werb Z. Development. 1996; 122: 181-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This re-expression raised the possibility that Id-1 may also regulate apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells. Mammary epithelial cells undergo apoptosis when cultured in serum-free medium at confluency, and either insulin or epidermal growth factor can act as survival factors to prevent cell death (24Merlo G.R. Basolo F. Fiore L. Duboc L. Hynes N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To determine whether Id-1 was important for apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells under these conditions, we plated control SCp2 cells (SCp2-ctl) or SCp2 cells that constitutively express Id-1 (SCp2-Id-1) (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) at low and high cell densities. We cultured the cells in serum-free medium containing insulin for 5 days and then assayed for apoptotic cells using TUNEL staining (Fig.2A and 2B). SCp2-ctl cells did not undergo apoptosis at either density, and proliferation declined upon serum withdrawal (doubling time of about 30 h; see Fig.2C). At low density, SCp2-Id-1 cells continued to proliferate (doubling time of 16 to 18 h; see Fig. 2C), confirming that ectopic expression of Id-1 stimulates proliferation even in the absence of mitogens (17Desprez P.Y. Lin C.Q. Thomasset N. Sympson C.J. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Singh J. Itahana Y. Parrinello S. Murata K. Desprez P.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11852-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, at high density SCp2-Id-1 cells underwent apoptosis. To confirm these findings, we tested the same cell lines for non-random DNA fragmentation. SCp2-ctl cells showed no DNA fragmentation under any condition (low or high density) (Fig. 2D). Similarly, SCp2-Id-1 cells showed no fragmentation at low density. However, a characteristic apoptotic ladder was detected in the DNA of SCp2-Id-1 cells plated at high density. These results indicate that Id-1 can mediate the apoptotic response, in addition to the proliferation response, of mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, proliferation was favored in sparse cultures, which more closely resembles the virgin or early pregnant gland, whereas apoptosis was favored in dense cultures, which more closely resembles the gland at the start of involution. Because Id proteins function by binding bHLH transcription factors, Id-1-interacting proteins are very likely important transcriptional regulators of mammary epithelial cell properties. To identify Id-1-interacting proteins in mammary epithelial cells, we used the yeast two-hybrid system (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) to screen a cDNA library constructed from SCp2 cells in early stages of differentiation (12 to 24 h after addition of ECM, a time just preceding the appearance of β-casein mRNA). We screened the library with the human Id-1 cDNA fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain. From a screen of about 300,000 clones, we isolated two positive clones carrying the same 950-base pair cDNA insert. The sequence of this insert was identical to the ubiquitous bHLH transcription factor ITF-2. This mouse ITF-2 insert contained a 950-base pair open reading frame encoding the bHLH and C-terminal domains of ITF-2 but missing the N-terminal region. Because of its low abundance, we used semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR to examine the expression of ITF-2 in proliferating and differentiating SCp2 cells (Fig. 3). ITF-2 mRNA did not fluctuate, regardless of whether cells were proliferating or induced to differentiate by ECM plus lactogenic hormones for 1, 2, or 3 days. Thus, although Id-1 expression fluctuated during mammary epithelial cell growth and differentiation, ITF-2 appeared to be expressed constitutively. We used the full-length human ITF-2 cDNA to explore ITF-2 function in mammary differentiation. We cloned the hITF-2 in an LXSN retroviral vector, and LXSN-ctl or LXSN-ITF2 retroviruses were used to infect SCp2-Id-1 cells. SCp2-Id-1-LXSN-ctl and SCp2-Id-1-LXSN-ITF-2 cell populations expressed Id-1 protein at the same level (Fig. 4A). However, only SCp2-Id-1-LXSN-ITF2 cells expressed high levels of ITF-2 (Fig.4B). When induced to differentiate, SCp2-Id-1-LXSN-ITF2 cells were capable of expressing β-casein (Fig. 4C), the marker of differentiation that SCp2-Id-1 cells failed to express (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). When plated on plastic at low density and cultured in serum-free medium, the ITF-2-expressing cells lost the high proliferative capacity characteristic of SCp2-Id-1 (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or SCp2-Id-1-LXSN-ctl cells (Fig.4D). When plated at high density and serum-starved, the same ITF-2-expressing cells showed much less apoptosis, compared with SCp2-Id-1-LXSN-ctl cells (Fig. 4E). These data suggest that these effects of Id-1 on mammary epithelial cell phenotypes occur, at least partly, through its interaction with the basic helix-loop-helix E-protein ITF-2. Because E-proteins dimerize with either another E-protein or a tissue-specific bHLH transcription factor, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify ITF-2-interacting proteins expressed in differentiated epithelial cells. Surprisingly, this screen yielded cDNA inserts encoding the helix-loop-helix protein Id-2. We therefore examined Id-2 expression in proliferating and differentiating SCp2 cells treated with ECM and lactogenic hormones. Western analysis (Fig. 5) showed that differentiated SCp2 cells expressed high levels of the 16-kDa Id-2 protein, whereas Id-2 was not detectable in proliferating cells. In comparison, Id-1 was detectable only in proliferating cells as reported previously (12Desprez P.Y. Hara E. Bissell M.J. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3398-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We confirmed this inverse expression pattern of Id-1 and Id-2 by Northern analysis of mRNA isolated from cells proliferating or treated with laminin (the major component of ECM required for mammary epithelial cell differentiation) and lactogenic hormones for 24 and 48 h (Fig. 6A). Thus, in contrast to Id-1, Id-2 appeared to be associated with differentiation in mammary epithelial cells.Figure 6A, inverse correlation between Id-1 and Id-2 mRNA expression in growing (lane 1), serum-starved (lane 2), and SCp2 cells treated with laminin + LH for 24 (lane 3) and 48 h (lane 4).

Actin protein was used as a control for loading and integrity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Id-2 was essential for mammary epithelial cell differentiation and milk production, we infected SCp2 cells with LXSN-control, LXSN-Id-2-sense, or LXSN-Id-2-antisense retroviruses (Fig. 6B). After selection for infected cells, the cells were induced to differentiate using laminin and lactogenic hormones. β-Casein expression was significantly higher in SCp2-LXSN-Id-2-sense cells compared with control cells. Moreover, β-casein expression was almost undetectable in SCp2-LXSN-Id-2-antisense cells, which expressed much lower levels of Id-2 protein compared with control cells (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that ectopic expression of Id-2 accelerates differentiation, whereas depletion of Id-2 protein inhibits differentiation. To determ"
https://openalex.org/W1978691390,"The Galactic plane is a strong emitter of hard x-rays (2 to 10 kiloelectron volts), and the emission forms a narrow continuous ridge. The currently known hard x-ray sources are far too few to explain the ridge x-ray emission, and the fundamental question of whether the ridge emission is ultimately resolved into numerous dimmer discrete sources or truly diffuse emission has not yet been settled. In order to obtain a decisive answer, using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we carried out the deepest hard x-ray survey of a Galactic plane region that is devoid of known x-ray point sources. We detected at least 36 new hard x-ray point sources in addition to strong diffuse emission within a 17' by 17' field of view. The surface density of the point sources is comparable to that at high Galactic latitudes after the effects of Galactic absorption are considered. Therefore, most of these point sources are probably extragalactic, presumably active galaxies seen through the Galactic disk. The Galactic ridge hard x-ray emission is diffuse, which indicates omnipresence within the Galactic plane of a hot plasma, the energy density of which is more than one order of magnitude higher than any other substance in the interstellar space."

Mechanical stimulation can cause release of ATP, an agent that stimulates osteoclastic resorption at low concentrations and inhibits at high concentrations. We examined whether osteoclasts express P2X7 receptors, which are activated by high concentrations of ATP and can behave as ion channels or cause the formation of membrane pores. Rabbit osteoclasts were studied using patch clamp techniques. Successive or prolonged applications of 2′- & 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP, a relatively potent P2X7 agonist) or high concentrations of ATP caused the development of a slowly deactivating inward current. The underlying channel was permeable only to small cations, ruling out pore formation. Divalent cations reduced current magnitude, consistent with the presence of P2X7 receptors, a finding confirmed in rat osteoclasts by immunocytochemistry. Successive applications of BzATP also elicited [Ca2+]i elevations that required extracellular Ca2+. The BzATP-induced current and the rise of [Ca2+]i were temporally associated, and both were inhibited by PPADS, a P2X7antagonist. This study demonstrates that high concentrations of ATP activate P2X7 receptors and provides the first functional evidence for an extracellular ligand-gated Ca2+ influx pathway in osteoclasts.

Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Functional P2X receptors are multimeric, composed of at least three subunits (7Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) that can combine to form homomeric and heteromeric channels (8North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Some P2X receptors change ion selectivity within seconds because of the formation of membrane pores (9Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 10Khakh B.S. Bao X.R. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Cells can express multiple P2 receptors that respond to various ligands, likely accounting for the diversity of biological responses to extracellular nucleotides. The precise balance of bone resorption and formation during remodeling is regulated by local factors and modulated by mechanical stimuli; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Nucleotides have multiple effects on the functions of bone cells, including osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption (12Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Drug Dev. Res. 2000; 49: 187-200Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro, low concentrations of ADP, ATP, or their analogs stimulate the resorptive activity of rodent osteoclasts and human osteoclast-like cells (13Bowler W.B. Littlewood-Evans A. Bilbe G. Gallagher J.A. Dixon C.J. Bone. 1998; 22: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Morrison M.S. Turin L. King B.F. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 495-500Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, low concentrations of ATP promote, whereas high concentrations inhibit, the formation of murine osteoclasts (14Morrison M.S. Turin L. King B.F. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 495-500Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that nucleotides, released locally in response to mechanical or other stimuli, contribute to the regulation of bone remodeling. However, it is not clear which receptor or receptors mediate the effects of nucleotides on osteoclast function. The P2Y2 receptor, which is activated by both ATP and UTP, has been cloned from human osteoclastoma (15Bowler W.B. Birch M.A. Gallagher J.A. Bilbe G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and identified byin situ hybridization in rat osteoclasts (16Hoebertz A. Townsend-Nicholson A. Glass R. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. Bone. 2000; 27: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). ADP activates the P2Y1 receptor, the expression of which has been demonstrated in rat osteoclasts by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry (17Hoebertz A. Meghji S. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Rat and rabbit osteoclasts respond to several P2 agonists with an elevation of the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i)1(18Yu H. Ferrier J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Wiebe S.H. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These responses involve activation of multiple subtypes of P2Y receptors leading to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, but the contribution of Ca2+ influx is unclear. Nucleotides induce an inward current caused by activation of P2X receptors (21Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 303-315Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the P2X4 receptor has been identified functionally and at the molecular level in osteoclasts (22Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined patch clamp and fluorescence studies revealed that the P2X4receptor in osteoclasts does not mediate Ca2+ entry (20Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that other P2X subtypes are present which do permit Ca2+ influx. It is of interest to identify and characterize Ca2+ entry pathways in osteoclasts. Electrophysiological studies do not provide evidence for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (23Sims S.M. Kelly M.E. Dixon S.J. Pflügers Arch. 1991; 419: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, osteoclasts respond to mechanical stimulation with transient elevation of [Ca2+]i which involves both influx and release from stores (19Wiebe S.H. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Wiltink A. Nijweide P.J. Scheenen W.J. Ypey D.L. Van Duijn B. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), effects that may be mediated by P2 receptors. The objective of this study was to examine whether P2X receptor subtypes, in addition to P2X4, are expressed functionally in osteoclasts and to investigate their role in Ca2+ influx. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Council on Animal Care at The University of Western Ontario and complied with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Osteoclasts were isolated from the long bones of neonatal New Zealand White rabbits or Wistar rats (modified from Ref. 25Chambers T.J. Magnus C.J. J. Pathol. 1982; 136: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Animals were killed by decapitation, and long bones were isolated, minced, and placed in a culture tube containing medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada), Earle's salts, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.7 mml-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, fetal bovine serum (15% v/v), and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B). After bone fragments had settled, the suspended cells were plated on 12-mm glass coverslips. For studies of rat osteoclasts, cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 30–60 min, after which the coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove nonadherent cells and submerged in fresh culture medium. Rat osteoclasts were used on the day of isolation. For studies of rabbit osteoclasts, cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h, after which coverslips with adherent osteoclasts were submerged in fresh culture medium. The day of isolation was denoted as experimental day 0, and rabbit osteoclasts were studied on days 2–7. On the day of the experiments, the majority of non-osteoclastic cells were removed from rabbit cell preparations using Pronase E (0.001% in PBS with 0.5 mm EDTA) with intermittent agitation at 22 °C (modified from Ref. 26Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When the majority of non-osteoclastic cells had been removed (<5 min), the saline was replaced with fresh medium. Osteoclasts were identified by their characteristic morphology under phase-contrast microscopy, and only cells having three or more nuclei were studied. In selected preparations, cytochemical staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was used to confirm the identity of these cells as osteoclasts. For recording of macroscopic currents, a conventional whole cell configuration was used with the electrode solution containing (in mm): 136 CsCl, 20 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 10 tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.4 CaCl2, 0.1 EGTA, adjusted with CsOH to pH 7.2, 280–290 mosmol/liter, to block K+ currents. When recording K+ currents, in some experiments, the electrode solution contained KCl instead of CsCl, and tetraethylammonium chloride was excluded. Greater than 80% series resistance compensation was used. Liquid junction potentials were less than 2 mV with these solutions, and reported potentials were not corrected. Cells were superfused continuously (1–2 ml/min) in Na+ solution containing (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 1 CaCl2, 20 NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 280–290 mosmol/liter. Where noted, 1 mmMgCl2 was added to the superfusion solution. Ca2+-free solution was prepared by omitting CaCl2 and adding 0.5 mm EGTA. Na+-free solution was prepared by replacing Na+with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG+; molecular mass, 196 Da). Currents were recorded using an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered (−3 db at 1 kHz), and digitized at 2–5 kHz using pClamp 6.0 (Axon Instruments). Experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Agonists and antagonists were applied by superfusion or locally to individual osteoclasts using pressure ejection from micropipettes (5–10 µm diameter) positioned 30–50 µm from the cell (Picospritzer II, General Valve Corporation, Fairfield, NJ). Test substances were dissolved in the corresponding bath solution. When test substances were applied locally, the concentrations reported were those in the pipette solution; the concentrations at the cell surface were necessarily lower. Application of control solutions did not cause appreciable changes in membrane currents or [Ca2+]i. Unless otherwise indicated, chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. [Ca2+]iwas measured using the fluorescence from single osteoclasts (27Wood D.A. Hapak L.K. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15369-15376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells plated on coverslips were loaded by incubation with 1.5 µm fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30–60 min at room temperature, washed, placed in fresh medium 199, and incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature to allow for ester hydrolysis. Coverslips containing fura-2-loaded cells were placed in a chamber, superfused continuously with buffer solutions, and examined using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Cells were excited with alternating 340 and 380 nm light, and the emission light was detected using a photomultiplier, sampling at 10 ratios/s (Photon Technologies International, London, ON, Canada). Fluorescence intensities at 340 and 380 nm were corrected for background by subtraction of values obtained from a region with no cells, and the ratio was used to calculate [Ca2+]i (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In some experiments, [Ca2+]i and currents were monitored simultaneously using combined fluorescence and patch clamp recording. Cells were loaded with fura-2 prior to establishing whole cell configuration; fluorescence and current were recorded simultaneously to ensure proper temporal alignment. Currents were also recorded at a higher bandwidth on digital videotape and/or digitized using pCLAMP software. Immunocytochemistry was carried out on rat osteoclasts using an affinity-purified anti-P2X7polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Cells were fixed at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in PBS, incubated with 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h, and then primary antibody (1:100) was added, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:200) followed by avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Cells were rinsed with PBS, incubated with 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma, 2 mg/ml H2O) until color developed, and then counterstained with Harris' modified hematoxylin. In control experiments, primary antibody was either preincubated with excess antigen peptide or omitted. To characterize the P2X channels in osteoclasts, we used patch clamp techniques to record whole cell currents. In the initial studies, we used a CsCl electrode solution to block the K+ currents previously identified in these cells. The initial application of 100 µm ATP evoked an inward current that activated rapidly and then declined during agonist application. This current was identified previously as a P2X4 nonselective cation current (22Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inward current desensitized rapidly upon successive stimulation with ATP (Fig.1A, representative of 9 of 9 cells). Current voltage (I-V) relationships were studied using voltage ramp commands, where subtraction of the control current revealed the nucleotide-induced current. The initial ATP-activated current was inwardly rectifying (Fig. 1B) and reversed direction at 7 ± 1 mV (n = 9). In contrast to 100 µm ATP, 100 µm BzATP, which is a more potent agonist than ATP at P2X7 receptors, evoked the initial inward current followed by an inward current that increased in amplitude with successive stimulations (Fig. 1C). This result is representative of that seen in 18 of 21 cells studied, with the remaining 3 cells exhibiting an initial P2X4 current but no later component. This later component of the BzATP-activated current was inwardly rectifying and reversed at 9 ± 1 mV (Fig.1D). Such a current was also observed in response to 1 mm ATP (4 of 5 cells, with a reversal of 9 ± 4 mV, not shown). In 7 of the 18 responding cells, BzATP evoked inward currents without delay. Thus, nucleotides appear to activate two distinct P2X currents: an initial P2X4 current that desensitizes followed by an activity-dependent current. The kinetics of P2X currents vary depending on the receptor subtype. The inward P2X4 current activated by 100 µm ATP reached a maximum then declined rapidly in the continued presence of agonist (Fig. 2A, left), as reported previously in osteoclasts (22Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent applications of 100 µm ATP elicited a current that was of reduced amplitude (Fig. 2A, right) but still inactivated in the presence of agonist. In contrast, 100–300 µm BzATP induced an inward current that persisted during and after agonist application, for periods of up to 1 min, considerably longer than the time required for solution exchange in these studies (Fig.2B). These properties were observed in all cells studied with BzATP and also with high concentrations of ATP (1 mm, Fig. 2C). P2X2 receptors have been identified in rat osteoclasts using immunocytochemistry (16Hoebertz A. Townsend-Nicholson A. Glass R. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. Bone. 2000; 27: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the characteristics of the activity-dependent current argue against involvement of P2X2, which deactivates promptly upon agonist washout (29Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Taken together, the persistence of the activity-dependent current during agonist application and its delayed deactivation upon agonist removal suggest the presence of P2X7 receptors in osteoclasts. Ion substitution was used to examine the selectivity of this later component of the BzATP-induced current. Replacement of Na+ with the large cation NMG+ caused the current at −30 mV to reverse from inward to outward (Fig. 3A) because of a shift of the I-V relationship to more negative potentials (Fig.3B). This result is representative of responses recorded in 7 cells, with a mean reversal in NMG+ solution of −50 ± 5 mV. Thus, the BzATP-activated conductance exhibits low permeability to NMG+. Slow deactivation upon agonist washout accounts for the undershoot of the current recorded at −30 mV in NMG+ solution, as extracellular levels of Na+ are restored before channel closure (Fig.3A). It has been reported that prolonged stimulation of P2X7 or heterologously expressed P2X2 or P2X4 receptors can result in a change of ion selectivity within seconds because of the formation of pores that are permeable to NMG+ (9Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 10Khakh B.S. Bao X.R. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 11Virginio C. MacKenzie A. Rassendren F.A. North R.A. Surprenant A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To assess the possibility of pore formation, we examined the effects of prolonged stimulation of cells superfused in NMG+ solution. The persistence of outward current at −30 mV, even after a 3-min stimulation with BzATP (Fig. 3C), demonstrates that the channel remains impermeable to NMG+. Taken together, these data indicate that BzATP activates an activity-dependent P2X channel that is permeable to small cations and does not behave as a pore. Because divalent cations play an important role in determining the kinetics and amplitude of P2X currents, we examined their effects on the activity-dependent current. In these experiments, solutions did not contain Mg2+ unless indicated. BzATP elicited a sustained inward current in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig.4A). However, 1 mmCa2+ reversibly reduced the amplitude of the BzATP-induced current. In solutions that contained Ca2+, BzATP elicited a sustained inward current in both the presence and absence of Mg2+, although 1 mm Mg2+ reduced the BzATP-induced current (Fig. 4B). Similarly, 10 µm Zn2+ reversibly reduced the amplitude of the BzATP-induced current (Fig. 4C). Data are representative of responses in 9 cells for Ca2+ (amplitude of current reduced by 43 ± 8%), 3 cells for Mg2+ (amplitude of current reduced by 70 ± 2%), and 5 cells for Zn2+(amplitude of current reduced by 27 ± 8%). Notably, the addition of these divalent cations did not cause any marked change in the reversal potential or time course of deactivation. Suppression of this current by divalent cations resembles that reported for P2X7 current (9Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduction of the current by Zn2+ argues against mediation of the activity-dependent current by P2X4 receptors, as Zn2+ potentiates the P2X4 current (8North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar,22Naemsch L.N. Weidema A.F. Sims S.M. Underhill T.M. Dixon S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4425-4435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P2 receptor antagonists also inhibited the activity-dependent current in osteoclasts. PPADS is an inhibitor of several P2 receptors including P2X7 (5Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). PPADS did not block the initial P2X4 current in osteoclasts (n = 7), whereas the activity-dependent current was progressively inhibited (Fig.5, n = 8). Oxidized ATP, an irreversible antagonist at the P2X7 receptor (30Murgia M. Hanau S. Pizzo P. Rippa M. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8199-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduced the activity-dependent current (6 of 8 cells, not shown). Thus, the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of the activity-dependent current in osteoclasts are similar to those reported for P2X7 currents in other systems. Immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the expression of P2X7 receptors in osteoclasts. These experiments were carried out using rat osteoclasts because of the binding of the secondary antibody to endogenous immunoglobulins present in preparations of rabbit osteoclasts. Positive immunostaining for P2X7 was observed in most multinucleated cells (Fig.6A; 143 of 146 osteoclasts from three separate experiments). In contrast, positive staining was observed in only 30% of the mononucleated cells, most likely monocytes and osteoclast precursors. Staining was not apparent in spindle-shaped stromal cells also found in these preparations. As negative controls, primary antibody was preincubated with antigen peptide or omitted. In these preparations, virtually all cytochemical staining was abolished (Fig. 6B). To determine whether endogenous P2X7 receptors elevate [Ca2+]i, we measured changes of [Ca2+]i in isolated rabbit osteoclasts in response to repetitive agonist stimulation. 100 µm ADPβS (a P2Y-selective agonist) or 100 µm ATP induced transient elevations of [Ca2+]i that desensitized with successive applications (Fig. 7,A and B, observed in 5 of 5 and 6 of 6 cells tested, respectively). Similarly, 100 µm UTP (a P2Y2 agonist) elicited only an initial response in 8 of 10 cells (2 cells did not respond). 100–300 µm BzATP or a high concentration of ATP (1 mm) induced an initial transient elevation of [Ca2+]i, but notably continued applications led to the progressive development of a sustained [Ca2+]i elevation (Fig. 7, C and D). This activity-dependent rise of [Ca2+]i was observed in 44 of 52 osteoclasts stimulated in this way but was not observed in response to ADPβS, UTP, or lower concentrations of ATP, distinguishing it from P2Y-mediated responses. Thus, successive stimulation with BzATP elicits elevation of [Ca2+]i with a pattern resembling the activity-dependent P2X7current described above. P2 antagonists were used to investigate which receptor subtype mediates the activity-dependent rise of [Ca2+]i. 100 µmoxidized ATP, which inhibited the activity-dependent current, also caused a gradual reduction of the BzATP-induced rise of [Ca2+]i (Fig.8A). Such a blockade was observed in 7 of 8 cells tested, with no reversal seen on washout of antagonist. We next tested PPADS, which is reported to inhibit P2X7, but not P2Y2 or P2X4receptors (6Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). 100 µm PPADS did not block the initial rise of [Ca2+]i but did prevent the activity-dependent component (Fig. 8B, 5 of 5 cells). We next examined the source of Ca2+mediating the activity-dependent changes of [Ca2+]i. After successive stimulation with BzATP, the progressive rise of [Ca2+]i was abolished upon removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.9A, in 6 of 6 osteoclasts studied). This effect was fully reversible on readdition of Ca2+ (Fig. 9A, right), consistent with BzATP-induced influx of Ca2+. To test the possibility that the BzATP-induced rise of [Ca2+]i was dependent on extracellular Na+, we studied the response of osteoclasts bathed in solutions in which NMG+ was substituted for Na+. Even in the absence of Na+, BzATP continued to induce elevations of [Ca2+]i in 7 out of 7 cells tested (Fig. 9B), ruling out a requirement for extracellular Na+. We note that in Na+-free solutions, the BzATP-mediated rise of [Ca2+]ideveloped rapidly. Even when studied in solutions containing Na+, this rapid development was observed in 22 of 52 osteoclasts studied, whereas the response developed gradually in the remaining cells. The rapid response, like the gradually developing response, was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Thus, although the initial nucleotide-induced rise of [Ca2+]i is caused by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (20Weidema A.F. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1531-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activity-dependent rise of [Ca2+]i represents a Ca2+ influx pathway that has hitherto not been demonstrated in osteoclasts. Patch clamp recording allowed us to evaluate the link between activity-dependent elevations of [Ca2+]i and membrane current. A rise of [Ca2+]i has previously been shown to activate intermediate conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in osteoclasts (21Weidema A.F. Barbera J. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 303-315Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When studied using a K+-containing electrode solution, ATP elicited a biphasic response, with an initial inward P2X4 current followed by outward K+current caused by the P2Y receptor-mediated release of Ca2+from stores (Fig. 10A). The I-V relationships confirm the different selectivity of the early and late currents (Fig. 10A, right). Subsequent stimulations with BzATP evoked an inward current that reversed near 0 mV, but no outward current, indicating desensitization of P2Y receptors (Fig. 10B). A striking change was observed with further stimulations, where we observed progressive development of Ca2+-dependent K+ current (4 of 6 cells, Fig. 10C). This channel provided us with a physiological indicator of a rise of [Ca2+]i, confirming activity-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i in osteoclasts. We next used combined patch clamp and fluorescence techniques to investigate the relationship between activity-dependent current and changes of [Ca2+]i. The BzATP-induced current was closely associated with graded elevations of [Ca2+]i (Fig"

However, there is evidence for its involvement in growth control, maintenance of genomic stability, DNA repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Consistently, Gadd45a has previously been shown to interact in vitro and/orin vivo with a number of proteins playing central roles in these cellular processes: proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p21Cip1/Waf1, Cdc2-CyclinB complex, MTK1, and histones. Adding to this complexity, we have found that Gadd45a self-associates in solution, both in vitro and when expressed in the cell. Moreover, Gadd45a can complex with the two other members of the Gadd45 family of stress-induced proteins, human Gadd45b (MyD118) and Gadd45g (CR6). Gel-exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoretic analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and chemical cross-linking showed that recombinant Gadd45a forms dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric species in vitro, the dimers being the predominant form. Deletion mutant and peptide scanning analyses suggest that Gadd45a has two self-association sites: within N-terminal amino acids 33–61 and within 40 C-terminal amino acids. Despite the low abundance of Gadd45a in the cell, oligomer-forming concentrations can probably be achieved in the foci-like nuclear structures formed by the protein upon overexpression.

Gel-exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoretic analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and chemical cross-linking showed that recombinant Gadd45a forms dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric species in vitro, the dimers being the predominant form. Deletion mutant and peptide scanning analyses suggest that Gadd45a has two self-association sites: within N-terminal amino acids 33–61 and within 40 C-terminal amino acids. Despite the low abundance of Gadd45a in the cell, oligomer-forming concentrations can probably be achieved in the foci-like nuclear structures formed by the protein upon overexpression. Evidence for a potential role of Gadd45a self-association in altering DNA accessibility on damaged nucleosomes is presented. proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody dimethylsuberimidate dithiothreitol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay horseradish peroxidase glutathioneS-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bacteriophage T4 UV endonuclease V ultraviolet radiation (254 nm) polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline Gadd45a is a member of a mammalian protein family that includes two other homologous proteins, Gadd45b/MyD118 and Gadd45g/CR6 (1Fornace Jr, A.J.

Transcription of the genes encoding these proteins is induced by various kinds of DNA-damaging agents and/or a number of stresses associated with growth arrest. Gadd45a is the only member of the family whose up-regulation has a p53 component. Its gene has a very strong p53-binding site in the third intron (5Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F.

Gadd45a is a relatively small, 18.4 kDa, and highly acidic protein. It is of low abundance in the cell and is thought to localize primarily in the nucleus (6Carrier F. Smith M. Bae I. Kilpatrick K.E.

Gadd45a shares with Gadd45b and Gadd45g this extreme charge characteristic and may act synergistically with them in promoting cell growth arrest upon overexpression in the cell (7Zhan Q. Lord K.A.

Besides this originally discovered role in suppression of cell growth (1Fornace Jr, A.J. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The role(s) of Gadd45 proteins in these fundamental cellular processes are supported by several observations made both in vitro and in a mouse model.

Gadd45a and Gadd45b interact with PCNA,1 which is an indispensable component of the DNA repair mechanism (8Smith M. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M.

The role of Gadd45a in repair may also be realized through its ability to bind histones and modify accessibility of DNA on damaged chromatin (15Carrier F. Georgel P.T. Pourquier P. Blake M. Konty U.H. Antinore M.J. Gariboldi M. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Pommier Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Gadd45a interacts with p21 (Cip1, Wip1, Cdkn1A), a particularly important cell cycle regulator protein (16Kearsey J.M. Coates P.J. Prescott A.R. Warbrick E. Hall P.A.

Gadd45a forms a specific complex with Cdc2-CyclinB mitosis promoting complex and inhibits its kinase activity, which is crucial for G2-M progression (19Wang X.W. Zhan Q. Coursen J.D.

In addition Gadd45 proteins seem to directly bind and activate stress-responsive MTK1/MEKK4 kinase (4Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Even though these findings provide important clues to the cellular role(s) of Gadd45a protein, its function(s) remains poorly understood. In characterization of the function of any protein, especially of a protein participating in as multiple interactions as Gadd45a, it is important to establish a potential for self-association. In many cases formation of higher order oligomeric structures contributes crucially to protein functionality and its regulation and extends its ability to interact with other cellular targets (22Zhang J. Hug B. Huang E.Y. Chen C.W. Gelmetti V. Maccarana M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Engel J. Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hence, understanding of potential homo- and hetero-interactions among Gadd45 proteins can aid in our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which these proteins carry out their roles in multiple cellular processes. Here we present evidence that Gadd45a protein can self-associate bothin vitro and in the cell. It was found that two distinct regions of Gadd45a are involved in self-association. These regions at least partially overlap with PCNA binding domains, thus implying functional roles for self-association. As another clue for its functional relevance, it was found that the oligomeric state of Gadd45a may regulate its effect on accessibility of DNA on damaged chromatin. Moreover, Gadd45a is capable of forming hetero-complexes with two other Gadd45 proteins. These observations suggest a potentially complex network of interactions underlying the functions of Gadd45 proteins. Escherichia coli and human constructs expressing Gadd45 proteins with or without N-terminal tag were obtained by inserting PCR amplified fragment containing Gadd45 open reading frames into suitable expression vectors. Primers for PCR amplification of inserts consisted of 15 or 18 nucleotides corresponding to open reading frame sequence flanked with restriction endonuclease sites that were used for cloning. The following combinations of templates containing Gadd45 open reading frames, restriction endonuclease sites, and endonuclease-digested expression vectors were employed.

Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for PCR amplification. Cloning was carried out according to manufacturer's protocol provided with the Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. PCR-amplified inserts and expression vectors were treated with endonucleases and agarose gel-purified before ligation reactions. All expression constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. Constructs for expression of myc-tagged Gadd45a deletion mutants in mammalian cells were described previously (21Jin S. Antinore M.J. Lung F.T. Dong X. Zhao H. Fan F. Colchagie A.B. Blanck P.

Competent E. coli B834(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) were transfected with pET21-Gadd45a vector for untagged protein. Three-ml mini-cultures of LB supplemented with 100 µg/ml carbenicillin and 1% glucose (growth medium) were inoculated with several distinct overnight colonies and grown until anA600 of 0.5 was reached. Mini-cultures were expanded into 50-ml cultures of fresh growth medium and subsequently into 1-liter cultures. Large scale cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.5 at 37 °C followed by temperature shift to 28 °C. Protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration 1 mm. After 3 h of induction at 28 °C, cells were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For purification, cells were thawed, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, ∼20 ml/g of frozen cells), incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml, 30 min), and briefly sonicated to complete lysis and shred genomic DNA. All manipulations were on ice. Four m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, was slowly added to crude lysate (1 m final concentration). After 1-h incubation on ice, lysate was cleared by centrifugation (SS34 rotor, 12 Krpm, 30 min, 4° C). Cleared lysate was filtered (Millex-GV, 0.22 µm, Durapore, low protein-binding syringe filter unit Millipore, SLGV 025LS) and loaded onto HiPrep 16/10 phenyl-Sepharose, high substitution column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A plus 1 m ammonium sulfate. Buffer A composition: 25 mm K+MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A plus 0.2 m ammonium sulfate followed by 100 ml of buffer A plus 0.1 m ammonium sulfate. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 100 ml of buffer A plus 0.1 m ammonium sulfate to 100 ml of buffer A followed by additional 100 ml of buffer A. Fractions containing Gadd45a were pooled and directly loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 DEAE (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.05m KCl. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A plus 0.1 m KCl. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 125 ml of buffer A plus 0.1 m KCl to buffer A plus 0.5m KCl. Fractions, which contained Gadd45a, were pooled and concentrated to <5 ml using Stir Unit 8200 (Millipore) and a YM10 (Millipore) membrane. The salt content of pooled fractions was ∼210–220 mm KCl as determined by conductivity measurement. Concentrated protein was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography on HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.2 m KCl. Protein was eluted with the same buffer. The concentration of protein in fractions containing the purest Gadd45a was determined spectrophotometrically (25Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar) based on extinction coefficient 14,000m−1 cm−1 calculated using Expasy proteomic tool (www. expasy.ch) and/or by Bradford assay using BSA as a standard. Fractions were aliquoted, frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Molecular mass markers for gel-filtration chromatography were run on the column under the same conditions in duplicate for calibration. Elution of dextran blue was used to determine the void volume of the column. Elution volumes and partition coefficients of the standards and samples were calculated according to Amersham Pharmacia Biotechprotocol. Laemmli discontinuous system without SDS was used for native gel separations. Mobilities of proteins were determined in 8, 10, 12, and 14% gels. Protein concentrations were adjusted to ∼1 mg/ml with loading buffer. Ten or 20 µg of protein was loaded onto gel. Relative electrophoretic mobilities (Rf) were calculated relative to the mobility of bromphenol blue. Calibration markers for native gels were from Sigma. Calibration curves were obtained and molecular masses calculated according to Refs. 26Rodbard D. Chrambach A. Anal.

Dimethylsuberimidate (DMS) and disuccinimidyl glutarate chemical cross-linkers were from Pierce. Solutions of these cross-linkers were prepared and reactions carried out according to manufacturer's recommendations. In the case of DMS, a stock solution of reagent (25 mg/ml) was prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9. Reactions were conducted for 30 min at 25 °C in 20-µl volume of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 10 µm protein, and 5 mg/ml DMS and varying KCl and DTT concentrations (Fig. 3). Reactions were stopped by adding 2 µl of 1m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8. Reactions were adjusted to 1 × SDS loading buffer, boiled, and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Protein products were detected by Coomassie Blue G-250 staining. Unstained protein molecular mass markers for denaturing gels (broad range, Bio-Rad) were run along the samples on the same gels. Microtiter plates (Immulon II, Dynatech) were coated with higly purified Gadd45a protein by incubating wells with 50 µl of protein diluted in PBS (2 µg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and blocking with 4% BSA, purified GST-Gadd45a (or GST in control) protein 2-fold serially diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA was added to the wells. Following 2-h incubation at 25 °C and extensive washing with PBST, anti-GST monoclonal Ab (Covance Resarch Products) diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS was applied to the wells for 1 h. Following reactions, plates were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse sheep Ab (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:10000 in 1% BSA/PBS. Following 1-h incubation and washing, 0.4 mg/ml solution of o-phenylendiamine (Sigma) in citric-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.02% hydrogen peroxide was added for color development at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped in 30 min with 2 m sulfuric acid, and optical density at 490 nm was measured using a plate reader (Molecular Dynamics). In the case of peptide scan analysis, the same basic steps were followed except that different Gadd45a-derived peptides were immobilized on microtiter plates. The synthesis and sequence of peptides as well as details of ELISA procedure were described previously (21Jin S. Antinore M.J. Lung F.T. Dong X. Zhao H. Fan F. Colchagie A.B. Blanck P. Roller P.P.

Transfections were carried out with Effectene reagent according to manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). For immunoanalyses, cell cultures were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, lysed on ice in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmβ-glycerolphosphate; 0.6 ml per P100 plate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (for mammalian cell and tissue extracts, Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. For immunoblot, an aliquot of lysate was supplemented with SDS loading buffer to 1× final concentration, and denatured by boiling. Twenty-five to 100 µg of total protein were typically loaded onto pre-made 12% SDS-PAGE (Novex) and electrophoresed. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk in PBST and proteins analyzed with specific primary Abs diluted in 5% dry milk followed by extensive washing in PBS and incubation with secondary HRP-conjugated Ab diluted 1:5000. Following extensive washing in PBS, blots were developed with ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primary Abs were used for immunoblot analysis: anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab M2 (Sigma) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 conjugated with HRP (Sigma), anti-HA polyclonal Ab (Covance Research Products), anti-c-myc-tag monoclonal Ab 9E10 (Santa Cruz), anti-Gadd45a polyclonal Ab H-165 (Santa Cruz). Secondary Abs were sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, 0.5 or 1 mg of cleared total lysates were incubated with affinity matrix anti-FLAG(M2)-agarose (Sigma), anti-HA-agarose (Covance Research Products), or anti-c-myc-agarose (Santa Cruz), for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Isolated immunocomplexes were washed five times in RIPA buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Cells stably expressing FLAG-Gadd45a protein were used for immunofluorescence analysis. To obtain these cells, RKO human colorectal carcinoma cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-Gadd45a plasmid and plasmid carrying puromycin resistance in 10:1 ratio. For control cell lines, pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG vector was employed instead of pFLAG-Gadd45a. After 1 week selection in medium with 2 µg/ml puromycin, clones expressing pFLAG-Gadd45a protein were determined by immunoblot analysis of total lysates using anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab. Expression of Gadd45a protein in FLAG-positive clones was verified by immunoblot with anti-Gadd45a Ab. For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded onto coverslips 24 h before fixation in 95% ethanol:5% acetic acid for 10 min at 25 °C. Cellular localization of pFLAG-Gadd45a was probed with anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab (1:100 dilution) and visualized with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:600. Slides were mounted in 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing medium (Vectashield), and immunofluorescence was examined on an Olympus AX70 microscope. Nucleosome core particles isolated from chicken erythrocytes were a kind gift from Dr. Yu. Postnikov (NCI, NIH). One µg of core particles was labeled for 10 min at 30 °C in 10 µl of polynucleotide kinase reaction buffer (Stratagene) with 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 units of T4 polynucleotidekinase (Stratagene). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 µl of 100 mm EDTA. Glycerol was added to 2% final concentration and the reaction electrophoresed on pre-run 5% PAGE. Core particles and free DNA, separated by electrophoresis, were isolated from crushed gel slices by overnight incubation in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 100 µg/ml BSA. Extracted molecules were cleaned of gel material by centrifugation through filter columns (Millipore) and dialyzed against T4 UV endo buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) in Microdialyzer System 100 using 50-kDa cut-off membranes (Pierce). Dialysis was according to Pierce protocol. Electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide showed that core particles obtained in this way contained less than 5% of free DNA (data not shown). The T4 UV endo protection assay on UV-damaged nucleosomes has been described previously (15Carrier F. Georgel P.T. Pourquier P. Blake M. Konty U.H. Antinore M.J. Gariboldi M. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Pommier Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, core particles and free DNA were UV-irradiated, and about 20 ng of the material was incubated with 0.5 µl of T4 UV endo stock supplied by Dr. D. Yarosh (AGI Dermatics) with or without Gadd45a protein for 30 min at 37 °C. The final reaction volume was 5 µl. Reactions were stopped by addition of 20 µl of 90% formamide in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) containing electrophoretic dyes. Samples were boiled for 10 min and 5 µl electrophoresed on pre-run 6% PAGE containing 7 m urea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. To enrich the oligomeric fraction in Gadd45a samples used in the T4 protection assay (Gadd45o), highly purified protein was incubated on ice for 15 min with 10 µm NiCl2 followed by dialysis to T4 reaction buffer using a Microdialyzer and 5-kDa cut-off membranes (Pierce). Gadd45a samples with preferentially monomeric species (Gadd45m) were treated in the same way except that NiCl2 exposure was omitted. Gel-filtration chromatography was used as a final step in the purification of Gadd45 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Protein was already about 90% pure after the two preceding chromatographic steps. Chromatography on Sephacryl S200 clearly separates most of remaining higher molecular mass contaminants. The resulting protein was estimated to be more than 99% pure. Gadd45a was eluted from the column as a single peak, although with some “tailing” in the front, suggesting the presence of higher molecular mass species. Molecular mass standards for gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were run through the column to obtain a calibration plot for determination of protein partition coefficients (Fig. 1). Comparison of the Gadd45a peaks from three purification runs with this calibration plot yielded an apparent molecular mass estimate of 30 ± 4 kDa. 2It is assumed that Gadd45 is roughly globular, which is strongly suggested by secondary structure predictions (EXPASY proteomics tools server). The molecular mass of Gadd45a calculated from its amino acid sequence is 18.4 kDa. This suggested that under the conditions of chromatography Gadd45a existed as a dimer or as monomer and dimer in rapid equilibrium. Analysis of the relative electrophoretic mobilities (Rf) of the globular proteins in nondenaturing gels provides a sensitive technique to determine the aggregation state of the protein and estimate molecular masses of the oligomeric species (26Rodbard D. Chrambach A. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 40: 95-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 27Gallagher S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seldman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocls in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ1999: 10.2.B.1-10.2.B.10Google Scholar). At least four bands can be resolved when Gadd45a at 1 mg/ml (starting concentration) is electrophoresed through such gels (Fig.2A). In contrast, only one band can be detected when the same amount of the protein is run under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2B). Thus, the additional bands in native conditions may represent oligomers of Gadd45a containing from two to four subunits. To estimate molecular masses of these presumed oligomers, molecular mass protein standards for native gel (Sigma) were electrophoresed along with the Gadd45a in duplicate through native gels of differing acrylamide percentage (%T).

To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the AMPA receptor dynamics, cultured hippocampal neurons were stimulated with 100 µm NMDA, and the biochemical and pharmacological changes in the ligand binding activity of AMPA receptor complexes and its subunits, GluR1 and GluR2/3, were investigated. The NMDA treatment reduced the total amount of bound [3H]AMPA on the surface of the neurons but not in their total membrane fraction. This process was mimicked by a protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester, but blocked by an inhibitor of the same kinase, calphostin C. The NMDA-induced down-regulation of the ligand binding activity was also reflected by the decreased AMPA-triggered channel activity as well as by the cells' reduced immunoreactivity for GluR1. In parallel, the NMDA treatment markedly altered the interaction between the AMPA receptor subunits and their associating molecule(s); the association of PDZ molecules, including Pick1, with GluR2/3 was enhanced in a protein-kinase-C-dependent manner. Viral expression vectors carrying GluR1 and GluR2 C-terminal decoys, both fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein, were transfected into hippocampal neurons to disrupt their interactions. The overexpression of the C-terminal decoy for GluR2 specifically and significantly blocked the NMDA-triggered reduction in [3H]AMPA binding, whereas that for GluR1 had no effects. Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Pick1 antibodies revealed that the overexpressed GluR2 C-terminal decoy indeed prevented Pick1 from interacting with the endogenous GluR2/3. Therefore, these observations suggest that the NMDA-induced down-regulation of the functional AMPA receptors involves the interaction between GluR2/3 subunits and Pick1.

The most recent physiological studies have suggested that an exocytotic process of these receptor channels to the postsynaptic sites may form the basis of the NMDA-dependent hippocampal LTP (1Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trinble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Conversely, the elimination of the receptors from the synaptic surface has been suggested to associate with hippocampal LTD (2Luscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 6: 545-550Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The former synaptic plasticity is known to require the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase α (3Lee H.K. Barbarosie M.

Through the NMDA receptor channels, the influx of calcium ions can lead to the activation of these two protein kinases, each of which results in opposing synaptic changes. Although it remains to be established how both types of synaptic plasticity are switched on and off following the postsynaptic influx of calcium ions, postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins should contribute to such synaptic processes. There are a large variety of PSD proteins and other molecules that can interact with AMPA receptor subunits. The AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 is known to interact with SAP97, Narp, and Lyn through various subdomains of this subunit (7Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), the real dynamics of the functional AMPA receptor complexes and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) have not been fully characterized. For instance, which AMPA receptor subunit governs the dynamics of the whole receptor complex? Which adaptor molecule accordingly regulates the pharmacological change of the AMPA receptors? In cultured hippocampal neurons, we attempted to address these questions by monitoring their ligand binding activity and molecular interactions. Using the Sindbis viral expression vector carrying AMPA receptor decoys, here we investigated the AMPA receptor subunits and domains responsible for the NMDA-induced pharmacological changes of AMPA receptors. Hippocampal tissues were taken from embryos of Sprague-Dawley rats (embryonic day 18) and dissociated with 1 mg/ml papain solution. Hippocampal neurons were plated at a density of ∼5.0 × 105 cells/ml with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, and grown for 6–7 days in serum-free conditions, as described previously (21Nagano T. Iwakura Y. Ushiki T. Nawa H. Kieo Univ. Symp. Life Sci. Med. 1999; 2: 386-389Google Scholar). These cultures typically contained less than 5% nonneuronal cells, as monitored by antiglial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining (22Nawa H. Bessho Y. Carnahan J. Nakanishi S. Mizuno K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 772-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The stimulation of NMDA or PKC was carried out as follows. Hippocampal neurons were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and then exposed to 100 µm NMDA (Sigma) or 1 µmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem) for 10 min in HEPES-buffered Hanks' solution containing 1 mm glycine but no magnesium ions. After 10 min, the stimulation was terminated by application of an NMDA receptor antagonist,d-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 µm; Sigma), and cultures were further incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The treatment did not lead to severe neuronal damage; 98, 89, and 92% of hippocampal neurons were alive 40 min, 3 h, and 24 h after the NMDA stimulation, respectively, as revealed by the dye exclusion assay (23Andreoni G. Angeretti N. Lucca E. Forloni G. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 148: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Haberecht M.F. Mitchell C.K. Lo G.J. Redburn D.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Prior to the NMDA treatment, cultures were preincubated with the protein kinase inhibitors K252b (100 nm; Calbiochem), calphostin C (1 µm; Wako), or KN93 (370 nm; Calbiochem). Cultured neurons were rinsed with Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 µm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 g/liter glucose. [3H]AMPA (1561 GBq/mmol, 37 MBq/ml; Amersham, Japan) was adjusted to 50 nm with the Tris buffer and diluted with 0–1000 nm cold AMPA (RBI). Neurons were incubated with these AMPA solutions on ice for 60 min as described previously (25Hall R.A. Bahr B.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,26Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After washing with the cold Tris buffer, neurons were lysed with 0.5 n NaOH, and the radioactivity of the cell lysates was counted by the Liquid Scintillation System LSC-3050 (Aloka). Electrophysiological analysis was performed at room temperature (24–26 °C) following the treatment with 100 µm NMDA. Membrane currents were monitored after being low pass-filtered at 3 kHz by the amplifier (Axoclamp 2B; Axon Instruments), and data were analyzed with pClamp6 software (Axon Instruments). The hippocampal culture medium was replaced with Krebs-Ringer solution, which consisted of 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, 20 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. A hippocampal neuron was held with a glass electrode (6–8 MΩ) containing 130 mm CsMeSO2, 10 mmCsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm ethylene glycol-bis-(oxonitrilo)tetraacetic acid, 5 mmQX-314·Cl− (Alomone Laboratories), 3 mmMg-ATP, pH 7.4, and clamped at −78 mV. AMPA (RBI) was dissolved in the same solution and applied locally to a neuron by positive air pressure (4 p.s.i., 20 ms) through a different glass pipette. If data exhibited changes in series resistance of greater than 20% during experiments, they were excluded from analysis. To visualize the AMPA receptors on the cell surface, hippocampal neurons were treated in culture with 20 µg/ml rabbit antibodies raised against the amino terminus of GluR1 (27Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, neurons were incubated with the Cy3-labeled secondary anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies (1:500, Vector Laboratories) in the presence of 10% normal goat serum. Alternatively, the neurons that had been preincubated with the anti-GluR1 antibodies were similarly stimulated with NMDA, and the remaining anti-GluR1 antibodies on the cell surface were then removed with an acid-phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.25 m acetic acid (a process known as acid stripping) (28Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Internalized GluR1 immunoreactivity was visualized by following fixation of the cell and subsequent immunostaining with secondary antibodies in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoreactivity was observed and pictured with the aid of a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axioskop). Neurons in culture were harvested with a cell scraper and transferred into a microtube. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose solution containing a protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 mm leupeptin (Wako), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.5 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4 (Sigma)) and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the membrane fraction was obtained and solubilized with 1% sodium deoxycholate (12Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Total cell lysate (1 mg) was incubated at 4 °C for 12–16 h with 10 µg of anti-Pick1 (30Staudinger J. Jianrong L.U. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), anti-GRIP1 (31Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), or anti-panPDZ antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The resulting immunocomplexes were precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein samples for Western blotting were prepared from cultured neurons or from immunoprecipitates. These samples were homogenized in 2% SDS by sonication and denatured in the presence of 100 µm dithiothreitol (Wako) at 95 °C for 5 min. In parallel, their protein concentrations were determined by a micro-BCA kit (Protein Assay Reagent; Pierce). Typically, 20 µg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) by electrophoresis. The membrane was probed with anti-C-terminal GluR1 antibodies (1:1000; Chemicon), anti-C-terminal GluR2/3 antibodies (1:1000; Chemicon), or antibodies raised against enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP; 1:500; CLONTECH). After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity on the membrane was detected with an anti-rabbit/mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by a chemiluminescence reaction. The immunoreactivity of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis. The modified EGFP that carried either the carboxyl-terminal sequence of GluR1 (SSGMPLGATGL) or that of GluR2 (GYNVYGIESVKI) was constructed as follows. Using the EGFP expression vector pIRES/EGFP (CLONTECH) as a template, the polymerase chain reaction was performed with the forward primer for the PsG region, TACGGTGGTCCTAAATAGTC, and with the reverse primers corresponding to the stop codon of the fused proteins of EGFP and the above amino acid sequences: CTACTAAATTTTAACACTCTCGATGCCATATACGTTGTAACCCTTGTACAGCTCGTC (for GluR1) and CTATTACAATCCTGTGGCTCCCAAGGGCATCCCTGAACTCTTGTACAGCTCGTC (for GluR2). Polymerase chain reaction products were cut with the restriction enzymes XbaI and NotI, and these DNA cassettes were replaced by the 3′-translation region of the EGFP sequence in pSindRep5 (32Shi S.H. Hayashi Y. Petralia R.S. Zaman S.H. Wenthold R.J. Svoboda K. Malinow R. Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Viral genome RNA was transcribed in vitro from these constructs by SP6 RNA polymerase using an Invitroscript CAP kit (Invitrogen) and co-transfected with mRNAs coding viral coat proteins into BHK cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The infectivity of the Sindbis virus particles was titered with BHK cells by serial dilution. Typically, we obtained a viral titer of more than 107pfu/ml. Hippocampal neurons were exposed to the Sindbis viral vectors at a titer of >107 pfu/ml for 1 h. After washing, the neurons were further incubated in regular growth medium at 37 °C for 6–12 h. The expression of EGFP from the vectors was monitored with the aid of the fluorescence microscope. At the viral titer used for transfection, more than 94% of neurons showed green fluorescence (see Fig. 6). One-factor ANOVA was employed to analyze the differences in [3H]AMPA binding or immunoreactivity. Given distributions of the values of electrophysiological data and comparisons between NMDA-treated or control groups were made with the Mann-Whitney U test. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The radiolabeled receptor assay method allows measurement of the amounts of radiolabeled ligands bound to cell membranes and enables characterization of the pharmacological properties of its receptors, such as the number of functional receptors (B max) and the dissociation constant for their ligands (K d) (25Hall R.A. Bahr B.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, this assay was used with 3H-labeled AMPA to assess the effects of NMDA treatment on the ligand binding activity of functional AMPA receptors expressed on the surface of cultured hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic rats, grown in serum-free conditions for 7 days (21Nagano T. Iwakura Y. Ushiki T. Nawa H. Kieo Univ. Symp. Life Sci. Med. 1999; 2: 386-389Google Scholar) and then treated with 100 µm NMDA for 10 min. Thirty minutes after the NMDA treatment, various concentrations of [3H]AMPA were applied to the cultures and the binding of the radioactive ligand to neurons was measured. The values of bound [3H]AMPA were subjected to Scatchard plotting, and the total amount (B max) and the dissociation constant (K d) of the functional AMPA receptors were estimated (Fig. 1). The NMDA treatment significantly decreased theB max of the AMPA receptors on the cell surface to 55% that of the control. The dissociation constant of the AMPA receptors (K d) decreased from 454 ± 22 to 289 ± 20 nm. This result indicates that the exposure of hippocampal neurons to NMDA decreased the total number of the AMPA receptors on their surface. The above results raised the question of how the functional AMPA receptors were depleted from the cell surface. To address this question, we carried out the same radiolabeled receptor assay using the total membrane fraction of hippocampal neurons as a target material (26Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fraction contained total cell membranes, including intracellular membranes. The NMDA treatment failed to exert a significant influence on the B max of the AMPA receptors in the total membrane fraction, although NMDA did increase the affinity of the AMPA receptors 2-fold. These observations imply that the reduction in surface [3H]AMPA binding could be attributed to the internalization of AMPA receptors from the neuronal surface. Electrophysiological studies have suggested that chemical exposure of hippocampal slice preparations to glutamate or NMDA induces long term depression of synaptic currents, namely chemically induced LTD (14Lissin D.V. Carroll R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Von Zastrow M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has yet to be established whether the down-regulation of AMPA receptor binding is correlated with a functional decrease in their channel activities. In the present study, AMPA-induced currents were measured in hippocampal neurons by the whole-cell patch clamp method. Cultured hippocampal neurons, which were pretreated with or without NMDA, were voltage-clamped at −78 mV, and 100 µm AMPA was applied to their soma by pressure injection (Fig. 2). The AMPA currents were significantly decreased to 51.3 ± 17.1% (n= 7) of control values by the NMDA treatment. The magnitude of the reduction in AMPA currents was similar to that for the surface [3H]AMPA binding, as shown earlier. These results further confirm that the down-regulation of their cell surface expression reflects the decrease in channel activities. In parallel, the membrane capacitance of hippocampal neurons and current densities were reduced to 82 ± 11.4 and 65 ± 9.8% of control values, respectively. The latter changes might be associated with the plasticity-related structural changes in hippocampal neurons such as membrane endocytosis or synapse elimination (5Man Y.H. Lin J.W. Ju W.H.

Hippocampal synaptic plasticity is associated with the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunits, which depends upon various protein kinases (3Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 4Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R.

To explore the intracellular signaling cascades leading to the AMPA receptor down-regulation, various kinase inhibitors were tested together with the NMDA treatment. Prior to the NMDA treatment, hippocampal neurons were pretreated with a PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (36Schmidt J.T. J.

The ligand-binding activity of the AMPA receptors was estimated by measuring the total binding of [3H]AMPA on the cell surface with the highest concentration (1 µm) of AMPA (Fig.3). In the NMDA-treated culture, the surface binding of [3H]AMPA decreased to 58 ± 8.2% of the control value. Only pretreatment with calphostin C significantly blocked the NMDA-triggered reduction in binding, whereas K252b and KN93 failed to inhibit the decrease. Thus, this pharmacological result implies that the down-regulation of AMPA binding requires the activation of PKC. In our hippocampal culture, NMDA treatment led to a reduction in the surface AMPA binding and channel activities of the AMPA receptor complexes presumably through the activation of PKC. Previous immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that similar chemical stimulation with glutamate results in the internalization of AMPA receptor subunits (15Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H.

These observations raised the question as to whether the down-regulation of AMPA receptor binding depends upon the internalization of these subunits. The total immunoreactivity to the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1, on the surface of hippocampal neurons was visualized by labeling with antibodies raised against its extracellular domain, without cell fixation (i.e. permeabilization). Alternatively, hippocampal neurons were similarly preexposed to the anti-GluR1 antibodies and subsequently subjected to the NMDA treatment. Then the GluR1 antibodies remaining on the cell surface were washed away by a short exposure to acid solution (27Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C.

Accordingly, the antibodies bound to the internalized AMPA receptor subunits escaped from the acid washing and were visualized by subsequent fixation and immunostaining for GluR1 (Fig.4). In the untreated control group, GluR1 immunoreactivity on the cell surface was much brighter than that inside the neurons. In the hippocampal neurons that were treated with NMDA or a PKC activator (PMA); however, the immunoreactivity on the cell surface was decreased in comparison with that on control cultures. Conversely, the intracellular immunoreactivity, which presumably reflected the internalized AMPA receptors, became more intense than the surface immunoreactivity (Fig. 4, C–F). In contrast, when the hippocampal neurons were exposed to NMDA in the presence of the PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, the surface immunoreactivity for the AMPA receptors was not translocated into cells (Fig. 4, G andH). Together with our pharmacological and electrophysiological findings on AMPA receptors, these immunohistochemical results indicate that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors triggers AMPA receptor internalization leading to their down-regulation in a PKC-dependent manner. Previous molecular studies have suggested that the postsynaptic compartment contains various PSD proteins that carry the PDZ domain(s) (29Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L.

The hormone is released in response to food intake and plays an important role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis (1Holst J.J. Annu. Rev.

In vivo, stimulation of the GLP-1R by endogenous hormone induces multiple complementary mechanisms, which together result in a lowering of circulating blood glucose levels. These mechanisms include receptor-mediated enhancement of glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, inhibition of gastric emptying with a delay in the gastrointestinal resorption of nutrients, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake (2Drucker D.J.

Consistent with these physiologic functions, it has been demonstrated that application of exogenous GLP-1 or related agonist peptides provides an effective approach for the treatment of adult-onset diabetes mellitus (14Gutniak M.

However, this therapeutic strategy is hampered by serious challenges, such as the susceptibility of peptides to rapid enzymatic inactivation and the need for parenteral drug administration. To overcome these limitations, efforts during the past decade have focused on the identification of small GLP-1R non-peptide ligands, potential drugs that would mimic the activity of endogenous hormone yet could be administered orally. To our knowledge, no non-peptide agonists have yet been reported for either the GLP-1R or for any other class B receptor. In fact, little is presently known about the potential binding domains in these proteins, which could be targeted by non-peptide ligands. Here we report that a non-peptide molecule, T-0632, has significant affinity for the GLP-1R and appears to allosterically block receptor function. The additional finding that T-0632 binds with almost 100-fold greater affinity to the human GLP-1R than to the rat receptor homolog (91% amino acid identity) enabled us to utilize receptor chimeras, followed by point mutations, for mapping a determinant of non-peptide binding to the extracellular amino terminus of the receptor. Understanding the mechanisms underlying T-0632 affinity provides novel insight on how non-peptide molecules can interact with class B GPCRs. Such information may ultimately enable a strategy whereby defined domains in the GLP-1 receptor could be targeted by non-peptide ligands and thus facilitate the discovery of future agonist drugs. Cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and from Intergen Company (Purchase, NY), respectively. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Bolton-Hunter-labeled 125I exendin (9–39) (2,200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled exendin (9–39) and GLP-1 (7–36) amide were obtained from American Peptide Company, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) and Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA), respectively.

The human GLP-1 receptor cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction based on a published sequence (4Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.P. Morel P. Widmann C. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construct was subcloned into pcDNA1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and assessed using an Applied Biosystems 373 automated DNA sequencer. The deduced amino acid sequence from the protein coding region was identical to the standard sequence as deposited in the Swiss-Prot Database (P43220). The rat GLP-1 receptor in the expression vector pcDNA1 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Dillon (17Wheeler M.B. Lu M. Dillon J.S. Leng X.H. Chen C. Boyd III, A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence from this clone corresponded to the sequence in Swiss-Prot, P32301, with two modifications as follows: (i) Leu321 (instead of Phe) and (ii) Ile323(instead of Val) as has been noted previously (18Lankat-Buttgereit B.

GLP-1 receptors that were distinct from the wild type proteins by either amino acid substitutions or introduction of translationally silent restriction sites were generated using oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis as described previously (19Beinborn M. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kopin A.S. Nature. 1993; 362: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides of interest were synthesized at the Tufts University DNA Synthesis Core Facility (Boston, MA). Introduction of desired mutations was confirmed by restriction enzyme analyses followed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. GLP-1 receptor chimeras were constructed after introducing translationally silentAflII, XhoI, EcoRI, or PvuI restriction sites into homologous positions of both the human and rat wild type receptor cDNAs (see above) or by using a BstXI restriction site, which naturally occurred in both of these cDNAs. The positions of the restriction sites in the human receptor nucleotide coding sequence were as follows: AflII, 1307–1312;XhoI, 1124–1129; EcoRI, 898–903;BstXI, 636–647; and PvuI, 142–147. After digestion of corresponding human and rat receptor cDNAs, resulting fragments were gel-purified using the Geneclean II kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Amino-terminal DNA fragments from the human receptor were ligated with complementary carboxyl-terminal fragments from the rat cDNA, using the Ligation Express kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The sequences of the desired human/rat GLP-1 receptor chimeric cDNAs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. COS-7 cells (500,000 cells/10-cm dish) were grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G sodium/streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.4. The next day, cells were transiently transfected using the diethylaminoethyl-dextran method, with 5 μg of cDNA encoding the wild type, chimeric, or mutant GLP-1 receptors as described previously (20Kopin A.S. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Miller L.J. Lu M. Lin H.Y. Kolakowski L.F. Beinborn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3605-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded on 24-well plates (10,000 cells/well) and allowed to attach for an additional 24 h. Competition binding assays were performed in Hanks' balanced salt solution, supplemented with 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.15 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Also included was 0.4 μmPro-Boro-Pro ([1-(2-pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)-2-pyrrolidinyl]boronic acid), a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor that delays enzymatic degradation of GLP-1 and related peptides (21Flentke G.R.

W. Bachovchin (Tufts University, Boston, MA). Competition binding experiments were done using 15 pm125I exendin (9–39) as the radioligand, a peptide established previously as a high affinity GLP-1 receptor antagonist (4Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.P. Morel P. Widmann C. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Göke R. Fehmann H.C. Linn T. Schmidt H. Krause M. Eng J. Göke B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-saturable radioligand binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled exendin (9–39). Equilibrium binding occurred after incubation of cells at 21 °C for 100 min (preliminary experiments not shown). Cell monolayers were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (see above) and then hydrolyzed in 1n NaOH for γ counting (Beckman Gamma 5500B). 24 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded on 24-well plates (100,000 cells/well) and allowed to attach for an additional 24 h. To assess the effect of ligands on receptor signaling, cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm isobutyl-methylxanthine, 0.4 μm Pro-Boro-Pro, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Supernatants were then replaced with 0.1 n HCl, and the cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen. The extracts were neutralized, and cAMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (acetylation method) using a FlashPlate® kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plate-bound radioactivity was measured using a Packard Topcount® proximity scintillation counter. Radioligand competition binding and agonist/antagonist concentration-response curves from at least three independent experiments were calculated using GraphPad Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Statistical comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons post-tests, using InStat software version 3.0 for Windows (GraphPad). Analysis of the non-peptide molecule T-0632 for potential interactions with the GLP-1 receptor demonstrated its ability to displace the peptide radioligand, 125I exendin (9–39). At the human GLP-1 receptor, T-0632 bound with an apparentKi of 1.2 μm whereas the affinity of this compound at the rat receptor homolog was two orders of magnitude lower (Fig. 1). In contrast to the species selectivity of T-0632, the radioligand125I exendin (9–39) per se bound with comparable affinity to the human and rat GLP-1 receptor homologs. Homologous 125I exendin (9–39) competition experimentsversus unlabeled exendin (9–39) revealedKi values of 1.7 nm (CI, 0.5–5.6) and 1.4 nm (CI, 1.2–1.7) at the human and rat GLP-1 receptors, respectively (means and S.E. of three and five independent experiments). T-0632 had no detectable agonist activity when assessed for its ability to induce cAMP production in COS-7 cells expressing either the human or rat GLP-1 receptors (data not shown). This observation suggested that the compound was an antagonist. In fact, T-0632 inhibited GLP-1 (20 pm)-induced cAMP production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2). Consistent with its binding profile (Fig. 1), T-0632 had higher potency at the human (IC50 = 21 μm) than at the rat GLP-1 receptor (IC50 = 353 μm). Further study of T-0632 function at the human GLP-1 receptor suggested that this compound blocked agonist-induced cAMP production by a non-competitive mechanism (Fig. 3). In the presence of T-0632, the agonist concentration-response curve of GLP-1 was shifted to the right. At the same time, the maximum GLP-1-induced cAMP production decreased to 77 ± 3% of the corresponding value in the absence of T-0632. The considerable selectivity of T-0632 for the human versusthe rat GLP-1 receptor, despite the high degree of amino acid identity between these two proteins (91%) (Fig.4), suggested that it would be feasible to map the residue(s) underlying the species specificity of non-peptide binding. The limited number of divergent residues in the humanversus rat receptors (42 of a total of 463) were considered as candidate affinity determinants. In an attempt to narrow the range of amino acids that potentially contribute to T-0632 affinity, we constructed and characterized a series of chimeric GLP-1 receptors. The chimeras included amino-terminal portions from the human receptor protein complemented by increasing carboxyl-terminal substitutions from the rat homolog (Fig. 5). Competition binding experiments utilizing these receptors revealed that even a limited amino-terminal domain of the human GLP-1 receptor (note thePvuI chimera in Fig. 5) was sufficient to maintain T-0632 affinity close to the value observed at the wild type human protein. T-0632 affinity was conserved despite the fact that most of thePvuI chimera consisted of rat GLP-1 receptor amino acids, and only eight residues within the amino terminus remained as candidate T-0632 affinity determinants.Figure 5High affinity binding of T-0632 is determined by the amino terminus of the human GLP-1 receptor. Cartoons symbolize the human and rat wild type GLP-1 receptors (shown asblack and gray line graphs, respectively), as well as chimeric constructs of the human receptor with increasing carboxyl-terminal contributions from the rat species homolog. TheAflII, XhoI, EcoRI, BstXI, and PvuI chimeras were generated as detailed under “Methods.” Binding of 125I exendin (9–39) was assessed using COS-7 cells expressing respective receptor constructs. Non-displaceable binding in the presence of 20 μm T-0632 was normalized to control binding in the absence of compound (100%). Data represent means ± S.E. of n independent experiments as indicated in the figure.

Radioligand competition experiments at these point mutants revealed that replacement of tryptophan at position 33 in the human receptor by its homolog in the rat receptor, serine, significantly decreased T-0632 affinity close to the value observed at the rat wild type protein. In contrast, substitution of the remaining candidate amino acids, alone or in combination, had no effect on T-0632 binding. The marked loss of T-0632 affinity at the W33S mutant suggested that this residue plays an important role in compound binding. To further explore this hypothesis, a converse experiment was performed in which the serine residue in position 33 of the rat GLP-1 receptor was substituted with its human homolog, tryptophan. As illustrated in Fig.7A, radioligand competition at the S33W rat receptor mutant by T-0632 approached the level observed at the wild type human GLP-1 receptor. Further analysis of T-0632 binding over a broad concentration range showed that exchange of the residues occupying position 33 in the human (W) versus rat receptors (S) was sufficient to reverse the affinities observed at respective wild type proteins (Fig. 7B). The calculated affinity of T-0632 at the rat S33W mutant exceeds the corresponding value at the human W33S mutant by more than 100-fold. Thus, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments support the conclusion that GLP-1 receptor residue 33 is an important affinity determinant of T-0632 binding. To begin to explore the structural features that enable Trp33 in the human GLP-1 receptor to confer T-0632 affinity, we sequentially replaced this residue with a different aromatic amino acid (phenylalanine or tyrosine), with a residue that shared the amino group of tryptophan within the amino acid side chain (histidine or glutamine), or with a “minimized” residue that lacked any significant side chain (alanine). Each of these substitutions led to a significant increase in non-displaceable binding, reflecting a loss of T-0632 affinity compared with the human wild type GLP-1 receptor (Fig. 8). Among the mutants, a limited degree of T-0632 affinity appeared to be best preserved when tryptophan 33 was replaced with other aromatic residues (phenylalanine or tyrosine). The present study demonstrates that the interaction of a non-peptide ligand with the GLP-1 receptor is in large part dependent on a single residue within the amino terminus of the receptor, far distal from its junction with the first transmembrane domain. To our knowledge, there is no precedent in which a non-peptide binding determinant has been mapped to this domain in other G protein-coupled receptors. It is of note that the GLP-1 receptor is part of a distinct subgroup (class B) within the GPCR superfamily. Class B receptors share with the more extensively studied rhodopsin-type (class A) receptors a seven-transmembrane domain structure, as well as the ability to activate G-proteins, yet have virtually no amino acid sequence homology with class A proteins (7Ulrich C.D.

However, members of the class B subgroup have several features in common, including (i) conserved amino acid signature motifs, (ii) presence of a long amino-terminal extracellular extension, and (iii) relatively large peptide hormones as endogenous ligands. Despite ongoing efforts over the past decade, very few synthetic non-peptide ligands for any of the class B receptors have been discovered, and little is known about the principles that underlie the interaction of such compounds with their target proteins. We are only aware of one other example where specific receptor residues in a class B GPCR have been shown to influence the binding of a non-peptide ligand. In this case, corresponding amino acids were mapped to transmembrane domains 3 and 5 of the corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (23Liaw C.W. Grigoriadis D.E. Lorang M.T. De Souza E.B. Maki R.A.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2048-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and thus have a distribution pattern that resembles the transmembrane domain location of non-peptide affinity determinants in many class A GPCRs (24Cascieri M.A. Fong T.M. Strader C.D. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1995; 33: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Schwartz T.W. Gether U. Schambye H.T. Hjorth S.A. Curr. Pharm.

Observations in the present study raise the possibility that an alternative mechanism may underlie the binding of certain non-peptide ligands to the GLP-1 receptor, one that primarily relies on ligand interactions with the amino terminus of the receptor. However, an additional role of putative transmembrane domain residues cannot be excluded. It remains to be determined which amino acids other than Trp33 contribute to T-0632 affinity in the GLP-1 receptor. Such potentially important residues, if conserved between the human and rat receptor species homologs, would be difficult to identify by the strategy used in this study. Given the lack of synthetic non-peptide compounds that could be used as tools for exploring the molecular mechanisms of receptor-ligand interactions, prior studies with the GLP-1 receptor have exclusively focused on the analysis of binding determinants for the endogenous peptide hormone, GLP-1. Collectively, reported observations suggest that the extracellular amino terminus of the receptor plays a major role in GLP-1 binding (27Graziano M.P. Hey P.J. Strader C.D.

Jeng W. Wheeler M.B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An important contribution of the amino terminus to hormone binding is also well established for other class B GPCRs, e.g. the parathyroid hormone (32Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J.

McIntosh C.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2640-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several highly conserved tryptophan residues that occupy positions 39, 72, 91, 110, and 120 in the extracellular amino terminus of both the human and rat GLP-1 receptors are crucial for hormone binding and function (29Wilmen A. Van Eyll B. Göke B. Göke R. Peptides. 1997; 18: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The region defined by these potential peptide binding sites also contains six highly conserved cysteine residues, which in other class B receptors have been shown to form disulfide bridges and thereby provide a highly folded tertiary structure (40Asmann Y.W. Dong M. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast to these highly conserved residues, it is of note that tryptophan 33, the non-peptide-affinity determinant described in the present study, is only present in the human GLP-1 receptor and is not required for hormone binding. However, the apparent proximity of this residue to the putative hormone binding domain may explain the ability of compound T-0632 to act as an antagonist. In this scenario, it is possible that receptor occupation by T-0632 could result, e.g. in steric hindrance of hormone binding and/or indirect interference with the conformation of adjacent peptide binding sites. A potential mechanism by which T-0632 blocks hormone binding and function can be hypothesized extending from current theories of class B GPCR activation. Prior evidence for several of these receptors, including the GLP-1 receptor, suggests that interaction with endogenous hormones involves two consecutive steps, (i) scavenging of the cognate peptide by the extracellular amino terminus of the receptor (via binding of the carboxyl terminus of the ligand), and (ii) docking of the amino-terminal ligand portion to the extracellular loops of the receptor, as well as nearby sections of adjacent transmembrane domains (32Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F665-F675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Acta Physiol Scand. 1996; 157: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Step (ii) is considered to be the actual trigger of receptor stimulation. Based on this model, it is conceivable that T-0632 may primarily interfere with the initial scavenging step and thereby hinder, but not entirely prevent, the subsequent second step of hormone-induced receptor activation. The hypothesis that the mechanism of non-peptide binding does only partially overlap with that of GLP-1 is supported by our observation that T-0632 functions as a non-competitive inhibitor of agonist function. Thus, T-0632 may be considered as an allosteric modulator of receptor-hormone interaction, rather than a competitive antagonist (41Tucek S. Proska J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A pattern of non-competitive antagonism that resembles that of T-0632 has been observed for an endogenous metabolite of GLP-1 (42Knudsen L.B. Pridal L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 318: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 43Wettergren A. Wojdemann M. Holst J.J. Peptides. 1998; 19: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The metabolite is distinguished from the parent GLP-1 molecule by truncation of the first two amino-terminal residues and, like T-0632, appears to induce a rightward shift of the GLP-1 concentration-response curve with a concomitant decrease in maximal effect (42Knudsen L.B. Pridal L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 318: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of this antagonism has not been explored fully, we hypothesize that the GLP-1 metabolite functions by a mechanism similar to the one discussed here for T-0632. The truncated peptide may non-competitively inhibit GLP-1 function by interfering with the initial hormone-scavenging step at the receptor (via the intact carboxyl terminus of the metabolite) and thereby compromise receptor stimulation by the full-length hormone. Non-competitive antagonism of hormone function has also been reported recently for a synthetic non-peptide ligand of the glucagon receptor (44Cascieri M.A. Koch G.E. Ber E. Sadowski S.J. Louizides D. de Laszlo S.E. Hacker C. Hagmann W.K. MacCoss M. Chicchi G.G. Vicario P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8694-8697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a member of the class B subfamily that is closely related to the GLP-1 receptor (49% amino acid identity). The glucagon antagonist (structurally unrelated to T-0632) was proposed to act via an allosteric mechanism, based on the observation that compound interactions with the receptor were modulated markedly by the experimental cation concentration. There are at least two potential modes of interaction by which tryptophan in position 33 of the GLP-1 receptor may confer T-0632 affinity. It is possible that this residue either directly interacts with the ligand and/or indirectly enables compound binding to the receptor by recruiting other receptor residues to form a ligand binding domain. In either case, it is apparent that this tryptophan residue provides a highly specific contribution to T-0632 binding to the human GLP-1 receptor, because this function could not be substituted by other structurally related amino acids (Fig. 8). A limited degree of T-0632 affinity, although at a considerably lower level than that observed at the wild type receptor, is maintained if the critical tryptophan residue is replaced by an amino acid that shares an aromatic side chain, e.g. phenylalanine. It is therefore possible that the unique role of tryptophan is, at least in part, based on aromatic stacking interactions, either with aromatic groups that are present in the T-0632 molecule (see inset in Fig. 1) and/or with other aromatic amino acids that are shared between the human and rat GLP-1 receptor homologs. The fact that introduction of a tryptophan at the corresponding position in the rat receptor is sufficient to confer T-0632 affinity (Fig. 7) suggests interspecies conservation of other potential residues that may participate in the interaction of Trp33 with the non-peptide ligand. It has been reported that a tryptophan residue in the neurokinin 1 receptor plays an important role in receptor interactions with a non-peptide ligand (45Fong T.M. Cascieri M.A. Yu H. Bansal A. Swain C. Strader C.D. Nature. 1993; 362: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), reminiscent of observations in the present study. In the neurokinin-1 receptor, a member of the class A GPCR subfamily, tryptophan appeared to be part of a transmembrane domain pocket that is now recognized as a common binding domain for small molecule and non-peptide ligands in many class A receptors. By examination of both structurally modified neurokinin receptors, as well as ligands, it was established that the critical tryptophan residue was involved directly in non-peptide binding via an amino (receptor)-aromatic (ligand) interaction (45Fong T.M. Cascieri M.A. Yu H. Bansal A. Swain C. Strader C.D. Nature. 1993; 362: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was found with the neurokinin-1 receptor, substitution of tryptophan 33 in the GLP-1 receptor by residues that share a side chain amino group (i.e. histidine or glutamine) reduced markedly the binding of T-0632. Therefore, it appears that the molecular mechanisms that confer non-peptide affinity to the neurokinin-1 versus the GLP-1 receptor are different. Our findings with T-0632 provide a first step toward the identification of determinants that underlie non-peptide binding to the GLP-1 receptor. Such information may have significant implications for the understanding of ligand interactions with class B proteins in general. It is of note that T-0632 is a compound that was optimized originally for binding to the CCK-1 receptor, a class A GPCR (46Taniguchi H. Yazaki N. Yomota E. Shikano T. Endo T. Nagasaki M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 312: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, cross-reactivity of a class A receptor ligand with a class B receptor has not been reported previously. Although speculative at this point, binding of T-0632 to the GLP-1 receptor raises the possibility that certain structural features of class A receptor non-peptide ligands may also enhance the likelihood that such compounds have affinity to seven-transmembrane domain receptors within other subgroups of the GPCR superfamily. One important question that particularly applies to the GLP-1 receptor is whether the discovery of non-peptide ligands, as reported here for T-0632, heralds the imminent development of agonists that would be clinically desirable for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. To our knowledge, the few non-peptide ligands that have been reported to date for class B receptors (including T-0632) appear to lack detectable intrinsic activity. Consistent with this general trend, there have been two recent preliminary reports on the discovery of non-peptide GLP-1 receptor ligands (structurally unrelated to T-0632) that appeared to function as antagonists (47Kiel D. Lakis Jr., J.N. Gonzales J. Rajapakse R. May J.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14 (Abstr. 238): 1351Google Scholar, 48Grönberg A. Sol E.-R. Danielsson A. Colca J.R. Bergsten P. Diabetes. 2000; 49 (Abstr. 1044-P): 251Google Scholar). At the same time, it should be noted that recent precedent with non-peptide antagonists for class A peptide hormone receptors has revealed that minor structural modifications can confer agonist activity to compounds considered previously to be functionally inert (49Perlman S.

Whether such functional conversion of class B receptor non-peptide ligands can be achieved (e.g.by modifying T-0632 in a way that allosterically facilitates, rather than hinders, GLP-1-induced receptor activation) should be investigated actively.

Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) searches against the sequence data bases revealed the presence of a cDNA sequence derived from human brain highly homologous to rat synaptojanin 2A (KIAA0348, kindly provided by Dr. T. Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan) (33Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The major difference between rat synaptojanin 2A and the predicted protein from human brain KIAA0348 cDNA is the assigned initiator methionine. Although the 5′-portion of the KIAA0348 sequence is highly homologous to the corresponding region of rat synaptojanin 2A and could potentially encode a large part of the putative Sac1 domain, the translation was terminated by a stop codon at nucleotides 971–973. The methionine codon at nucleotides 1049–1051 was predicted to be the initiator codon for the longest possible open reading frame in KIAA0348, which thus apparently encodes a protein of 1113 amino acids with a truncated Sac1 domain followed by an inositol 5′-phosphatase domain and a proline-rich region. To verify the presence of the messenger RNA for the human synaptojanin 2-related protein lacking the Sac1 domain, we synthesized two oligonucleotide primers based on KIAA0348 sequence flanking the intervening termination codon, 5′-CACCAGGTGAGCTGCTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 359–375, and 5′-CTCGAGCGCGATGAAGCT-3′, corresponding to the complement of nucleotides 1091–1108, and performed PCR on the cDNAs reverse-transcribed from human lung, peripheral leukocyte, placenta, or human brain. A single major product of 0.7 kilobases was amplified from all the tissue cDNAs used as template. The PCR product from each tissue source was subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. All these products were found to be identical to the corresponding region of KIAA0348, except for the absence of 57 base pairs corresponding to nucleotides 970–1026 of KIAA0348. By inspection of the sequence, we noticed that KIAA0348 has direct repeats of 12 base pairs in nucleotides 958–969 and nucleotides 1015–1026. Based on these results, we concluded that KIAA0348 has an artifactual insertion in nucleotides 970–1026 presumably arising from an aberrant rearrangement or duplication during the cloning procedure. After removing the artifactual insertion, the corrected KIAA0348 sequence (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF039945) was then found to encode a protein of at least 1443 amino acids with an N-terminal Sac1 domain, although the open reading frame is incomplete at the 5′-end and lacks the region corresponding to the most amino-terminal 50 amino acids. A 2.1-kilobase XbaI fragment from KIAA0348 cDNA spanning the region encoding the proline-rich sequence in human synaptojanin 2B was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe for screening a rat brain λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) following standard techniques to obtain rat synaptojanin 2B cDNA (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The screening yielded cDNAs for two forms of rat synaptojanin 2B, designated synaptojanins 2B1 and 2B2. Accordingly, we refer to a protein encoded by the corrected KIAA0348 cDNA as human synaptojanin 2B2 (see Fig. 1). The pMalC2 constructs for production of the maltose-binding protein (MBP)- and His6-tagged proline-rich carboxyl-terminal regions of rat synaptojanins 1 and 2A (amino acids 1015–1317 of synaptojanin 1 and amino acids 1030–1248 of synaptojanin 2A) were as described (28Nemoto Y.

The DNA fragments encoding the proline-rich regions of rat synaptojanins 2B1 and 2B2 (amino acids 1030–1451 of synaptojanin 2B1 and amino acids 1030–1496 of synaptojanin 2B2) were generated by PCR on the cDNAs. They were then subcloned into the pMalC2 vector (New England Biolabs Inc.) to produce the dually tagged proline-rich regions of synaptojanins with MBP at the N termini and His6 at the C termini as described (28Nemoto Y.

A portion of the synaptojanin 2B-specific C-terminal region (amino acids 1210–1346 and 1255–1391 in rat synaptojanins 2B1 and 2B2, respectively) was amplified by PCR on synaptojanin 2B2 cDNA and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 and pMalC2. The GST fusion protein from the pGEX construct was expressed in E. coli DH5α and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography following standard procedures. The GST fusion protein was used to immunize two rabbits to generate anti-synaptojanin 2B antisera.

The MBP fusion protein was run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma), and the band containing the MBP fusion protein was excised and used for affinity purification of the antibody from the antisera as described (37Olmsted J.B.

Preparation of rat brain Triton X-100 extract and affinity chromatography on the peptides coupled to gel beads were performed as described (30Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2991-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Testes from 21-day-old Wistar rats were dissected, and Sertoli cells and germ cells were isolated and grown in culture according to established procedures (40Nagao Y. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1088-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells at 3 days in culture were harvested and solubilized in SDS sample buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each sample (30 µg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-synaptojanin 2B antibody (1:200). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Pierce) and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length cDNA for each rat synaptojanin isoform was subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) by a PCR-mediated procedure to express the N-terminally GFP-tagged protein in mammalian cells. RhoA and Rac1 cDNAs were amplified from human placenta by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The cDNAs encoding constitutively GTP-bound forms of RhoA (G14V) and Rac1 (G12V) were generated by PCR on RhoA and Rac1 cDNAs, respectively. The cDNAs encoding native and active forms of RhoA and Rac1 were subcloned into the pHA vector (30Nemoto Y. De Camilli P.

Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (51Bradford M.M. Anal.

PCR was performed using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from BabCo (Richmond, CA) and used for detection of the HA epitope. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against endophilins 1 and 2 were as described (14Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis and nucleotide sequencing were performed at the Yale Keck Biotechnology Facility and the RIKEN BSI Advanced Technology Development Center. We conducted data base searches and PCR-mediated screening as described under “Experimental Procedures” and have identified two alternatively spliced forms of rat synaptojanin 2 distinct from synaptojanin 2A. We shall refer to these two forms of synaptojanin 2 as synaptojanins 2B1 and 2B2. As deduced from the cDNA sequences, rat synaptojanins 2B1 and 2B2 have 1451 and 1496 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 160 and 165 kDa, respectively. We have previously shown that synaptojanin 2A has a C-terminal motif that binds to the PDZ domain of OMP25 (27Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the synaptojanin 2B isoforms, the C-terminal end of rat synaptojanin 2A corresponding to amino acids 1209–1248 is replaced by a 248-amino acid sequence with multiple potential SH3 domain-binding regions, and the PDZ domain-binding motif is absent. The difference between the 2B1 and 2B2 forms is the absence in 2B1 and the presence in 2B2 of a 46-amino acid sequence. Based on the sequence comparison, an alternatively spliced form of murine synaptojanin 2 previously reported (29Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2306-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is likely to correspond to synaptojanin 2B1. Likewise, the human KIAA0348 cDNA (33Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) may be derived from a human homolog of synaptojanin 2B2 (Fig. 1). Several SH3 domain-containing proteins such as GRB2, amphiphysins 1 and 2, and SH3p4/8/13 (endophilins 1–3, respectively) have been identified as binding proteins for the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 1 (145-kDa form) (10David C.

https://openalex.org/W2010682593,"Biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) is the small biotinylated subunit of Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis. Similar proteins are found in other bacteria and in chloroplasts. E. coli BCCP is a member of a large family of protein domains modified by covalent attachment of biotin to a specific lysine residue. However, the BCCP biotinyl domain differs from many of these proteins in that an eight-amino acid residue insertion is present upstream of the biotinylated lysine. X-ray crystallographic and multidimensional NMR studies show that these residues constitute a structure that has the appearance of an extended thumb that protrudes from the otherwise highly symmetrical domain structure. I report that expression of two mutant BCCPs lacking the thumb residues fails to restore growth and fatty acid synthesis to a temperature-sensitive E. coli strain that lacks BCCP when grown at nonpermissive temperature. Alignment of BCCPs from various organisms shows that only two of the eight thumb residues are strictly conserved, and amino acid substitution of either residue results in proteins giving only weak growth of the temperature-sensitive E. coli strain. Therefore, the thumb structure is essential for the function of BCCP in the ACC reaction and provides a useful motif for distinguishing the biotinylated proteins of multisubunit ACCs from those of enzymes catalyzing other biotin-dependent reactions. An unexpected result was that expression of a mutant BCCP in which the biotinylated lysine residue was substituted with cysteine was able to partially restore growth and fatty acid synthesis to the temperature-sensitive E. coli strain. This complementation was shown to be specific to BCCPs having native structure (excepting the biotinylated lysine) and is interpreted in terms of dimerization of the BCCP biotinyl domain during the ACC reaction.

Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 37-82Google Scholar). ACC is a biotin-dependent enzyme, and like all biotin enzymes, the cofactor must be covalently attached to ACC for enzyme activity. Biotin-dependent carboxylases are found in several molecular forms (2Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 3Samols D. Thornton C.G. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Haase F.C. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6461-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria, the functional enzyme seems to consist of two copies of each of four different subunits (4Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

The biotin cofactor is attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) subunit, the sole biotinylated protein of this organism (Fig.1). In the first partial reaction, the heterocyclic ring of the attached biotin moiety is carboxylated by the biotin carboxylase subunit. The carboxyl group is then transferred from biotin to acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA by the carboxyltransferase, a complex of two proteins called ∂ and β. Similar ACCs (referred to as heteromeric ACCs) are found in the chloroplasts of many plants (7Ohlrogge J. Pollard M. Bao X. Focke M. Girke T. Ruuska S. Mekhedov S. Benning C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 567-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the ACCs found in mammals, fungi, and plant cytosol are composed of a single very large protein that includes sequences homologous to the four E. coli ACC subunit proteins. Other biotin-dependent enzymes have structures intermediate between these extremes. For example, the propionyl-CoA carboxylase of mammalian mitochondria (8Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as those of mycobacteria and Streptomyces are composed of two proteins. One protein contains the carboxyltransferase sequences, whereas the second has the biotin carboxylase active site and a biotin domain. In virtually all biotinylated proteins, the site of biotin attachment is a lysine side chain found at the center of a strongly conserved sequence of ∼70 amino acid residues located at the carboxyl termini of the proteins (9Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Based on the conservation of key glycine residues and stretches of hydrophobic residues, Brocklehurst and Perham (10Brocklehurst S.M. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) proposed that this sequence comprised biotinoyl domains that would have structures very similar to those determined for the lipoic acid-modified domains of pyruvate dehydrogenases (lipoyl domains). This prediction was borne out by the structures of the biotinoyl domains of the E. coli acetyl-CoA subunit BCCP (also called AccB) (11Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the first biotinyl domain structure, Athappilly and Hendrickson (11Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) showed that the domain is a remarkably symmetrical structure of two sets of four antiparallel β-strands (see Fig. 2). However, the symmetry of the molecule is disrupted by a protruding eight-residue structure called the “thumb,” which in the crystals was found to be hydrogen-bonded to the uriedo ring of the biotin moiety. These authors pointed out that the thumb insertion is not found in other biotinylated proteins, suggesting an insertion or a deletion of these residues during the evolution of biotinoyl domain structures. (I will refer to the thumb as an insertion despite the ambiguity.) Alignment of the E. coli BCCP biotionyl domain sequence with those of lipoyl and other biotinyl domains suggests that an insertion of seven residues into the prototype symmetrical structure (thought to have evolved by successive gene duplication events) (11Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) is responsible for the BCCP thumb. The subsequent NMR analyses showed that the solution structure of the BCCP domain is essentially the same as the crystal structure. Moreover, the apo and holo forms of the protein were shown to differ only in that side chain packing is more favorable in the holo form (12Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the known greater stability of the holo form toward chemical modification and proteolysis (16Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although interaction of the thumb and the biotin moiety such as that found in the crystal structure was also observed in solution, the hydrogen bonds seen in the crystal structure could not be confirmed in solution (12Roberts E.L. Shu N. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan Jr., J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The predicted lack of thumb structure in other biotinylated proteins (11Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was recently confirmed by the structure of the P. shermanii 1.3 S biotinoyl domain (15Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 1.3 S structure has a folding pattern essentially identical to that of the E. coli BCCP biotinoyl domain lacking the thumb (see Fig. 2). Although some strands are one or two residues longer or shorter between the proteins, the structures align closely with an average deviation over the 68 aligned residues of 1.1 Å (Fig.2). What is the function of the protruding thumb of the BCCP biotinoyl domain? A role in biotinylation of the protein by the cognate BirA biotin-protein ligase seemed very unlikely since expression in E. coli of the genes encoding several “thumb-less” heterologous biotinylated proteins resulted in highly biotinylated proteins (8Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Cronan Jr., J.E. Reed K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 440-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a BCCP biotinoyl domain deleted for the thumb residues was recently found to be efficiently biotinylated (19Reche P. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); and thus, a role for the thumb in biotinylation is precluded. As will be further discussed below, the thumb insertion appears only in a subset of the biotinylated proteins of known sequence, the BCCP subunits of bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylases. It therefore seemed likely that the thumb has a special role in the bacterial and chloroplast acetyl-CoA carboxylases. I report that expression of two different mutant BCCPs lacking the thumb region fails to complement growth of an E. coli strain that carries a mutation resulting in a temperature-sensitive BCCP protein. BCCPs having point mutations in the thumb region show only weak complementation of the mutant strain. During the course of this work, an unexpected observation was made, that a protein lacking the biotinylated lysine partially complemented growth of the temperature-sensitive BCCP mutant. E. coli K-12 strain DH5ΔZ (20Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) and the temperature-sensitive accB mutant strain CY1336 (also called LA2-22 in previous studies) (21Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Silbert D.F. Pohlman T. Chapman A. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for general cloning and accB complementation (BCCP function), respectively. Strain CY1336 was derived by transformation of strain L8 (called LA2-22 in previous studies) (21Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with plasmid pBA2, which encodes biotin ligase (23Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), followed by conjugation-mediated introduction of the lacIQ F′ plasmid from the NovaBlue strain (Novagen). The medium used was RB medium (containing 10 g/liter Tryptone, 1 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl). This medium contains ∼5 nm biotin (24Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added at 10, 50, and 100 mg/liter for tetracycline HCl, kanamycin sulfate, and sodium ampicillin, respectively. Note that although the expression plasmids carried both kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants, the latter antibiotic was omitted to avoid the possibility of competition between ACC and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase for the cellular acetyl-CoA pool. Plasmid pCY326 was constructed from pLS24 (5Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by insertion of the 875-base pair BspHI kanamycin resistance determinant of pET30a (Novagen) into the NcoI site of the multiple cloning sequence located downstream of theaccB coding sequence (an NcoI partial digest was used) to give pCY332. The ampicillin resistance determinant of the plasmid was then deleted by BspHI digestion, followed by ligation to give pCY326. Plasmid pCY325, which encodes an AccB protein in which all lysine residues in the C-terminal 87 residues (excepting that which is normally biotinylated) were substituted with arginine residues, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pCY326 with oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Table I). The unique site elimination method (25Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) was used with alkali-denatured double-stranded DNA as template, followed by transformation of the products into the mutS strain ES1301. Plasmid preparations from the pooled transformants were cut with Acc65I and transformed into strain DH5∂Z. Oligonucleotide 1 gave arginine substitutions for Lys100 and Lys108 and introduced two overlapping BssHII sites, whereas oligonucleotide 2 gave arginine substitutions for Lys131and Lys136, introduced BssHII andRsrII sites, and eliminated the Acc65I site.Table IOligonucleotides used in this workOligonucleotideSequence 15′-CGCCCACGTTGACGCGCTGACCCACTTCGATGAACGCGCGCGCGTCCGGGCTTGG 25′-CACTTTCGACCAGAATTGCGCGCACAGTACCGGAACGGTCCGCTTCGATCTGGT 35′-GGTACTTTCTACCGCGCGGCATTCATCGAAGTGGGTCAGCGCGTAAACGTGGG 45′-CCCACGTTTACGCGCTGACCCACTTCGATGAATGCCGCGCGGTAGAAAGTACC 55′-AACGTGGGCGATACCCTATGCATCGTTGAAGCCATGTGCATGATGAACCAGATCGAAGCG 65′-GTCCGCTTCGATCTGGTTCATCATGCACATGGCTTCAACGATGCATAGGGTATCGCCCACGTT 75′-GACCGTTCCAGTACTGTGCGCGCAATTCTGGTCGAAAGTGGACAG 85′-CCGGCTGTCCACTTTCGACCAGAATTGCGCGCACAGTACTGGAACG 95′-CATGGAAGCGCCGGCAGCAGCGGAAATCAGTGGTCACATCGTAG105′-GCGCCTACGATGTGACCACTGATTTCCGCTGCTGCCGGCGCTTC115′-AACGTGGGCGATACCCTATGCATCGTTGAAGCAATGYGCATGATGAACCAGATCGAAGCGGACAAATCCG125′-GTACCGGATTTGTCCGCTTCGATCTGGTTCATCATGCRCATTGCTTCAACGATGCATAGGGTATCGCCCACGTT135′-AGCTTACGACGGCGCAGCAGACGCTGCACCTGCGCAGGCAGAAGAGAAGAAAGAAGCAGCG145′-CCGGCGCTGCTTCTTTCTTCTCTTCTGCCTGCGCAGGTGCAGCGTCTGCTGCGCCGTCGTA155′-CCGGCTGCAGCACCAGCGGCTGCGGCGGCGGAGATCTCCGGTCACATCGTAC165′-GTACGATGTGACCGGAGATCTCCGCCGCCGCAGCCGCTGGTGCTGCAGCCGG Open table in a new tab Three other plasmids were constructed from pCY325. Plasmid pCY377, which encodes an AccB protein lacking the thumb region, was constructed by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) using mutagenic primer 3 plus the M13 forward and reverse primers. The final product was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). TheNcoI-RsrII fragment of pCY325 was then replaced with the analogous fragment of the polymerase chain reaction clone to give pCY377. The remaining plasmids were made by mutagenesis using cassettes made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. Plasmid pCY402, which encodes an AccB protein with Cys in place of Lys122 (and introduces a new NsiI site), was constructed by ligating a cassette of oligonucleotides 5 and 6 to the purified large fragment of pCY325 digested with HincII andRsrII. Likewise, plasmid pCY479, which encodes an AccB protein with both the K122C and G133S mutations (plus a newScaI site), was constructed by ligating a cassette of annealed oligonucleotides 7 and 8 between the RsrII andPinAI sites of pCY325. Two other plasmids were constructed by replacing theHincII-Acc65I segment of pCY326 with a cassette of annealed oligonucleotides 9 and 10. The first position of the Lys122 codon was made partially degenerate such that both K122C and K122R mutations were expected in the progeny plasmids. This construction introduced NsiI and BsrDI sites; and in the case of the K122R mutation, an FspI site was also introduced. Plasmids pCY484 and pCY485 carry the K122C and K122R mutations, respectively. An accB gene containing both the K122R and G133S mutations was constructed by cloning theHindIII-ClaI fragment of the K122R construct into pMTL22 to make the NsiI and Acc65I sites unique. A cassette of annealed oligonucleotides 11 and 12 was inserted between these sites, and the HindIII-ClaI fragment of the resulting construct was used to replace the analogous fragment of pCY485 to give pCY500. A final set of plasmids was constructed from the plasmids of Reche and Perham (19Reche P. Perham R.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2673-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Essentially the BsiWI-Acc65I fragment of pCY326 was replaced with the analogous mutant fragments of the Reche-Perham plasmids. Plasmids pCY449, pCY450, pCY451, and pCY517 contain the LD, DASMEP, Q126E, and SMEP mutations, respectively. All of the accB genes encoded by the above plasmids together with the downstream kanamycin resistance determinant were then subcloned as PvuII fragments into the StuI site of the multiple cloning region of pCY462. Vector pCY462 was constructed from pProLar.A122 (CLONTECH) by substitution of the kanamycin resistance determinant with the pZA33 (20Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) chloramphenicol resistance determinant, which had been modified by removal of theEcoRI and NcoI sites by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (as described above) using oligonucleotides 13 and 14. Each of the mutant gene sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands done by the Keck Genomics Center of the University of Illinois. Exponentially growing cultures (0.8 or 1 ml) growing in RB medium plus the appropriate antibiotics were labeled with 5 μCi of sodium [1-14C]acetate (55 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) as previously described (4Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) in a 15-ml plastic centrifuge tube for the time intervals given. Labeling was terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%, followed by incubation on ice for 0.5–2 h. The suspensions were then quantitatively transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube using a 0.5-ml wash of the original tube with 5% trichloroacetic acid; the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation; and any remaining solution was removed. The pellets were then extracted with 0.05 ml of methanol at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by addition of 0.1 ml of chloroform. Aliquots of these solutions were then spotted onto Silica Gel G thin-layer plates (which were not activated so that the three major phospholipids of E. coli would co-migrate), which were developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:8, by volume). The lipids were located by autoradiography and/or iodine staining, and the appropriate areas of silica gel were then scrapped into scintillation vials and counted in Bio-Safe II scintillation solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The levels of protein biotinylation were determined by labeling growing cultures with [8,9-3H]biotin (41 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 2 μCi/ml of culture. This biotin concentration is sufficient to repress endogenous biotin synthesis (17Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Barker D.F. Campbell A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) such that exogenous biotin becomes the source of all protein-bound biotin. Labeling was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as previously described (17Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except that one of the trichloroacetic acid washes was replaced by an ethanol wash. The labeled proteins were analyzed on 16% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (27Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), soaked in Enlightening (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to preflashed x-ray film at −80 °C (28Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain L8 (previously called strain LA2-22) was isolated in a selection targeted to mutants having a temperature-sensitive defect in fatty acid synthesis (21Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The strain was shown to grow and synthesize fatty acids normally at 30 °C; but upon shift to 38 °C, fatty acid-synthesizing ability was rapidly lost, and growth ceased within one cell doubling (21Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequent enzymatic work localized the defect to acetyl-CoA carboxylase; and although the results reported were ambiguous, the strain was found to contain decreased levels of BCCP, the biotinylated form of AccB, when grown at 30 °C (22Silbert D.F. Pohlman T. Chapman A. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent work established the G133S mutation (allele accB22) by DNA sequencing (5Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed that the mutant biotinoyl domain was a defective biotinylation substrate both in vivo and in vitro (5Li S.J.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that Gly133 is a key residue in the turn linking β-sheets 5 and 6, and modeling showed that steric clashes result upon substitution with larger residues (excepting Ala). The biotinoyl domain of the G133S mutant protein was overproduced and purified and found to be a defective biotinylation substrate in vitro and to be abnormally sensitive to proteolysis by trypsin (24Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteolysis in vivo also seemed possible since proteolytic products were found in the earliest purification steps (24Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this work, the in vivo stability of G133S BCCP was examined by [3H]biotin labeling. In good agreement with prior work (21Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Silbert D.F. Pohlman T. Chapman A. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1351-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cultures grown at the permissive temperature of strain CY1336 contained only 25% of the normal level of BCCP (wild-type strain CY1375 contained 3 pmol of BCCP/109 cells). Labeling cultures with [3H]biotin followed by a chase with excess unlabeled biotin showed that the mutant protein was slightly unstable at 30 °C. G133S BCCP had a half-life of ∼17 h, whereas, in agreement with prior data (5Li S.J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the parental BCCP strain showed no detectable turnover. Upon shift to a nonpermissive temperature (38 °C), the mutant BCCP protein was rapidly degraded (half-life of 20–25 min), whereas the wild-type protein was completely stable. The instability of G133S BCCP resulted in the BCCP concentration of strain L8 dropping to 0.3 pmol/109 cells within 25 min after shift and to 0.15 pmol/109 cells after 70 min. The in vivo function of G133S BCCP was assayed by measuring the synthesis of fatty acids as an index of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity that depends on BCCP. Fatty acid synthesis was assayed by pulse labeling with [1-14C]acetate, followed by lipid extraction and counting of the incorporated radioactivity. As previously reported (21Harder M.E. Beacham I.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beacham K. Honegger J.L. Silbert D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the rate of fatty acid synthesis in strain L8 grown at 30 °C was normal despite the decreased level of BCCP. Upon shift to 38 °C, the rate of fatty acid synthesis fell rapidly. Within 20 min after shift, the synthesis rate was only 12% of that of the wild-type strain. Only part of the decreased function of the BCCP mutant in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction could be attributed to degradation of the protein since about half of the initial BCCP remained 20 min after temperature shift. Therefore, function of G133S BCCP in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction also appeared to be disrup"

The complex of RGS9 with type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5) is abundant in photoreceptors, where it stimulates the GTPase activity of transducin. An important functional feature of RGS9-Gβ5 is its ability to activate transducin GTPase much more efficiently after transducin binds to its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase. Here we show that different domains of RGS9-Gβ5 make opposite contributions toward this selectivity. Gβ5 bound to the G protein γ subunit-like domain of RGS9 acts to reduce RGS9 affinity for transducin, whereas other structures restore this affinity specifically for the transducin-phosphodiesterase complex. We suggest that this mechanism may serve as a general principle conferring specificity of RGS protein action.

At present, over 20 mammalian RGS proteins have been identified that regulate the GTPase activity of most known G protein α subunits. The abundance of both protein types, along with findings that catalytic domains of RGS proteins have a very poor ability to discriminate among different G protein α subunits, makes the problem of specificity in the RGS-G protein interaction one of the most interesting questions in G protein signaling. A striking example of the specificity in RGS protein action is described for the photoreceptor cells of the retina, where RGS9 is able to discriminate between the free activated α subunit of photoreceptor-specific G protein, transducin, and transducin bound to its effector, PDE (reviewed in Refs. 3Cowan C.W.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of this selectivity is evident from the necessity for RGS9 to promptly terminate the photoresponse after PDE activation by transducin but not to inactivate transducin before it has a chance to interact with PDE. In photoreceptors, RGS9 is represented by its short splice isoform, which exists as a constitutive complex with the photoreceptor-specific long splice isoform of Gβ5 (5Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S.

The ability of RGS9-Gβ5L to select between free transducin and transducin-PDE complex is achieved because its affinity for free transducin is lower than its affinity for transducin bound to PDE (13Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The effect of PDE is conferred through its inhibitory γ subunit, PDEγ (14Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which directly binds to transducin. The catalytic role in activating transducin GTPase belongs to the RGS homology domain of RGS9, RGS9d, which itself can discriminate between free transducin and transducin-PDE complex (17He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18McEntaffer R.L. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O.

Biol. 2001; 8: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, PDEγ causes not more than a 2–3-fold potentiation of the activity of RGS9d, whereas the effect observed with the entire RGS9-Gβ5L complex is ∼20-fold (13Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This implies that the major role in conferring the stimulating effect of PDEγ is played by other, noncatalytic domains of RGS9-Gβ5L. This idea has been recently supported by He et al. (21He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), who reported that practically all domains within the RGS9-Gβ5L complex contribute to its ability to discriminate between free activated transducin and transducin bound to PDE. In this study, we addressed the kinetic mechanism by which individual domains within RGS9-Gβ5L confer its ability to specifically recognize transducin complexed with PDEγ. This was achieved by analyzing catalytic properties of a series of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L fragments ranging from RGS9d to the full-length RGS9-Gβ5L. Our approach was similar to that of He and colleagues (21He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the use of an alternative kinetic method enabled us to specifically address the major catalytic parameters of each fragment: their maximal catalytic activities and their affinities for transducin with and without PDEγ. Our surprising finding is that different structures within the RGS9-Gβ5L complex make opposite contributions in establishing this selectivity. The structure, including the putative seven-bladed β-propeller core of Gβ5 connected to GGL, imposes a dramatic reduction in the affinity of RGS9d for both transducin and transducin-PDE complex. All other parts of RGS9 as well as the N terminus of Gβ5L restore this affinity for the transducin-PDEγ complex to a much greater degree than for free transducin. We suggest that this mechanism may serve as a general principle by which the specificity of RGS action is achieved in various signaling pathways. GGL-Gβ5 modules may serve as nonspecific inhibitors of RGS function, whereas other structures in the RGS-Gβ5 complex may counter the action of GGL-Gβ5 specifically toward either appropriate G protein-α subtype or appropriate G protein-α-effector complex. ROS were isolated from frozen bovine retinas (T. A. & W. L. Lawson Co., Lincoln, NE) under infrared illumination as described (22McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Urea-treated ROS membranes lacking the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of RGS9 were prepared using a two-step protocol (23Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). First, photoreceptor discs were purified from the ROS in the dark (24Smith H.G. Stubbs G.W. Litman B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Second, the residual activity of RGS9 was inactivated by treating discs with 6 murea for 30 min on ice (15Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urea was then removed from the membrane preparation by five consecutive washes of the discs with an isotonic buffer. Rhodopsin concentration in all membranes was determined spectrophotometrically from the difference in absorbance at 500 nm before and after rhodopsin bleaching using the molar extinction coefficient of 40,000 (25Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.-C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transducin was purified from bovine ROS as described (26Ting T.D. Goldin S.B. Ho Y.-K. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 180-195Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transducin concentration used in all calculations was determined based on the maximum amount of rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding performed as described in Ref. 27Fung B.B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar. The PDEγ-(63–87) peptide was synthesized by the solid-phase Merrifield method on an automated peptide synthesizer and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. Purity and chemical formula of the peptide were confirmed by mass spectrometry and analytical reversed-phase HPLC. A schematic illustration of RGS9 constructs used in this study is presented in Fig. 1. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 containing mouse RGS9 cDNA (5Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR amplification of RGS9 cDNA and its fragments. DNA fragments encoding RGS9 residues 193–431 (GR), 193–484 (GRC), 112–431 (IGR), 112–484 (IGRC), 1–431 (DIGR), and 1–484 (DIGRC) were amplified using specific upstream and downstream primers containing BamHI and EcoRI sites, respectively. The resulting PCR products were cut with BamHI andEcoRI and ligated with the large fragment of a modified version of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (see below), digested with the same restriction enzymes. DNA sequence of all RGS9 constructs was confirmed over the PCR-amplified regions. The resulting constructs encoded recombinant proteins where RGS9 sequence was preceded in frame by the sequence MAHHHHHHGLVPRGS containing His6 tag and thrombin cleavage site. Baculovirus expression constructs encoding Gβ5S or Gβ5L (modified by a Met-43 to Leu point mutation to block an internal translation initiation site) (28Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) employed the mouse cDNAs ligated between the EcoRI andXbaI cloning sites in pVL1392. Finished constructs in baculovirus transfer vectors were used to generate recombinant baculoviruses using a custom service provided by Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Positive viral clones were isolated by the plaque assays followed by immunoblotting detection of the expressed RGS9 constructs using anti-RGS9 antibodies (5Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Plaque isolated recombinant viruses were amplified to obtain high titer stocks (>108 plaque-forming units/ml). In our choice of the protein expression systems we followed the strategies reported by He et al. (21He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli vector pGEX2T encoding GST-His6-RGS9d fusion protein was a generous gift from T. Wensel (Baylor College of Medicine). GST-His6-RGS9d from the soluble fraction of E. coli lysate was purified using affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described (21He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin followed by the separation of His6-RGS9d from the GST domain and thrombin on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. All other RGS9 constructs in their complexes with either Gβ5L or Gβ5S were produced in the Sf9/baculovirus expression system. We found, as did others (21He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), that the expression of all RGS9 constructs containing the GGL domain in soluble form was possible only in the presence of Gβ5. We therefore co-expressed all GGL domain-containing RGS9 constructs with either Gβ5L or Gβ5S. For a standard purification, Sf9 cells (4–5 liters) were cultured in suspension in SF900 II SFM (Life Technologies Inc.) containing 0.1% Pluronic F68, 1% fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 27 °C with constant shaking (125 rpm). Cells (1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml) were co-infected with amplified recombinant baculoviruses encoding desired RGS9 construct and the recombinant virus encoding Gβ5 at a multiplicity of infection of 3. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and resuspended in 100 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, two tablets of EDTA-free protein inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (buffer A). Remaining procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation using a Parr bomb using two 30-min compression/decompression cycles at 600 p.s.i. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and supernatants were collected and loaded onto a 2-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose column, which had been equilibrated in buffer A. The column was sequentially washed with 20 ml of buffer A and then 20 ml of buffer A containing 20 mmimidazole. Recombinant proteins were eluted off the column with 5 ml of buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed from the protein preparation, and buffer composition was changed to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol by a sequential dilution and concentration of the eluate using an Amicon concentrator. The resulting samples were further purified on a Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a gradient of NaCl concentration (from 0.1 to 0.4m). The eluted RGS9-Gβ5 complexes were dialyzed against buffer A containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C without significant loss of their functional activity. The purity of the recombinant RGS9 constructs was no less than 80%. The concentration of recombinant proteins was measured spectrophotometrically based on the theoretically calculated values of extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Transducin GTPase activity was determined by using either a multiple turnover ([GTP] > [transducin]) or single turnover ([GTP] < [transducin]) technique as described previously (13Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GTPase assays were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Urea-treated ROS membranes, lacking endogenous GAP activity of RGS9, were used as a source for rhodopsin for assaying GAP activity of the recombinant RGS9 constructs. Rhodopsin in these membranes was activated by illuminating them on ice immediately before the experiments. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of [γ-32P]GTP at desired concentration (∼105dpm/sample) to 20 μl of membranes (20 μm rhodopsin final concentration) reconstituted with proteins of choice. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. 32Pi formation was measured with activated charcoal as described (29Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All data fitting and statistical analyses were performed with the Sigmaplot software, version 6. 10 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were equilibrated with the binding buffer: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.25% lauryl sucrose, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The beads were then incubated on ice for 20 min with 50 μl of 5 μm His-tagged RGS9 constructs and then washed twice with 200 μl of binding buffer. Washed beads were mixed with 50 μl of binding buffer containing 1 μg of transducin. 10 mm NaF and 30 μmAlCl3 (AlF4−) and/or PDEγ at the final concentration of 1 μm were added when necessary. We used full-length PDEγ in this assay, since its affinity for transducin is higher than that of the PDEγ-(63–87) peptide, allowing better transducin-PDEγ complex retention upon agarose washes. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional shaking. The agarose beads were spun down and washed twice with 1 ml of the binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and also 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3 when required. Bound transducin was eluted from the beads with 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. 10-μl aliquots of eluates were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The α subunit of transducin was detected using monoclonal antibodies 4A (a generous gift from Heidi Hamm, Vanderbilt University). Schematic illustrations of RGS9 domain composition and protein constructs used in this study are presented in Fig. 1. The N-terminal domain of RGS9 containing ∼110 amino acids is called DEP because it is also present in Disheveled, EGL-10, andpleckstrin (30Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The function of this domain in each of these proteins remains unknown, although a recent report on the three-dimensional structure of DEP from Disheveled (Dvl) confirms that this domain exists as a unique, independently folded structure (31Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T. Srinivas S. Zhang W. Liu B. Li L. Wu D. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the RGS9 sequence, DEP is followed by an ∼80-amino acid stretch, which we will call interdomain. It has the lowest degree of homology among the members of the RGS9 subfamily. The next domain, composed of ∼80 residues, is the GGL domain, providing the binding site for Gβ5 in all representatives of the RGS9 subfamily. In RGS9, GGL binds to Gβ5L, whereas other subfamily members are usually found in a complex with the short splice isoform of Gβ5, Gβ5S (7Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GGL is followed by the RGS homology domain of ∼120 residues. RGS9, both the retinal isoform employed here and the brain isoform (32Rahman Z. Gold S.J. Potenza M.N. Cowan C.W. Ni Y.G. He W. Wensel T.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also contains a prominent C-terminal extension, unique among other members of this subfamily. This extension is often called the C-terminal domain. The domain composition of Gβ5L appears more simple. It is thought to have a core seven-bladed β-propeller structural domain characteristic of all G protein β subunits and mostly α-helical N-terminal region, including a photoreceptor-specific 42-amino acid extension, which is absent in Gβ5S and in other known G protein β subunits (28Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The unique opportunity in studying G protein signaling with the components of the phototransduction cascade is that transducin could be supplied with an essentially unlimited amount of its activated receptor, photoexcited rhodopsin. This enabled us to study the catalytic properties of RGS9-Gβ5L and its fragments under multiple turnover steady-state conditions, where the GTP hydrolysis by transducin was immediately followed by transducin's return to its GTP-bound form (13Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As illustrated in the Reaction 1 below, our approach could be considered a modification of the Michaelis-Menten method. We considered RGS9-Gβ5L constructs as the enzymes, activated α subunit of transducin (Gαt-GTP) as their substrate, and Gαt-GDP and inorganic phosphate as the reaction products. RGS+Gαt­GTP↔k−1k+1RGS·Gαt­GTP→kcatRGS+Gαt­GDP+PiREACTION 1 The power of this approach is that it allowed us to assess both maximal catalytic activities of the RGS9-Gβ5L constructs and their affinities for transducin with and without PDEγ, after calculating corresponding values of kcat and apparentKm. In the context of this study, this approach is preferential over the single turnover approach utilized in most previous studies of transducin GTPase (reviewed in Ref. 29Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the single turnover method was extremely productive in establishing the basic observations that GAP for transducin exists in rods (33Arshavsky V.Y. Antoch M.P. Lukjanov K.A. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 939-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that PDEγ is an activator of transducin GTPase (14Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has at least three major limitations that make detailed kinetic analysis of the catalytic properties of RGS9-Gβ5L constructs essentially impossible. First, accurate resolution of GTPase rates above ∼1 turnover/s cannot be achieved by conventional applications of this technique. As a result, maximal rates of GTP hydrolysis stimulated by the most active RGS9-Gβ5L constructs cannot be determined by the single turnover method. Second, the single turnover approach does not provide a means to distinguish whether PDEγ affects the affinity between RGS and transducin or if it directly changes the catalytic rate of an RGS protein. Third, as GTPase rates approach saturation at high RGS concentrations, this method does not resolve whether these rates are determined by the catalytic properties of RGS or by the intrinsic limitations of transducin to form a conformation competent for RGS interaction. To the contrary, the multiple turnover GTPase approach allowed us to determine two essential catalytic parameters of this reaction, kcat and apparentKm, for each RGS construct used. Each individual experiment utilizing the multiple turnover methodology included three data sets obtained at various transducin concentrations: 1) the basal activity of transducin GTPase measured without RGS9, which was a linear function of transducin concentration; 2) GTPase activity in the presence of a small fixed concentration of a given RGS9 construct; 3) GTPase activity in the presence of the same construct and PDEγ at saturating concentration. The basal GTPase activity was then subtracted from the data obtained with RGS9 constructs, which allowed us to analyze the properties of “accelerated” GTPase alone. Both data sets were fitted by hyperbolas, yielding the kinetic parameters of activated GTPase, kcat, and apparentKm. In order to further simplify this analysis, we used saturating concentrations of GTP to ensure that the rate of GTP hydrolysis was not dependent on the GTP concentration. We also substituted PDEγ by its C-terminal PDEγ-(63–87) peptide because PDEγ-(63–87) retains all GAP properties of the full-length PDEγ (13Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

The effects of PDEγ on the catalytic parameters of RGS9d were studied in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2A. The kinetic parameters, kcat and apparentKm, determined from the hyperbolic fits to the data are summarized in Table I. PDEγ-(63–87) affected two parameters of GTP hydrolysis. First, it decreased the value of apparent Km by ∼3-fold. This is in a good agreement with the 2–3-fold increase in the affinity between RGS9d and transducin by PDEγ observed in direct affinity measurements (19Skiba N.P. Yang C.S. Huang T. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8770-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Second, PDEγ caused an ∼10-fold decrease in thekcat value. This effect was completely unexpected and appeared to contradict an established concept that PDEγ is an activator, not an inhibitor, of both native RGS9-Gβ5L (13Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J.

https://openalex.org/W1589391295,"An analysis of the functional role of a diacidic motif (Asp236-Asp237) in the third intracellular loop of the AT1A angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor (AT1-R) revealed that substitution of both amino acids with alanine (DD-AA) or asparagine (DD-NN) residues diminished Ang II-induced receptor phosphorylation in COS-7 cells. However, Ang II-stimulated inositol phosphate production, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and AT1 receptor desensitization and internalization were not significantly impaired. Overexpression of dominant negative G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)K220M decreased agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation by ∼40%, but did not further reduce the impaired phosphorylation of DD-AA and DD-NN receptors. Inhibition of protein kinase C by bisindolylmaleimide reduced the phosphorylation of both the wild-type and the DD mutant receptors by ∼30%. The inhibitory effects of GRK2K220M expression and protein kinase C inhibition by bisindolylmaleimide on agonist-induced phosphorylation were additive for the wild-type AT1-R, but not for the DD mutant receptor. Agonist-induced internalization of the wild-type and DD mutant receptors was similar and was unaltered by coexpression of GRK2K220M. These findings demonstrate that an acidic motif at position 236/237 in the third intracellular loop of the AT1-R is required for optimal Ang II-induced phosphorylation of its carboxyl-terminal tail by GRKs. Furthermore, the properties of the DD mutant receptor suggest that not only Ang II-induced signaling, but also receptor desensitization and internalization, are independent of agonist-induced GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the AT1 receptor.

Following agonist activation, Gs-mediated signaling by the β2-AR is rapidly attenuated (or desensitized) and the receptor is internalized (or sequestered) into cells. In many GPCRs, these events result from phosphorylation of the agonist-activated receptors on serine/threonine residues by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and the consequent binding of β-arrestin proteins. Receptor-bound β-arrestins not only uncouple the β2-AR from Gs and initiate desensitization, but also act as molecular adaptors in the endocytosis of β2-ARs via clathrin-coated pits and promote intracellular signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (reviewed in Refs. 1Pitcher J.A.

Unlike second messenger-dependent kinases, which phosphorylate target proteins within well defined sequences (24Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E.

The major agonist-induced phosphorylation sites of the rat AT1A-R are located in a serine/threonine-rich segment (Ser326–Thr338) of the receptor's cytoplasmic tail (15Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Mihalik B. Jayadev S. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the only potentially relevant acidic residues within the intracellular domains of the AT1-R are Asp236 and Asp237, and these are located in the receptor's third intracellular loop rather than adjacent to the phosphorylation sites in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (31Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that individual mutations of these aspartate residues have no major effect on inositol phosphate signaling and internalization of the AT1 receptor (32Zhang M. Zhao X. Chen H.-C. Catt K.J. Hunyady L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15782-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, a more detailed analysis of this diacidic motif has demonstrated its importance in GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor, and has raised questions about the general role of these kinases in the regulation of desensitization and endocytosis of GPCRs. This investigation of the functional importance of the diacidic motif has indicated its requirement in agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation of the AT1-R and has also suggested that the majority of such phosphorylation is not essential for receptor desensitization and internalization.

Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using the Quick Change kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and mutant sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing using Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (COS-7 medium). Cells were seeded at 8 × 105 cells/10-cm dish in COS-7 medium and cultured for 3 days prior to transfection using 5 ml/dish OptiMEM containing 10 μg/ml LipofectAMINE and the required pcDNA3.1 expression vectors for HA-AT1ARs (wild-type and DD mutants) alone (5 μg/100-mm dish) or together with the pcDNA I-GRK2K220M (3.75 and 2.5 μg DNA/100-mm dish, respectively) for 6 h at 37 °C. After changing to fresh COS-7 medium, the cells were cultured for another 2 days prior to use. Binding of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II to intact cells was determined as described previously (34Hunyady L.

Transfected COS-7 cells in 10-cm dishes were metabolically labeled for 4 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of Pi-free DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 100 μCi/ml 32Pi. After three washes in KRH (118 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), cells were incubated in the same medium for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath and Ang II (100 nm) was added for another 5 min. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, membrane lysates were prepared, extracted with salt/urea, and solubilized prior to deglycosylation with PNGase F as described (14Smith R.D. Baukal A.J.

Following immunoprecipitation with the HA.11 antibody and protein A-Sepharose, 32P-labeled phospho-HA-AT1A-Rs were eluted into sample buffer for 1 h at 48 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–16% gradient resolving gel) prior to visualization in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In order to quantify the relative phosphorylation of mutant HA-AT1A-Rs, membrane lysates were normalized to an equal number of HA-AT1A-Rs prior to immunoprecipitation. COS-7 cells from replicate 10-cm dishes were detached by trypsinization 24 h after transfection, reseeded into 24-well plates, cultured for another 24 h, and subjected to radioligand binding competition assay using125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II.Bmax values were obtained from Scatchard analysis of the binding data using the LIGAND program. 125I-Ang II was added in serum-free Medium 199 containing 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin to transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates maintained at 37 °C for the required times. Incubations were stopped by rapid washing with ice-cold PBS, and acid-released and acid-resistant radioactivities were separated and measured by γ-spectrometry as described previously (35Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of internalized ligand at each time point was calculated from the ratio of the acid-resistant specific binding to the total (acid-released + acid-resistant) specific binding. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of an excess (10 μm) of unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. Transfected COS-7 cells in 24-well plates were labeled by overnight incubation in inositol-free DMEM containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 2.5% (v/v) FBS, antibiotics, and 20 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol. After washing and preincubation with 10 mm LiCl for 30 min, 100 nm Ang II was added for another 30 min. Inositol phosphates were extracted as described (36Hunyady L. Ji H. Jagadeesh G. Zhang M. Gaborik Z. Mihalik B. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and applied to Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 columns. After washing three times with water and twice with 0.2m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid, the combined [3H]inositol bisphosphate + [3H]inositol trisphosphate fractions were eluted with 1m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid, and radioactivities were determined by liquid scintillation counting. At the expression levels used in this study, there was a linear relationship between the number of cell surface receptors and the magnitude of agonist-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate production (37Hunyady L.

Labeled COS-7 cells expressing the indicated receptors were preincubated in medium alone or with 100 nmAng II for 3 min and washed with PBS before the treatment with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 3, for 30 s at 4 °C. After washing three times with ice-cold PBS, the cells were incubated for 15 min in medium containing 10 mm LiCl alone or with 100 nm Ang II. [3H]Inositol phosphates were extracted and measured as described above. Transfected COS-7 cells in 10-cm dishes were grown for 1 day after transfection and reseeded in six-well plates. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment with 100 nm Ang II for the indicated time. After agonist stimulation at 37 °C, medium was aspirated and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were briefly sonicated, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatants were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8–16%) gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membranes. GRK2 or phosphorylated ERKl and ERK2 were detected by using a polyclonal rabbit anti-GRK2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a monoclonal mouse phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody (1:2000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), respectively. Blots were probed with a 1:3000 dilution of anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by using by ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence reagent), then quantified by scanning laser densitometry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Substitution of both residues of the diacidic motif (Asp236-Asp237) located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the third intracellular loop (31Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S.

However, theKd values of these and other relevant mutant receptors were similar to those of the wild-type receptor, demonstrating that the Asp236-Asp237 motif is not required for high affinity ligand binding to the AT1A-R. In subsequent studies, the relative degrees of agonist-induced phosphorylation of mutant receptors were determined using solubilized membrane lysates normalized to an equal number of receptors, as calculated from Bmax values derived from radioligand binding assays in replicate transfected cells prior to immunoprecipitation.Table IBinding parameters of mutant HA-AT1A-RsReceptorKdBmaxnm% WTWT1.6 ± 0.1100DD-AA1.5 ± 0.252 ± 2DD-NN1.5 ± 0.261 ± 2DD-AD1.7 ± 0.283 ± 2DD-DA1.7 ± 0.240 ± 3DD-ED1.5 ± 0.194 ± 5DD-DE1.6 ± 0.188 ± 5DD-EE1.8 ± 0.281 ± 2Δ3351.6 ± 0.185 ± 4Intact COS-7 cells expressing the indicated receptors were subjected to radioligand binding competition assays for 2 h at 22 °C using125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, andKd and Bmax values were calculated using the LIGAND program.

This broad migration pattern, which is largely due to variable degrees of receptor glycosylation and possibly the presence of comigrating phosphoproteins, interferes with the quantitation of the native phospho-HA-AT1A-Rs. For this reason, the solubilized phosphoreceptors were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation with PNGase F prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The deglycosylated phospho-HA-AT1A-R runs as a discrete doublet ofMr ∼40,000, consistent with the predicted molecular mass (41 kDa) of the receptor, and is separate from extraneous phosphoproteins (15Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Mihalik B. Jayadev S. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, minimal basal phosphorylation of the wild-type HA-AT1A-R, or of the two DD mutant receptors, was observed in control cells (Fig.1A). However, exposure of wild-type HA-AT1A-R-expressing COS-7 cells to 100 nm Ang II for 5 min caused prominent phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 1A). In contrast, substitution of both Asp236 and Asp237 with alanine (DD-AA) or asparagine (DD-NN) reduced agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation by >60% (Fig. 1B). In principle, mutation of Asp236 and/or Asp237 to alanine or asparagine might “lock” the HA-AT1A-R into a conformation that is incapable of activation in response to agonist. Such inactive receptors would not only fail to isomerize to a conformation that permits phosphorylation, but could also be unable to transduce intracellular signals. However, exposure of DD-AA- or DD-NN-expressing COS-7 cells to Ang II caused a significant increase in [3H]inositol phosphate production (Fig.2A). Furthermore, when Ang II-stimulated increases in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation were normalized to an equal number of receptors, there was no reduction in the responses of the DD-AA- and DD-NN-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, Ang II-induced ERK activation, normalized to an equal degree of receptor expression, was also unaffected by the DD mutations. As shown in Fig. 2C, no differences in ERK phosphorylation were observed in COS-7 cells expressing wild-type or DD mutant AT1A receptors after 5 min of stimulation with 100 nm Ang II. These data indicate that the agonist-stimulated DD-AA and DD-NN receptors can isomerize to an active conformation with full efficacy for coupling to Gq/11 signaling and activation of the ERK phosphorylation cascade. Furthermore, since the magnitudes of Ang II-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate and ERK responses mediated by the DD-AA and DD-NN receptors did not exceed that mediated by the wild-type HA-AT1A-R, phosphorylation may not be essential for the desensitization mechanism(s) that normally limit signaling by the AT1 receptor (15Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Mihalik B. Jayadev S. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this context, we compared the magnitudes of Ang II-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate production mediated by the wild-type and the DD mutants with that mediated by a Δ335 truncated AT1 receptor. As observed previously (15Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Mihalik B. Jayadev S. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Ang II-induced intracellular signaling by the truncated AT1A-R was increased, an effect attributable to reduced desensitization of the hypophosphorylated receptor. The ability of the agonist-activated Δ335 receptor to stimulate inositol phosphate production was much greater than those of the wild-type and DD mutant receptors (Fig. 2, A and B), as was its effect on ERK signaling (data not shown). The capacity of the mutant receptors to undergo agonist-induced desensitization was evaluated (13Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) by pretreatment for 3 min with 100 nm Ang II, which significantly reduced the subsequent maximal Ang II-stimulated inositol phosphate production as compared with non-treated control cells expressing the wild-type receptor (Fig.3A). Attenuation of inositol phosphate generation was also observed when the DD mutant receptors were pretreated with 100 nm Ang II (Fig. 3A). Under similar conditions a small reduction was observed for the Δ335 receptor and was insignificant after normalization for receptor expression (Fig. 3B). In view of the apparent difference in the role that phosphorylation plays in the function of the HA-AT1A-R compared with that of the β2-AR, we also examined the internalization kinetics of the DD-AA and DD-NN receptors in COS-7 cells. Like the [3H] inositol phosphate and ERK responses mediated by these receptors, there was little difference in the rate and magnitude of 125I-Ang II internalization in DD-AA- or DD-NN-expressing cells compared with those expressing the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4). Hence, in contrast to the β2-AR, the majority of the agonist-induced HA-AT1A-R phosphorylation does not appear to be required for its internalization following Ang II stimulation. An evaluation of the structural requirements of the Asp236-Asp237 motif for optimal AT1A-R phosphorylation and signaling responses showed that substitution of either acidic residue with alanine (DD-AD, DD-DA) or glutamic acid (DD-DE, DD-ED) had little effect on Ang II-induced AT1A-R phosphorylation (Fig.5A). Replacement of both Asp236 and Asp237 with glutamic acid residues (DD-EE) likewise did not impair Ang II-induced HA-AT1A-R phosphorylation. Consistent with the normal signaling of the DD-AA and DD-NN receptors (Fig. 2A), the [3H]inositol phosphate responses mediated by the DD-AD, DD-DA, DD-DE, DD-ED, and DD-EE receptors were not significantly reduced (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the rate and magnitude of 125I-Ang II internalization by the mutant receptors were the same as those of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data indicate that a single acidic residue at position 236 or 237 is necessary f"

The purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism(s) responsible for the transcriptional regulation of theCYP3A7 gene in human hepatoma HepG2 cells that showed fetal phenotypes. Transfection studies using a series of theCYP3A7 or CYP3A4 promoter-luciferase chimeric genes identified a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-like element between nucleotides −2326 and −2297 that conferred the transcriptional activation of the CYP3A7 gene. A 1-base pair mismatch within the corresponding region of the CYP3A4 gene was sufficient for a differential enhancer activity. A gel shift assay using nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells showed that Sp1 and Sp3 bound to the NF-κB-like element of the CYP3A7 but notCYP3A4 gene. Specific activation of the CYP3A7promoter by Sp1 and Sp3 was confirmed by a co-transfection of the p3A7NF-κB or p3A4NF-κB reporter gene with Sp1 or Sp3 expression plasmid into Drosophila cells, which lacked endogenous Sp family. Additionally, introduction of mutations into binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β, upstream stimulatory factor 1, and a basic transcription element in the proximal promoter attenuated luciferase activity to 20% of the level seen with the intactCYP3A7 promoter. Thus, we conclude that the expression of the CYP3A7 gene in HepG2 cells is cooperatively regulated by Sp1, Sp3, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β, and upstream stimulatory factor 1.

Northern blot analysis using CYP3A7 or CYP3A4 cDNA as a probe and total RNAs prepared from human fetal and adult livers demonstrated that CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 mRNAs were expressed specifically in human fetal and adult livers, respectively (18Komori M. Nishio K. Kitada M. Shiramatsu K. Muroya K. Soma M. Nagashima K. Kamataki T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4430-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a trace amount of CYP3A7 mRNA could be detected in some adult livers (19Schuetz J.D. Beach D.L. Guzelian P.S. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). CYP3A7 mRNA was detectable at 50–60 days of gestation (20Yang H.Y. Lee Q.P. Rettie A.E. Juchau M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 922-928PubMed Google Scholar). This expression reached a maximal level within a week after birth and then declined (21Lacroix D. Sonnier M. Moncion A. Cheron G. Cresteil T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA was not seen in human fetal livers and began to increase after birth (21Lacroix D. Sonnier M. Moncion A. Cheron G. Cresteil T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the age-related expression of theCYP3A7 and CYP3A4 genes, however, has not yet been elucidated. As reported previously, we isolated genomic clones containing the 5′-flanking region and the 13 exons spanning ∼30 kb of theCYP3A7 or CYP3A4 gene (22Itoh S. Yanagimoto T. Tagawa S. Hashimoto H. Kitamura R. Nakajima Y. Okouchi T. Fujimoto S. Uchino J. Kamataki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Hashimoto H. Toide T. Kitamura R. Fujita M. Tagawa S. Itoh S. Kamataki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The structures of exon-intron junctions of the CYP3A7 and CYP3A4genes were highly conserved between the two genes. In addition, a 5′-flanking region from −1 kb to the transcriptional start site of theCYP3A7 gene was 91% identical to that of theCYP3A4 gene. In the same series of studies, we found characteristic sequences termed “HFLaSE” (P-450 HFLa-specific element) and “NFSE” (P-450NF-specific element) in the 5′-flanking region of the CYP3A7 and CYP3A4genes, respectively. However, we could not detect any age-related factors in gel shift assays using these elements as probes and nuclear extracts prepared from human fetal and adult livers. Thus, it appeared that a possible cis-acting element(s) responsible for the developmental transcription of the CYP3A7 orCYP3A4 gene was located in regions with minor differences or far upstream regions of the two genes. The expression of the CYP3A genes is inducible by a wide variety of clinically important drugs, including rifampicin, dexamethasone, and clotrimazole (24Maurel P. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P-450: Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 241-270Google Scholar). Recently, a human orphan nuclear receptor termed PXR, steroid and xenobiotic receptor, or pregnane-activated receptor that mediates the induction of CYP3As has been found (25Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D.

The PXR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer has been reported to interact with a PXR-responsive element that contains the everted repeat of an imperfect AGGTCA motif separated by 6 nucleotides (called as ER6). This element was identified in the proximal promoters of the CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 genes (25Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moor J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the loss of the expression of PXR protein does not alter the constitutive expression of murine CYP3A proteins (29Xie W. Barwick J.L. Downes M. Blumberg B. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Brunt E.M. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), a transcription factor(s) other than PXR is assumed to contribute to the constitutive expression of the CYP3A genes in mammals. In an attempt to analyze the function of a promoter expressed in human fetal livers, human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells have been used, because the cells show fetal hepatic phenotypes such as the increased synthesis of α-fetoprotein, fetal aldolase, and pyruvate kinase and the reduced synthesis of albumin (30Kelly J.H. Darlington G.J. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Successful results obtained so far suggest that HepG2 cells possess transcription factors necessary for the gene expression seen in the fetus. Thus, in the present study, HepG2 cells were employed and transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid in which the 5′-flanking region of the CYP3A7 or theCYP3A4 gene was fused to the luciferase gene to identify a possible cis-acting element(s) specifically responsible for the expression of the CYP3A7 gene. In this paper, we provide lines of evidence showing that the expression of CYP3A7 in HepG2 cells is coordinately regulated by HNF-3β, USF1, and the Sp (specificity protein) family members, which bind to the NF-κB-like element of theCYP3A7 gene. Human hepatoma cells, HepG2 and HuH-7, were purchased from Riken (Tsukuba, Japan). Drosophila SL2 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). HepG2 and HuH-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), nonessential amino acids (ICN, Aurora, OH), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. DrosophilaSL2 cells were maintained in Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 26 °C in 5% CO2. Total RNAs were prepared from human hepatoma cells according to an acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). To examine the expression levels of CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 mRNAs in HepG2 and HuH-7 cells, RT-PCR was performed as described previously (32Hakkola J.M. Pasanen M. Hukkanen J. Pelkonen O. Mäenpää J. Edwards R.J. Boobis A.R. Raunio H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (1 μg) and oligodeoxythymidylic acid primer (0.5 μg) were mixed. The RNA-primer mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice. Subsequently, Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (20 units) (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan), RNase inhibitor (20 units) (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), and 0.5 mm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates were added to the RNA-primer mixture and then incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. PCR was performed in a solution containing cDNA synthesized in a solution containing the above RT reaction mixture (1 μl), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, each primer (50 pmol), AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (2.5 units) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 10× AmpliTaq reaction buffer (5 μl) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 2 min.

To construct reporter plasmids p3A7/−5.0, p3A7/−4.5, p3A7/−4.0, p3A7/−3.5, and p3A7/−3.0, PCR was performed using 3A7/4–5.0XhoI, 3A7/4–4.5 XhoI, 3A7/4–4.0XhoI, 3A7/4–3.5 XhoI, or 3A7/4–3.0XhoI as a sense primer and 3A7/4-AS as an antisense primer. Synthesized fragments were digested with restriction enzymesXhoI and HindIII. Resultant fragments were inserted into the XhoI/HindIII site of p3A7/−5.5. To generate reporter plasmids p3A4/−5.0, p3A4/−4.5, p3A4/−4.0, p3A4/−3.5, and p3A4/−3.0, PCR was carried out using 3A7/4–5.0 XhoI, 3A7/4–4.5 XhoI, 3A7/4–4.0XhoI, 3A7/4–3.5 XhoI, or 3A7/4–3.0XhoI as a sense primer and 3A7/4-AS as an antisense primer.

Synthesized fragments were digested with XhoI and HindIII. Resultant fragments were inserted into the XhoI/HindIII site of Basic Vector 2. Reporter plasmids p3A7/−580, p3A4/−580, p3A7/−360, p3A4/−360, p3A7/−62, and p3A4/−62 were generated by the cleavage of p3A7/−1.0 or p3A4/−1.0 with restriction enzymesSacI, BglII, and PstI, respectively. To construct reporter plasmids p3A7Ewild and p3A4Ewild, a region from −2.50 to −2.25 kb was amplified by PCR using 3A7–2.5 XhoI or 3A4–2.5 XhoI as a sense primer and 3A7/4–2.25XhoI as an antisense primer. Synthesized fragments were digested with XhoI and then inserted into theXhoI site of p3A7/−62.

Reporter plasmids p3A7Emut. and p3A4Emut. were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using 3A4NF-κB-S, 3A4NF-κB-AS, 3A7NF-κB-S, and 3A7NF-κB-AS as mutated primers. To construct p3A7NF-κB or p3A4NF-κB, double-stranded 3A7NF-κB or 3A4NF-κB was introduced into the SmaI site of p3A7/−62. The copy number of the introduced oligonucleotides was confirmed by a sequence analysis.

To construct an expression plasmid for HNF-3β (named pAcHNF-3β), HNF-3β cDNA was isolated from CMV-HNF-3β (35Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. Robert H Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) bySpeI/EcoRV digestion and was inserted into theEcoRV site of pAc5.1/V5-His (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). To construct an expression plasmid for USF1 (named pAcUSF1), USF1 cDNA was isolated from USF-SRα (36Takahashi Y. Nakayama K. Itoh S. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kamataki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30025-30031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) byXhoI/XbaI digestion and was inserted into theXhoI/XbaI site of pAc5.1/V5-His. To construct the HNF-3β expression plasmid (named pCI-HNF-3β) for in vitro transcription and translation, HNF-3β cDNA was isolated from CMV-HNF-3β by SpeI/EcoRV digestion and was inserted into the SmaI site of pCI-Neo carrying T7 promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). HepG2 cells (2 × 106 cells) were plated onto a 60-mm dish and then transfected with a reporter plasmid (2–8 μg) and pRL-SV40 (0.1 μg) (Promega) as an internal control by using the methods of calcium phosphate co-precipitation (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Four hours after the DNA transfection, the cells were treated with 20% glycerol for 1.5 min. Transfection of DNA into SL2 cells was performed as described previously by Kudo (38Kudo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5492-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). After 36 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by a dual-luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). In vitrotranscription and translation assays were carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, the pCI-HNF-3β expression plasmid under control of T7 promoter (1 μg) was added to a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50% of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 20 μm complete amino acid mixture, a ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units), and T7 RNA polymerase (20 units). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction mixture (4 μl) was subjected to a gel shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (39Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The gel shift assay was performed with double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara). The binding reaction was carried out with a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4% Ficoll, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, poly(dI-dC) (0.5 μg), nuclear extracts (10 μg), and a 32P-labeled probe DNA (5 fmol). The mixture was incubated at 24 °C for 30 min. The samples were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA disodium salt at 100 V at room temperature and visualized by BAS-2500 Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies to Sp1, Sp3, NF-κB p50, and USF1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to HNF-3 (35Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) and Dr. Naoko Tanese (New York University, New York, NY), respectively. The supershift assay was performed using these antibodies as follows. After incubation of probe DNAs with nuclear extracts as described above, the antibodies were added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 24 °C for 1 h. The products were then analyzed by a gel shift assay.

https://openalex.org/W2026590297,"Bruner et al. examined the effectiveness of parks in the tropics, drawing on survey data to support their contention that parks 1) have been effective; 2) need more support; and 3) should remain a central component of conservation strategies. Their conclusions remain equivocal. The evidence in support of Bruner's first conclusion is equivocal. In the opinion of respondents, conditions within parks are better than in their surrounds. Parsimony begs whether these apparent differences have always existed, or could be an artefact of sampling (i.e., selection of the parks; design and conduct of the survey; comparing with surrounds larger than the parks in question). There is no evidence to support Bruner's second conclusion that increased support will improve effectiveness of parks. This lack of evidence prevails despite the fact that any personal bias on the part of directors involved in selecting the sample, and managers involved in completing the survey may have contributed to a more favourable (i.e., pro-park) result than a more rigorous survey might indicate. Bruner's third conclusion remains untested. His data and analyses shed no light on the relative efficacy of protected areas versus other conservation initiatives. Since both land and financial support for conservation are limited, the issue is not whether parks are good, but whether parks are better than the alternatives. There are several alternatives that could be examined, but a 10-km band around a park is not an informative alternative. In terms of conserving habitat, a better test would be a comparison of habitat quality within protected areas versus that in community managed areas and in other multiple-use initiatives. In terms of conserving species, a comparison of the performance (both in terms of success and cost) of protected areas versus ex-situ conservation efforts may be more relevant."
https://openalex.org/W1989821836,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels, expressed in atrial myocytes, various neurons, and endocrine cells, represent the paradigmatic target of βγ subunits released from activated heterotrimeric G proteins. These channels contribute to physiological slowing of cardiac frequency and synaptic inhibition. They are activated by βγ dimers released upon stimulation of receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (Gi/o), whereas βγ released from Gs do not converge on the channel subunits. This is in conflict with the finding that dimeric combinations of various β and γ subunits can activate GIRK channels with little specificity. In the present study, we have overexpressed the major subtypes of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors (β1-AR and β2-AR) in atrial myocytes by transient transfection. Whereas in native cells β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol failed to induce measurable GIRK current, robust currents were recorded from myocytes overexpressing either β1-AR or β2-AR. Whereas the β2-AR-induced current showed the same sensitivity to pertussis toxin as the current evoked by the endogenous Gi/o-coupled muscarinic M2 receptor, isoproterenol-activated currents were insensitive to pertussis toxin treatment in β1-AR-overexpressing myocytes. In contrast to a recent publication (Leaney, J. L., Milligan, G., and Tinker, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 921–929), sizable GIRK currents could also be activated by isoproterenol when the signaling pathway was reconstituted by transient transfection in two different standard cell lines (Chinese hamster ovary and HEK293). These results demonstrate that specificity of receptor-G protein signaling can be disrupted by overexpression of receptors.

The classical view of β-AR signaling is that the agonist-activated receptor interacts with the stimulatory type of G protein (Gs), which, via its α subunit, activates adenylate cyclase, resulting in phosphorylation of target proteins by protein kinase A (PKA), such as thel-type Ca2+ channel and phospholamban. In the heart β-ARs play an important role in acute modulation of cardiac output in response to variable demands of the organism by increasing pacemaker frequency and myocardial contractility. Apart from this classic role in acute regulation of mechanical and electrical functions of the heart, β-AR may be involved in long term control of myocytes including cell survival and apoptosis under various conditions (1Chesley A.

Additional interesting differences in signaling between β1-AR and β2-AR may also arise from differences in subcellular localization and organization with other signaling components (8Kuschel M.

This channel is composed, in a heterotetrameric fashion of GIRK1 channel (G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel 1) and GIRK4 channel (also termed Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 subunits). In the heart K(ACh) channels contribute to mediating the negative chronotropic effect of vagally released acetylcholine (ACh) via muscarinic M2 receptors (13Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) (M2ACh-R). Similar channels with different subunit composition are expressed in various endocrine cells and in the central nervous system, where they are supposed to be involved in inhibitory synaptic mechanisms (see Refs. 14Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar, 15Karschin A. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 215-220PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mark M.D. Herlitze S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5830-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar for reviews). These channels have in common that their gating is controlled by direct interaction of their subunits with βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (12Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar,17Perez-Terzic C. Pyle J. Jaconi M. Clapham D.E. Stehno-Bittel L.

In native atrial myocytes, only receptors coupled to pertussis toxin (Ptx)-sensitive G proteins (Gi/Go) were believed to couple to K(ACh) channels, such as M2 muscarinic, A1 purinergic, and a sphingolipid receptor belonging to the EDG family (18Bünemann M.

More recently, weak activation by stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors has been described in dog atrial myocytes, which could be enhanced by adenoviral infection, a maneuver that is assumed to increase expression of the Gαs subunit (20Sorota S. Rybina R. Yamamoto A. Du X.-Y. J. Physiol.(Lond.). 1999; 514: 413-423Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mullner et al. (21Mullner C. Vorobiov D. Bera A.K. Uezono Y. Yakubovich D. Frohnwieser-Steinecker B. Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) described a facilitation of M2AChR-induced activation of atrial GIRK current (IK(ACh)) in dog atrial myocytes as well as of GIRK channels expressed in Xenopusoocytes, which was suggested to be mediated by PKA phosphorylation at some point downstream of the receptor. These findings contrast with studies from other laboratories (22Wang Y.G. Lipsius S.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 565-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Meyer T. Pott L.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In those studies no effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on IK(ACh) was found in atrial myocytes under normal conditions. However, manipulation of Gβγ binding to other proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), in atrial myocytes resulted in a weak but significant activation of IK(ACh) by the unspecific β-agonist isoproterenol (Iso). As compared with the current that could be activated by a saturating concentration of ACh, currents caused by β-adrenergic stimulation in those studies were small. A small current remained following pre-treatment of myocytes with Ptx, using a protocol that completely inhibited the M2 pathway, suggesting that at least part of the β-adrenergic K(ACh) activation was via Gs. Thus, as a rule, no activation of native IK(ACh) is observed upon β-adrenergic stimulation, i.e. by βγ subunits released from Ptx-insensitive Gs. This contrasts with the finding that various βγ combinations can activate K(ACh) channels with little specificity when applied to the internal face of excised membrane patches (25Wickman K.D. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the oocyte expression system, robust macroscopic GIRK currents can be activated via co-expressed β2 adrenergic receptors (26Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarga C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To obtain further information on target specificity/promiscuity of β1-AR and β2-AR in their native environment, in the present study these receptors have been overexpressed in adult rat atrial myocytes by transient transfection. In β1-AR- and β2-AR-overexpressing myocytes, isoproterenol induced currents amounting to 70% of maximum IK(ACh). Evaluation of G protein specificity using Ptx showed a predominant contribution of Gi/Go for the β2-AR and a predominant, if not exclusive, contribution of Gs for the β1-AR. These data demonstrate that acutely overexpressed β-AR in atrial myocytes couple promiscuously to a classic target of Gi-derived βγ subunits. As overexpression of β-AR by gene transfer is considered as a therapeutic strategy to treat heart failure (e.g. Refs. 27Maurice J.P. Hata J.A. Shah A.S. White D.C. McDonald P.H. Dolber P.C.

Silvestry S.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Circulation. 2000; 101: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), this loss in target specificity should be taken into consideration. Experiments were performed with local ethics committee approval. Wistar Kyoto rats of either sex (around 200 g) were anesthetized by intravenous injection of urethan (1 g/kg). The chest was opened, and the heart was removed and mounted on the cannula of a sterile Langendorff apparatus for coronary perfusion at constant flow. The method of enzymatic isolation of atrial myocytes has been described elsewhere (e.g. Ref. 29Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol.(Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The culture medium was fetal calf serum-free bicarbonate-buffered M199 (Life Technologies, Inc., Dreieich, Germany) containing gentamycin (25 μg/ml, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were plated at a low density (several thousand cells per dish) on 36-mm culture dishes. Medium was changed 24 h after plating and then every 2nd day. Myocytes were used experimentally from day 0 until day 5 after isolation. No effects of time in culture were found as for the key experiments. For the patch clamp measurements of IK(ACh), an extracellular solution of the following composition was used (mm): 120 NaCl, 20 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10.0 Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. The solution for filling the patch clamp pipettes for whole cell measurements of G protein-activated K+ currents contained (mm): 110 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 5.0 NaCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 2.0 Na2ATP, 2.0 EGTA, 0.01 GTP, 10.0 HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4. For measurement of l-type Ca2+ current, the pipette filling solution had the following composition (mm): 140 CsCl, 7 MgCl2, 5 Na2ATP, 10 EGTA, 20 HEPES/CsOH, pH 7.3; and 20 μm GTP. Standard chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). EGTA, Hepes, MgATP, Ado, GTP, ACh-chloride, and isoprenaline chloride were from Sigma. CGP 207112A was kindly provided by Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland). Membrane currents were measured using whole-cell patch clamp. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and were filled with the solution listed above (DC resistance = 4–6 megohms). Currents were measured by means of a patch clamp amplifier (List LM/EPC 7, Darmstadt, Germany). Signals were analog-filtered (corner frequency of 1–3 kHz), digitally sampled at 5 kHz, and stored on a computer, equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for voltage control and data acquisition. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature (22–24 °C). If not otherwise stated, cells were voltage-clamped at −90 mV, i.e. negative to EK, resulting in inward K+ currents. Current-voltage relations were determined by means of voltage ramps between −120 mV and +60 mV. Rapid superfusion of the cells for application and withdrawal of different solutions was performed by means of a solenoid-operated flow system that permitted switching between up to six different solutions (t½ ≤ 100 ms). Myocytes, human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) methodology. Myocytes were cultured overnight to allow attachment. For transfection 2.5 μg/plate of the reporter IRES-EGFP receptor (CLONTECH) and 2.5 μg/plate of the constructs pcDNA3.1-β1R (rat, kindly provided by Dr. C. A. Machida) or human pcDNA-β2R, respectively, were used. All cDNAs were under cytomegalovirus promotor control. β1-AR cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites. To precomplex the DNA for each plate, constructs were incubated with 100 μl of transfection medium (M199 without fetal calf serum and antibiotics) and 5 μl of Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation 2 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was diluted in 100 μl of transfection medium, mixed with Plus/DNA solution, and incubated in the same way before dilution of transfection medium to a final volume of 1 ml. Myocytes were washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 3 h under normal cell culture conditions with the transfection solution. Thereafter, dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with medium M199 supplemented with gentamycin and kanamycin (20 μg/ml each) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells and CHO cells were transfected using the same protocol but different amounts of DNA. For transfection of both cell lines, 0.5 μg of IRES-EGFP vector, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-β1R, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-GIRK1 (mouse), 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-GIRK4 was used and incubated as described. As shown previously, in rat atrial myocytes studied under the experimental condition of the present study Iso neither induced a measurable IK(ACh), nor were any of the properties of the current modified. A representative recording of membrane current from a cell transfected with the EGFP vector only is shown in Fig.1. Iso at 10 μm, a concentration that is saturating for both β-AR subtypes, did not cause activation of IK(ACh), nor did the β-agonist affect the response to ACh when applied before or simultaneously with the muscarinic agonist. This behavior is representative of more than 100 cells studied, including freshly isolated cells, non-transfected myocytes cultured for 3–5 days and EGFP-transfected cells cultured for 3–4 days after transfection. Moreover, this was independent of the concentration of ACh ([ACh] ≥ 5*10−8 m ≥ 2*10−5 m). This finding is not limited to myocytes from rats but could be confirmed also in freshly isolated and cultured guinea pig atrial myocytes (data not shown). In none of these cells did exposure to Iso result in activation of IK(ACh)or modification of its properties. This confirms previous studies (23Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Meyer T. Pott L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,24Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Brandts B. Meyer T. Pott L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and clearly demonstrates that in rat and guinea pig atrial myocytes endogenous β-AR fail to activate IK(ACh) by βγ subunits released from the coupling G protein(s). Furthermore, in the system under study, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the channel subunits or any other component relevant to this signaling pathway does not seem affect the properties of the native current (see also Fig. 5).Figure 5Forskolin fails to activate IK( ACh ) but potentiates L-type Ca2+current. A, representative current recording from a β2-AR-overexpressing myocyte. B, sample traces of l-type Ca2+ currents (leak subtracted) evoked by stepping from −50 mV holding potential to −5 mV; thenumbers refer to panel C, which represents a plot of ICa amplitude versustime.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In EGFP-positive myocytes, co-transfected with the pcDNA-β1 vector, robust Iso-induced currents were recorded. A representative example is illustrated in Fig.2A. In this measurement atropine (1 μm) was superfused before and simultaneously with Iso in order to completely shut off the M2AChR-linked pathway. A comparable result was obtained in myocytes overexpressing the β2-AR subtype (Fig. 2B). Identity of the Iso-induced current with IK(ACh) was confirmed by its current-voltage relation (panel C), which perfectly matched the I/V curve of ACh-induced current. The summarized data from myocytes overexpressing the β1-AR (n = 12) or the β2-AR (n= 12) yielded mean currents of comparable densities for both receptors amounting to ∼70% of IK(ACh) induced by M2AChR stimulation by a saturating concentration of ACh. Atrial IK(ACh) undergoes a partial rapid desensitization, which, as a distinct kinetic component, is only seen upon fast application of agonist, i.e. fast activation of the current (compare Fig. 1). Rapid or acute desensitization can also be identified as a reduction in total current, when two activating agonists are present simultaneously (e.g. Refs. 30Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Pflügers Arch. 1987; 410: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Meyer T. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Biewald A. Bender K. Eickel A. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of this variable component of desensitization is not known yet. It is supposed, however, to reflect a phenomenon related to the channel complex, rather than a receptor desensitization, common to many, if not all, members of the seven-helix superfamily (see Refs. 33Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar and 34Bünemann M. Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar for reviews). This view is mainly supported by the observation that it is heterologous and it is the more pronounced, the larger the current density, independent of the species of receptor used for activation (e.g. M2AChR, A1-adenosine receptor; Refs. 30Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 35Bünemann M. Pott L. J. Physiol.(Lond.). 1995; 482: 81-92Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that this property of macroscopic IK(ACh) is associated with the GIRK1 subunit, since currents carried by homomeric GIRK4 channels lack a distinct desensitizing component (36Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Inanobe A. Meyer T. Kurachi Y. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28873-28880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The heterologous nature of fast desensitization, i.e. its independence on receptor species, is confirmed by the representative current traces from a β2-AR-overexpressing cell presented in Fig. 3. It shows that sensitivity to ACh was substantially reduced on the background of an Iso-activated current, which amounted to 65% of peak ACh-induced IK(ACh). The total current in the presence of both agonists was 74% of peak IK(ACh). As shown previously (e.g. Refs. 30Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 36Bender K. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Inanobe A. Meyer T. Kurachi Y. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28873-28880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this occlusive behavior is due to the fact that desensitization of GIRK channels by Iso took place during the activation phase, resulting in a current trajectory that lacks a distinct desensitizing component. In the lower panel the activation phases of the current induced by rapid application of ACh, Iso, or both agonists simultaneously have been superimposed. Interestingly, not only were the amplitudes of currents induced by ACh or ACh plus Iso, respectively, identical, their activation kinetics were also identical, i.e. activation rate was saturated at 20 μm ACh. Taken together, these data, which qualitatively were confirmed in 9 myocytes (4 β1-AR/5 β2-AR) to which such an experimental protocol was applied, support the notion that both receptors converge on the same population of K(ACh) channels. The observation illustrated in Fig. 3 might suggest that Gβγ binding site(s) on the channels subunits become saturated at a concentration of Gβγ, which is small compared with the concentration of free Gβγ that can be produced by activation of a large number of receptors. A myocyte transfected with either of the two receptor subtypes should contain native β1-AR, native β2-AR, and the overexpressed subtype. It is conceivable, therefore, that activation of IK(ACh) proceeds by the native receptors plus the overexpressed subtype, simply due to the fact that the loss in target specificity is related to the increase in total number of β-AR. Alternatively, activation of IK(ACh) could result from the overexpressed β-AR only, without a contribution of the native receptors, which might be precluded from activating IK(ACh)due to functional compartmentalization with other signaling components (5Xiao R.-P. Cheng H. Zhou Y.-Y. Kuschel M. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 37Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We addressed this question by means of the β1-AR specific antagonist CGP20712A (CGP). As shown in Fig.4A, CGP at 10 μmdid not affect the current induced by 10 μm Iso in a β2-AR-transfected myocyte, suggesting that native β1-AR do not contribute to the response or, at least, that their contribution is below the detection limit. On the other hand, CGP completely inhibited the Iso-induced current in β1-AR-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B); identity of the inhibited current with IK(ACh) was confirmed by the difference current voltage relation (Fig. 4C). This, in turn, suggests that native β2-AR are not involved in activation of IK(ACh), since their contribution should be resistant to this antagonist. Complete insensitivity of Iso-induced IK(ACh) to 10 μm CGP was observed in 4/4 β2-AR-overexpressing myocytes, whereas a complete block of Iso-induced IK(ACh)was found in 4/4 myocytes overexpressing β1-AR. An analogous experiment using a selective β2-AR antagonist (ICI118,551) could not be performed, since this compound, at concentrations >0.1 μm inhibited IK(ACh) induced by ACh (Fig.4D), presumably by a direct blocking action on the K(ACh) channel. A recent paper (21Mullner C. Vorobiov D. Bera A.K. Uezono Y. Yakubovich D. Frohnwieser-Steinecker B. Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed some interference of β-adrenergic stimulation with native and expressed GIRK channels, which was interpreted in terms of a PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Moreover, Ref.38Medina I. Krapivinsky G. Arnold S. Kovoor P. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29709-29716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar demonstrated that protein phosphorylation in the C terminus of GIRK1 is conditional for Gβγ activation of GIRK1/GIRK4 channel complexes. Information on the signaling mechanism controlling GIRK1 phosphorylation, including the type of protein kinase involved, was not provided in that publication. On this background, it cannot be excluded that, in myocytes overexpressing β-ARs, apart from a Gβγ-mediated activation, a PKA-mediated effect contributes to activation of IK(ACh). To bypass Gβγ signaling, we used forskolin, a direct (receptor-independent) activator of PKA. Fig.5A demonstrates that forskolin (10 μm), applied for 90 s, in a myocyte overexpressing β2-AR failed to cause any measurable activation of IK(ACh), whereas Iso induced a robust inward current of 80% of the maximum current. This result is qualitatively representative for 10/10 non-transfected and 9/9 β-AR-transfected cells. In none of these cells did forskolin induce a measurable K+ current or altered properties of IK(ACh)activated by ACh. It has been shown previously that atrial myocytes isolated from guinea pig hearts and cultured under otherwise identical conditions respond to stimulation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway by Iso or forskolin, respectively, by a substantial increase in l-type Ca2+ current (ICa), a paradigmatic target for PKA in cardiac myocytes in general (Ref. 39Boller M. Pott L. Pflügers Arch. 1989; 415: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; see Ref. 40Pelzer D. Pelzer S. McDonald T.F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

In order to confirm that the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway is also working in cultured rat myocytes under the present experimental conditions, we tested the effect of forskolin on ICa.

https://openalex.org/W1549384319,"We identified a novel metabolic system of morphine in the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.). In response to stress, morphine is quickly metabolized to bismorphine consisting of two morphine units, followed by accumulation in the cell wall. This bismorphine binds predominantly to pectins, which possess high galacturonic acid residue contents, through ionical bonds. Our newly developed method using artificial polysaccharides demonstrated that bismorphine bridges are formed between the two amino groups of bismorphine and the carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid residues, resulting in cross-linking of galacturonic acid-containing polysaccharides to each other. The ability of bismorphine to cross-link pectins is much higher than that of Ca2+, which also acts as a cross-linker of these polysaccharides. Furthermore, we confirmed that cross-linking of pectins through bismorphine bridges leads to resistance against hydrolysis by pectinases. These results indicated that production of bismorphine is a defense response of the opium poppy. Bismorphine formation is catalyzed by anionic peroxidase that pre-exists in the capsules and leaves of opium poppies. The constitutive presence of morphine, together with bismorphine-forming peroxidase, enables the opium poppy to rapidly induce the defense system.

Among these, morphine has attracted a great deal of attention as one of the most medicinally important analgesics and narcotics. Therefore, numerous studies on morphine have been carried out since its first isolation in 1804 by Sertürner (1Sertürner F.W.A.F. J. Pharm. Ärzte Apotheker Chem. 1806; 14: 47-93Google Scholar), but why the opium poppy produces this compound remains unknown. Morphine is structurally classified into alkaloid, based on the presence of nitrogen in its molecule. Many higher plants including the opium poppy synthesize a variety of alkaloids, and like urea and uric acid in animals, these alkaloids have often been suggested to be produced as nitrogenous waste products with little physiological importance for host plants. However, this hypothesis lacks precise experimental evidence (2Robinson T. Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Biophysics: The Biochemistry of Alkaloids.2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1981Google Scholar). In addition, the significant physiological roles of some alkaloids in host plants have been demonstrated by characterizing the biological properties of the alkaloids and their metabolites; steroid alkaloids such as tomatine and solanidine are involved in protecting plants against herbivores and microbial pathogens (3Robinson T.

Therefore, it is not reasonable to regard all alkaloids including morphine as waste products, although in contrast to these steroidal and pyridine alkaloids, little information is available concerning the physiological function of morphine in opium poppy. Important information on the physiological roles of several plant secondary constituents as well as the above pyridine alkaloids can be obtained by investigating the properties of their metabolites. For example, the main steroid saponins of oat (Avena sativa), avenacosides A and B, have been shown to be metabolized by endogenous β-glucosidase into 26-desglucoavenacosides A and B, respectively, which function as antibacterial substances against pathogens (6Tschesche R.

Furthermore, we recently investigated the metabolic pathway of flavone glucuronide in the skullcap plant (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi), and the metabolite (baicalein) of baicalein 7-O-β-d-glucuronide has been shown to play an important role in detoxification of the large amount of H2O2 produced by the oxidative burst (8Morimoto S.

These results indicated that precise understanding of morphine metabolism may provide the useful evidence from which its physiological importance in the opium poppy is inferred. Recent studies have almost completely elucidated the biosynthetic mechanism of morphine (12Kutchan T.M. The Alkaloid. 50. Academic Press, New York1998: 257-316Google Scholar), but metabolism of morphine in the opium poppy is largely unknown. Therefore, to determine the physiological importance of morphine, we investigated its metabolism in the opium poppy. Our results indicated that in response to mechanical damage, morphine immediately undergoes oxidation by bismorphine-forming peroxidase (BFP)1 and is metabolized into the dimer of morphine, bismorphine. Biochemical characterization of bismorphine demonstrated that the two amino groups of this alkaloid ionically bind to the carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid residues of cell wall polysaccharides pectins, resulting in cross-linking of pectins to each other. Furthermore, we confirmed that binding of bismorphine to pectins significantly contributes to their resistance to hydrolysis by pectinase. We report here the metabolism of morphine and its novel physiological role in the opium poppy. Opium poppies (P. somniferum L.) were grown in the herbal garden of the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Kyushu University. Opium poppies at 10–15 days after flowering were used in this study. Wounding of the capsules was carried out as follows. The immature capsules (fresh weight, 15–20 g) were scratched using a blade (15 scratches/capsule; length of scratch, 2.0 cm; interval of each scratch, 2.0 mm). The opium poppies of which the capsules had been scratched were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C in a greenhouse. The scratched regions were cut off the capsules and used as the wounded capsules. We confirmed that reproducible results were obtained by these procedures. Crude cell walls prepared from the wounded capsules (200 g) were sonicated in 20 mm HCl (100 ml) for 10 min. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min, and the HCl extracts were neutralized with 0.1m NaOH. After concentration under vacuum, the residue was washed with 1% (v/v) ammonia water (50 ml) and then applied to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to afford bismorphine (2.5 mg). The structure of bismorphine was determined by obtaining its1H and 13C NMR (Varian) spectra. NMR data were assigned as follows: 1H NMR (diemethylsulfoxide-d6, 500 MHz) ppm; 1.68 (2H,H-15,15′), 1.99 (2H,H-15,15′), 2.09 (2H,H-9,9′), 2.28 (2H,H-16,16′), 2.38 (6H,N-Me), 2.48 (2H,H-16,16′), 2.56 (2H,H-13,13′), 2.88 (2H,H-9,9′), 3.28 (2H,H-14,14′), 4.10 (2H,H-6,6′), 4.71 (1H,H-5,5′), 5.26 (2H,H-7,7′), 5.57 (2H,H-8,8), and 6.30 (2H,H-2,2′);13C NMR (dimethyl sulfoxide-d6, 100 MHz) ppm; 20.0 (C-9,9′), 35.3 (C-15,15′), 40.6 (C-13,13′), 42.8 (C-12,12′, Me), 46.0 (C-16,16′), 58.1 (C-14,14′), 66.3 (C-6,6′), 91.7 (C-5,5′), 120.9 (C-2,2′), 124.9 (C-10,10′), 128.1 (C-11,11′), 128.3 (C-8,8′), 129.5 (C-1,1′), 133.4 (C-7,7′), 135.6 (C-3,3′), and 147.1 (C-4,4′). The immature capsules (100 g) from which seeds were removed were homogenized with distilled water (2,000 ml) and filtered using filter papers. The residue was consecutively washed with distilled water (2,000 ml), 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 (2,000 ml), EtOH (2,000 ml), acetone (2,000 ml), and hexane (2,000 ml). After drying under vacuum, the residue was used as the crude cell wall fraction. Fractionation of the crude cell walls was carried out by a modification of the method of Srisuma et al. (13Srisuma N. Ruengsakulrach S. Uebersax M.A. Bennink M.R. Hammerschmidt R. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1991; 39: 855-858Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The crude cell wall fraction (10 g) was heated twice in 0.5% (w/v) ammonium oxalate (500 ml) at 85 °C to remove pectins and then washed with water (500 ml). After drying under vacuum, the residue was incubated twice in 1 m NaOH (500 ml) at room temperature for 18 h and washed with water (2,000 ml) to afford the lignocellulose fraction. This fraction was incubated in 72% (v/v) H2SO4 at 4 °C for 36 h to give the lignin fraction. The crude cell wall fraction (50–200 mg) of opium poppies was homogenized with 20 mm HCl (20–80 ml), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The amount of bismorphine in the supernatant was measured using an HPLC system equipped with a 0.46 × 15-cm column of Cosmosil 5C18 AR-II (Nacalai, Kyoto). Bismorphine was eluted with 60% (for quantitative analysis) or 50% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile (for identification and isolation of bismorphine) containing 5 mm sodium di-2-ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (14Kubiak E.J. Munson J.W. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1980; 69: 152-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The pH of the mobile phase was adjusted to 3.3 using acetic acid. The eluate was monitored by absorption at 280 nm. The amount of bismorphine was calculated from the standard curve obtained with the authentic sample. Assay mixtures consisting of 35 μm bismorphine, crude cell wall fraction (5 mg), and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 500 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The cell walls were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the amount of bismorphine in the supernatant was quantified by HPLC. The amount of bismorphine bound to the cell walls was calculated by subtracting the amount of bismorphine in the assay mixture incubated without the cell walls from that in the supernatant. We confirmed that 668 μg of bismorphine bound to 1 g of the crude cell wall fraction under these conditions and that bound bismorphine was completely solubilized with 20 mm HCl. Uronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B was prepared as follows. Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dry weight, 3 g) preswollen with water was suspended in 0.2 n NaOH (20 ml) solution containing galacturonic acid or glucuronic acid (each 400 mg). After incubation at room temperature for 24 h, the gel was washed with 1 m NaCl (100 ml), and then water (100 ml) was used as uronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B. A 60 μmbismorphine solution (300 ml) was loaded onto the column (1.0 × 5.0 cm) containing uronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B. After application of 0.2% (w/v) polysaccharide solution (5 ml) to the same column, the gel was washed with water (20 ml). The bound polysaccharides were eluted with 20 mm HCl (20 ml), and the amounts of polysaccharides in the HCl eluate were quantified by phenol/sulfuric acid analysis. The crude cell wall fraction (50 mg) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in 50 ml of 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.5) containing bismorphine (30 μg). We confirmed that all bismorphine was bound to the cell walls. Pectinase treatment of the crude cell sample was carried out by a modification of the method of Cervone et al. (15Cervone F. Scala A. Foresti M. Cacacr M.G. Noviello C. Biochim. Biopys. Acta. 1977; 482: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Aspergillus pectinase (Sigma; 1 unit) was added to these samples and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Ammonium oxalate (100 mg) was added to the enzymatic reaction mixture and then heated at 85 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the reducing groups in the supernatant were quantified using dinitrosalicylic acid reagent. To determine the amounts of pectin fragments released from the cell walls, the above enzymatic reaction mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the pectin fragments in the supernatant were quantified by phenol/sulfuric acid analysis. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise indicated. The immature capsules of opium poppies (30 g) were homogenized in 100 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 100 ml) containing 3 mmmercaptoethanol and then filtered through Nylon filters. The filtrate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was fractionated by the addition of ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitating at 65% saturation were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and then dialyzed overnight against 10 mm phosphate buffer (3000 ml, pH 7.0). The dialyzed sample (crude enzyme solution) was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was washed with three column volumes of the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.4 m) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing BFP were collected, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The dialysate was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.0 × 10.0 cm). The column was washed with the same buffer (100 ml) and then with a 200-ml gradient of 10–200 mm phosphate buffer. Potent BFP activity was detected in fractions eluted with 10 mmphosphate buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The most active fractions were directly loaded onto a column containing morphine-conjugated Sepharose 6B (1.0 × 10.0 cm), which was prepared using 50 mg of morphine and epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dry weight, 3 g) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After washing with 30 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl was passed through the column at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The fractions containing BFP activity were pooled, concentrated, and used for the kinetic studies. The assay mixtures consisted of 5 mm morphine, 5 mm H2O2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and enzyme solution (100 μl) in a final volume of 500 μl. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated with 500 μl of HPLC mobile phase. The amount of bismorphine liberated was quantified by HPLC. A solution (100 ml) containing 143 mg of morphine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm H2O2 was incubated at 30 °C for 12 h with crude enzyme solution prepared from 30 g of the immature capsules. The precipitates containing bismorphine were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with distilled water (50 ml) and then with EtOH (50 ml). The washed samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (5 ml), and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Water (30 ml) was added to the supernatant, and the resulting precipitates were collected by similar centrifugation to afford bismorphine (62 mg). To determine the metabolic pathway of morphine, we first attempted to identify morphine metabolites in the opium poppy by HPLC analysis and by feeding with 3H-labeled morphine. However, no morphine metabolites were detected in the intact immature capsules of opium poppies using these methods. In contrast, we found that an unknown alkaloid accumulated at the site of damage in the wounded capsules (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, incorporation of 3H-labeled morphine into this unknown compound was observed by feeding experiments (data not shown), confirming that this was a metabolite of morphine. This metabolite was purified from the damaged capsules of opium poppies by preparative HPLC, and its mass spectrum and NMR spectra were obtained. The fast atom bombardment mass spectrum showed an [M+H]+ ion peak at m/z 569, indicating the dimeric nature of the metabolite. Furthermore, the1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, which were almost identical to those of morphine except for the aromatic signals, indicated that this dimeric compound possessed a symmetrical structure. Based on analyses of the two-dimensional NMR spectra, the metabolite was finally determined to be dimeric morphine (called bismorphine in this study), in which two morphine units are oxidatively coupled to each other through a biphenyl bond (Fig. 1B). Bismorphine is a new alkaloid with a dimeric structure. Changes in the amount of bismorphine after wounding of the immature capsules are assessed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2, bismorphine was not detected in the intact capsules, and its production was induced immediately after wounding. The amount of bismorphine increased rapidly until 2 h after wounding, and thereafter its production rate became relatively slow. The capsules at 24 h after wounding produced ∼600 μg/g cell walls of bismorphine (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the accumulation (450 μg/g cell walls) of bismorphine was also confirmed in the dead, brown tissue of the immature capsules infected by pathogens. Taken together with the absence of bismorphine in the intact capsules, these results suggested that production of bismorphine is induced rapidly by various forms of stress. The localization of bismorphine accumulating in the wounded capsules was deduced from its solubility in various solvents. Solvents such as water, ethanol, and acetone were less effective for bismorphine extraction from the damaged capsules, whereas bismorphine was readily solubilized using aqueous solvents containing HCl, CaCl2, NaCl, and EDTA (Fig.3A), which are often used for extraction of components ionically associated with cell walls (16Ridge I. Osborne D.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Bradley J.D. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more than 90% of the bismorphine produced by the wounded capsules was recovered in the crude cell wall fraction (Fig.3B). These results indicated that most of the bismorphine induced by wounding was ionically bound to the cell walls. As shown in Fig. 3A, NaCl or EDTA accelerated the extraction of bismorphine in a concentration-dependent manner, although bismorphine exhibited low solubility in 100 mm HCl or CaCl2 as compared with respective 20 mmsolutions. Acidic conditions and divalent ions significantly change the physical properties of cell wall polysaccharide pectins, resulting in the solidification of pectins (18McNeil M. Darvill A.G. Fry S.C. Albersheim P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 625-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 19Varner J.E. Lin L.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that such changes in the pectin moiety caused the inhibition of bismorphine extraction. We also investigated to which cell wall components bismorphine binds. The cell walls from the wounded capsules were fractionated into three fractions (pectins, hemicellulose, and lignocellulose), and the bismorphine in each fraction was quantified. However, it was impossible to precisely quantify bismorphine, because during fractionation most bismorphine was solubilized from the cell wall. Therefore, the localization of bismorphine was determined by in vitrobinding assay. Bismorphine was incubated with cell wall samples fractionated according to Srisuma's procedure (13Srisuma N. Ruengsakulrach S. Uebersax M.A. Bennink M.R. Hammerschmidt R. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1991; 39: 855-858Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the amount of bismorphine bound to each fraction was then analyzed. As shown in Fig.4A, bismorphine exhibited apparently lower affinity for the cell wall fraction when pectins were removed, as compared with the crude cell walls. Thus, it became evident that bismorphine is predominantly bound to pectins. In the cell walls from which pectins and hemicellulose had been removed, a further decrease was observed in the amount of bound bismorphine, suggesting that a small amount of bismorphine is also bound to the hemicellulose moiety. Little bismorphine was bound to the lignin fraction. Pectins, which are structurally classified into three types (polygalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I, and rhamnogalacturonan II), possess high galacturonic acid residue contents, whereas xylans belonging to hemicelluloses have low glucuronic acid residue contents (18McNeil M. Darvill A.G. Fry S.C. Albersheim P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 625-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 19Varner J.E. Lin L.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because morphinan alkaloids readily form alkaloid salts with organic acids (2Robinson T. Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Biophysics: The Biochemistry of Alkaloids.2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1981Google Scholar), we assumed that bismorphine is ionically bound to the carboxyl groups of these uronic acid residues. This was unequivocally confirmed by the observation that bismorphine did not bind to the cell walls where carboxyl groups were extensively esterified by diazomethane treatment (Fig. 4B). Considering the dibasic nature of bismorphine, it is likely that the two amino groups simultaneously form ionic bonds with carboxyl groups of pectins, leading to cross-linking of pectins to each other through bismorphine bridges (Fig.5A). To confirm this hypothesis, we developed a chromatographic method using artificial polysaccharides as a matrix, prepared by coupling of galacturonic acid with Sepharose 6B through ether linkages (Fig. 5B). Bismorphine was readily absorbed to galacturonic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B, whereas HCl solution or NaCl solution effectively solubilized bound bismorphine, confirming that bismorphine is ionically bound to the galacturonic acid residues of the matrix. If bismorphine can form bismorphine bridges between this matrix and polysaccharides, the polysaccharides should bind to the matrix as shown in Fig.5B. Pectins were loaded onto the galacturonic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B column pretreated with bismorphine, and the substances absorbed to the column were then eluted with HCl solution. Quantitative analysis using phenol/sulfuric acid reagent confirmed that pectins bound to the bismorphine-treated matrix (Fig.6A). Thus, it was evident that bismorphine possesses the ability to cross-link pectins to each other through bismorphine bridges (Fig. 5A). Small amounts of pectins bound to the matrix without any pretreatment (control), and we assumed that this may have been due to interaction between pectins and few charged groups in Sepharose. A similar experiment was carried out using the same matrix treated with the monobasic alkaloid morphine instead of bismorphine, but the amount of pectins bound to the matrix was almost identical to that in the control sample (Fig.6A), indicating that morphine lacks the ability to form cross-linkages.Figure 6Amount of pectin bound to uronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B. Pectins were loaded onto galacturonic acid-conjugated (A) or glucuronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B (B) pretreated with bismorphine (12 μmol), morphine (11 μmol), or Ca2+ (12 μmol). Control experiments were carried out using the same matrix without any pretreatment. Pectins bound to the matrix were eluted with 20 mm HCl and quantified by phenol/sulfuric acid analysis. The data are the means of five replicate assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, glucuronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B was also prepared, and pectins were applied to this matrix pretreated with bismorphine. Binding of pectins to the matrix was observed, although its amount was lower than the values obtained using galacturonic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B (Fig. 6B). These results were consistent with the above finding that bismorphine was predominantly bound to the pectin fraction rather than the hemicellulose fraction with low glucuronic acid residue contents. On the other hand, like starch, polysaccharides containing no uronic acid residues were not cross-linked to uronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B, even if each matrix was treated with bismorphine, indicating that cross-linking of polysaccharides through bismorphine bridges is significantly dependent on the contents of uronic acid. Similarly to bismorphine, divalent ions such as Ca2+ are also known to bind to carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid residues in pectins and cross-link these polysaccharides to each other. When the ability of Ca2+ to cross-link pectins was compared with that of bismorphine using both uronic acid-conjugated gels, we found that the amount of pectins cross-linked by bismorphine was much higher than that by Ca2+ (Fig. 6). Previously, two groups reported that xylans in several monocots are cross-linked through diferuloylester bridges and assumed that such cross-linking results in resistance to enzymatic digestion (20Markwalder H.U. Neukom H. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-837Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Hartley R.D. Jones E.C. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 1157-1160Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Bismorphine is structurally different from diferulic acid, but both compounds have a biphenyl bond. Therefore, we hypothesized that cross-linking of pectins through bismorphine bridges may lead to resistance to digestion by pectin-hydrolyzing enzymes. To confirm this hypothesis, the effects of bismorphine on pectinase reaction were examined using the crude cell wall fraction prepared from the intact capsules. The crude cell wall fraction treated with bismorphine was incubated in the presence of pectinase, and the reducing groups, which were produced by enzymatic hydrolysis, were quantified. The amount (23 nmol) of the reducing groups from bismorphine-treated cell walls was lower than that (69 nmol) from the untreated cell walls. Furthermore, we confirmed that bismorphine treatment also reduced the amounts (185 μg) of pectin fragments released by the enzymatic reaction from the cell walls, as compared with that (335 μg) from the untreated cell walls. Because these results were obtained at a level of bismorphine (600 μg/g cell walls) that the wounded capsules can produce, we concluded that bismorphine accumulating in the wounded capsules contributes to protection of pectins from hydrolysis by pectinase. Because production of bismorphine was regarded as a novel defense response of the opium poppy, we attempted to determine its biosynthetic mechanism by identifying and characterizing the enzymes involved in this reaction. Morphine was incubated under various conditions in the presence of crude enzyme extracts prepared from the immature capsules of opium poppies, and reaction products were then analyzed by HPLC. Bismorphine was produced only in the presence of H2O2, indicating that bismorphine formation is catalyzed by peroxidase. This peroxidase (BFP) was also found in the leaves of opium poppies (0.7 microkatal/g leaves), but its activity was lower than that in the immature capsules (1.3 microkatal/g capsules). In contrast, no activity was detected in the roots of this plant. We tested whether the BFP activity is induced by wounding of immature capsules, but the enzyme activity did not increase by wounding the immature capsules (Fig.7A). Purification of BFP was carried out by a four-step procedure. Crude enzyme extracts prepared from the immature capsules were fractionated by ammonium sulfate saturation. The fraction precipitated by 65% saturation was applied to a DE-cellulose (DE-52) column and then to a hydroxylapatite column. Finally this peroxidase was purified to homogeneity by affinity column chromatography over morphine-conjugated Sepharose 6B. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified BFP displayed a monomeric molecular mass of about 33 kDa (Fig. 7B), whereas the pI for this peroxidase was estimated to be 5.0 by isoelectric focusing. The enzyme activity of BFP was maximal at pH 9.0, with half-maximal activities at pH values around 7.5. and 10.0. Therefore, standard assay conditions included Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) containing 5 mm H2O2. Under these conditions, BFP catalyzed the dimerization of morphine, whereas the other oligomers and polymers of morphine were not detected in the assay solution. We also tested the substrate specificity of BFP using several morphinan alkaloids. In contrast to morphine, its biosynthetic precursors thebaine and codeine were not substrates of this peroxidase (Fig.7C). In addition, BFP did not catalyze oxidation of various phenolics (guaiacol, catechol, pyrogallol, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid), which are often used as substrates of phenol peroxidase (22Kim S.S. Wender S.H. Smith E.C. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 165-168Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Chabanet A. Catesson A.M. Goldberg R. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 759-763Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Vitali A. Botta B. Monache G.D. Zappitelli S. Ricciardi P. Melino S. Petruzzelli R. Giardina B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, we found that BFP displayed restricted substrate specificity. Despite numerous studies on morphine, nothing is known about its roles in the opium poppy. In the present study, we identified the novel metabolic pathway by which morphine is oxidized into the dibasic alkaloid bismorphine in the opium poppy and established the physiological importance of this metabolism. Various alkaloids have been isolated from opium poppies, but the morphine dimer has not been identified previously. Because several morphine derivatives have been shown to have strong affinity for opioid receptors and to display potent analgesic effects (25Oguri K. Yamada-Mori I. Shigezane J. Hirano H. Yoshimura H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 102: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we also investigated the binding ability of bismorphine to opioid receptors. However, its affinity for receptor μ was markedly lower than that of morphine. 2S. Morimoto, Y. Shoyama, and Y. Shimohigashi, unpublished data. The physiological importance of morphine metabolism in the opium poppy was confirmed by investigating the properties of bismorphine. Interestingly, bismorphine was bound readily to cell wall polysaccharides containing uronic acid residues such as pectins and hemicellulose. In addition, our newly developed method using artificial polysaccharides demonstrated that these polysaccharides are cross-linked through bismorphine bridges and that bismorphine more effectively cross-links pectins than other polysaccharides including hemicellulose. Taken together with the observation that bismorphine accumulated in the site of damage in the capsules, these results suggested that bismorphine may hold together pectin fragments produced by wounding. On the other hand, morphine, the precursor of bismorphine, was also ionically bound to the uronic acid residues of these artificial polysaccharides, whereas this alkaloid did not cross-link pectins. Because the morphine molecule possesses only one amino group, it is reasonable that this alkaloid lacks cross-linking ability. The divalent ions such as Ca2+ are known to cross-link pectins to each other, resulting in formation of gels (18McNeil M. Darvill A.G. Fry S.C. Albersheim P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 625-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 19Varner J.E. Lin L.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that treatment of plant tissues with Ca2+ or chelating agents stiffens or softens them, respectively, it has been proposed that cross-linking of pectins through Ca2+ contributes to strengthening of the plant wall and adhesion of plant cells (26Roberts K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Levy S. Staehelin L.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our experiments using uronic acid-conjugated Sepharose 6B indicated that the cross-linking ability of bismorphine for uronic acid-containing polysaccharides is much higher than that of Ca2+. In addition, we confirmed that pectins form gels in the presence of bismorphine (data not shown). These results suggested that bismorphine may have physiological functions similar to those of Ca2+. It is of interest that the opium poppy synthesizes bismorphine with Ca2+-like function by dimerization of the monobasic alkaloid morphine. Cross-linking of polysaccharides through other secondary constituents has been demonstrated in monocots. For example, diferulic acid in which two ferulic acid units are oxidatively coupled to each other through a biphenyl bond has been shown to be bound to the cell wall polysaccharides xylans of Triticum aestivum and Lolium multiflorum via ester bonds, involving both of its carboxyl groups (20Markwalder H.U. Neukom H. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 836-837Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Hartley R.D. Jones E.C. Phytochemistry. 1976; 15: 1157-1160Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Such cross-linking is believed to have significant effects on the ability to resist enzymatic digestion of xylans, but to date no experimental evidence for this notion has been reported. In the present study, we established that binding of bismorphine to pectins resulted in resistance against their degradation by pectinases. It is noteworthy that the protective effect of bismorphine for pectins was found at a bismorphine level that can be produced by the wounded capsules. From these results, we concluded that production of bismorphine is a defense response. Pectins are polysaccharides that play important roles in cell adhesion, cell wall stiffening, and assembly of cell wall components, and degradation of pectins is well known to cause serious damage in plants (26Roberts K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Levy S. Staehelin L.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, the repair and stiffening system for pectins is quite important. The formation of bismorphine is catalyzed by endogenous anionic peroxidase, BFP. This enzyme activity was also found in the leaves of the opium poppy, although at somewhat lower levels than that in the capsules. This distribution showed a good correlation with the morphine content; greater amounts of morphine are found in the immature capsules than in the leaves. Because bismorphine was also detected in wounded leaves of the opium poppy (data not shown), it is likely that the same defense system also exists in the leaves of the opium poppy. We found that the properties of BFP are different from those of other plant peroxidases. Plant phenol peroxidases usually catalyze various substrates including both natural and synthetic substrates; for example, peroxidases in tobacco and mung bean have the ability to oxidize several phenolics (22Kim S.S. Wender S.H. Smith E.C. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 165-168Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Chabanet A. Catesson A.M. Goldberg R. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 759-763Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, BFP catalyzed oxidation only of morphine, and none of the other phenolic compounds tested were substrates for this enzyme. Thus, BFP is quite a unique peroxidase. Although bismorphine has a biphenyl bond that is often found in lignans and lignins, judged from the inability to oxidize ferulic acid and caffeic acid, it is unlikely that BFP catalyzes biosynthesis of lignin, one of the cell wall components. Bismorphine is not detected in the intact plant, and its production is initiated within 1 h by stress. This response is faster than transcription-dependent defense reactions such as phytoalexin accumulation (28Dixon R.A. Harrison M.J. Adv. Genet. 1990; 28: 165-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which are usually observed more than 2 h after stress treatment. Hence, bismorphine production is one of the earliest defense reactions. Albersheim et al. (29Albersheim P. Jones T.M. English P.D. Annu. Rev. Pytopathol. 1969; 7: 171-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in many cases, the first stage of the infectious process of phytopathogens is the production of cell wall-degrading enzymes such as pectinases. Therefore, rapid production of bismorphine involved in the stiffening of pectins may play an important role in protecting the opium poppy against infection by pathogens at the early stages. In the present study, we confirmed the pre-existence of large amounts of BFP as well as morphine in the immature capsules of the opium poppy, and such constitutive expression was considered to enable the observed rapid responses. In addition to both constituents, H2O2 is also essential for bismorphine formation. Because stress treatment of plant cells causes observed rapid production of large amounts of reactive oxygen species, a reaction known as the oxidative burst (30Doke N. Physiol. Plant. Pathol. 1983; 23: 345-357Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 31Sutherland M.W. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1991; 39: 79-93Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 32Baker C.J. Orlandi E.W. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1995; 33: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), H2O2 induced during the oxidative burst may be used for bismorphine formation. In conclusion, the metabolism of morphine to bismorphine is regarded as a defense system of the opium poppy. Higher plants can immediately initiate production of various defense-related secondary constituents to protect themselves from microbial phytopathogens. Most act as antimicrobial substances, and several constituents contribute to strengthening of the lignin moiety in cell walls. Bismorphine is the first alkaloid involved in the repair and strengthening of pectins to be identified to date. Several Papaver species produce morphinan alkaloids other than morphine. Among these,Papaver pseudo-orientale and Papaver lasiothrixproduce the biosynthetic precursor of morphine, salutaridine, as a major alkaloid. In both plants, Sariyar et al. (33Sariyar G. Freyer A.J. Guinaudeau H. Shamma M. J. Nat. Prod. 1990; 53: 1383-1386Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) identified salutadimerine, in which two morphine units are oxidatively coupled to each other through a biphenylether bond. Because cross-linking of pectins through bismorphine bridges is based on the ionic interaction between the two amino groups of bismorphine and the uronic acid residues of polysaccharides, salutadimerine may display similar properties for pectins. In addition, the occurrence of many dibasic alkaloids in the plant kingdom suggested that similar defense systems may be found in other plants.

In contrast to domain III, considerably less is known concerning the importance of the different regions of domain II, principally due to the fact that several alternative RNA secondary structures have been proposed in recent years (7Honda M. Brown E.A. Lemon S.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 955-968PubMed Google Scholar, 8Honda M. Beard M.R. Ping L.H. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Brown E.A. Zhang H. Ping L.H. Lemon S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5041-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These changes have made it difficult to compare past mutational studies (22Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the latest structural model, which is based not only on structural analyses but also on the phylogenetic comparison with recently isolated HCV-related viruses (hog cholera virus, GB virus B, and bovine viral diarrhea virus) (8Honda M. Beard M.R. Ping L.H. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have introduced a comprehensive series of mutations and deletions in the single-stranded regions of this domain II structure (see Fig. 1). The mutants were then analyzed for their ability to direct IRES translation, the degree of p25 ribosomal protein UV cross-linking, their ability to bind the 40S ribosomal subunits (in sucrose gradient assay and footprinting analysis), and changes in secondary structure. All mutants described in this study were constructed by polymerase chain reaction, and the primer sequences are shown in TableI. All mutants were amplified from a template plasmid containing nucleotides 1–920 described in detail elsewhere (20Buratti E. Tisminetzky S. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3179-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All mutants were prepared in pBluescript II KS+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the primers in the following combination: 1) for mutants Δ53-55 and Δ108-110, domIIaS/reverse and domIIaAS/universal primer; 2) for mutants Δ61-64 and Δ103, domIIbS/reverse primer and domIIbAS/universal primer; and 3) for mutants Δ71-73 and Δ93-96, domIIcS/reverse and domIIcAS/universal primer. Both amplification products were mixed in the same molar proportion and subjected to a second round of amplification using the universal and reverse primers. To obtain the double mutants, the same group of primers was used on single deletion mutants rather than the original template. To prepare the different set of AUG mutants, we used the primers described in Table I using the same strategy described above, using the 5′-wt and the Δ71-73 mutant as template. All constructs were fully sequenced before their in vitrotranscription using Beckman CEQ 2000 Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Table IPrimers used for polymerase chain reaction amplificationPrimerSequence (5′→3′)domIIaSCCCTGTGAGGTACTGTCTTCdomIIaASGTCCTGGAGGCACGACACTCdomIIbSGGATCTACTGCACGCAGAAAdomIIbASAGGCTGCACGCACTCATACTdomIIcSTCTTCACGCAAGCGTCTAGCdomIIcASACGACACTCATACTAACGCCdomII76SGCAGAAAGCCGCTAGCCATGdomII76ASCATGGCTAGCGGCTTTCTGCdomII82SAGCGTCTAAAAATGGCGTTAdomII82ASTAACGCCATTTTTAGACGCTdomIII260SAGTAGTGTTGCGTCGCGAAAdomIII260ASTTTCGCGTCGCAACACTACTdomIII290SACTGCCTGATGGGGTGCTTGdomIII290ASCAAGCACCCCATCAGGCAGTAUG339SACCGATGACCAAAAGCACGAAUG339ASTCGTGCTTTTGGTCATCGGTAUG345SACCGTGCACCAAAAGCatgAAUG345ASTCATGCTTTTGGTGCACGGT Open table in a new tab All Bls KS+ plasmids described in this study were linearized by digestion with HindIII. Transcription of 2 μg of linearized plasmid was performed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific activities of these labeled RNA preparations were in the range of 4 × 106 cpm/μg RNA. The UV cross-linking technique, preparation of the ribosomal salt wash extract from COS-1 cells, and secondary structure analysis using RNase V1, RNase T1, and S1 nuclease have already been described in detail in a previous work (21Odreman-Macchioli F.E. Tisminetzky S.G. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Buratti E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the UV cross-linking assay was performed by adding [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes (2 × 105 cpm/incubation) in a water bath for 15 min at 30 °C with 18 μg of the ribosomal salt wash extract (or 6 pmol of purified 40S subunits) in a 20-μl final volume. Final binding conditions were 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 72 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.78 mm magnesium acetate, 0.52 mm DTT, 3.8% glycerol, 0.75 mmATP, and 1 mm GTP. In the competition experiments, cold RNA was also added as a competitor 5 min before the addition of the labeled RNAs (the amount used is reported in the figure legends). Samples were then transferred into the wells of an HLA plate (Nunc; InterMed) and irradiated with UV light on ice (0.8 J, approximately 5 min) using a UV linker (Euroclone). Unbound RNA was then digested with 30 μg of RNase A (Sigma) and 6 units of RNase T1 (Sigma) by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in a water bath. Samples were then analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography, drying, and exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR films for 12–24 h. Films were then scanned on a Macintosh G3 work station using Adobe Photoshop and printed using a Phaser 400 printer. The different mutants were then excised from the Bls KS+ plasmids by cutting with XbaI-HindIII restriction enzymes and inserted in the pSV growth hormone bicistronic expression system for transfection experiments in COS-1 cells as described previously (20Buratti E. Tisminetzky S. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3179-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells at 60% confluence were transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 48 h, the cells were collected, and the hGH levels were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to normalize the amount of cellular lysate in the Western blot procedures. The amount of reporter core protein produced was recognized using MAb B12.F8 and detected on Kodak autoradiographic film by enhanced chemiluminescence analysis (ECL; Amersham Life Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The film was subsequently scanned using an Imaging Densitometre GS-670 (Bio-Rad), and each band was quantified using the molecular Analyst program for the Macintosh computer. Each transfection was repeated three times. When the two core protein isoforms (the 23-kDa processed and the 25-kDa unprocessed forms) were present, they were quantified together. The purification of 40S ribosomal subunits and the assembly of binary IRES-40S ribosomal complexes were performed essentially as described previously by Odreman-Macchioli et al. (21Odreman-Macchioli F.E. Tisminetzky S.G. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Buratti E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40S ribosomal subunits were prepared from HeLa extracts by precipitation for 4 h at 4 °C and centrifugation at 30,000 rpm in a Beckman 60Ti rotor and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm DTT, and 6 mm MgCl2) with 0.25 m sucrose and 150 mm KCl to a concentration of 40 A260 units/ml. This suspension was incubated with 1 mm puromycin (Sigma) for 10 min at 0 °C and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of KCl to 0.5 m final concentration. The 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits were then separated by centrifugation of 2-ml aliquots of this suspension through a 10–30% sucrose gradient in buffer A with 0.5m KCl for 17 h at 4 °C and 22,000 rpm, using a Beckman SW28 rotor. The 40S subunits were precipitated from the pooled gradient fractions by centrifugation for 18 h at 4 °C and 50,000 rpm in a 60Ti rotor. Pellets were resuspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.25 m sucrose) to a final concentration of 60 A260 units/ml. Ribosomal complexes were assembled by incubating 2 × 105 cpm of labeled RNAs for 10 min at 30 °C in a 100-μl reaction volume that contained buffer E (2 mm DTT, 100 mmpotassium acetate, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) with 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 units of RNasin (Promega), 1 mm ATP, and 6 pmol of 40S subunits. The complexes were resolved by centrifugation through a 10–30% sucrose gradient in buffer E with 6 mm magnesium acetate for 16 h at 4 °C and 24,000 rpm, using a Beckman SW41 rotor. The radioactivity of gradient fractions was determined by Cerenkov counting. The enzymatic footprinting analysis was performed basically as described previously by Kolupaeva et al. (15Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6242-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The IRES-40S ribosomal complexes were assembled in 20-μl reaction volumes by mixing 6 pmol of 40S subunits with 2 × 105 cpm of labeled RNAs in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT). Free or 40S-IRES RNA complexes were digested by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C with RNase T1 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.02 unit/μl (in the absence or presence of the 40S ribosomal subunit). The end-labeled primer 5′-TTCGTGCTCATGGTGCACGGT-3′ (complementary to HCV nucleotides 332–352) was annealed to RNA, and the extended cDNA products (using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to standard protocols) were analyzed by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gels and exposed to X-Omat film (Kodak) after they were dry. The recent mutation/deletion studies performed on the lower portions of HCV 5′-UTR domain III have highlighted the existence of a very close relationship between RNA structure and IRES translational ability. Indeed, even single-nucleotide changes in selected regions (IIId and IIIe) have been reported to completely abolish IRES activity (17Jubin R. Vantuno N.E. Kieft J.S. Murray M.G. Doudna J.A. Lau J.Y. Baroudy B.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10430-10437Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Psaridi L. Georgopoulou U. Varaklioti A. Mavromara P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to determine whether an analogous situation could also be found in any of the single-stranded regions of HCV domain II. Therefore, two substitutions (A54G and U63G) were inserted in the IIa and IIb bulges of domain II (mut50), as shown in Fig. 1. As control, we used a second mutant (mut297) carrying an A297G substitution in stem-loop IIIe, a mutation that was previously described to abolish IRES activity (27Psaridi L. Georgopoulou U. Varaklioti A. Mavromara P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Each mutant was then analyzed for translational ability (both in vitro and in transfection assay), for complexing with the 40S ribosomal subunit, and for binding to a p25 ribosomal protein. This p25 protein has been previously identified as a ribosomal protein by several independent studies (21Odreman-Macchioli F.E. Tisminetzky S.G. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Buratti E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U.

Virus Genes. 1999; 19: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (15Kolupaeva V.G. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6242-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In particular, Pestova et al. (31Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Fletcher S.P. Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) had identified this 25-kDa protein as ribosomal protein S9 through internal sequence analysis. However, in a recent article (46Fukushi S. Okada M. Stahl J. Kageyama T. Hoshino F.B. Katayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20824-20826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) this identification has been queried, and it has been suggested by immunoprecipitation analysis that the ribosomal p25 protein corresponds to another ribosomal protein of similar molecular mass, ribosomal protein S5. The binding of this protein is of interest because p25 is the only protein described thus far whose degree of UV cross-linking changes following mutations in the domain II region (22Fukushi S. Kurihara C. Ishiyama N. Hoshino F.B. Oya A. Katayama K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A(left panel, lanes 1–3) shows a UV cross-linking assay using a ribosomal salt wash protein extract (RSW) with each labeled RNA. The results show that UV cross-linking of a p25 protein can be observed for the wild type (5′-wt) and mut50, but not for mut297. The same result is obtained using a purified 40S subunit preparation (40S) as shown in Fig. 2 A (left panel, lanes 4–6). A competition analysis was also performed to confirm the specificity of this interaction. Fig. 2 A, right panel, shows that in keeping with the direct binding assays only cold 5′-wt and mut50 RNAs (but not cold mut297 RNA) can compete for the binding of this protein to the HCV IRES. Both mutants were then analyzed for their ability to drive IRES translation. In the case of mut297, we observed a total inhibition in the translation of the HCV core protein both in vivo and in vitro, whereas mut50 showed a level of translation comparable with the wild type (Fig. 2 B, top and bottom panels). It should be noted that the HCV core protein isoforms that are produced in transfection are slightly larger than normal (25/23 kDa as opposed to 23/21 kDa) due to the addition of a C-terminal tag sequence, as described previously (47Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Tisminetzky S.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 1998; 44: 505-512PubMed Google Scholar). We then analyzed by sucrose density gradient the ability of the 40S ribosomal subunit to bind to these mutant RNAs. Fig. 2 Cshows that mut50 binds the 40S ribosomal subunits with the same efficiency of the wild type RNA (5′-wt). On the other hand, mut297 was totally incapable of binding the 40S ribosomal subunits, a result that is totally consistent with the recent crystallographic data that identify IIId, IIIe, and IIIf as the regions that contact the 40S platform (13Spahn C.M. Kieft J.S. Grassucci R.A. Penczek P.A. Zhou K. Doudna J.A. Frank J. Science. 2001; 291: 1959-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Because these single-nucleotide mutations in domain II did not affect the translational ability of the HCV IRES, we then prepared a new set of mutants in which all domain II bulge regions (IIa, IIb, and IIc) were partially or completely deleted. In addition, we prepared two additional mutants in the upper region of domain II to test the importance of this upper stem-loop portion. A schematic representation all these mutants is reported in Fig.3 A. We then tested the degree of UV cross-linking of the p25 ribosomal protein. Fig. 3 Bshows that all deletions introduced in the IIa, Iib, and IIc bulges abolished the UV cross-linking signal from the p25 ribosomal protein, with the exception of a single-nucleotide deletion in bulge IIb (Δ103) and in the two upper stem-loop mutants (mut76 and mut82). To investigate the effect of these mutations on the efficiency of the HCV-IRES translation, we transfected each mutant in COS-1 cells in the pSV GH bicistronic system (20Buratti E. Tisminetzky S. Zotti M. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3179-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which used the HCV core protein itself as reporter protein. Fig. 4 Ashows that the translation efficiency of these mutated IRESs was variable. In particular, mutants domIIΔa, Δ53-55, and Δ93-96 showed an almost complete lack of IRES translation. On the other hand, mutants Δ108-110, domIIΔb, Δ61-64, domIIΔc, and Δ71-73 retained an intermediate level of IRES activity (ranging between 21% and 33%) (Fig. 4 B). Finally, the mutants that showed no decrease or little decrease in the degree of p25 cross-linking (mut76 and mut82 and mutant Δ103) showed translation efficiencies comparable to that of the 5′-wt (Fig. 4 B). The reactivity of MAb B12.F8 with the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate and HCV core protein was determined by preparing a standard calibration curve using a recombinant flock house virus protein displaying the B12.F8 epitope (FHV-C3) on its surface, as described previously (48Buratti E. Di Michele M. Song P. Monti-Bragadin C. Scodeller E.A. Baralle F.E. Tisminetzky S.G. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 117-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results, which are shown in Fig. 4 C, were used to quantify the amount of core protein produced in each transfection experiment.Figure 4Translational ability of domain II mutants in transient transfection analysis. A (top panel) shows a Western blot following a transfection assay in COS-1 cells of the different 5′-UTR mutants used in this study. The two bands (indicated by an asterisk) represent the processed (23-kDa) and unprocessed (25-kDa) core proteins, which were recognized using MAb B12.F8 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence staining.

This is the case in many embryonic tissues and certain adult cells such as mammalian hepatocytes and megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytic endomitosis is characterized by repeated S phases followed by abortive mitoses, resulting in mononucleated polyploid cells. Several cell cycle regulators have been proposed to play an active role in megakaryocytic polyploidization; however, little is known about upstream factors that could control endomitosis.

However, polyploidization occurs in different cell types from plants to vertebrates as part of their physiological differentiation programs. For instance, most embryonic cells that do not give rise to adult structures are highly polyploid, probably as a means to potentiate the high metabolic rate needed to sustain the developing embryo (1Larkins B.A. Dilkes B.P. Dante R.A. Coelho C.M. Woo Y. Liu Y. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, a few highly differentiated and mature cells also appear to require an increase in DNA content, as is the case for mammalian hepatocytes and the platelet precursor cell, the megakaryocyte. In the final stages of maturation, megakaryoblasts stop proliferating and undergo from three to five truncated cell cycles, resulting in polyploid, fully mature megakaryocytes. To increase their DNA content to levels up to 128N, megakaryocytes repeatedly enter S phase after escaping mitosis without completing anaphase in a process traditionally called endomitosis (2Nagata Y. Muro Y. Todokoro K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,3Vitrat N. Cohen-Solal K. Pique C. Le Couedic J.P. Norol F. Larsen A.K. Katz A. Vainchenker W. Debili N. Blood. 1998; 91: 3711-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo experimental approaches have shown that both G1/S and G2/M cell cycle transitions have to be regulated for megakaryocytes to achieve polyploidization (4Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D.

Specifically, both cyclin D3-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes have been proposed as the most likely candidates to drive megakaryocytic polyploidization (4Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Matsumura I.

However, little is known about the mechanisms upstream of the cell cycle machinery that ultimately control the proper establishment of endomitotic cycles in differentiating megakaryoblasts. In embryonic systems, the entrance into re-replication cycles seems to be inhibited by proteins belonging to the Snail family of transcriptional repressors (for recent reviews, see Refs. 13Hemavathy K. Ashraf S.I. Ip Y.T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar and 14Manzanares M. Locascio A. Nieto M.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All Snail proteins contain four to six highly conserved zinc fingers at the C terminus of the protein through which they bind DNA. In vitro binding site selection experiments using pools of random sequences have revealed that the consensus binding element corresponds to an E2 box that is recognized by a variety of basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional activators. It has been proposed that the Snail proteins may compete directly with basic helix-loop-helix proteins for the same binding sequences, although this has been observed only in a limited number of cases (19Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Genetic studies inDrosophila, Xenopus, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mouse have shown that Snail proteins participate in a variety of processes that include mesoderm determination, neurogenesis, and apoptosis (13Hemavathy K. Ashraf S.I. Ip Y.T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Manzanares M. Locascio A. Nieto M.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently, Snail proteins have been implicated in the invasiveness of cancer cells (15Batlle E. Sancho E. Franci C. Dominguez D. Monfar M. Baulida J. Garcia De Herreros A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 16Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar) and in the development of B lymphomas (17Inukai T. Inoue A. Kurosawa H. Goi K. Shinjyo T. Ozawa K. Mao M. Inaba T. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), revealing that they might have important roles in adult tissues. Escargot was first described in relation to the control ofDrosophila imaginal cell development (18Hayashi S. Hirose S. Metcalfe T. Shirras A.D. Development. 1993; 118: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that Escargot is involved in the maintenance of diploidy in embryonic and larval cells (19Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, ectopic expression ofescargot inhibits polyploidization in salivary glands, whereas its ablation prevents the regular progression through mitotic cycles in the imaginal tissues and, as a result, causes abdominal histoblasts to undergo endocycles and become polyploid (18Hayashi S. Hirose S. Metcalfe T. Shirras A.D. Development. 1993; 118: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Escargot inhibits polyploidization of murine trophoblast giant cells as efficiently as its murine homolog, Snail (20Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, the endogenous expression pattern of both escargotand snail further suggests an inhibitory activity onDrosophila and mouse embryonic endocycles, respectively, as both proteins are down-regulated in those cells that become polyploid (18Hayashi S. Hirose S. Metcalfe T. Shirras A.D. Development. 1993; 118: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we have asked whether a similar role could be played by proteins related to Escargot in megakaryocytic endomitosis. The megakaryoblastic cell line HEL normally responds to the phorbol ester TPA1 by undergoing terminal differentiation including polyploidization. We have isolated stable clones of HEL cells constitutively expressing escargot and monitored their response to TPA in terms of differentiation marker expression, extent of polyploidization, and expression and activity of different cell cycle regulators. In addition, we have explored whether the presence of endogenous Escargot-like proteins capable of specifically binding to an Escargot-binding element (EBE) correlates with the ability of megakaryoblastic cells to become polyploid. Our results show that escargot expression interferes with the regulation of the G1/S transition of endomitotic cycles and thereby with megakaryocytic polyploidization. They also suggest that down-regulation of proteins that specifically interact with the EBE could be required for megakaryoblastic cells to become polyploid. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mml-glutamine, and 60 mg/ml gentamycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 95% air in a humidified incubator. In all experiments, exponentially growing cells were subcultured into Nunc 96-, 24-, or 6-well plates with or without appropriate treatment. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion in a hemocytometer chamber. To induce megakaryocytic differentiation, 0.15–0.20 × 106cells/ml were grown in the presence or absence of 10−8m TPA (Sigma) for the indicated times. Full-lengthescargot DNA was obtained from Dr. Mary Whiteley. Expression vector pcDNA3-ESG was generated by subcloning anXbaI fragment containing the ESG open reading frame into the pcDNA3 polycloning site (Invitrogen). The construction of the cycA(−875)luc reporter plasmid containing the human cyclin A promoter has been described elsewhere (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HEL cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected by electroporation at 125 microfarads/300 V in a 0.4-cm cuvette. 5 × 106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of linearized pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-ESG plasmids. After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in fresh medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 antibiotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were subcultured in 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Single cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution of the G418-resistant cells. For transient transfection experiments, cell lines were transfected by electroporation. 2 × 106 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation. For TPA treatments, electroporated cells were divided into two aliquots and allowed to recover for 12 h. One aliquot was then treated with TPA. 48 h after electroporation, the cells were harvested, and cell extracts for assaying luciferase activity were made by three cycles of freeze-thaw lysis. Morphological Wright stain was performed on cytospun cells. Cell-surface immunofluorescent staining was performed by incubating cells with antibodies against glycoprotein IIIa/CD61 or glycophorin A conjugated to FITC (Becton Dickinson) as previously described (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA content was determined by staining with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a FACScan analyzer using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Nuclear extracts were obtained by lysing cells in high salt buffer as previously described (30Frampton J. McNagny K. Sieweke M. Philip A. Smith G. Graf T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2866-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 0.02 pmol of32P-labeled oligomer, various amounts of protein extracts as indicated, 40 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 100 mmKCl. When needed, competitor oligonucleotides were added in excess to the binding reaction. The probe or wild-type competitor (EBE) was GCGGCCTGACAGGTGCTTTG. The mutant competitor (EBEM) was GCGGCCTGCACACTGCTTTG, and the non-related competitor was GCGGCCTGCGTTACCTTTG. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound labeled oligonucleotide on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer. After drying, the shifted complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Western blotting was performed as previously described (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein extracts (30 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were transferred to BioTraceTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall Corp.) for 1 h at 2 mA/cm2 on a semidry transfer apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking in 5% skim dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS), filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in TTBS. After washing and incubation with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako), signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Extracts were isolated as described for Western blot analyses. Total protein was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of anti-Cdk2 antibody. Immunocomplexes were then isolated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and once with 1 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Pellets were then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 250 ng of the carboxyl-terminal part of retinoblastoma protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. 25 μl of each reaction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and bands were detected by autoradiography. For the simultaneous analysis of cell cycle and cyclin expression, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in suspension in cold 75% ethanol. After washing and permeabilization, cells were pelleted and incubated with either FITC-conjugated anti-cyclin A antibody or isotype control antibody or with anti-cyclin E antibody and an appropriate irrelevant IgG1 control (all antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen). Anti-cyclin E binding was detected after washing by incubation with BODIPY-FL-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.). After appropriate washing, cells were labeled with propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline. Analysis was performed using a FACScan analyzer using CellQuest software. Endomitotic megakaryoblastic HEL cells were transfected with full-lengthEsg cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. 10 clones were selected in the presence of G418 and analyzed for the presence of functional ESG protein. Nuclear extracts of transfectants were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding site for ESG (ACAGGTG, hereinafter referred to as the EBE). As shown in Fig. 1 a, extracts from four of the clones transfected with the ESG-expressing vector gave a pattern of shifted proteins that was not present in a G418-resistant clone of HEL cells transfected with an empty vector. The latter was subsequently used as control HEL (referred to as HELc) cells. A similar pattern of protein-EBE complexes was observed in COS cells transiently transfected with the same ESG-expressing construct (Fig. 1 c). The specificity of binding to the EBE of proteins derived from the HEL/ESG clones was assessed by competing with a 100-fold excess of the EBE oligonucleotide, a mutant version of the EBE that does not bind to ESG (EBEM), or an oligonucleotide containing an unrelated sequence. This revealed that the two predominant complexes of higher mobility represented specific complexes between the ectopically expressed ESG and EBE, whereas the lower mobility complexes seen in both transfected and control clones were nonspecific and unrelated to the presence of ESG (Fig.1 b). Based on these preliminary observations, the HEL/ESG clones HA1 and HD12 were selected for further analysis. To determine whether constitutive expression of ESG was affecting the intrinsic phenotypic properties of HEL cells, clones HA1 and HD12 were examined with respect to their proliferation under normal growth conditions. In addition, the clones were tested for differentiation in response to treatment with the phorbol ester TPA, which triggers the differentiation of HEL cells, leading to decreased cell division and acquisition of mature megakaryocytic features. Constitutive expression of ESG did not affect the exponential growth of HEL cells in standard growth medium or the growth arrest response to TPA (Fig.2 a). The morphology of exponentially growing HELc and ESG-expressing clones was very similar, with an immature morphology typical of erythroleukemic cells (Fig. 2 c). Likewise, the TPA-driven up-regulation of megakaryocytic markers such as glycoprotein IIIa (CD61) and down-regulation of the erythrocytic marker glycophorin A remained unchanged in the ESG-expressing cells compared with HELc cells (Fig.2 b). The morphology of exponentially growing HELc and ESG-expressing clones was very similar, with a blast morphology typical of erythroleukemic cells (Fig. 2 c). However, profound differences were observed when HELc, HA1, and HD12 cells were treated with TPA. Hence, a significant proportion of differentiated HELc cells appeared as large cells with a polylobulated nucleus, whereas ESG-expressing HEL cells showed no cytoplasmic or nuclear maturation and the presence of large vacuoles in a high proportion of cells. Therefore, it appeared that ESG was specifically interfering with the completion of the TPA-driven megakaryocytic differentiation program. Next we analyzed the nuclear DNA content of TPA-treated cells to determine whether the key feature of megakaryocytic maturation, i.e. the degree of polyploidization, was also affected in the presence of ESG. Control and ESG-expressing HEL clones were seeded at 1.5 × 105cells/ml in the presence or absence of TPA and stained with propidium iodide 48 and 96 h after treatment. More than 50% of the HELc cells showed a DNA content of 4N or higher (10 and 1% of cells being 8N and 16N, respectively) 48 h after treatment, whereas HA1 and HD12 cells failed to become polyploid even after 96 h in the presence of TPA (Fig. 3). Instead, the propidium iodide staining pattern indicated that ESG-expressing HEL cells remained arrested in G1 and G2. This behavior appeared to be reminiscent of megakaryoblastic K562 cells, which respond to TPA in terms of platelet antigen up-regulation, but do not become polyploid (Fig. 3). As Escargot DNA-binding properties were not affected by the TPA treatment (data not shown), we conclude that Escargot inhibits the establishment of endomitotic cycles in megakaryoblastic cells. Establishment of endomitotic cycles in HEL cells requires active cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, which in turn maintain cyclin A expression (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the G1/S machinery in HELc cells and ESG-expressing clones before and after treatment with TPA. As shown in Fig.4 a, TPA treatment of HA1 and HD12 cells resulted in a decrease in the levels of cyclins E and A and Cdk2 activity, whereas p27 kip1 inhibitor levels remained unchanged or even increased. This was in sharp contrast with the pattern of expression of these proteins in HELc cells, which showed the expected maintenance of cyclin and p27 kip1 levels and Cdk2 activity. Interestingly, the pattern of TPA-induced changes in HA1 and HD12 cells resembled that in non-endomitotic K562 cells with the exception that the ESG-expressing cells demonstrated a more dramatic down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein. These data suggest that a profound inhibition of the G1/S transition in TPA-treated cells occurs in the presence of Escargot. To investigate in greater detail whether Escargot was affecting the maintenance of expression of G1/S regulators during TPA-driven differentiation, a time course bivariant flow cytometric analysis was performed. Prior to TPA treatment, cyclins E and A were present in G1/S and S/G2 cells, respectively, as expected for exponentially growing cells (Fig. 4 b,t = 0). Subsequent to the addition of TPA, it appeared that the level of both cyclins progressively declined for the first 24 h and that no cells expressed the proteins. In fact, 48 h after differentiation, HA1 and HD12 lacked nuclear cyclins E and A, as was also observed in K562 cells. In contrast, polyploid HELc cells maintained waves of expression of the G1/S cyclins (Fig. 4 b). These results suggest that the cell populations that are entering S and M phases at the time of TPA treatment respectively progress through replication and mitosis during the first hours of differentiation, but that no further G1/S transition takes place in escargot-expressing HEL cells. We have previously observed that TPA inhibits cyclin A expression in non-endomitotic megakaryoblastic cells (e.g.K562) and that ectopic expression of cyclin E enables these cells to reestablish cyclin A expression and, as a consequence, to undergo endomitotic replication (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible target for the action of Escargot could be the transcriptional regulation of cyclin A gene expression. To test this, HELc, HA1, and HD12 cells were transiently transfected with the cycA(−875)luc construct, which contains the luciferase reporter gene under the control of sequences from −875 to +37 base pairs of the human cyclin A promoter. Promoter activity was then assessed in the presence and absence of TPA. As we had previously shown (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the activity of the cyclin A promoter in HEL cells was maintained or slightly increased in TPA-treated cells. In contrast, TPA resulted in a >3-fold decrease in luciferase expression in escargot-expressing cells (Fig.5). This apparent inhibition of cyclin A promoter activity in ESG-expressing HEL cells following TPA treatment was similar to the degree of inhibition that was observed in TPA-treated K562 cells (40% of activity compared with untreated cells). These results are consistent with the idea that the mechanisms by which Escargot blocks the establishment of endomitotic cycles in HEL cells could be similar to those operating in non-endomitotic K562 cells and may involve effects at the level of the regulation of cyclin A gene expression. The phenotypic similarities between Escargot-expressing HEL cells and non-endomitotic K562 cells suggested that endogenous Escargot-like proteins could be present in these latter cells. To test this possibility, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed on nuclear extracts isolated from untreated or TPA-treated HEL and K562 cells. Under the conditions used to assess ectopic escargotexpression in transfected cells, no specific bands could be detected in HELc cells (Fig. 1 a) or K562 cells (data not shown). However, when 2–3 times higher amounts of protein extract were used, a major complex could be detected in both HEL and K562 cells (Fig.6, upper left panel). The specificity of the binding was estimated by competition with an excess of unlabeled EBE or of EBEM (Fig. 6, lower panels). A similar binding pattern was detected in a variety of human cell types, including HeLa (epithelial), and U2OS (osteosarcoma) cells (Fig. 6, upper right panel). Perhaps most significantly, the amount of this specific complex was much higher in electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed with extracts from K562 and the other cells analyzed compared with those using HEL extracts. Interestingly, the amount of protein able to form this specific complex with EBE remained constant, or even increased, in TPA-treated K562 cells, whereas it almost disappeared in differentiated endomitotic HEL cells. These data indicate that human cells contain one or more nuclear EBE-binding proteins. They also suggest that the presence of endogenous EBE-binding proteins, like ectopically expressed escargot in HEL, is not compatible with establishment of megakaryocytic endomitotic cycles. In this study, we have shown that constitutive expression of the transcriptional repressor Escargotinhibits megakaryocytic polyploidization. Previous genetic and biochemical evidence had already demonstrated an inhibitory role forDrosophila Escargot and murine Snail factors in the establishment of endocycles in early development (19Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi S. Development. 1996; 122: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here extend this evidence and indicate that theDrosophila protein retains its specific function in re-replication control when expressed in adult mammalian cells. The inhibition of endomitosis is also observed when mouse Snail is ectopically expressed in HEL cells, 2N. Vilaboa and C. Calés, unpublished observation. pointing to a general role of certain members of the Snail family in the control of ploidy maintenance. The cloning of a human homolog, SnaH, has recently been reported (29Okubo T. Truong T.K., Yu, B. Itoh T. Zhao J. Grube B. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1338-1346PubMed Google Scholar). It could then be speculated that Escargot is affecting target promoters physiologically controlled by the endogenous protein, given the degree of homology between human and mouse proteins (overall 83%, reaching >95% identity in the DNA-binding region). Although the binding elements that SnaH appears to preferentially recognize are not coincident with the ones shown for its mouse homolog or Escargot (29Okubo T. Truong T.K., Yu, B. Itoh T. Zhao J. Grube B. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1338-1346PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to bear in mind that these factors could bind to variants of the sequences tested by in vitro random selections. A putative target of Escargot relevant to megakaryocytic endomitosis could be cyclin A: we have shown here that its expression is down-regulated in escargot-expressing cells and that the transcriptional activity of its proximal promoter region is significantly reduced in these cells. Three E boxes that could account for a repressive effect of Escargot/SnaH on the transcription of the cyclin A gene are present in the proximal promoter region that was present in our cyclin A promoter-reporter construct (CACTTG, CATATG, and CAAGTG at −538, −469, and −387). Although none of these sites corresponds to the consensus Escargot-binding element (19Fuse N. Hirose S. Hayashi S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it could be possible that the overexpressed heterologous protein binds in vivo to one or more of them. Work is in progress to investigate whether cyclin A is one of the putative Escargot target genes that mediates its effect on endoreplication and to determine whether SnaH is physiologically relevant to megakaryocytic polyploidization. Another interesting point to take into account is that the megakaryocytic endomitotic cycle presents substantial differences compared with embryonic endocycles. Although the latter consist of successions of DNA duplication and short “gap” phases in which G2/M cyclins are absent (1Larkins B.A. Dilkes B.P. Dante R.A. Coelho C.M. Woo Y. Liu Y. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22Cayirlioglu P. Duronio R.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R178-R181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), megakaryocytes complete the G2 phase and enter an abortive mitosis lacking karyo- and cytokinesis (23Roy L. Coullin P. Vitrat N. Hellio R. Debili N. Weinstein J. Bernheim A. Vainchenker W. Blood. 2001; 97: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, despite these significant differences, our results suggest that mechanisms similar to those inhibited by Escargot in embryonic cells may account for polyploidy in these highly differentiated adult cells. In all the systems analyzed to date, polyploidization is accompanied by maintenance of an active G1/S transition and down-regulation of the mitotic machinery (21Hayashi S. Development. 1996; 122: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 24Grafi G. Larkins B.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1262-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Lilly M.A. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 26MacAuley A. Cross J.C. Werb Z. Mol. Biol.

In megakaryocytic endomitosis, the G2/M transition takes place in the presence of cyclin A and of active, albeit reduced, cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes (3Vitrat N. Cohen-Solal K. Pique C. Le Couedic J.P. Norol F. Larsen A.K. Katz A. Vainchenker W. Debili N. Blood. 1998; 91: 3711-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Garcia P. Calés C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 695-703PubMed Google Scholar, 10Datta N.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we show that the G1/S transition machinery, previously implicated in the establishment of endomitosis in TPA-treated megakaryoblastic cells, is inhibited in escargot-expressing cells. Thus, Cdk2 activity is not detected in the differentiating escargot-expressing HEL cells, and this could result in the down-regulation of cyclin A. In this respect, our data slightly differ from previous interpretations that Escargot/Snail specifically interfere with G2/M machinery (20Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi S. Development. 1996; 122: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of Escargot and Snail was described to affect the obligate down-regulation of mitotic Cdc2 and cyclins A and B that occurs in embryonic endocycles (20Nakayama H. Scott I.C. Cross J.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi S. Development. 1996; 122: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 26MacAuley A. Cross J.C. Werb Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,27Palazon L.S. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have also observed lower levels of cyclin B and also of Cdc2 inescargot-expressing cells, 3A. Ballester and C. Calés, unpublished observation. but our interpretation is that the poor expression of these G2/M factors is an indirect consequence of the majority of cells not proceeding beyond G1. We believe that the key point at which Escargot prevents HEL cells from proceeding into endomitotic cycles lies in the regulation of the G1/S machinery, as a profound down-regulation of cyclin E, Cdk2, and also of retinoblastoma protein occurs in the overexpressing cells. An additional observation is that the expression of escargotin HEL cells results in a phenotype that is strikingly reminiscent of non-endomitotic K562 cells. Hence, escargot-expressing cells respond to TPA by up-regulating megakaryocytic and concomitantly down-regulating erythrocytic markers, but do not undergo polyploidization (11Garcia P. Frampton J. Ballester A. Calés C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1820-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the idea that Escargot-like proteins could be playing a determinant role in megakaryocytic differentiation. It can then be hypothesized that K562 cells do not enter endomitosis because of the presence of a protein functionally equivalent to Escargot, which would then be down-regulated in differentiating HEL cells. Ectopic expression of escargotin HEL cells might mimic an endogenous factor by interfering with the establishment of endomitotic cycles in these cells. The fact that EBE-binding proteins are present in TPA-treated K562 cells but absent in HEL cells suggests that this could be the case. Although further work is needed to determine whether the EBE-binding activities that we have detected correspond to Snail factors or to another class of DNA-binding proteins, the evidence presented in this study suggests that megakaryocytic endomitotic differentiation could require the down-regulation or inhibition of such E2 box-binding factors.
