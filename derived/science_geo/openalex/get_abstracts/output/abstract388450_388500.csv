https://openalex.org/W2069945083,"KNOWLEDGE of the reaction mechanism of different substances with intracellular enzymes or catalytic systems involved in the metabolism, growth and multiplication of cells is of fundamental importance in the study of the pharmacological action of drugs and of chemotherapy. Cells are, however, not equally permeable to substances which may react with intracellular catalysts, whether as metabolites, activators or inhibitors. As the rates at which such reactions may take place are often controlled by the permeability of cells to these substances, the study of the mechanism of cell permeability becomes of considerable theoretical and practical importance."

https://openalex.org/W1977565880,"AN account of the polarographic reactions of the uranium ions has just been published1. During 1944, experiments on this subject were made at this Laboratory, the publication of which has been delayed by war conditions. In general, our results confirm those of Kolthoff and Harris. The first wave in the uranyl polarogram is due to the reaction and the second 'wave' to a two-stage reduction from U V to U III. The American authors do not mention the fact that this second wave always shows a perceptible kink at half its height: the kink is more easily observed in sulphuric acid solutions, in which the first part of the wave has an irregular non-logarithmic form, and the second part something close to the logarithmic form of a reversible wave."

https://openalex.org/W1997155226,"ANHYDRO-SUGARS have already been the subject of diligent study by several groups of workers, and the chief methods of obtaining these compounds have been through the hydrolysis of sulphonic or halogen acid esters of sugar derivatives. For example, 2: 3-anhydro?-methyltaloside was obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of 2-p-toluene sulphonyl?-methylgalactoside1; 1: 6-2: 3-dianhydro?-talose was isolated after the alkaline hydrolysis of 2-mesyl 1: 6-anhydro?galactose2, and 3: 6-anhydro?-methylglucoside has been obtained by the hydrolysis of 6-bromo?-methylglucoside3. Sulphuric acid esters of sugars have also been made to yield anhydro-derivatives. For example, Duff and Percival4 obtained 3:6-anhydro?-methyl glucopyranoside from barium -methyl glucopyranoside sulphate. Finally, the same type of reaction has been applied to the nitric acid esters of sugars. Gladding and Purves5 obtained a product which probably contained 2: 3-anhydro?-methyl-mannoside from 3:4: 6-triacetyl?-methylglucoaide 2-nitrate and 3: 6-anhydro?-methyl-glucoside from 2: 3: 4-triacetyl?-methylglucoside 6-nitrate."

A coliform organism has now been isolated which is specific for the decarboxylation of l(+)-arginine and has been deposited in the National Collection of Type Cultures under the reference number 7020. The organism is grown for 20–24 hr. at 25° C. in tryptic digest of casein containing 2 percent glucose and the crop then centrifuged down and washed once in distilled water. The washed organism is made up into a thick cream in water, poured into 5 vol. of ice-cold acetone and stirred vigorously until coagulation occurs. The coagulum is filtered off on a Buchner funnel, washed once with acetone and once with ether, dried under suction, powdered and finally dried overnight in vacuo. The acetone-powder so prepared can be used for the estimation of arginine without further purification and the dry powder retains its arginine decarboxylase activity for some weeks."

https://openalex.org/W2068597732,"KERATIN differs from other scleroproteins in containing a relatively high percentage of sulphur, and it is known that the sensitivity of wool and hair to attack by alkali and alkaline reducing agents results from fission of the cystine disulphide linkages, followed, under more drastic conditions of treatment, by hydrolysis of peptide linkages1,2. The medulla of sheep wool and porcupine quill, however, is devoid of cystine3, while the medulla cells of goat hair resist hydrolysis by 4N sodium hydroxide at room temperature, and contain little, if any, sulphur4. This observation has been extended to hair from several carnivores and rodents5,6, and would appear to be a general property of medullary keratin. The X-ray diffraction pattern of medulla cells dissected from Canadian porcupine quill reveals the presence in the cells of?-keratin, together with unidentified material7. On X-ray examination, medulla cells isolated from hair by treatment with cold sodium hydroxide showed no spacing corresponding to?-keratin ; but a strong meridional arc was found, identical with that from the non-protein constituent of porcupine quill medulla cells7."

https://openalex.org/W2088346512,"In severe experimental hemorrhagic anemia in hens, the injection of beta-pyracin and Lactobacillus casei factor, alone and in combination, was found to hasten the regeneration of hemoglobin. When these factors were administered together, however, the rise in hemoglobin was much more rapid and the level reached was higher than in the lots administered the factors alone. The hemoglobin levels in the control lots rose above the ""pre-bleeding"" values and then began an almost immediate decline to approximately the original level. In the lots receiving beta-pyracin and Lactobacillus casei factor, alone or in combination, the hemoglobin levels also rose above the ""pre-bleeding"" values but were maintained for some time after injections were discontinued before declining to the original values."

Closely related inactive compounds did not affect the rate of haemolysis. Quinine, 1: 10,000, for example, delayed the lysis time from one minute in the control to between 20 and 30 minutes, while a number of inactive quinoline, quinaldine and quinidine compounds failed to affect the rate of lysis."

It is now thought that in most cases they are due to ions issuing from the thermionic cathode. This conclusion was mainly reached by inference from the composition of the ion stream which was analysed by mass-spectroscopic methods by several investigators1,2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2000397712,"THE discovery in recent years of a new class of insecticides has given man an advantage over his insect enemies such as he has never before enjoyed. Although these materials kill insects by contact, they possess a stability and persistence which confer a protective effect far exceeding that of any previously known contact insecticide. Best known among them is D. D. T., a substance the properties of which are so remarkable that it has been accorded the doubtful honour of becoming 'news'. Very little of the vast amount of experimental work done has yet been published, and the door has thus been opened wide to the wildest speculation and exaggeration. A meeting of the Association of Applied Biologists on October 5 sought to adjust the outlook at least upon some of the agricultural uses of D. D. T. by bringing together workers qualified to speak on original investigations. Mr. C. T. Gimingham, of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Plant Pathology Laboratory, introduced the proceedings with a plea for a restrained and balanced approach. The peculiar circumstances in which D. D. T. was introduced had led to intensive investigations on an unprecedented scale. The substance had proved to be of inestimable value and, by controlling disease-carrying insects, had probably been a major factor in the success of several Allied campaigns. Unfortunately, much of the resulting publicity had not been in the highest tradition of scientific accuracy. Contrary to the popular view of D. D. T. as a cure-all, it had recently been reported in the United States1 that while it excelled the commmonly used insecticide against some thirty insect species it was only about equal against nineteen and was inferior against fourteen. Most of the work so far had been exploratory, and increased knowledge of dosage, timing and compounding would doubtless lead to improved performance in many cases. At present little was known as to which of the variety of possible forms of application was most effective and safest for particular purposes. A special problem in agriculture was the risk of harmful effects upon beneficial insects. Injury to birds and fishes also might follow widespread use over large areas. There appeared to be little danger to warm-blooded animals, but more information was required about cumulative effects. D. D. T., said Mr. Gimingham, was of such outstanding interest and promise that it would be peculiarly unfortunate if its future were prejudiced by misuse in the early days."
https://openalex.org/W2053184321,"THE problem of the relation of insect life to climate and weather conditions has always attracted naturalists, both from its scientific and its practical importance ; but most of the early work was qualitative rather than quantitative and, owing to the complexity of the problem, little real progress was made. Here and there, however, some of the results were expressed in the form of general laws, such as the 'hyperbola' relation between temperatures and length of development, and Hopkins' 'bio-climatic laws' relating to the dates of occurrence of biological events, including the outbreaks of certain insects."
https://openalex.org/W2064597304,"The specificity of epidemic and murine typhus has been shown by active immunization of mice with killed rickettsial suspensions and subsequent challenge with heterologous and homologoustoxic substance. During the preparation of this manuscript, Fitzpatrick published findings showing that 3 of 8 mice immunized with murine typhus vaccine were protected against 3 MLD of epidemic toxic substance administered intravenously and that 8 of 16 mice immunized with epidemic vaccine were protected against < 1 MLD of murine typhus rickettsiae administered intraperitoneally (2). These results suggested to Fitzpatrick that the toxic factor in the two strains is identical. Although there are antigens common to both strains, our findings do not support the suggestion that the two toxic substances are identical."

https://openalex.org/W2078768754,"MEGAMOLECULAR crystals such as the crystals of native proteins confront X-ray crystallography with a new situation, since the structure of the molecules is unknown. We suggest that a systematic study of what may be called the language of structure factors may be a useful, even a necessary, preliminary to the interpretation of the intensity maps of crystals containing megamolecules of unknown structure. A preliminary study of this nature has therefore been undertaken1. The purpose of this note is to describe one by-product of this work which may be of interest in view of the great prominence given to the Patterson diagrams of protein crystals, namely, a method of evaluating the Patterson distribution of a given distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2007793959,"BUTTER—especially that prepared from buffalo milk-is usually artificially coloured to make it look like that afforded by well-known dairy breeds of cows (such as the Jerseys). Many colouring matters for butter are sold under different names, the commonest of which is that known as 'annatto', which is an oil extract of seed coats of Bixa orellana. This, as well as many other less common colouring matters, have always been imported into Egypt, but during the War butter makers were forced to prepare butter without artificial colouring matter."
