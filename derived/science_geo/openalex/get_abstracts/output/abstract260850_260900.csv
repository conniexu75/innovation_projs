https://openalex.org/W2015416439,"Histone modifications are implicated in influencing gene expression. We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function."
https://openalex.org/W2167485774,"Obesity and insulin resistance, the cardinal features of metabolic syndrome, are closely associated with a state of low-grade inflammation1,2. In adipose tissue chronic overnutrition leads to macrophage infiltration, resulting in local inflammation that potentiates insulin resistance3,4. For instance, transgenic expression of Mcp1 (also known as chemokine ligand 2, Ccl2) in adipose tissue increases macrophage infiltration, inflammation and insulin resistance5,6. Conversely, disruption of Mcp1 or its receptor Ccr2 impairs migration of macrophages into adipose tissue, thereby lowering adipose tissue inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity5,7. These findings together suggest a correlation between macrophage content in adipose tissue and insulin resistance. However, resident macrophages in tissues display tremendous heterogeneity in their activities and functions, primarily reflecting their local metabolic and immune microenvironment8. While Mcp1 directs recruitment of pro-inflammatory classically activated macrophages to sites of tissue damage5,8, resident macrophages, such as those present in the adipose tissue of lean mice, display the alternatively activated phenotype9. Despite their higher capacity to repair tissue10, the precise role of alternatively activated macrophages in obesity-induced insulin resistance remains unknown. Using mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), we show here that PPARγ is required for maturation of alternatively activated macrophages. Disruption of PPARγ in myeloid cells impairs alternative macrophage activation, and predisposes these animals to development of diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed that downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression in skeletal muscle and liver leads to decreased insulin sensitivity in these tissues. Together, our findings suggest that resident alternatively activated macrophages have a beneficial role in regulating nutrient homeostasis and suggest that macrophage polarization towards the alternative state might be a useful strategy for treating type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2107037828,"Transcriptional activation of the nuclear receptor RAR by retinoic acid (RA) often leads to inhibition of cell growth. However, in some tissues, RA promotes cell survival and hyperplasia, activities that are unlikely to be mediated by RAR. Here, we show that, in addition to functioning through RAR, RA activates the “orphan” nuclear receptor PPARβ/δ, which, in turn, induces the expression of prosurvival genes. Partitioning of RA between the two receptors is regulated by the intracellular lipid binding proteins CRABP-II and FABP5. These proteins specifically deliver RA from the cytosol to nuclear RAR and PPARβ/δ, respectively, thereby selectively enhancing the transcriptional activity of their cognate receptors. Consequently, RA functions through RAR and is a proapoptotic agent in cells with high CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio, but it signals through PPARβ/δ and promotes survival in cells that highly express FABP5. Opposing effects of RA on cell growth thus emanate from alternate activation of two different nuclear receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1997814909,"Chromosomal regions can adopt stable and heritable alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence. Such epigenetic control is often associated with alternative covalent modifications of histones. The stability and heritability of the states are thought to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. We developed a simplified stochastic model for dynamic nucleosome modification based on the silent mating-type region of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that the mechanism can give strong bistability that is resistant both to high noise due to random gain or loss of nucleosome modifications and to random partitioning upon DNA replication. However, robust bistability required: (1) cooperativity, the activity of more than one modified nucleosome, in the modification reactions and (2) that nucleosomes occasionally stimulate modification beyond their neighbor nucleosomes, arguing against a simple continuous spreading of nucleosome modification."
https://openalex.org/W2112541959,"The balance between excitation and inhibition in the cortex is crucial in determining sensory processing. Because the amount of excitation varies, maintaining this balance is a dynamic process; yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show here that the activity of even a single layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in the somatosensory cortex of the rat generates widespread inhibition that increases disproportionately with the number of active pyramidal neurons. This supralinear increase of inhibition results from the incremental recruitment of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons located in layers 2/3 and 5. The recruitment of these interneurons increases tenfold when they are excited by two pyramidal cells. A simple model demonstrates that the distribution of excitatory input amplitudes onto inhibitory neurons influences the sensitivity and dynamic range of the recurrent circuit. These data show that through a highly sensitive recurrent inhibitory circuit, cortical excitability can be modulated by one pyramidal cell."
https://openalex.org/W2119032770,"Aberrant WNT signal transduction is involved in many diseases. In colorectal cancer and melanoma, mutational disruption of proteins involved in the degradation of β-catenin, the key effector of the WNT signaling pathway, results in stabilization of β-catenin and, in turn, activation of transcription. We have used tandem-affinity protein purification and mass spectrometry to define the protein interaction network of the β-catenin destruction complex. This assay revealed that WTX, a protein encoded by a gene mutated in Wilms tumors, forms a complex with β-catenin, AXIN1, β-TrCP2 (β-transducin repeat–containing protein 2), and APC (adenomatous polyposis coli). Functional analyses in cultured cells, Xenopus , and zebrafish demonstrate that WTX promotes β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation, which antagonize WNT/β-catenin signaling. These data provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the tumor suppressor activity of WTX."
https://openalex.org/W2144996654,"Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) proteins play an important role in a variety of actin-based processes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The defining feature of the PCH proteins is an evolutionarily conserved EFC/F-BAR domain for membrane association and tubulation. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of the EFC domains of human FBP17 and CIP4. The structures revealed a gently curved helical-bundle dimer of approximately 220 A in length, which forms filaments through end-to-end interactions in the crystals. The curved EFC dimer fits a tubular membrane with an approximately 600 A diameter. We subsequently proposed a model in which the curved EFC filament drives tubulation. In fact, striation of tubular membranes was observed by phase-contrast cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and mutations that impaired filament formation also impaired membrane tubulation and cell membrane invagination. Furthermore, FBP17 is recruited to clathrin-coated pits in the late stage of CME, indicating its physiological role."

https://openalex.org/W2158421588,"The immunological synapse (IS) is a junction between the T cell and antigen-presenting cell and is composed of supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs). No studies have been published on naive T cell IS dynamics. Here, we find that IS formation during antigen recognition comprises cycles of stable IS formation and autonomous naive T cell migration. The migration phase is driven by PKCθ, which is localized to the F-actin-dependent peripheral (p)SMAC. PKCθ−/− T cells formed hyperstable IS in vitro and in vivo and, like WT cells, displayed fast oscillations in the distal SMAC, but they showed reduced slow oscillations in pSMAC integrity. IS reformation is driven by the Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp). WASp−/− T cells displayed normal IS formation but were unable to reform IS after migration unless PKCθ was inhibited. Thus, opposing effects of PKCθ and WASp control IS stability through pSMAC symmetry breaking and reformation."
https://openalex.org/W2071489477,"Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathologic process that involves deposition of excess extracellular matrix leading to distorted architecture and culminating in cirrhosis. The role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) as a key molecule in the development and progression of hepatic fibrosis via the activation of hepatic stellate cells, among other fibroblast populations, is without controversy. We hereby show that TGF-β1 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state in mature hepatocytes in vitro. EMT state was marked by significant upregulation of α1(I) collagen mRNA expression and type I collagen deposition. Similar changes were found in a “normal” mouse hepatocyte cell line (AML12), thus confirming that hepatocytes are capable of EMT changes and type I collagen synthesis. We also show that in hepatocytes in the EMT state, TGF-β1 induces the snail-1 transcription factor and activates the Smad2/3 pathway. Evidence for a central role of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway is further supported by the inhibition of EMT by Smad4 silencing using small interference RNA technology. In conclusion, TGF-β1, a known pro-apoptotic cytokine in mature hepatocytes, is capable of mediating phenotypic changes and plasticity in the form of EMT, resulting in collagen deposition. Our findings support a potentially crucial role for EMT in the development and progression of hepatic fibrogenesis.

Liver fibrosis results from increased deposition of type I collagen within the hepatic extracellular space and constitutes a common cardinal signature to all forms of liver injury, regardless of etiology (1Friedman S.L.

Indeed, their role is central in hepatic fibrosis (5Reeves H.L. Friedman S.L. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: D808-D826Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, despite several discoveries pertaining to HSC activation and mechanisms of collagen deposition, no substantial anti-fibrotic therapies have been developed in order to halt the progression to cirrhosis and or reverse established fibrosis. Although resident tissue fibroblasts are traditionally considered as the principal source of fibrosis, there has been increasing interest in the ability of epithelial cells to assume not only a mesenchymal phenotype (known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) but also to undertake mesenchymal function(s), i.e. contribute to fibrosis formation. Indeed, EMT has been established as a major mechanism for the deposition of extracellular matrix in renal and pulmonary fibrosis injury models (6Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H.

Several lines of evidence support an important role for TGF-β1 signaling in the initiation and progression of liver fibrosis (9Dooley S. Streckert M. Delvoux B. Gressner A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In mature (i.e. adult) hepatocytes, TGF-β1 is responsible for inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (10Bissell D.M. Roulot D. George J.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TGF-β1 mediates EMT by inducing snail-1 transcription factor and tyrosine phosphorylation of Smad2/3 with subsequent recruitment of Smad4 (14Vega S. Morales A.V. Ocana O.H.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and xylazine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Livers were perfused in situ through the portal vein, initially with calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) followed by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing collagenase (Sigma) until the liver lost its firm texture. The soft liver was removed and gently shaken in DMEM containing collagenase at 37 °C for 10-15 min. The homogenate was filtered and centrifuged for 2 min. The pellet was washed three times with DMEM and then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen), and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) (Culture Medium). Cell number and viability were assessed by counting an aliquot in the presence of 0.1% trypan blue. Cells were plated on 60-mm culture plates previously coated with collagen (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After 18 h, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium (same composition as Culture Medium except that fetal bovine serum was replaced with 9.6 ng/ml dexamethasone (Fujisawa, Deerfield, IL), 10 μg/liter epidermal growth factor, 0.5 mg/liter transferrin, 5 μg/liter selenium, 0.5 mg/liter linoleic acid, and 0.5 mg/liter fetuin) (serum-free Culture Medium). Recombinant human transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added once, i.e. at time of switching to serum-free medium, at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. The cells without TGF-β1 (control) and those with TGF-β1 were harvested at 0.5, 1, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. Mouse Hepatocyte Cell Line, AML12 Culture and Treatment—A nontumorigenic mouse hepatocyte cell line, i.e. AML12 (CRL-2254), was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cell line was maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium (BIO-SOURCE), 40 ng/ml dexamethasone (Fujisawa), and 100 ng/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen) (Complete Growth Medium). AML12 cells were seeded at ∼60% confluence in Complete Growth Medium. The cells were changed to serum-free medium, 18 h later, after washing twice with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Similar to primary hepatocytes, TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) was added at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. The cells without TGF-β1 (control) and those with TGF-β1 were harvested at 0.5, 1, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after TGF-β1 treatment. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis (qRT-PCR)—qRT-PCR was performed by ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystem) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific forward and reverse primers were purchased from Qiagen. Data analysis was performed using ABI Prism 7900HT SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystem). 2ΔCtn = 2CtGAPDH - Cttarget calculation was used for relative expression value. Preparation of Cell Lysate—AML12 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes were lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice. Cells were scraped and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and rotated for 1 h at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were stored in aliquots at -80 °C until required. Protein concentration in the cell lysate solution was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—The cell lysate was mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer (350 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.012% bromphenol blue) supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min before loading and being separated on precasted 10% or 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm sodium NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with various primary antibodies in blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat milk at the dilution specified by the manufacturers. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-E cadherin (BD Biosciences), goat anti-vimentin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-type I collagen (Calbiochem), rabbit anti-AKT (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) and mouse anti-GAPDH (Abcam). After washing in TTBS buffer, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk dissolved in TTBS. Membranes were then washed with TTBS buffer extensively, and the signals were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified with Image-J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Relative protein abundance in each sample was normalized to that of GAPDH or α-tubulin. Immunoprecipitation (IP)—2 μg of rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added to 510 μg of whole protein cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated with rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was incubated with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Sample mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed three times with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) which included protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were loaded on precasted 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence (IF) Staining—Mouse primary hepatocytes for immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin and vimentin were plated on collagen-coated coverslips in 6-well culture dishes and treated in the same method as above described. Mouse primary hepatocytes for immunofluorescence staining of procollagen/type I collagen were plated on positively charged, noncollagen-coated, coverslips seeded in 6-well culture dishes (to confirm de novo synthesis of type I collagen). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After 18 h, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium. TGF-β1 was added at the onset of the experiment (i.e. time of change to serum-free medium) at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. AML12 cells for immunofluorescence staining were plated on noncollagen-coated (as recommended by ATCC) positively charged coverslips seeded in 6-well culture dishes and treated using the same methods as described above. At 0.5, 1, 24, 48, and 72 h after changing to serum-free medium, cells without TGF-β1 (control) and those with TGF-β1 were washed with PBS three times and fixed with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 10 min on ice. Cells were fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS for 5 min (three times), cells were blocked with Pro-Block (Dako Cytomation, Carpintenia, CA) for 30 min at room temperature, then with 5% serum (from same species as secondary antibody) in PBS for 60 min, and then incubated with the specific primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used for immunostaining: goat anti-mouse albumin (Immunology Consultants Laboratory), rat anti-E cadherin (clone ECCD-2) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), goat anti-vimentin (Abcam), and rabbit anti-mouse anti-procollagen/type I collagen (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Alexa fluor-488, Alexa fluor-594 (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR), or Texas Red (Abcam)-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. For F-actin staining, we used Alexa fluor-488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cells were co-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), HCl (Molecular Probes), to visualize the nuclei. Stained cells were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation) and viewed by confocal laser microscopy (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All exposure gains and rates are consistent among samples. Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Experiment—Culture medium was changed 4 h after the isolation of primary hepatocytes, and the cells were cultured in the presence of negative control siRNA (Qiagen) or Smad4 siRNA (Qiagen) for 48 h. Transfection of siRNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 10 μm was determined to be the most effective siRNA concentration for Smad4 silencing. Hence, 10 μm siRNA with HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) in serum-free culture medium was incubated for 10 min at room temperature (transfection mixtures) and added directly to the cultured cells. The AML12 hepatocyte cells were plated with transfection mixtures and cultured for 48 h. The primary hepatocytes and the AML12 cells with the transfection mixture were changed to serum-free medium after washing twice with PBS. TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) was added at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. The cells without TGF-β1 (control) and those with TGF-β1 were harvested 1 h and 72 h later. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means ± S.E. All values were derived from measurements of at least three independently performed experiments. Statistical analyses for comparisons over time course were performed with repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Bonferroni/Dunn's correction. Student's t test was used for the comparison of control and TGF-β1 treatment groups at the same time point. A p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. ANOVA and Student's t test were performed using StatView software package (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). TGF-β1 Induces Cytoskeletal Rearrangement in Hepatocytes in Vitro—Primary adult (12-week-old) mouse hepatocytes were cultured in serum-free medium with or without TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). After 72 h in culture, hepatocytes were co-immunostained for F-actin and albumin and examined by confocal microscopy. In control hepatocytes, F-actin was detected in the cell-cell junction with a peri-cell membrane distribution, and TGF-β1-treated cells acquired a spindle-shaped morphology with polarization of the F-actin stress fibers throughout the cell (Fig. 1A). This phenotypic appearance suggested that mature hepatocytes can acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. Co-expression of albumin, in both controls and TGF-β1-treated cells, indicates that the cells are hepatocytes (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we confirmed the lack of expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), in both control and TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes using Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, to confirm that our results are not because of HSC or fibroblast contamination of our primary culture, the experiments were reproduced using a “normal” mouse hepatocyte cell line (AML12); TGF-β1-treated cells, but not controls, exhibited a similar pattern of F-actin rearrangement to primary hepatocytes after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 1C). TGF-β1 Induces an EMT State in Hepatocytes—E-cadherin is a universal epithelial marker that plays a key role in the maintenance of cellular integrity, and down-regulation of its expression marks early EMT (16Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 17Li Y. Yang J. Dai C. Wu C. Liu Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We evaluated the pattern of E-cadherin expression in response to TGF-β1 treatment; E-cadherin mRNA levels were decreased in the TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes as compared with controls, p < 0.05 (Fig. 2A, panel i). Similarly, Western blot analysis showed that E-cadherin protein levels were reduced in the TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes, p < 0.05 (Fig. 2B). To demonstrate whether the TGF-β1-induced phenotypic changes and down-regulation of epithelial markers were accompanied by acquisition/up-regulation of mesenchymal makers, we evaluated the expression of vimentin, a filament used to identify mesenchymal cells, as well as cells in EMT (10Bissell D.M. Roulot D. George J. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Both groups of hepatocytes (i.e. controls and TGF-β1-treated) expressed vimentin mRNA, which increased over time. However, the expression of vimentin mRNA was significantly increased in the TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes as compared with controls, p < 0.05 (Fig. 2A, panel ii). Co-immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin and vimentin, evaluated by confocal microscopy, revealed near loss of cell membrane-bound E-cadherin by 72 h after TGF-β1. Down-regulation of the membrane-bound E-cadherin occurs in parallel with fibrillar rearrangement of vimentin filament in the cytoplasm hepatocytes 48 and 72 h after TGF-β1 exposure. These changes were absent in the controls (Fig. 3). TGF β1 Induces an EMT State in the AML12 Hepatocytes—To further test our hypothesis, we examined whether the EMT changes observed in primary hepatocytes could be confirmed in the AML12 mouse hepatocyte cell line. E-cadherin mRNA levels were repressed by TGF-β1 treatment, p < 0.05 (Fig. 4A, panel i). Western blot analysis showed that E-cadherin protein levels were also reduced in the AML12 cells after TGF-β1 treatment, p < 0.05 (Fig. 4B). Similar to primary hepatocytes, vimentin mRNA levels were up-regulated in TGF-β1-treated AML12 cells at 48 and 72 h, p < 0.05 (Fig. 4A, panel ii). Phenotypic examination by immunohistochemistry using confocal microscopy was also performed on AML12 cells in order to further delineate the distribution pattern of these epithelial and mesenchymal markers (Fig. 4C). The findings are consistent with those observed in primary hepatocytes, and provide further proof that our results are due to EMT and not to potential fibroblast contamination and overgrowth. TGF-β1 Induces Type I Collagen Expression in Primary Hepatocytes—To evaluate whether the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by hepatocytes (as suggested by changes in morphology and cytoskeleton rearrangement) is accompanied by mesenchymal defining function(s), we determined whether primary hepatocytes could contribute to the production of extracellular matrix (18Kasai H. Allen J.T. Mason R.M. Kamimura T. Zhang Z. Respir. Res. 2005; 6: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we examined the expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA by hepatocytes. TGF-β1 induced α1(I) collagen mRNA 72 h after treatment (Fig. 5A, panel i). Next, we evaluated the expression of fibroblast-specific protein (FSP1), a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (S1004A) that is specific to fibroblasts (16Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Lack of FSP1 up-regulation after TGF-β1 further supports that increased α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by TGF-β1 is not because of fibroblast contamination/overgrowth (Fig. 5A, panel ii). Subsequently, we examined the type I collagen protein expression in whole cell lysates, and as shown in Fig. 5B, type I collagen was produced by hepatocytes. Levels of type I collagen were higher in the TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes than in their control counterparts. Furthermore, the primary hepatocytes were immunostained with anti-procollagen/type I collagen antibody. As shown in Fig. 6, collagen fibrils were clearly detected in the extracellular space 48 and 72 h after TGF-β1 treatment. Moreover, the intracellular detection of procollagen in albumin-positive cells supports collagen production by hepatocytes. TGF-β1 Treatment Stimulates Type I Collagen Production by AML12 Hepatocytes—To further confirm that the source of type I collagen was the primary hepatocytes, rather than fibroblasts or other unaccounted cell types that may have potentially contaminated our primary hepatocyte preparation, the AML12 cell line was evaluated for type I collagen production. α1(I) collagen mRNA and type I collagen protein were up-regulated after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 7). Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that AML12 hepatocytes synthesize procollagen/type I collagen in response to TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Immunofluorescence for type I collagen in AML12 hepatocytes after TGF-β1 treatment. Co-immunostaining for albumin (red) and procollagen/type I collagen (green) in AML12 cells in the absence (control) or presence of 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 at 24, 48, and 72 h (shown in panels i, ii, and iii, respectively) in serum-free medium, examined by confocal laser microscopy. Cell nuclei are demonstrated by DAPI (blue). Assembly of type I collagen is demonstrated in TGF-β1-treated AML12 cells at 72 h. Note the intracellular procollagen staining in TGF-β1-treated cells.

Quintanilla M. Cano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21113-21123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The snail gene functions as a key regulator of EMT in vitro and in vivo (14Vega S. Morales A.V. Ocana O.H. Valdes F. Fabregat I. Nieto M.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 20Chagraoui J. Lepage-Noll A. Anjo A. Uzan G. Charbord P. Blood. 2003; 101: 2973-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the expression of snail in TGF-β1-treated and control hepatocytes is consistent with EMT. In fact, snail mRNA was up-regulated at 0.5 and 1 h after TGF-β1 exposure in AML12 and primary hepatocytes, respectively (Fig. 9A, panels i and ii). This is consistent with other reports and with our observation of E-cadherin down-regulation (21Carver E.A. Jiang R. Lan Y. Oram K.F. Gridley T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Next, we evaluated the TGF-β1 pathways that are associated with EMT change. Both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent (i.e. Akt- and ERK-dependent) TGF-β pathways have been implicated in EMT in various epithelial cell types (8Xie L. Law B.K. Aakre M.E. Edgerton M. Shyr Y. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Breast Cancer Res. 2003; 5: R187-R198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kasai H. Allen J.T. Mason R.M. Kamimura T. Zhang Z. Respir.

Aakre M.E. Moses H.L. Neoplasia (Bratisl.). 2004; 6: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). First, we evaluated the Smad-independent pathway by examining Akt and ERK1/2 activation. The level and differential expression of phospho-Akt (P-Akt) and phospho-ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2), the active forms of Akt and ERK1/2, were similar, i.e. not significantly different between control and TGF-β1-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 9B, panel i). Similarly, P-AKT and P-ERK1/2 had similar patterns and levels of expression in both control and TGF-β1-treated AML12 cells (Fig. 9B, panel ii). These observations suggested that Smad-independent TGF-β signaling is not significantly involved in mediating EMT. Next, we examined the Smad-dependent signaling pathway, i.e. Smad2/3 and Smad4 activation. IP assays confirmed binding of Smad2/3 to Smad4, hence their activation (Fig. 10A, panel i). P-Smad2 levels increased after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 10A, panel ii), and immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the translocation (i.e. activation) of the Smad2/3 complex to the nucleus of hepatocytes 0.5 h after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 10B). AML12 cells were similarly examined for evidence of Smad2/3 activation after TGF-β treatment. IP (Fig. 11A) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 11B) studies were consistent with Smad2/3 and Smad4 binding and activation. Taken together, the Smad-dependent signaling pathway was clearly activated in TGF-β1-treated primary and AML12 hepatocytes and not in their control counterparts. This suggests that TGF-β1-induced EMT changes in hepatocytes were predominantly mediated via Smad signaling and not via the non-Smad, Akt, and/or ERK1/2 pathway. Smad4-siRNA Reverses EMT in Hepatocytes in Vitro—To demonstrate the central role of the TGF-β1/Smad signal on EMT induction, siRNA technology was used for smad4 gene silencing in both primary and AML12 hepatocytes (24Inoue A. Sawata S.Y. Taira K. J. Drug Target. 2006; 14: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Ye L. Zhang H. Zhang L. Yang G. Ke Q. Guo H. Bu H. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 29: 1149-1157PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of siRNA transfection and resultant smad4 gene silencing in primary and AML12 hepatocytes was evaluated by IP, qRT-PCR, and IF.

Photoinduced formation of a cystein-flavin adduct drives flavin protonation to induce an N-terminal conformational change. A cysteine-to-serine substitution remote from the flavin adenine dinucleotide binding site decouples conformational switching from the flavin photocycle and prevents Vivid from sending signals in Neurospora.

https://openalex.org/W2036813822,"Although the primary mechanism of eukaryotic messenger RNA decay is exoribonucleolytic degradation in the 5'-to-3' orientation, it has been widely accepted that Bacteria can only degrade RNAs with the opposite polarity, i.e. 3' to 5'. Here we show that maturation of the 5' side of Bacillus subtilis 16S ribosomal RNA occurs via a 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic pathway, catalyzed by the widely distributed essential ribonuclease RNase J1. The presence of a 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease activity in B. subtilis suggested an explanation for the phenomenon whereby mRNAs in this organism are stabilized for great distances downstream of ""roadblocks"" such as stalled ribosomes or stable secondary structures, whereas upstream sequences are never detected. We show that a 30S ribosomal subunit bound to a Shine Dalgarno-like element (Stab-SD) in the cryIIIA mRNA blocks exonucleolytic progression of RNase J1, accounting for the stabilizing effect of this element in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1967596247,"Nucleosomes must be deacetylated behind elongating RNA polymerase II to prevent cryptic initiation of transcription within the coding region. RNA polymerase II signals for deacetylation through the methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36), which provides the recruitment signal for the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). The recognition of methyl H3K36 by Rpd3S requires the chromodomain of its Eaf3 subunit. Paradoxically, Eaf3 is also a subunit of the NuA4 acetyltransferase complex, yet NuA4 does not recognize methyl H3K36 nucleosomes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we found that methyl H3K36 nucleosome recognition by Rpd3S also requires the plant homeobox domain (PHD) of its Rco1 subunit. Thus, the coupled chromo and PHD domains of Rpd3S specify recognition of the methyl H3K36 mark, demonstrating the first combinatorial domain requirement within a protein complex to read a specific histone code."

How the Xs are maintained differently in the same nucleus remains unknown.

Autosomes carrying ectopic X-inactivation center sequences are also targeted to the perinucleolar compartment.

In 1949, Barr and Bertram discovered a cytologically distinct structure in the female cat neuron (Barr and Bertram, 1949Barr M.L. Bertram E.G. A morphological distinction between neurons of the male and female, and the behaviour of the nucleolar satellite during accelerated nucleoprotein synthesis.Nature. 1949; 163: 676Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) that is now known to be an inactivated X chromosome (Lyon, 1961Lyon M.F. Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (Mus musculus L.).Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)—the programmed silencing of one X chromosome in the female embryo—is one of the earliest measurable events in mammalian development. In preimplantation embryos, imprinted silencing of the paternal X ensures dosage equivalence between males and females (reviewed in Thorvaldsen et al., 2006Thorvaldsen J.L. Verona R.I.

X-chromosome inactivation: Linking ontogeny and phylogeny.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the epiblast, the paternal X is reactivated (Mak et al., 2004Mak W. Nesterova T.B. de Napoles M. Appanah R. Yamanaka S. Otte A.P. Brockdorff N. Reactivation of the paternal X chromosome in early mouse embryos.Science. 2004; 303: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), with ensuing random XCI occurring at 4.5–6.5 days postfertilization in a manner that can silence either the maternal or paternal X (reviewed in Lucchesi et al., 2005Lucchesi J.C. Kelly W.G. Panning B. Chromatin remodeling in dosage compensation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 615-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Unlike imprinted XCI, silencing during random XCI is preceded first by a counting step, in which the number of Xs is measured relative to autosomes, and then by a choice step, in which a stochastic mechanism designates one active X (Xa) and one inactive X (Xi) in a mutually exclusive manner. The X-inactivation center (Xic) regulates the counting, choice, and silencing steps during random XCI (Brown et al., 1991bBrown C.J. Lafreniere R.G. Powers V.E. Sebastio G. Ballabio A. Pettigrew A.L.

Its function depends on a trio of noncoding genes which produce the 17 kb Xist RNA (Borsani et al., 1991Borsani G. Tonlorenzi R. Simmler M.C. Dandolo L. Arnaud D. Capra V. Grompe M. Pizzuti A.

Davidow L.S. Warshawsky D. Tsix, a gene antisense to Xist at the X-inactivation centre.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and a series of shorter transcripts within Xite (Ogawa and Lee, 2003Ogawa Y. Lee J.T. Xite, X-inactivation intergenic transcription elements that regulate the probability of choice.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). During the process of XCI, the asymmetric fates of the two Xs result from the allele-specific action of Xite and Tsix. Under the influence of the enhancer-like Xite, Tsix expression persists on the future active X (Xa) and blocks Xist induction (Ogawa and Lee, 2003Ogawa Y. Lee J.T.

Identification of developmentally specific enhancers for Tsix in the regulation of X-chromosome inactivation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2757-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At the same time, Xite and Tsix's downregulation on the future inactive X (Xi) enables the allele-specific upregulation of Xist in cis. The Xi is then enveloped by an “Xist RNA cloud” (Clemson et al., 1996Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. XIST RNA paints the inactive X chromosome at interphase: evidence for a novel RNA involved in nuclear/chromosome structure.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and adopts a heterochromatic configuration that includes delayed replication timing, recruitment of polycomb complexes (PRC1 and PRC2), lysines 9 and 27 hypermethylation on histone H3, and deacetylation of histone H4 (reviewed in (Lucchesi et al., 2005Lucchesi J.C. Kelly W.G. Panning B. Chromatin remodeling in dosage compensation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 615-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)). Once established, the Xi is clonally maintained through subsequent cell divisions. Curiously, the Xic is thought to be dispensable for Xi maintenance despite continued synthesis of Xist RNA in adult cells (Brown and Willard, 1994Brown C.J. Willard H.F. The human X-inactivation centre is not required for maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation.Nature. 1994; 368: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Csankovszki et al., 1999Csankovszki G. Panning B. Bates B. Pehrson J.R. Jaenisch R. Conditional deletion of Xist disrupts histone macroH2A localization but not maintenance of X inactivation.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). With the dispensability of the Xic, how female cells maintain the epigenetically divergent states of two Xs remains an intriguing and unsolved problem. The ability of chromatin to self-propagate through semiconservative replication (McNairn and Gilbert, 2003McNairn A.J. Gilbert D.M. Epigenomic replication: linking epigenetics to DNA replication.Bioessays. 2003; 25: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) may provide a partial explanation for how the Xi maintains a distinct identity from the Xa. Another possible mechanism involves nuclear compartmentalization (Cremer et al., 2006Cremer T. Cremer M. Dietzel S. Muller S. Solovei I. Fakan S. Chromosome territories–a functional nuclear landscape.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, Comings, 1968Comings D.E. The rationale for an ordered arrangement of chromatin in the interphase nucleus.Ann. Hum. Genet. 1968; 520: 440-460Google Scholar). A role for functional nuclear dynamics in XCI has recently emerged from studies examining X chromosome movement during the process of XCI (Xu et al., 2006Xu N. Tsai C.L. Lee J.T. Transient homologous chromosome pairing marks the onset of X inactivation.Science. 2006; 311: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, Bacher et al., 2006Bacher C.P. Guggiari M. Brors B. Augui S. Clerc P. Avner P. Eils R. Heard E. Transient colocalization of X-inactivation centres accompanies the initiation of X inactivation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Prior to the onset of XCI, the epigenetically equivalent Xs adopt random positions relative to each other. At the onset of XCI, the Xs pair transiently at the Xic and acquire asymmetric epigenetic marks (Xu et al., 2006Xu N. Tsai C.L. Lee J.T. Transient homologous chromosome pairing marks the onset of X inactivation.Science. 2006; 311: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the result of which is the allele-specific initiation of silencing from the designated Xi. It is currently not known whether the Xs retreat to specific nuclear destinations following the dissociation of pairing. Because the Xi is seen as an attachment to the nuclear envelope in 60%–80% of human cells, a classic hypothesis proposes that the Xi resides at the nuclear periphery together with other types of heterochromatin (Barton et al., 1964Barton D.E.

The relative intranuclear positions of Barr bodies in XXX non-transformed numan fibroblasts.Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 165: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, a detailed structural analysis has shown that the Xa is also attached to the nuclear envelope (Eils et al., 1996Eils R. Dietzel S. Bertin E. Schrock E. Speicher M.R. Ried T. Robert-Nicoud M. Cremer C. Cremer T.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), with the Xs differing not so much in their perinuclear localization but more in the shape each chromosome adopts. Combined, these observations suggest that perinuclear localization may be important but, by itself, cannot explain the epigenetic differences between the Xa and Xi. In other studies–particularly those involving neuronal cells–the Barr body could sometimes be seen to lie near the nucleolus, though not necessarily in direct contact (Barr and Bertram, 1949Barr M.L. Bertram E.G.

Bouteille M. New data on the in situ position of the inactive X chromosome in the interphase nucleus of human fibroblasts.Hum. Genet. 1985; 69: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, to further investigate the compartment hypothesis, we examine the dynamic movements of the Xi following X-X pairing and implicate a new subnuclear space in the epigenetic maintenance of Xa and Xi. During the course of earlier work (Lee et al., 1999bLee J.T. Lu N. Han Y. Genetic analysis of the mouse X inactivation center defines an 80-kb multifunction domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we incidentally observed that autosomes carrying Xic transgenes were frequently near the nucleolus (unpublished data). To investigate a potential relationship, we followed X chromosome movement in differentiating female mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, an established ex vivo model for studying XCI. In the pre-XCI state (day 0 [d0] of differentiation), the Xs are randomly positioned relative to each other, consistent with previous observation (Xu et al., 2006Xu N. Tsai C.L. Lee J.T. Transient homologous chromosome pairing marks the onset of X inactivation.Science. 2006; 311: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, Bacher et al., 2006Bacher C.P. Guggiari M. Brors B. Augui S. Clerc P. Avner P. Eils R. Heard E. Transient colocalization of X-inactivation centres accompanies the initiation of X inactivation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). During XCI induction by cell differentiation (d4), we observed a transient increase in X-X pairing (Figure 1B), also as previously reported. Shortly after pairing is first detected, we also observed an increase in the number of Xs that came into contact with the nucleolus (Figure 1C). In kinetic analyses, Xic DNA FISH and nucleolar immunostaining showed that X-X pairing peaked between d2 and d4 (Figure 1D) (the timeframe during which XCI counting and choice take place) and returned to baseline by d8 (a time when XCI is already established). By contrast, perinucleolar localization of one X was first seen at d2 and steadily increased up to d8 without declining thereafter (Figure 1D and data not shown). Thus, while X-X pairing is a transient and occurs early, nucleolar association is stable over time and continues to increase in frequency after pairing ceases. To determine whether pairing occurs in the perinucleolar region, we asked what fraction of paired Xic's could be found at the nucleolar edge. Using a pairing criterion of <1.0 μm or 0.1 normalized distance (ND; see Xu et al., 2006Xu N. Tsai C.L. Lee J.T. Transient homologous chromosome pairing marks the onset of X inactivation.Science. 2006; 311: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar for definition), we found that ∼70% of all pairing took place far from the nucleolus. Among the ∼30% that were proximal, often only one of the two Xic's was in direct contact (data not shown), potentially indicating an early stage of dissociation. Taken together, these data suggested that pairing does not take place at the nucleolar surface and that perinucleolar localization occurs after X-X pairing. We next asked which chromosome –Xa or Xi – assumes a perinucleolar position. We examined primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from 13.5 dpc embryos by Xist RNA immuno-FISH and found that it was the Xist RNA-coated chromosome (Xi) that associated with the nucleolus (Figures 2A and 2B). In unsynchronized MEF populations, approximately 50%–60% of nuclei showed Xi localization to the perinucleolar region (Figure 2C). The Xi occupied a domain next to the nucleolus, never within, in all cases for which an association was detected. When DNA FISH using an Xic probe was performed in sequence after first-round RNA immuno-FISH, we found that the Xic was invariably in direct contact with the nucleolus, whereas other X domains did not necessarily contact the nucleolus directly (Figure 2D). The Xi as a whole, however, frequently appeared to embrace the nucleolus (Figure 2B). By contrast, only 10% of Xa demonstrated Xic contact with the nucleolus (Figure 2C). Because the Xi is often described as an attachment to the lateral nuclear envelope (peripheral edge), we next asked whether nucleolar association might bear any relationship to perinuclear localization. By combining Xist RNA FISH, nucleolar immunostaining, and DAPI nuclear staining, we found that ∼30% of Xi showed exclusive association with the nucleolus (note: this does not exclude contact with the apical nuclear membrane), ∼35% with exclusive association with the lateral nuclear envelope, and ∼25% associated with both (Figure 2E). This indicated that the Xi actually has two preferred locations—one perinucleolar and one perinuclear—and that these positions are not mutually exclusive. In unsynchronized populations, the prevalence of Xi nucleolar attachment never exceeded 50%–60%. To determine whether the association might be regulated by the cell cycle, we examined the frequency of association during different phases of the cell cycle in primary MEFs. Analysis of G0, G1, and G2 phases using cell synchronization techniques and cell cycle-specific markers either showed reduced Xi-nucleolar association or no enrichment at all (data not shown). Further analysis revealed a specific association with S phase (Figure 3). Cells in S phase could be identified by combining BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) labeling and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) immunostaining (Nakayasu and Berezney, 1989Nakayasu H. Berezney R.

Epigenomic replication: linking epigenetics to DNA replication.Bioessays. 2003; 25: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). BrdU, a nucleotide analog, incorporates directly into DNA during replication, whereas PCNA protein accumulates only at the replication fork. Thus, when cells were BrdU-treated for 1 hr, those in early S phase stained diffusely with both BrdU and PCNA, due to genome-wide replication of euchromatin; cells in mid S showed focal staining around the nucleolus, correlating with replication of some types of heterochromatin; and cells in late S showed multiple punctate foci correlating with replication of pericentric heterochromatin (Figure 3A). When MEFs were BrdU-treated for 5 hr, we discovered the appearance of a perinucleolar BrdU ring with a thickness of ∼0.4–1.0 μm (Figure 3B). Among nuclei with BrdU rings, 30% were in mid-S, as inferred from the fact that the PCNA pattern was still mid S-like at the end of the 5 hr BrdU labeling (Note: BrdU labeled all DNA that underwent replication during the 5 hr BrdU treatment window, while PCNA staining detected only DNA at the replication fork at the time of harvest). Approximately 62% were in late-S, as inferred from the progression of PCNA staining to the punctate peri-centric patterns at the end of the 5 hr. When cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment for 15 hr, the BrdU ring consistently appeared between 5–7 hr after HU release and BrdU treatment (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, the perinucleolar BrdU ring coincided with S phase and could be used as a specific temporal marker. We then carried out Xist RNA immuno-FISH on primary MEFs treated with BrdU for 5 hr. Interestingly, among cells in mid-to-late S phase, 80%–90% of the Xi could be found within the BrdU ring embracing the nucleolus (Figures 3E and 3F). These results would predict that cells in early S phase show inverse association with the nucleolus. Indeed, primary MEFs showed significantly decreased Xi-nucleolar contact between 0 to 4 hr after HU release (early S phase) (Figure 3G). Therefore, the Xi is highly enriched at the perinucleolar site during mid-to-late S phase, a time when the Xi is replicated during the cell cycle. Intriguingly, we also discovered that the perinucleolar ring is enriched for Snf2h (Figure 3H), the catalytic subunit of the ACF1-ISWI chromatin remodeling complex that is known to be required for replication of heterochromatin (Collins et al., 2002Collins N. Poot R.A. Kukimoto I. Garcia-Jimenez C. Dellaire G. Varga-Weisz P.D. An ACF1-ISWI chromatin-remodeling complex is required for DNA replication through heterochromatin.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This striking coincidence raised the possibility that the perinucleolar compartment may function in Xi replication. Clearly, the perinucleolar space is not a general storage space for heterochromatin, as FISH with centromeric probes showed that, unlike the Xi, centric heterochromatin resides throughout the nucleus during mid-to-late S phase (Figure 3H). Therefore, the perinucleolar ring is not a general “sink” for all heterochromatin and, given its enrichment for Snf2h, may serve a purpose instead in replicating condensed chromatin. Because the Xi has another preferred location (Figure 2), we also asked whether association with the lateral nuclear envelope displayed any cell cycle dependence. However, the fraction of Xi attached to the nuclear periphery did not change at any stage of the cell cycle (data not shown). In mid-to-late S when 80%–90% of Xi resided in the perinucleolar ring domain, still only ∼50% maintained contact with the peripheral nuclear envelope. We concluded that perinucleolar targeting is dynamic, while perinuclear association is relatively constant. Previous studies showed that 80 kb Xic transgenes encompassing Xist, Tsix, and Xite recapitulated XCI by silencing linked autosomes in male cells (Figure 4A) (Lee et al., 1999bLee J.T. Lu N. Han Y. Genetic analysis of the mouse X inactivation center defines an 80-kb multifunction domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if the perinucleolar ring served a specific function during XCI, such Xic transgenes might ectopically target the autosome to the perinucleolar site. We tested three fibroblast lines with silencing-competent transgenes: 116.6, which carries a 450 kb yeast artificial chromosome clone, Y116, on chromosome (Ch) 12 (Lee et al., 1996Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R. A 450 kb transgene displays properties of the mammalian X-inactivation center.Cell. 1996; 86: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); πJL1.4.1, which carries the 80 kb P1 clone, πJL1, on Ch3; and πJL2.5.5, which carries the 80 kb P1 clone, πJL2, on Ch8 (Lee et al., 1999bLee J.T. Lu N. Han Y. Genetic analysis of the mouse X inactivation center defines an 80-kb multifunction domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, in all three cases, RNA immuno-FISH showed that the Xist RNA-coated autosome embraced the nucleolus (Figures 4B and 4C). Subsequent DNA FISH on the same samples showed that it was also the Xic sequences that made contact with the nucleolus (Figure 4B and data not shown). Thus, the Xic-bearing autosomes behaved similarly to the Xi. πJL1.4.1 and πJL2.5.5 showed perinucleolar and perinuclear distribution profiles that were very similar to those of wild-type MEFs (Figure 4C). By contrast, a pSx7 transgene that cannot silence linked autosomes (Lee, 2005Lee J.T. Regulation of X-chromosome counting by Tsix and Xite sequences.Science. 2005; 309: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) could not recapitulate perinucleolar targeting, as a nucleolar association was observed only in ∼20% on d8 (Figures 4B and 4D, Sx7.7). These results together indicated the Xic is sufficient to target linked chromosomes to the perinucleolar ring. The cell cycle-specific dynamics were also faithfully reproduced by the Xic transgenes. In π2.5.5 cells, approximately 70% of the Ch8Tg (transgenic Chromosome 8) localized to perinucleolar space during mid-to-late S phase, contrasting with only 40% localization for the nontransgenic Ch8 (Figures 4E and 4F). In 116.6 cells, 100% of Ch12Tg contacted the nucleolus in mid-to-late S phase and at other times during the cell cycle (Figure 4C). Ch12Tg tightly embraced the nucleolus and displayed more contact points than the Xi or any other transgenic autosome (Figure 4B), possibly reflecting the presence of a Ch12 nucleolus-organizing region which would target Ch12Tg to the nucleolus independently of the Xic. The extremely tight nucleolar association correlates with the highly effective Ch12Tg silencing in 116.6 (Lee and Jaenisch, 1997Lee J.T. Jaenisch R. Long-range cis effects of ectopic X-inactivation centres on a mouse autosome.Nature. 1997; 386: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 1996Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A.

Han Y. Genetic analysis of the mouse X inactivation center defines an 80-kb multifunction domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Conversely, the less efficient targeting in other transgenic lines correlated with less effective silencing. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the Xic is sufficient to recapitulate the cell cycle dynamics of perinucleolar targeting and hinted that targeting may be involved in aspects of silencing. Given Xist's role in XCI silencing, we examined the consequences of deleting Xist using XistΔ16kb-2lox, a conditional allele in which two loxP sites flank a 16 kb Xist sequence (Csankovszki et al., 1999Csankovszki G. Panning B. Bates B. Pehrson J.R. Jaenisch R. Conditional deletion of Xist disrupts histone macroH2A localization but not maintenance of X inactivation.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Figure 5A). Skin fibroblasts isolated from XistΔ16kb–2lox/+ female mice either inactivated the wild-type X or the X with the conditional Xist allele. Upon introducing Cre recombinase and carrying out limiting dilution cloning, three types of subclones were obtained in accordance with which X was previously chosen as Xa and Xi (Figure 5B). XiWT XaΔXist subclones carried a wild-type Xi and an Xa with the conditionally deleted Xist allele. XaWT XiΔXist subclones carried a wild-type Xa and an Xi with a deleted Xist allele. The 2lox subclones failed to delete the conditional Xist allele and continued to carry two intact Xist alleles (controls). The clonal type of interest, XaWT XiΔXist, could be distinguished from all others by the absence of Xist RNA. To determine whether Xist is required for perinucleolar targeting, we performed immuno-FISH on independently isolated XaWT XiΔXist subclones, using probe Sx7 to detect the two Xic's and probe E9 to distinguish XaWT from XiΔXist (Figure 5C). Most intriguingly, nearly all XiΔXist lost its association with the nucleolus, whereas Xist+(2lox) controls maintained an expected 50%–60% association. Among all three mutant subclones (III.20, III.3, and III.7), XiΔXist showed only low level association with the nucleolus, a level that was essentially equal to background (the frequency of incidental Xa association) (Figure 5D). At the same time, the association with the lateral nuclear envelope did not decrease, with 67% of Xi exhibiting perinuclear localization (n = 111). This result further emphasized differences between the perinucleolar and perinuclear compartments with respect to XCI. We concluded that Xist is absolutely obligatory for targeting the Xi to the perinucleolar site and that its excision in post-XCI cells leads to dissociation from the nucleolus. To determine whether the loss of perinucleolar targeting had functional consequences, we performed immuno-FISH on metaphase chromosomes and looked for changes in the Xi heterochromatin (Figure 6). The Xi is known to be enriched for H3-K27 trimethylation (H3-K27me3) and show a dearth of H3-K4 dimethylation (H3-K4me2) (Lucchesi et al., 2005Lucchesi J.C. Kelly W.G. Panning B.

https://openalex.org/W2038175996,"In fission yeast, the RNAi pathway is required for heterochromatin-dependent silencing of transgene insertions at centromeric repeats and acts together with other pathways to silence transgenes at the silent mating-type locus. Here, we show that transgene transcripts at centromeric repeats are processed into siRNAs and are therefore direct targets of RNAi. Furthermore, we show that Cid14, a member of the Trf4/5 family of poly(A) polymerases, has poly(A) polymerase activity that is required for heterochromatic gene silencing. Surprisingly, while siRNA levels in cid14Delta cells are dramatically reduced, the structural integrity of heterochromatin appears to be preserved. Cid14 resides in a complex similar to the TRAMP complex found in budding yeast, which is part of a nuclear surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant transcripts. Our findings indicate that polyadenylation by a TRAMP-like complex contributes to robust silencing of heterochromatic genes in fission yeast via the recruitment of the exosome and/or the RNAi machinery."

Here we describe a pure spillover connection between the climbing fiber and molecular layer interneurons in the rat cerebellar cortex. We show that, instead of acting via conventional synapses, multiple climbing fibers activate AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors on interneurons exclusively via spillover. Spillover from the climbing fiber represents a form of glutamatergic volume transmission that could be triggered in a regionalized manner by experimentally observed synchronous climbing fiber activity. Climbing fibers are known to direct parallel fiber synaptic plasticity in interneurons, so one function of this spillover is likely to involve controlling synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1967758178,"ZAP-70, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase required for T cell antigen receptor signaling, is controlled by a regulatory segment that includes a tandem SH2 unit responsible for binding to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). The crystal structure of autoinhibited ZAP-70 reveals that the inactive kinase domain adopts a conformation similar to that of cyclin-dependent kinases and Src kinases. The autoinhibitory mechanism of ZAP-70 is, however, distinct and involves interactions between the regulatory segment and the hinge region of the kinase domain that reduce its flexibility. Two tyrosine residues in the SH2-kinase linker that activate ZAP-70 when phosphorylated are involved in aromatic-aromatic interactions that connect the linker to the kinase domain. These interactions are inconsistent with ITAM binding, suggesting that destabilization of this autoinhibited ZAP-70 conformation is the first step in kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2064720809,"Radiation therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of glioblastomas, but these tumors are often associated with radioresistance. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which occurs frequently in glioblastomas due to inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), correlates with radioresistance. To directly test the link between Akt activation and radioresistance, we utilized PTEN-deficient U251 glioblastoma cells engineered to inducibly restore PTEN upon exposure to doxycycline. These cells showed high basal levels of Akt activation (i.e. high levels of phospho-Akt), but induction of PTEN led to substantially decreased phospho-Akt and was associated with radiosensitization. To investigate whether the PTEN-induced radiosensitization was attributable to impaired sensing versus repair of DNA damage, we assessed levels of γ-H2AX after ionizing radiation in U251 cells induced for PTEN. Initial post-radiation levels of γ-H2AX foci were not decreased in PTEN-induced cells; however, the resolution of these foci was significantly delayed. In contrast to these results, induction of phosphatase-dead PTEN showed no appreciable effect. Finally, exposure of cells to the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not decrease the occurrence of γ-H2AX foci after irradiation but did markedly delay their resolution. These results together support a direct link between Akt activation, repair of DNA damage, and radioresistance in glioblastoma. Targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway may modulate DNA repair to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy."

These Gzms are called orphan Gzms, which are also highly conserved serine proteases found in both humans and rodents, located in three clusters on separate chromosomes. The orphan Gzms include C, D, E, F, G, K, L, M, and N in mice, and H, K, and M in humans (9Grossman W.J. Revell P.A. Lu Z.H. Johnson H. Bredemeyer A.J. Ley T.J. Curr. Opin.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of oxidative damage and have been proposed as critical regulators of apoptosis (14Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). ROS can induce opening of the permeability transition (PT) pore through oxidation-dependent mechanisms and are potent inducers of apoptosis, both in cultured cells and in vivo (14Danial N.N.

Notably, intracellular ROS arise prior to cytochrome c (cyt c) release during the activation of several apoptosis pathways. Mitochondrial damage is a required initial step in caspase-dependent apoptosis, including that induced by GzmB, in which it is triggered by proteolytic cleavage of Bid (15Alimonti J.B. Shi L.

However GzmM does not alter the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) or does not cause ROS accumulation and release of cyt c. It is unclear whether mitochondria are involved in GzmM-mediated apoptosis. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) was initially identified using the yeast two-hybrid system as a novel protein that interacts with the intracellular domain of type I TNF receptor (22Song H.Y.

TRAP1 is identical to heat shock protein 75 (HSP75), which is a member of the HSP90 family that binds to the retinoblastoma protein during mitosis and after heat shock (23Chen C.F. Chen Y. Dai K. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4691-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). TRAP1 localizes in mitochondria and its mitochondrial localization sequence exists at the N terminus of this protein (24Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

A recent report showed TRAP1 is dramatically suppressed in tumor cells with apoptogenic inducers, such as the shikonin derivative β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (β-HIVS) or a topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16. TRAP1 silencing enhances cyt c release and apoptosis induced by those two apoptotic inducers (25Masuda Y. Shima G. Aiuchi T. Horie M. Hori K. Nakajo S. Kajimoto S. Shibayama-Imazu T. Nakaya K. J.

These data suggest TRAP1 may play an important role in antagonizing apoptosis via reducing ROS accumulation. In this study, we demonstrated GzmM can cause mitochondrial swelling and loss of ΔΨ. Furthermore, GzmM induces a rapid increase of intracellular ROS and the release of cyt c. TRAP1 is able to protect cells from death through inhibition of ROS generation. GzmM directly cleaves TRAP1 resulting in intracellular ROS accumulation. Moreover cells with silenced TRAP1 expression are more susceptible, whereas cells overexpressing TRAP1 are more resistant to GzmM-induced apoptosis. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Jurkat) or DMEM medium (HeLa) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin. Commercial antibodies were mouse mAb against cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen), β-actin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) and Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). A monoclonal antibody against human TRAP1(TRAP1–6) was kindly provided by Drs. D. O. Toft and S. J. Felts (Mayo Graduate School, Rochester, MN) or obtained from Abcam Ltd (Cambridge, UK). The fluorescent probe, 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes. 4,5-Dihydroxyl-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid (Tiron) and cyclosporine A (CsA) were from Sigma. LipofectamineTM2000 was from Invitrogen. Annexin V-FITC was from BD Pharmingen, ProLong Antifade kit was from Molecular Probes. Recombinant Protein Expression—Recombinant GzmM, S-AGzmM (enzymatically inactive GzmM produced by mutating the active site Ser182 to Ala) were produced and purified as previously described (13Lu H. Hou Q. Zhao T. Zhang H. Zhang Q. Wu L. Fan Z. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA coding human TRAP1 (a gift from S. J. Felts) was subcloned into pET26b(+) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Recombinant TRAP1 with His6 tags were purified through a nickel column as above. Loading GzmM with Adenovirus—Cells were washed three times in HBSS and resuspended in loading buffer (HBSS with 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). HeLa cells or Jurkat cell (2 × 105) in 50 μl of loading buffer were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with different concentrations of GzmM, S-AGzmM, and an optimal dose of adenovirus (Ad). Cells were incubated for an additional 15 min in 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before being lysed for immunoblot. Transmission Electron Microscopy—HeLa cells (5 × 105) were treated with GzmM plus Ad at 37 °C for 4 h. Then cells were washed twice and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h and postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide. Cells were dehydrated with sequential immerge in 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100% ethanol, and then embedded in Spurrs resin. Ultrathin sections were mounted in copper grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were photographed and scanned by Eversmart Jazz+ program (Scitex). Assessment of ΔΨ—For ΔΨ, cells treated with GzmM/Ad or CCCP were stained with DiOC6 (3Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (27Zhao T. Zhang H. Guo Y. Fan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12104-12111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, Jurkat cells treated with GzmM/Ad (100pfu/ml) for the indicated times and doses were harvested and washed with HBSS three times. Cells were loaded with 20 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC6 (3Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) for 5 min before FACS analysis. Cells treated with the membrane uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were used as a positive control. Cleavage Assay—Cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells treated with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40/25 mm KCl/5 mm MgCl2/1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). Cell lysates (equivalent to 2 × 105 cells) or 1 μm rTRAP was incubated with indicated doses of GzmM or S-AGzmM for the indicated time points in 20 μl of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). For in vivo cleavage assay, cells loaded with GzmM/Ad were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The reaction samples were terminated in 5× SDS-loading buffer and probed by immunoblotting. ATPase Activity Assay—ATP hydrolysis was measured directly by the conversion of ATP to ADP, release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) was estimated according to Kempaiah and Srinivasan (28Kempaiah R.K. Srinivasan K. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2006; 17: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, TRAP1 (3 μm) was incubated with 1 mm ATP at 37 °C for indicated times in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl. Inhibition by granzyme M was performed with 3 μm TRAP1, 1 mm ATP, and various amounts of granzyme M. Reactions were stopped by addition of 200 μl of 1% SDS. Following treatment, samples (0.1 ml) were added to 0.7 ml of ascorbate-molybdate reagent, which consists of 1 part of 10% ascorbic and 6 parts of 0.42% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 1 n H2SO4. Tubes were incubated at 45 °C for 20 min, and absorbance was determined at 820 nm. Time-lapse Microscopy—HeLa cells were plated overnight in 35-mm culture dishes in DMEM and replaced with phenol red-free DMEM with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA), followed by treatment with GzmM (1 μm) and Ad. Images were taken every 2 min by Olympus IX71 microscope (29Waterhouse N.J. Sedelies K.A. Sutton V.R. Pinkoski M.J. Thia K.Y. Johnstone R. Bird P.I. Green D.R. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular ROS production was monitored by incubating HeLa cells with 10 μm DCF-DA at 37 °C for 30 min. Unincorporated DCF-DA was removed through complete washing with phosphate-buffered saline before loading GzmM with Ad. Fluorescence was measured using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur). 200 μm H2O2-treated cells were as a positive control. Apoptosis and Cytochrome c Release Assay—Phosphatidylserine externalization was stained with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyante labeling and assessed with flow cytometer. For the analysis of cyt c release, HeLa cells (1 × 106) were treated with GzmM plus Ad at the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of digitonin lysis buffer (80 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 0.02% digitonin) for 5 min (18Heibein J.A. Barry M. Motyka B. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4683-4693PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatants and the pellets were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using cyt c antibody. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells were grown overnight to subconfluency at 37 °C in 8-well chamber slides coated with rat collagen I (BD Falcon™) and incubated with 500 nm MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were treated with 1 μm GzmM in the presence or absence of Ad for 4 h, washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for another 20 min, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 5 μg/ml anti-cyt c mAb (clone 6H2.B4; Pharmingen), 50 μg/ml donkey serum and 100 μg/ml RNase I. The cells were stained with Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, and soaked for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst. The slides were mounted with ProLong Antifade reagent and observed using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus FV500 microscope). Silencing and Overexpression of TRAP1—Three pairs of RNA sequences against TRAP1 for RNAi were designed based on pSUPER system instructions (Oligoengine) and cloned into pSUPER-puro that expresses 19-nt hairpin-type short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) with a 9-nt loop, as described previously (30Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). TRAP1 shRNA-encoding sequences were as follows: shRNA1: 5′-ACATGAGTTCCAGGCCGAGTTCAAGAGACTCGGCCTGGAACTCATGTTTTTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAAAACATG AGTTCCAGGCCGAGTCTCTTGAACTCGGCCTGGAACTCATGT-3′ (antisense); shRNA2: 5′-GTACAGCAACTTCGTCAGCTTCAAGAGAGCTGACGAAGTTGCTGTACTTTTTT-3′(sense) and 5′-AAAAAAGTACAGCAACTTCGTCA GCTCTCTTGAAGCTGACGAAGTTGCTGTAC-3′ (antisense); shRNA3: 5′-ACATGAGTTCCAGGCCGAGTTCAAGAGACTCGGCCTGGAACTCATGTTTTTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAAAA CATGAGT TCCAGGCCGAGTCTCTTGAACTCGGCCTGGAACTCATGT-3′ (antisense). The inserted shRNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Cells with silenced TRAP1 were selected with puromycin. Empty vectors were used as a control. For TRAP1 overexpression, HeLa cells were transfected with either empty vector pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-TRAP1 for 3 days. GzmM Targets Mitochondria and Causes Loss of ΔΨ—We previously demonstrated GzmM induces caspase-dependent apoptosis (13Lu H. Hou Q. Zhao T. Zhang H. Zhang Q. Wu L. Fan Z. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Kelly et al. (12Kelly J.M. Waterhouse N.J. Cretney E. Browne K.A. Ellis S. Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) reported GzmM induces caspase-independent cell death, which changed the morphology of mitochondria to be rounded but not to be dilated. We wanted to verify whether mitochondria are involved in GzmM-mediated apoptosis. To investigate whether GzmM provokes morphological changes of mitochondria, 1 μm GzmM was loaded with Ad into HeLa cells at 37 °C for 4 h and visualized by electron microscopy. GzmM plus Ad treatment induced profound mitochondrial swelling with loss of cristae structures (Fig. 1). The mitochondria of mock-treated cells showed normal features with a condensed state and narrow cristae. The mitochondria of cells treated with S-AGzmM plus Ad or GzmM alone had no effect (Fig. 1 and not shown). Similar results were obtained by loading GzmM with PFP (data not shown). Mitochondrial functions are dependent on the maintenance of ΔΨ (31Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Loss of ΔΨ is likely to contribute to the death of cells (32Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To assess whether GzmM causes ΔΨ collapse, Jurkat cells were treated with GzmM plus Ad and analyzed by FACS analysis. Cells loaded with GzmM plus Ad showed a dose-dependent decrease of ΔΨ, assayed by the change in fluorescence of the sensitive dye 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC6 (3Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). 0.25 μm GzmM started to initiate significant reduction of ΔΨ. Inactive S-AGzmM plus Ad or mock-treated cells were without effect. An uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) was used to treat cells as a positive control. GzmM-induced ΔΨ reduction was also in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). 1 μm GzmM plus Ad initiated a dramatic decrease in ΔΨ within 1 h. By 4 h, ΔΨ was completely collapsed. GzmM and Ad alone or S-AGzmM had little effect. PT pore can mediate mitochondrial swelling and depolarization during the course of apoptosis. We next investigated whether the PT pore inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) was capable of inhibiting the loss of ΔΨ induced by GzmM. CsA significantly inhibited the loss of mitochondrial ΔΨ induced by GzmM. These results indicate GzmM causes loss of ΔΨ through disruption of the PT pore. GzmM Induces a Rapid Increase of Intracellular ROS—ROS production has been identified as an early event undergoing apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. Superfluous ROS cause mitochondrial damage as well as nuclear DNA damage. Mitochondria are the major source of intracellular ROS (33Esposito L.A. Melov S. Panov A. Cottrell B.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). GzmA induces a rapid increase of ROS and mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss leading to caspase-independent death (21Martinvalet D. Zhu P. Lieberman J. Immunity. 2005; 22: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We next wanted to determine whether ROS is accumulated during GzmM-mediated cytolysis. ROS production was detected using the dye DCF that is a nonfluorescent cell-permeant compound. Once entering a cell, it is degraded by endogenous esterases and no longer diffuses out of the cell. De-esterified products become the fluorescent compound 2′, 7′-dichlorofluors upon oxidation by ROS. To detect ROS accumulation in GzmM-induced death, HeLa cells were treated with various amounts of GzmM plus Ad as measured by detection of the conversion of DCF to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin. 0.25 μm GzmM began to trigger ROS production within a 1-h treatment as measured by increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the ROS indicator dye (Fig. 3A). GzmM augmented ROS generation with increasing concentrations. 1 μm GzmM reached a high peak for ROS production (MFI: 59.6). ROS accumulation required GzmM delivery by Ad. GzmM or Ad alone had no effect. Inactive mutant GzmM (S-AGzmM) plus Ad did not trigger ROS generation (not shown). H2O2-treated cells were used as a positive control. To further verify ROS generation induced by GzmM, time-lapse microscopy was used to visualize ROS production at a single cell level. HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of GzmM plus Ad, fluorescence staining dynamically condensed during induction of cell death (Fig. 3, B and C). GzmM and Ad alone treated cells were undetectable. One cell was chosen for detection of ROS generation by photographing every 2 min. ROS was produced early and increased over time, which was consistent with the above observations by FACS. H2O2 treated cells were used as a positive control. These data are representative of three separate experiments. GzmM Directly Cleaves TRAP1—To investigate whether TRAP1 participates in GzmM-induced apoptosis, nanomolar concentrations of GzmM were incubated with recombinant TRAP1 (rTRAP1) at 37 °C for 2 h. GzmM began to degrade TRAP1 at a nanomolar concentration of 50 nm (Fig. 4 A). rTRAP1 began to degrade within 10 min with 0.5 μm GzmM treatment. Inactive S-AGzmM did not cause TRAP1 degradation. Neither caspase3 nor caspase 8 cut rTRAP1 (data not shown). We detected TRAP1 degradation in cytoplasmic lysates of HeLa cells. Native TRAP1 (2 × 105 cell equivalents) was almost cleaved at the dose of 1.0 μm GzmM at 37° for 2 h (Fig. 4B). GzmM began to degrade TRAP1 at a very early time of 10 min. The full-length of TRAP1 was completely degraded by 2 h. S-AGzmM was without effect on recombinant or native form of TRAP1. These data indicate TRAP1 cleavage requires enzymatic activity of GzmM. To further verify TRAP1 processing is physiologically relevant, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μm GzmM in the presence of Ad. TRAP1 was cleaved in GzmM/Ad-loaded cells by 2 h (Fig. 4C). After 6 h, TRAP1 was completely cleaved. GzmM and Ad alone or S-AGzmM plus Ad failed to degrade TRAP1. The same blot was stripped and reprobed for β-actin. β-Actin was unchanged as a good loading control. The GzmM concentration required to cut TRAP1 in vivo is comparable to that required to induce cell death and DNA damage (13Lu H. Hou Q. Zhao T. Zhang H. Zhang Q. Wu L. Fan Z. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRAP1 is a direct physiological substrate of GzmM in vivo. GzmM Disrupts the ATPase Activity of TRAP1—TRAP1 is an ATP-binding protein with ATPase activity (24Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). TRAP1 may play an important role in refolding of denatured proteins after oxidative stress. We next tested whether GzmM cleavage interferes with the ability of TRAP1 to hydrolyze ATP. ATPase assay was carried out to analyze the effect of GzmM on ATP hydrolysis by TRAP1. rTRAP1 possessed ATPase activity as shown in Fig. 5A. Incubation of rTRAP1 with ATP resulted in increasing free phosphates in a time-dependent manner. Preincubation of rTRAP1 with GzmM inhibited its ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). 2 μm GzmM can completely inhibit ATPase activity of TRAP1. Inactive S-AGzmM had no such effect. Silencing TRAP1 Expression Enhances ROS Production Induced by GzmM—GzmM can induce a rapid increase of intracellular ROS as shown above. We next wanted to determine whether TRAP1 cleavage by GzmM contributes to trigger cell death through ROS accumulation. We designed three shRNA sequences against TRAP1 and constructed pSUPER-TRAP1-shRNA plasmids to silence TRAP1 expression that contained 19-nucleotide hairpin-type short hairpin RNAs. These plasmids were separately transfected into HeLa cells. After 3 days, siRNA1 and siRNA2 each silenced TRAP1 expression by 60–70%; whereas siRNA3 had little effect on TRAP1 expression (Fig. 6A). pSUPER-TRAP1-shRNA1 stable cell lines were established by puromycin selection. TRAP1 was almost undetectable through immunoblotting. HeLa cells transfected with pSUPER empty vector were unchangable for expression of TRAP1. With 50 μm H2O2 treatment, TRAP1 silenced HeLa cells got 34.6% ROS-positive. While only 11.9% control cells transfected with empty vector were ROS positive (Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained with treatment of 100 μm H2O2. To further look at whether TRAP1 silencing enhances GzmM-induced ROS accumulation, TRAP1-silenced HeLa cells were loaded with GzmM plus Ad. ROS generation dramatically increased in TRAP1 silenced HeLa cells compared with cells transfected by empty vectors with increasing concentrations (0.25 μm: 28.9 versus 7.0%; 0.5 μm: 80.2 versus 31.2%; 1 μm: 98.9 versus 47.0%) (Fig. 6C). Cells treated with GzmM or Ad alone just got comparable levels of ROS. These results indicate that TRAP1 cleavage enhances ROS generation during GzmM-induced apoptosis. TRAP1 Silencing Accelerates Cytochrome c Release and GzmM-induced Death—Cyt c release from mitochondria appears to be an early event during apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli (35Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cytochrome c together with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 in a ATP-dependent manner forms apoptosome that causes caspase activation to orchestrate the biochemical execution of cells (36Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS arise prior to cyt c release during activation of several apoptotic pathways. GzmM can induce a rapid increase of intracellular ROS, we further detected whether GzmM induces cyt c release from mitochondria. Cyt c was released from mitochondria in HeLa cells treated with GzmM and Ad visualized through confocal microscopy (Fig. 7A). Cyt c was not released in response to treatment by Gzm M and Ad alone or S-AGzmM plus Ad (and data not shown). We next wanted to test whether TRAP1 affects GzmM-induced cyt c release. HeLa cells with silenced TRAP1 were treat"
https://openalex.org/W2158131232,"Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is essential for cells to survive many environmental stresses. Thus, it may be necessary to buffer ubiquitin and proteasome pools against fluctuation. Proteasome levels are tightly regulated, and proteasome deficiency stimulates a stress response. Here we report a novel pathway of cellular response to ubiquitin depletion. Unlike proteasome stress, ubiquitin stress does not upregulate proteasome abundance. Instead, ubiquitin stress alters proteasome composition. The proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6, which spares ubiquitin from proteasomal degradation, is induced by ubiquitin deficiency. This enhances loading of proteasomes with Ubp6, thereby altering proteasome function. A catalytically inactive mutant of Ubp6 fails to recycle ubiquitin and also inhibits proteasome function directly, thus inducing both ubiquitin stress and proteasome stress. These results show that homeostatic control of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway can be achieved through signal-dependent, subunit-specific regulation of the proteasome, and indicate a dual role of Ubp6 in regulating ubiquitin levels and proteasome function.

Ubiquitin is a highly conserved, 76 residue protein which can be conjugated posttranslationally to other proteins via an isopeptide linkage between glycine-76 of ubiquitin and, most typically, the ɛ-amino group of a lysine within the target protein. Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysines, allowing the formation of ubiquitin-ubiquitin polymers. Posttranslational modification by ubiquitin is utilized in a number of cellular pathways, but the role of ubiquitin in selective, intracellular protein degradation remains its best-understood function. In this pathway, ubiquitin modification serves as the recognition motif for a large multisubunit protease, known as the proteasome, which renders proteins into small polypeptides. Initial identification of the ubiquitin genes revealed an unusual mode of synthesis. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, ubiquitin is encoded by four genes. Three of these genes (UBI1-3) encode fusions of ribosomal proteins to the C terminus of ubiquitin (Ozkaynak et al., 1987Ozkaynak E. Finley D. Solomon M.J. Varshavsky A. The yeast ubiquitin genes: a family of natural gene fusions.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The final ubiquitin gene, UBI4, contains five head-to-tail repeats of ubiquitin (Ozkaynak et al., 1987Ozkaynak E. Finley D. Solomon M.J. Varshavsky A. The yeast ubiquitin genes: a family of natural gene fusions.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In all cases, the generation of free ubiquitin requires the translation of a fusion protein, an unusual event in eukaryotes, followed by posttranslational cleavage of ubiquitin at its C terminus, a reaction carried out by one or more members of a family of proteases known as deubiquitinating enzymes. Transcriptional control of ubiquitin is highly regulated. Under normal growth conditions, the bulk of cellular ubiquitin is provided by UBI1-3. Stress conditions, such as heat shock, stimulate induction of UBI4 (Ozkaynak et al., 1987Ozkaynak E. Finley D. Solomon M.J. Varshavsky A. The yeast ubiquitin genes: a family of natural gene fusions.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, Finley et al., 1987Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. The yeast polyubiquitin gene is essential for resistance to high temperatures, starvation, and other stresses.Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Transcription of ubiquitin genes is stimulated by a wide variety of cellular stresses in addition to heat shock, and is controlled by a number of distinct transcriptional pathways (Watt and Piper, 1997Watt R. Piper P.W. UBI4, the polyubiquitin gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a heat shock gene that is also subject to catabolite derepression control.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Simon et al., 1999Simon J.R. Treger J.M. McEntee K. Multiple independent regulatory pathways control UBI4 expression after heat shock in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The complexity of regulation of ubiquitin biosynthesis likely reflects the myriad roles of ubiquitin in cellular biology, and the need for precise control over ubiquitin levels for cellular homeostasis. Ubiquitin is among the most physically stable proteins known, and remains properly folded at temperatures up to 85°C and between a pH range of 1 and 13 (Lenkinski et al., 1977Lenkinski R.E. Chen D.M. Glickson J.D. Goldstein G. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the denaturation of ubiquitin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 494: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). That ubiquitin displays a significant rate of turnover is therefore intriguing. Early studies in mammalian cells observed that under nutrient-rich conditions, the bulk of ubiquitin degradation was nonlysosomal and ATP-dependent (Haas and Bright, 1987Haas A.L. Bright P.M. The dynamics of ubiquitin pools within cultured human lung fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 345-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Hiroi and Rechsteiner, 1992Hiroi Y. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin metabolism in HeLa cells starved of amino acids.FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 156-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This degradation is mediated by the proteasome, as more recent studies have demonstrated (Ryu et al., 2006Ryu K.Y. Baker R.T. Kopito R.R. Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 as a tool for quantification of total ubiquitin levels in biological specimens.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 353: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Significant ubiquitin turnover has also been observed in yeast, where the half-life of ubiquitin has been estimated to be less than 2 hr (Hanna et al., 2003Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Ubiquitin depletion as a key mediator of toxicity by translational inhibitors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The crucial role of the proteasome in ubiquitin turnover is emphasized by a yeast mutant lacking the UBP6 gene, which encodes a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme. In the absence of this protein, the half-life of ubiquitin is dramatically reduced, and ubp6Δ cells rapidly become deficient in steady-state ubiquitin levels, a feature which hypersensitizes such cells to a wide variety of chemical and environmental stresses (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52102-52115Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ubp6 uses its catalytic activity to remove ubiquitin from proteasome substrates (Hanna et al., 2006Hanna J. Hathaway N.A. Tone Y. Crosas B. Elsasser S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Leggett D.S. Gygi S.P. King R.W. Finley D. Deubiquitinating enzyme ubp6 functions noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation.Cell. 2006; 127: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and some fraction of this ubiquitin, despite its physical stability, is apparently readily unfolded by proteasomes and destroyed along with substrate in the absence of Ubp6. It has been assumed that the maintenance of cellular ubiquitin levels is regulated primarily at the level of synthesis. We demonstrate here a regulatory pathway that controls cellular levels of ubiquitin by modulating processes of deubiquitination and protein degradation. The cellular abundance of Ubp6 is sensitive to the levels of cellular ubiquitin: under conditions of ubiquitin depletion, Ubp6 abundance increases, and when ubiquitin levels are restored by exogenous expression, Ubp6 levels return to baseline. Ubiquitin-dependent upregulation of Ubp6 results in greater loading of proteasomes with Ubp6, presumably resulting in greater efficiency of ubiquitin recycling at the proteasome. Intriguingly, a catalytically inactive mutant of Ubp6 (ubp6-C118A) triggers the induction of Ubp6, owing to cellular ubiquitin deficiency, but in contrast to the ubp6 null mutant, ubp6-C118A also displays a general upregulation of total proteasome levels that is independent of ubiquitin levels, likely reflecting a previously described noncatalytic function of Ubp6 in proteasome inhibition (Hanna et al., 2006Hanna J. Hathaway N.A. Tone Y. Crosas B. Elsasser S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Leggett D.S. Gygi S.P. King R.W. Finley D. Deubiquitinating enzyme ubp6 functions noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation.Cell. 2006; 127: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Proteasome upregulation in ubp6-C118A mutants is mediated by the transcription factor Rpn4, and loss of proteasome compensation by Rpn4 results in a severe growth defect. However, ubiquitin-dependent induction of Ubp6 appears to be independent of proteasome induction by Rpn4. These results describe an unexpected pathway of cellular regulation, provide evidence for the existence of a cellular ubiquitin sensor, and indicate that despite the sequential and interdependent nature of ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the pathways controlling ubiquitin and proteasome levels are largely independent. We recently generated yeast CEN plasmids expressing wild-type Ubp6 and a catalytically inactive mutant, Ubp6-C118A, from the UBP6 promoter (Hanna et al., 2006Hanna J. Hathaway N.A. Tone Y. Crosas B. Elsasser S. Kirkpatrick D.S. Leggett D.S. Gygi S.P. King R.W. Finley D. Deubiquitinating enzyme ubp6 functions noncatalytically to delay proteasomal degradation.Cell. 2006; 127: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Transformation of ubp6Δ cells with the wild-type plasmid resulted in approximately wild-type expression levels of the Ubp6 protein (Figure 1A). In contrast, ubp6Δ cells harboring the Ubp6-C118A plasmid accumulated significantly higher levels of the mutant protein (Figure 1A; for quantitation, see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). Levels of an unrelated protein, the translation initiation factor eIF5A, were constant throughout, indicating the specificity of these effects (Figure 1A). Two related functions have been ascribed to the catalytic activity of Ubp6: Ubp6 gradually removes ubiquitin from proteasome-bound ubiquitin conjugates, and it prevents or minimizes degradation of ubiquitin by the proteasome. The degradation of ubiquitin by ubp6Δ proteasomes presumably reflects that substrates not subject to deubiquitination by Ubp6 can be unfolded and translocated into the degradation-competent core particle of the proteasome with at least some ubiquitin still attached, resulting in degradation of both substrate and ubiquitin components of the conjugate (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S.

Failure to regenerate ubiquitin in the absence of Ubp6 results in deficient ubiquitin content in ubp6Δ cells, giving rise to hypersensitivity to a variety of chemical, environmental, and genetic stresses (Chernova et al., 2003Chernova T.A. Allen K.D. Wesoloski L.M. Shanks J.R. Chernoff Y.O. Wilkinson K.D. Pleiotropic effects of Ubp6 loss on drug sensitivities and yeast prion are due to depletion of the free ubiquitin pool.J. Biol.

Ubiquitin depletion as a key mediator of toxicity by translational inhibitors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitin recycling by Ubp6 requires its catalytic function, ubp6-C118A mutants largely recapitulate the ubiquitin deficiency of the null mutant (Figure 1A). We therefore hypothesized that accumulation of the Ubp6-C118A protein might reflect a cellular response to ubiquitin deficiency. This model predicts that a correction of ubiquitin levels should restore Ubp6-C118A levels to normal, even without restoration of Ubp6's catalytic activity. Indeed, when ubiquitin levels were increased by expressing a synthetic ubiquitin gene in this strain, the difference in abundance of Ubp6 and Ubp6-C118A levels was minimized (Figure 1B). The plasmid-borne ubiquitin expression construct was chosen to correct ubiquitin levels without dramatically overexpressing ubiquitin (see Experimental Procedures), thus enhancing the likelihood of identifying regulatory pathways that operate in a physiological fluctuation range of ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is conjugated posttranslationally to other proteins, but is also known to bind a variety of proteins in a noncovalent fashion. To determine whether conjugation of ubiquitin was necessary for the downregulation of Ubp6-C118A levels, we utilized a mutant of ubiquitin lacking its final two glycine residues, which are required for conjugation (hereafter referred to as ubiquitin-desGlyGly; Arnason and Ellison, 1994Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Stress resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is strongly correlated with assembly of a novel type of multiubiquitin chain.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast to results obtained with wild-type ubiquitin, ubiquitin-desGlyGly was unable to restore levels of Ubp6-C118A to those seen with wild-type Ubp6 (Figure 1C). The inability of ubiquitin-desGlyGly to influence Ubp6 levels could not be attributed to low expression levels of the mutant ubiquitin. Indeed, when ubiquitin-desGlyGly was expressed in ubp6Δ and ubp6-C118A cells, the resulting total free ubiquitin content was comparable to that of endogenous ubiquitin in a wild-type cell (Figure 1C). These data suggest that ubiquitin conjugation is required for the pathway of ubiquitin-dependent regulation of Ubp6, and the implications of this finding are discussed in more detail below. We next sought evidence that the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of Ubp6-C118A reflected a physiological cellular response. Were this the case, one would expect an induction of wild-type, endogenous Ubp6 in response to cellular ubiquitin deficiency that does not derive from impaired Ubp6 function. To test this model, we employed two independent ubiquitin-deficient yeast mutants: doa4Δ and ubi1-3Δ (Swaminathan et al., 1999Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. The Doa4 deubiquitinating enzyme is required for ubiquitin homeostasis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Hanna et al., 2003Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Ubiquitin depletion as a key mediator of toxicity by translational inhibitors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). DOA4, like UBP6, encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme. However, the ubiquitin deficiency in doa4Δ mutants is suppressed by mutations in vacuolar proteases, suggesting that the site of aberrant ubiquitin degradation is the vacuole (Swaminathan et al., 1999Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. The Doa4 deubiquitinating enzyme is required for ubiquitin homeostasis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), rather than the proteasome, as seen for ubp6Δ (Hanna et al., 2003Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Ubiquitin depletion as a key mediator of toxicity by translational inhibitors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Chernova et al., 2003Chernova T.A. Allen K.D. Wesoloski L.M. Shanks J.R. Chernoff Y.O. Wilkinson K.D. Pleiotropic effects of Ubp6 loss on drug sensitivities and yeast prion are due to depletion of the free ubiquitin pool.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52102-52115Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ubi1-3Δ mutant lacks three of the four ubiquitin genes, but the ribosomal portions of these fusion proteins are supplied on plasmids, as they are essential for viability (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data). Upon examination of the doa4Δ and ubi1-3Δ mutants, we observed increased levels of endogenous Ubp6 protein (Figure 2A). To confirm that increased Ubp6 levels in the ubp6-C118A, doa4Δ, and ubi1-3Δ mutants was due specifically to the ubiquitin deficiency common to these mutants, and not to some unappreciated common characteristic of the three strains, we employed a yeast mutant in which all endogenous ubiquitin coding elements have been removed and replaced with a single galactose-inducible ubiquitin gene. This strain allows for precise shut-off of ubiquitin synthesis by switching the culture from a galactose-containing medium to one containing glucose. As described previously, cellular ubiquitin levels are rapidly depleted in this strain upon cessation of ubiquitin synthesis, reflecting ubiquitin turnover (Hanna et al., 2003Hanna J. Leggett D.S. Finley D. Ubiquitin depletion as a key mediator of toxicity by translational inhibitors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9251-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar; Figure 2B). In contrast, as ubiquitin levels declined over the course of the experiment, Ubp6 levels rose (Figure 2B). Again, levels of an unrelated control protein, eIF5A, showed no corresponding increase, indicating the specificity of the Ubp6 response. Together, the data of Figure 1 and Figure 2 indicate a robust cellular pathway for regulating Ubp6 that appears to respond precisely and specifically to the amount of ubiquitin in the cell. Ubiquitin deficiency, whether it arises through defects in biosynthesis or through aberrant degradation by either the proteasome or the vacuole, appears to be a sufficient signal for upregulation of Ubp6. A third deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp14, was of interest because of its known role in ubiquitin homeostasis. In contrast to ubp6Δ and doa4Δ mutants, ubp14Δ mutants are not significantly deficient in either free or total ubiquitin; rather, ubp14Δ mutants accumulate unanchored polyubiquitin species (Amerik et al., 1997Amerik A.Y. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. In vivo disassembly of free polyubiquitin chains by yeast Ubp14 modulates rates of protein degradation by the proteasome.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar; see also Figure S2). We examined Ubp6 levels in whole-cell extracts of these mutants, and we were unable to detect significant induction of the Ubp6 protein (Figure S2). In addition to ubp6Δ, other yeast mutants, including ufd3Δ and as described above doa4Δ, are known to be deficient in ubiquitin (Swaminathan et al., 1999Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. The Doa4 deubiquitinating enzyme is required for ubiquitin homeostasis in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Johnson et al., 1995Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. A proteolytic pathway that recognizes ubiquitin as a degradation signal.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether Doa4 or Ufd3 might be subject to a similar pathway of ubiquitin-dependent regulation. We utilized strains bearing TAP-tagged versions of Doa4 and Ufd3, respectively, and rendered these strains ubiquitin deficient by deletion of UBP6. However, we were unable to detect ubiquitin-dependent induction of either TAP-Doa4 (Figure 2C) or TAP-Ufd3 (data not shown), indicating some degree of specificity of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway of Ubp6 induction. The preceding data demonstrate that Ubp6 levels respond sensitively to cellular ubiquitin levels. Whereas previous work has demonstrated that the presence or absence of Ubp6 dramatically affects ubiquitin levels (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52102-52115Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we also sought to determine whether incremental changes in Ubp6 levels could in turn affect cellular ubiquitin abundance. We artificially reduced expression of Ubp6 by removing a large portion of its promoter sequence (Figure 2D). Such promoter truncation also abolished ubiquitin-dependent upregulation of Ubp6 (Figure 2E). When we examined ubiquitin levels in these strains, we observed that reduction in Ubp6 levels was matched with corresponding reduction in free and total ubiquitin levels (Figure 2E, and data not shown). An increase in abundance of Ubp6 protein could be achieved through either an increase in synthesis or a decrease in degradation. To address this point, we followed UBP6 RNA in cells responding to ubiquitin depletion. We utilized the doa4Δ and ubi1-3Δ mutants from Figure 2 and observed a significant increase in wild-type UBP6 RNA levels in both of these mutants, as determined by northern blotting (Figure 3A). Consistent with these findings, when we employed the ubp6-C118A mutant, which is ubiquitin-deficient by virtue of the loss of Ubp6 catalytic activity, we observed increased ubp6-C118A RNA levels as compared with either a wild-type strain or a ubp6Δ strain complemented with the wild-type Ubp6 plasmid (Figure 3B; for quantitation, see Figure S3). These data indicate that the observed ubiquitin-dependent upregulation of Ubp6 protein is mediated, at least in part, at the RNA level. We next sought to determine whether a decrease in the rate of degradation of the Ubp6 protein could also contribute to an increase in Ubp6 levels. To this end, we developed a yeast strain in which the endogenous UBP6 promoter has been replaced by the GAL1 promoter. This allows for precise shut-off of Ubp6 synthesis, analogous to the ubiquitin shut-off described in the experiment of Figure 2B. After cessation of Ubp6 synthesis, we were unable to observe a significant decrease in Ubp6 abundance over a 3 hr time course, indicating that the Ubp6 protein is relatively stable (data not shown). Additionally, studies of the human ortholog of Ubp6, known as Usp14, did not reveal significant turnover of that protein (Borodovsky et al., 2001Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Casagrande R. Overkleeft H.S. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. A novel active site-directed probe specific for deubiquitylating enzymes reveals proteasome association of USP14.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5187-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). It is thought that the major known functions of Ubp6 are carried out at the proteasome because deletion of Ubp6's proteasome binding domain (known as the Ubl domain) recapitulates the null phenotype in every context studied to date (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol.

Furthermore, because Ubp6 is dispensable for the overall structural integrity of the proteasome, its abundance on the proteasome could in principle be varied in response to cellular demands. We therefore sought to determine whether increases in total cellular Ubp6 levels resulted in corresponding increases in the amount of Ubp6 on proteasomes. Proteasomes were affinity purified (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) from the ubiquitin-deficient doa4Δ mutant, and compared to those of wild-type yeast. The overall electrophoretic profiles of the two proteasome preparations were similar (Figure 4A). It is difficult to visualize Ubp6 by standard Coomassie staining because it comigrates electrophoretically with the proteasome subunit Rpn3. However, when we examined the abundance of Ubp6 in these preparations by immunoblotting, we detected an increased amount of Ubp6 in proteasomes from the doa4Δ strain (Figure 4B). This difference was specific for Ubp6, as levels of a different proteasome subunit, Rpn12, were comparable between preparations (Figure 4B). We next examined proteasomes purified from a strain expressing Ubp6-C118A. When compared with proteasomes from either a wild-type strain or a ubp6Δ strain complemented with a wild-type Ubp6 plasmid, proteasomes from the ubp6-C118A mutant displayed a greater amount of Ubp6 protein (Figure 4C; for quantitation, see Figure S4). Again, this result was specific for Ubp6, as other proteasome subunits, such as Rpn12, were not similarly affected (Figure 4C). In the case of Ubp6-C118A, the increase in Ubp6 association with the proteasome appeared to be greater than that associated with proteasomes from the doa4Δ strain. The reason for this difference remains unclear. Because the Ubp6-C118A protein is devoid of catalytic activity, its increased accumulation on proteasomes might reflect a futile and thus more persistent cellular response to restore ubiquitin levels. The data of Figures 4B and 4C indicate that proteasomes from wild-type cells are not saturated with Ubp6. Consistent with this model, when matrix-immobilized purified proteasomes from wild-type cells were challenged with an excess of purified, bacterially produced Ubp6, levels of proteasome-bound Ubp6 increased significantly, with the increase comparable to that seen in Figure 4C (data not shown). Whether the extent of proteasome loading by Ubp6 is controlled by means other than UBP6 gene expression remains to be evaluated. In yeast, the synthesis of proteasome subunits, over 30 in total, is thought to be coordinated through a specific pathway of transcriptional control. All known proteasome genes, including UBP6, contain a cis-acting upstream sequence of eight nucleotides known as the Proteasome-Associated Control Element (PACE) (Mannhaupt et al., 1999Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H.

Although MIG-2 is expressed in many cell types, it is deficient in certain colon cancer cells. Expression of MIG-2, but not of an integrin binding-defective MIG-2 mutant, in MIG-2-null colon cancer cells strengthened cell-matrix adhesion, promoted focal adhesion formation, and reduced cell motility.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Schaller M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F9-F11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R.

Genetic studies have shown that Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-112, a homolog of MIG-2, is required for attachment of body-wall muscle cells to the hypodermis (17Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Gilbert M.M. Williams B.D. Moerman D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Williams B.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Loss of UNC-112 in C. elegans results in an embryonic lethal Pat (paralyzed, arrested elongation at two-fold) phenotype resembling that of α or β integrin loss (17Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Gilbert M.M. Williams B.D. Moerman D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Williams B.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In mammalian organisms, MIG-2 has been detected in many cell types, including fibroblasts, muscle cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 22Gkretsi V. Zhang Y. Tu Y. Chen K. Stolz D.B. Yang Y. Watkins S.C. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these cells, it concentrates at FAs. MIG-2 interacts with migfilin (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), a filamin- and VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)-binding protein (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 21Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Tu Y. Gkretsi V. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12397-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Through this interaction, it recruits migfilin to FAs and provides a link from FAs to the actin cytoskeleton (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although MIG-2 is crucial for recruiting migfilin to FAs, how MIG-2 is recruited to FAs was not known. Structurally, MIG-2 contains an N-terminal region that exhibits no obvious structural motif and a C-terminal FERM domain. Notably, the MIG-2 FERM domain contains a region that shares considerable sequence similarity with the integrin-binding site of the talin FERM domain. Furthermore, kindlin, a protein that shares significant (62%) sequence identity with MIG-2, interacts with β1 and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains (24Kloeker S. Major M.B. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Jones D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6824-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the functions of the kindlin/integrin interaction remain unknown. Cell-ECM adhesion is intimately involved in the regulation of cell behavior such as cell motility. Theoretical consideration and experimental studies have shown that the relationship between cell-ECM adhesion and motility is biphasic (25Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 26Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of cell-ECM adhesion strength is important in the control of cell motility. Consistent with this, alterations of proteins that are pertinent to the control of cell-ECM adhesion are frequently associated with human diseases such as cancer. Determining the molecular basis underlying the regulation of cell-ECM adhesion and migration is therefore of not only general biological importance but also considerable clinical significance. In this work, we show that MIG-2 interacts with β1 and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains and functions as an important regulator of integrin activation, cell-ECM adhesion, and migration. Cells, Antibodies, and Other Reagents—Human SK-LMS-1 cells and HT-1080 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. RKO, HT-29, DLD-1, LoVo, and HCT-116 colon cancer cells were from Dr. Lin Zhang (University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute). Caco-2 colon cancer cells were from Dr. Craig C. Garner (Stanford University). The SK-LMS-1, HT-1080, and RKO cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. HT-29 and DLD-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. LoVo and Caco-2 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 and McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Mouse anti-MIG-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3A3 has been described (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-kindlin mAb (clone 4A5) was generated using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing human kindlin residues 216–677 as an antigen following previously described protocols (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Function-blocking mouse anti-α2 integrin (clone P1E6) and anti-β1 integrin (clone 6S6) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-vinculin mAb was from Sigma. Rhodamine Red™-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Ab) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cell culture media were from Sigma or Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Fisher or Sigma. Mutagenesis, DNA Constructs, and Transfection—The vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MIG-2 has been described (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into MIG-2 coding sequence as specified in each experiment using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). DNA fragments encoding MIG-2 deletion mutants were generated by PCR. DNA fragments encoding MIG-2 mutants were inserted into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected with vectors encoding GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant MIG-2 or GFP alone as a control using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—The vectors encoding GST fusion proteins containing the β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain (residues 775–786), the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain (residues 716–762), or a mutant form of the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain in which Tyr747 was substituted with Ala were generated as described previously (27Li J. Mayne R. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Ma Y.-Q. Yang J. Pesho M.M. Vinogradova O. Qin J. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6656-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The vectors were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Expression of GST and GST fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial cells were lysed with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EDTA (STE buffer) containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme for 15 min (on ice), followed by sonication in STE buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5% Sarkosyl, and protease inhibitors. After the cell debris was removed by centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation, washed three times with STE buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and used for GST pulldown assays as we described previously (20Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Brief, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, SK-LMS-1 cells, or SK-LMS-1 cells transfected with vectors encoding GFP or GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant MIG-2 were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.1) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (lysis buffer). The lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST or GST-integrin cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins for 4 h or longer at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were precipitated by centrifugation, washed four times with lysis buffer, and then analyzed by Western blotting and Coomassie Blue staining as specified in each experiment. Integrin Activation—The effect of MIG-2 on integrin activation was analyzed using CHO cells stably expressing αIIbβ3 integrin and activation-specific anti-αIIbβ3 integrin mAb PAC1 as described (28Ma Y.-Q. Yang J. Pesho M.M. Vinogradova O. Qin J. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6656-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 integrin were transfected with GFP-tagged MIG-2, the GFP-tagged talin head domain (talin-H; residues 1–429), or GFP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested; suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution/bovine serum albumin (BSA); and stained with mAb PAC1 (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor® 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM Ab for 30 min on ice. After washing, the cells were fixed and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. mAb PAC1 binding was analyzed only on a gated subset of cells positive for GFP expression (i.e. GFP- or GFP fusion protein-expressing cells). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI; generated with CellQuest software) of mAb PAC1 bound to the GFP-MIG-2- or GFP-talin-H-expressing cells was divided by the MFI of mAb PAC1 bound to the control GFP-expressing cells in the same experiment to obtain a relative MFI value. Seven independent experiments were performed, and the relative MFI in each experimental set, GFP-MIG-2 or GFP-talin-H, were compared with the MFI of the GFP control by a paired t test to determine statistical significance. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Adenoviral Vectors and Infection—Adenoviral vectors encoding wild-type or mutant MIG-2 were generated using the AdEasy system following a previously described protocol (29Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Guo L. Wu C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIG-2 coding sequences were cloned into the NotI/XbaI sites of the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector. The resultant plasmids were linearized with PmeI, purified, and mixed with supercoiled pAdEasy-1. The vectors were transferred into E. coli BJ5183 by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator. Recombinants that were resistant to kanamycin were selected, and recombination was confirmed by PacI digestion. The positive plasmids were then transformed into DH5α by heat shock for large-scale amplification. The plasmid DNAs were digested with PacI, ethanol-precipitated, and used to transfect 293 cells with Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). The transfectants were harvested ∼10 days after transfection. The cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing in a methanol/dry ice bath and rapid thawing at 37 °C, and the lysates containing the recombinant adenovirus were collected. The control adenoviral expression vector encoding β-galactosidase was kindly provided by Drs. Tong-Chuan He and Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). Adenoviral vectors were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation as described (31Kolls J. Peppel K. Silva M. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and then used to infect cells. The infection efficiency was monitored by the expression of GFP encoded by the viral vectors. The percentage of GFP-positive cells typically reached 80–90% within 1 day after infection. Overexpression of wild-type or mutant MIG-2 in the infected cells was confirmed by Western blotting. FA Localization of GFP-tagged MIG-2—SK-LMS-1 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant MIG-2. One day after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips, and cultured for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with anti-vinculin mAb and Rhodamine Red™-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab, and observed under a Leica DMR fluorescence microscope equipped with GFP and rhodamine filters. Cell-ECM Adhesion—Cell-ECM adhesion was assessed by centrifugation assays either at 4 °C (to measure initial cell-ECM adhesion, which is controlled primarily by integrin ligand-binding activity) or after incubation of the cells at 37 °C (to allow cytoskeletal strengthening) as described previously (16McClay D.R. Hertzler P.L. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003: 9.2.1-9.2.10Google Scholar). For CHO cells, the cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP-MIG-2, GFP-talin-H (as a positive control), or GFP (as a negative control) using Lipofectamine PLUS. Thirty-six hours after DNA transfection, the transfectants (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in fibrinogen-coated 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One). GFP-positive cells were quantified by measuring fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, with a GENios Pro fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan). The plates were tightly sealed with sealing films (USA Scientific, Inc.) and centrifuged with a Sorvall RT7 Plus centrifuge equipped with a microplate carrier at 600 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C to facilitate cell settlement. The plates were then inverted and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. The transfectants that remained adhered were quantified by measuring fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Cell adhesion was calculated as the fluorescence reading at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, after inverted centrifugation divided by the fluorescence reading at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, before inverted centrifugation. The adhesion of the cells expressing wild-type or mutant MIG-2 was compared with that of the control GFP cells (normalized to 1). Student's t test was used for statistical analyses. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For SK-LMS-1 cells, the cells were infected with the control β-galactosidase adenovirus or adenoviruses encoding wild-type MIG-2 or mutants. One day after infection, the cells (5 × 104/well) were seeded in collagen I-coated 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One). The GFP-positive adenovirus-infected cells were quantified by measuring fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, with the GENios Pro fluorescence microplate reader. The plates were tightly sealed and centrifuged with the Sorvall RT7 Plus centrifuge equipped with a microplate carrier at 600 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to facilitate cell settlement. To analyze initial cell adhesion, the plates were inverted and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. To analyze cytoskeletal strengthened cell adhesion, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then inverted and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 12 min at 37 °C. The adenovirus-infected cells that remained adhered were quantified by measuring fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Cell adhesion was calculated as described above. The adhesion of the cells expressing wild-type or mutant MIG-2 was compared with that of the control β-galactosidase cells (normalized to 1). Student's t test was used for statistical analyses. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For RKO cells, the cells were infected with β-galactosidase adenovirus or adenoviruses encoding wild-type or mutant MIG-2. Two days after the infection, the cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in collagen I-coated 96-well plates, and the GFP-positive adenovirus-infected cells were quantified as described above. The plates were sealed and centrifuged with a Sorvall RTH750 centrifuge at 600 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. To analyze initial cell adhesion, the plates were inverted and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. To analyze cytoskeletal strengthened cell adhesion, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then inverted and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 3 min at 37 °C. The amount of the adenovirus-infected cells that remained adhered was quantified by measuring fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Cell adhesion and statistics were calculated as described above. In some experiments, SK-LMS-1 and RKO cells were preincubated with function-blocking mouse anti-β1 integrin mAb (clone 6S6; 6.7 μg/ml IgG), function-blocking mouse anti-α2 integrin mAb (clone P1E6; 6.7 μg/ml IgG), or control mouse IgG Ab (6.7 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. Integrin-mediated initial cell adhesion was then analyzed as described above. To assess FA formation, SK-LMS-1 or RKO cells infected with the control β-galactosidase adenovirus or adenoviruses encoding wild-type or mutant MIG-2 were plated on coverslips and cultured as specified in each experiment. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with mouse anti-vinculin mAb and Rhodamine Red™-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Ab, and observed under the Leica DMR fluorescence microscope. Cell Migration—Cell migration was analyzed using Transwell cell motility chambers as described (32Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, the undersurfaces of the 8-mm pore diameter cell motility chambers (BD Biosciences) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. The cells were trypsinized 24 h after adenoviral infection and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were suspended in 0.2 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA and added to the upper chambers. After incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere for the periods of time specified in each experiment, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed. The membranes were fixed, and the cells on the undersurface were stained with Gill's hematoxylin III. The cells from five randomly selected microscopic fields were counted. The number of MIG-2- or Q614A/W615A mutant-overexpressing cells that migrated through the membrane pores was compared with the number of control β-galactosidase cells (normalized to 100%). Molecular Modeling—The primary sequences of MIG-2 and talin were aligned using the ClustalW program, which predicted a considerable MIG-2 FERM F3 sequence. A homology model of the MIG-2 FERM F3-free form was constructed using the SWISS-MODEL modeling server (34Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar), which adapted the atomic coordinates of the talin FERM domain (Protein Data Bank code 1Y19) as a template. The β1A integrin peptide model was generated using the coordinates of β3 integrin bound to talin F3 (Protein Data Bank code 1MK9), the side chains of which were replaced with the β1A integrin sequences, and then refined using the program CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The docking model of the complex between MIG-2 F3 and β1A or β3 integrin was constructed according to the atomic coordinates of the talin F3/β3 integrin interaction observed in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Model inspection and analysis of the MIG-2 F3 subdomain·β1A integrin complex were performed using the TURBO-FRODO program (36Roussel A. Cambileau C. TURBO-FRODO in Silicon Graphics Geometry. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, California1991Google Scholar). The figure was generated using the PyMOL program (37DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). MIG-2 Interacts with β1 and β3 Integrin Cytoplasmic Domains—To test whether MIG-2 interacts with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, we incubated lysates of MIG-2-expressing mammalian cells with GST or GST fusion protein containing the β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain (residues 775–786; referred to as GST-β1). GST, GST-β1 fusion protein, and associated proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Western blot analyses showed that MIG-2 was readily coprecipitated with GST-β1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3) but not with GST (lane 2). The presence of GST and GST-β1 in the precipitates was confirmed by staining the membrane with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B). In additional control experiments, no protein bands in the GST-β1 fusion protein preparation were recognized by anti-MIG-2 Ab in the absence of cell lysates (Fig. 1A, lane 4), confirming the specificity of the Western blotting. The β3 integrin tail shares considerable sequence similarity with the β1 integrin tail. To test whether MIG-2 recognizes the β3 integrin tail, we incubated the cell lysates with GST fusion protein containing the β3 integrin tail (residues 716–762; referred to as GST-β3) and analyzed MIG-2 binding by the GST pulldown assay. The results show that MIG-2 was readily coprecipitated with GST-β3 (Fig. 1, C and D, lanes 3) but not with GST (lanes 2). In control experiments, no protein bands in the GST-β3 fusion protein preparation were recognized by anti-MIG-2 Ab in the absence of cell lysates (Fig. 1, C and D, lanes 4). These results suggest that MIG-2 interacts with both β1 and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains. Structure-based Mutagenesis Identifies a Single Integrin-binding Site within the MIG-2 FERM Domain—MIG-2 contains multiple protein-binding motifs, including a C-terminal FERM domain. To facilitate studies aimed at determining the functions of the MIG-2/integrin interaction, we sought to identify the MIG-2 site(s) that are involved in integrin binding. The F3 subdomain within the MIG-2 FERM domain shares considerable sequence similarity with the F3 subdomain of the talin FERM domain, i"

We show here that a transient network formed by the innexin gap-junction protein NSY-5 coordinates left-right asymmetry in the developing nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. nsy-5 is required for the left and right AWC olfactory neurons to establish stochastic, asymmetric patterns of gene expression during embryogenesis. nsy-5-dependent gap junctions in the embryo transiently connect the AWC cell bodies with those of numerous other neurons. Both AWCs and several other classes of nsy-5-expressing neurons participate in signaling that coordinates left-right AWC asymmetry. The right AWC can respond to nsy-5 directly, but the left AWC requires nsy-5 function in multiple cells of the network. NSY-5 forms hemichannels and intercellular gap-junction channels in Xenopus oocytes, consistent with a combination of cell-intrinsic and network functions. These results provide insight into gap-junction activity in developing circuits. Gap junctions are widespread in immature neuronal circuits, but their functional significance is poorly understood.

NSY-5 forms hemichannels and intercellular gap-junction channels in Xenopus oocytes, consistent with a combination of cell-intrinsic and network functions. These results provide insight into gap-junction activity in developing circuits. Developing neurons and other embryonic cell types are often connected by gap junctions, intercellular channels that allow the direct transfer of electrical signals and small molecules between coupled cells (Bennett and Zukin, 2004Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Electrical coupling and neuronal synchronization in the mammalian brain.Neuron. 2004; 41: 495-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). A gap junction is formed by aligned homotypic or heterotypic half-junctions on two adjacent cells and can be composed of either connexins, which are present only in chordates, or innexins or pannexins, which are present in all metazoa. Developing neurons in the vertebrate spinal cord, retina, and cortex are interconnected by gap junctions that fade away later in life (Kandler and Katz, 1995Kandler K. Katz L.C. Neuronal coupling and uncoupling in the developing nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The connected neurons form functional domains with coordinated patterns of spontaneous activity and intracellular calcium flux (Yuste et al., 1995Yuste R. Nelson D.A. Rubin W.W. Katz L.C. Neuronal domains in developing neocortex: mechanisms of coactivation.Neuron. 1995; 14: 7-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Transient gap-junction networks have been proposed to regulate proliferation, migration, cell death, contact inhibition, and synapse formation and/or elimination, but there is little direct evidence of their function. Their best understood role is in developing motor neurons, where they potentiate the synaptic refinement that leads to the selection of a single input neuron per muscle fiber (Chang et al., 1999Chang Q. Gonzalez M. Pinter M.J. Balice-Gordon R.J. Gap junctional coupling and patterns of connexin expression among neonatal rat lumbar spinal motor neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10813-10828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in gap-junction genes eliminate certain chemical synapses in the Drosophila optic lamina, suggesting that signals for synapse formation may pass through gap junctions (Curtin et al., 2002Curtin K.D. Zhang Z. Wyman R.J. Gap junction proteins expressed during development are required for adult neural function in the Drosophila optic lamina.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7088-7096PubMed Google Scholar). Gap junctions link the earliest born nonneuronal cells in embryos and are essential for C. elegans, Drosophila, and mammalian embryogenesis (Phelan, 2005Phelan P.

Lo C.W. Connexins and cell signaling in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 811-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The first detectable left-right asymmetry of the body axis in frog and chick embryos is generated by gap junctions (Levin and Mercola, 1999Levin M. Mercola M. Gap junction-mediated transfer of left-right patterning signals in the early chick blastoderm is upstream of Shh asymmetry in the node.Development. 1999; 126: 4703-4714PubMed Google Scholar). This asymmetry predicts the laterality of the Shh and BMP signaling pathways that generate asymmetry in internal organs. Both invariant and random left-right asymmetries are present in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Hobert et al., 2002Hobert O. Johnston Jr., R.J. Chang S. Left-right asymmetry in the nervous system: the Caenorhabditis elegans model.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most left-right asymmetries are tightly coupled to the body axis, but left-right differences between the AWC olfactory neurons, which are distinguished as AWCON or AWCOFF based on whether or not they express the reporter str-2::GFP, are stochastic. Each animal generates one AWCON neuron and one AWCOFF neuron, but half of the animals express str-2 in the right AWC neuron while the other half express str-2 in the left AWC (Troemel et al., 1999Troemel E.R.

Cell-killing experiments suggest that AWCOFF is the default state and that induction of AWCON requires an interaction between the AWC neurons. Genetic studies of symmetric mutants with two AWCON or two AWCOFF neurons have defined a calcium-dependent kinase cascade that regulates AWC asymmetry near the time of synapse formation, including a voltage-activated calcium channel, the calcium-dependent kinase CaMKII, and a MAP kinase cassette (Chuang and Bargmann, 2005Chuang C.F.

The earliest signaling molecule in this cascade is NSY-4, a transmembrane protein related to vertebrate claudin adhesion proteins and regulatory γ subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels (VanHoven et al., 2006VanHoven M.K. Bauer Huang S.L. Albin S.D. Bargmann C.I.

Axon guidance mutants disrupt AWC asymmetry, but classical synaptic communication is not essential, suggesting that a different kind of cell communication is involved (Troemel et al., 1999Troemel E.R. Sagasti A. Bargmann C.I. Lateral signaling mediated by axon contact and calcium entry regulates asymmetric odorant receptor expression in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 99: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Here we analyze the signaling between AWC neurons by characterizing an AWC asymmetry gene, nsy-5, that encodes a member of the innexin/pannexin family of gap-junction proteins. We show that AWC neurons belong to a transient neuronal network connected by nsy-5-dependent junctions and that this network coordinates communication between AWCOFF, AWCON, and other neurons to generate left-right asymmetry. nsy-5(ky634) was identified in a genetic screen for mutants that do not express str-2::GFP in either AWC cell (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure 2A). This 2 AWCOFF phenotype can be caused by mutations that affect general AWC fate, axon guidance, signaling between AWC neurons, or activity-dependent maintenance of the str-2::GFP reporter (Troemel et al., 1999Troemel E.R. Sagasti A. Bargmann C.I. Lateral signaling mediated by axon contact and calcium entry regulates asymmetric odorant receptor expression in C. elegans.Cell. 1999; 99: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). AWC fate appeared to be normal in nsy-5(ky634) mutants based on the bilateral expression of the AWC marker odr-1::DsRed, and the same marker revealed apparently normal AWC axons, dendrites, and cilia (Figure 1D). The str-2::GFP expression defect was observed at all developmental stages, unlike the late-onset defect in the maintenance mutants (Troemel et al., 1999Troemel E.R. Sagasti A. Bargmann C.I.

These results suggest that nsy-5 affects the establishment of left-right asymmetry of AWC neurons.Figure 2nsy-5 Antagonizes Calcium and Kinase SignalingShow full caption(A) AWC phenotypes in single and double mutants.

Bargmann C.I. C. elegans odour discrimination requires asymmetric diversity in olfactory neurons.Nature. 2001; 410: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). These results support the idea that nsy-5 mutants have one or more functional AWCOFF neurons but no functional AWCON neurons. nsy-5(ky634) was mapped to a small interval on the first chromosome, and the mutant phenotype was rescued with an 18 kb PCR product of genomic DNA containing only one full-length open reading frame, T16H5.1/inx-19 (Figure 3, row 1). T16H5.1 encodes two innexin-related proteins with alternative N termini derived from alternative promoters (www.wormbase.org) (Figures 1F and 1G). Like other innexin proteins, NSY-5 is predicted to have four transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini (Figure 1F). There are 25 predicted innexin/pannexin-encoding genes in C. elegans, 8 in Drosophila melanogaster, and 3 in the human genome (Phelan, 2005Phelan P.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2459-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although most vertebrate gap junctions are formed by the unrelated connexin family, the human pannexin (innexin-like) proteins also form gap junctions (Bruzzone et al., 2003Bruzzone R. Hormuzdi S.G. Barbe M.T. Herb A. Monyer H. Pannexins, a family of gap junction proteins expressed in brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13644-13649Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The nsy-5(ky634) allele was associated with a G→A point mutation, resulting in a predicted glutamic-acid-to-lysine change in the second exon of both T16H5.1 isoforms (Figures 1F and 1G). nsy-5(tm1896), an in-frame deletion in the third and fourth exons of both T16H5.1 isoforms (generously provided by S. Mitani), caused a strong 2 AWCOFF phenotype, as did RNA interference of the T16H5.1 gene (Figure 1C; Figure 2A). These results suggest that nsy-5(ky634) and nsy-5(tm1896) are loss-of-function alleles of T16H5.1 and that reduction of nsy-5 function leads to a 2 AWCOFF phenotype. Overexpression of a genomic nsy-5 fragment in a wild-type background generated a 2 AWCON phenotype opposite to the nsy-5 loss-of-function phenotype (Figure 2A; Figure 3, row 17). Transgenes expressing either alternative transcript of T16H5.1 as a cDNA also rescued nsy-5 mutants and caused a gain-of-function phenotype (Figure 2A; Figure 3, rows 2–4 and 18). These results indicate that the level of nsy-5 activity can specify AWC asymmetry in an instructive manner, with a low level of nsy-5 activity defining the AWCOFF state and a high level of activity defining the AWCON state. The relationship between nsy-5 and other genes affecting AWC asymmetry was characterized by analyzing double mutants (Figure 2A). The 2 AWCOFF phenotype of nsy-5 mutants was suppressed by mutations in the calcium-channel genes unc-2 (α1 subunit) and unc-36 (α2δ subunit) and by mutations in the downstream kinase pathway: unc-43 (CaMKII), tir-1 (SARM/adaptor protein), and nsy-1 (ASK1/MAPKKK). These results suggest that nsy-5 acts upstream of the calcium signaling pathway. The 2 AWCOFF phenotype of the axon guidance mutant unc-76 was suppressed in unc-76(lf);nsy-5(OE) double mutants, suggesting that nsy-5 activity does not require the signal provided by axon guidance. Like nsy-5, the claudin/calcium channel γ subunit nsy-4 antagonizes unc-2 and unc-36 by acting either upstream of or parallel to the calcium-channel pathway (VanHoven et al., 2006VanHoven M.K. Bauer Huang S.L. Albin S.D. Bargmann C.I. The claudin superfamily protein nsy-4 biases lateral signaling to generate left-right asymmetry in C. elegans olfactory neurons.Neuron. 2006; 51: 291-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both nsy-5(OE) nsy-4(lf) and nsy-5(lf) nsy-4(OE) double mutants had a mixed phenotype compared to single mutants, suggesting that nsy-4 and nsy-5 act in parallel, with each having some activity in the absence of the other. This interpretation is tentative because the strongest nsy-4 mutation causes substantial lethality and may not be a null allele, and null alleles might in principle be fully epistatic to nsy-5. With that qualification, one possible model is that both nsy-4 and nsy-5 inhibit the calcium-channel pathway during AWC signaling (Figure 2E). The downstream AWC signaling proteins UNC-43(CaMKII) and TIR-1 reside together at postsynaptic regions of AWC axons (Chuang and Bargmann, 2005Chuang C.F. Bargmann C.I. A Toll-interleukin 1 repeat protein at the synapse specifies asymmetric odorant receptor expression via ASK1 MAPKKK signaling.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Rongo and Kaplan, 1999Rongo C. Kaplan J.M. CaMKII regulates the density of central glutamatergic synapses in vivo.Nature. 1999; 402: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although both wild-type and nsy-5(lf) animals had UNC-43+TIR-1+ puncta in their AWC axons, the numbers of puncta were significantly different. Wild-type animals had an average of 4.7 UNC-43+TIR-1+ puncta per animal (n = 16), whereas nsy-5(lf) animals had 6.5 puncta per animal (n = 11) (Figures 2B–2D). These results are consistent with an inhibitory relationship between nsy-5 and the UNC-43/MAPK pathway. No molecular interaction was evident between nsy-4 and nsy-5: the expression and localization of tagged NSY-4::GFP were unaltered in nsy-5 mutants, and the expression and localization of NSY-5::GFP were unaltered in nsy-4 mutants (data not shown). A GFP reporter transgene with 5.8 kb of the nsy-5 promoter was expressed exclusively in sensory neurons and interneurons in the head and tail (Figures 4A and 4B). The neurons that expressed nsy-5::GFP included AWC, ASH, AFD, ASI, ADL, ASK, BAG, AWB, and ADF (head sensory neurons); ADA, AIZ, RIC, AIY, and AIM (head interneurons); PHA and PHB (tail sensory neurons); and PVC and PVQ (tail interneurons). Expression began about halfway through embryogenesis, was strongest in late embryogenesis and the L1 larval stage, and faded thereafter. Adults maintained weak expression in several neurons, including ASH but not AWC (Figure 4C). Tagged NSY-5::GFP and NSY-5::DsRed fusion proteins that rescued nsy-5 mutants were first detected in embryos in a punctate pattern surrounding the sensory neurons and interneurons that expressed nsy-5::GFP (Figure 3; Figures 4D–4F; data not shown). Individual NSY-5 puncta appeared to reside at the borders between neuronal cell bodies (Figure 4F) and were largely excluded from axons and dendrites. The subcellular localization of NSY-5 was examined in COS cells expressing a heterologous NSY-5::EGFP fusion protein. In isolated COS cells, NSY-5::EGFP was observed mainly in intracellular vesicles (Figure 4G). In pairs of COS cells that contacted each other, NSY-5::EGFP clustered at points of cell-cell contact, but only when both cells expressed NSY-5 (Figure 4H). These results suggest that NSY-5 forms homophilic complexes at the plasma membranes of adjacent cells, like other gap-junction proteins. The expression of an innexin gene in AWC was surprising since AWC gap junctions do not appear in the anatomical reconstruction of the adult C. elegans nervous system (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early expression of nsy-5 reporter genes presented a possible resolution for this discrepancy. To search for gap junctions associated with immature AWC neurons, we performed serial-section electron microscopy and examined the AWC neurons of wild-type embryos between 7 and 12 hr after fertilization, the time at which nsy-5 reporter genes are most highly expressed, and from an L1 larva. We found that embryonic AWC neurons and many other nerve-ring neurons had extensive junctions connecting their cell bodies (Figure 5A). High-resolution analysis of these junctions in the nsy-5-expressing cells AWC, ASH, and AFD revealed that the AWC-ASH and ASH-AFD junctions had the pentalamellar structure, ∼2 nm electron-dense extracellular gap, and 15–16 nm junctional width characteristic of gap junctions in C. elegans and other animals (Figures 5B and 5D; see also Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) (Starich et al., 2003Starich T.A. Miller A. Nguyen R.L. Hall D.H. Shaw J.E. The Caenorhabditis elegans innexin INX-3 is localized to gap junctions and is essential for embryonic development.Dev.

Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Their ultrastructural features were distinct from those of adherens junctions and desmosomes in the same embryos (Figure S1). These results suggest that AWC and neighboring neurons are linked by gap junctions in wild-type embryos. In the wild-type L1 animal, junctions between AWC, ASH, and AFD lacked the pentalamellar electron-dense structure, and the cells became less tightly associated, with an 18–20 nm junctional width (Figure 5C; Table S1A). These observations suggest that AWC junctions are dissolved or remodeled in the L1 stage. Gap junctions were not observed at the cell bodies of the AWC neurons in adult sections from the White series (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). To ask whether the AWC junctions were formed by NSY-5 innexins, we fixed and sectioned two nsy-5(ky634) embryos at the 3-fold-to-pretzel stage and a nsy-5(ky634) L1 larva. In nsy-5 embryos, no pentalamellar electron-dense structure was observed between AWC-ASH or ASH-AFD (Figure 5E), and the distance between these cells was increased to 17.8–18.8 nm (Table S1A). In the same nsy-5(ky634) embryos, the gap junctions between excretory cells and hypodermal cells were intact, indicating that gap junctions were not destroyed by poor fixation (Figure 5G; Table S1B). The nsy-5 L1 animal also lacked AWC gap junctions (Figure 5F; Table S1A). These results suggest that NSY-5 functions as a gap-junction protein to establish transient embryonic connections between the cell bodies of AWC and adjacent neurons. The nsy-5-expressing neurons ASK and ADL belong to left-right pairs that are close to each other at the dorsal midline (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the nsy-5-dependent junctions might directly link left and right clusters of neuronal cell bodies. We examined the entire contact regions for ASK and ADL neurons in two wild-type embryos. In all sections, the cell bodies of the left and right neuron were clearly separated by an extracellular matrix layer at least 15 nm thick, and no gap junctions were observed between the left and right sides (Figure S2). To determine directly whether NSY-5 can form gap-junction channels, we expressed it in Xenopus oocytes. In single oocytes injected with NSY-5 mRNA, slowly activating outward currents were induced by depolarizing steps to positive voltages (Figure 5H; Figure S3). This result suggests that NSY-5 forms functional hemichannels. As seen for connexin hemichannels (Ebihara and Steiner, 1993Ebihara L. Steiner E.

To determine whether NSY-5 can induce the formation of intercellular channels, two RNA-injected oocytes with their vitelline membrane removed were brought into contact. After 24 hr, electrical coupling was detected using the dual two-electrode voltage-clamp technique (Figure 5J; Figure S3). NSY-5 expression resulted in electrical coupling and currents that showed little decline with transjunctional voltage steps, suggesting that they are voltage independent or only weakl"
https://openalex.org/W2042748180,"β-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins that regulate seven transmembrane-spanning receptor (7TMR) desensitization and internalization and also initiate alternative signaling pathways. Studies have shown that β-arrestins undergo a conformational change upon interaction with agonist-occupied, phosphorylated 7TMRs. Although conformational changes have been reported for visual arrestin and β-arrestin2, these studies are not representative of conformational changes in β-arrestin1. Accordingly, in this study, we determine conformational changes in β-arrestin1 using limited tryptic proteolysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis in the presence of a phosphopeptide derived from the C terminus of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp) or the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (V2Rnp). V2Rpp binds specifically to β-arrestin1 causing significant conformational changes, whereas V2Rnp does not alter the conformation of β-arrestin1. Upon V2Rpp binding, we show that the previously shielded Arg393 becomes accessible, which indicates release of the C terminus. Moreover, we show that Arg285 becomes more accessible, and this residue is located in a region of β-arrestin1 responsible for stabilization of its polar core. These two findings demonstrate “activation” of β-arrestin1, and we also show a functional consequence of the release of the C terminus of β-arrestin1 by enhanced clathrin binding. In addition, we show marked protection of the N-domain of β-arrestin1 in the presence of V2Rpp, which is consistent with previous studies suggesting the N-domain is responsible for recognizing phosphates in 7TMRs. A striking difference in conformational changes is observed in β-arrestin1 when compared with β-arrestin2, namely the flexibility of the interdomain hinge region. This study represents the first direct evidence that the “receptor-bound” conformations of β-arrestins1 and 2 are different. β-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins that regulate seven transmembrane-spanning receptor (7TMR) desensitization and internalization and also initiate alternative signaling pathways. Studies have shown that β-arrestins undergo a conformational change upon interaction with agonist-occupied, phosphorylated 7TMRs. Although conformational changes have been reported for visual arrestin and β-arrestin2, these studies are not representative of conformational changes in β-arrestin1. Accordingly, in this study, we determine conformational changes in β-arrestin1 using limited tryptic proteolysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis in the presence of a phosphopeptide derived from the C terminus of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp) or the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (V2Rnp). V2Rpp binds specifically to β-arrestin1 causing significant conformational changes, whereas V2Rnp does not alter the conformation of β-arrestin1. Upon V2Rpp binding, we show that the previously shielded Arg393 becomes accessible, which indicates release of the C terminus. Moreover, we show that Arg285 becomes more accessible, and this residue is located in a region of β-arrestin1 responsible for stabilization of its polar core. These two findings demonstrate “activation” of β-arrestin1, and we also show a functional consequence of the release of the C terminus of β-arrestin1 by enhanced clathrin binding. In addition, we show marked protection of the N-domain of β-arrestin1 in the presence of V2Rpp, which is consistent with previous studies suggesting the N-domain is responsible for recognizing phosphates in 7TMRs. A striking difference in conformational changes is observed in β-arrestin1 when compared with β-arrestin2, namely the flexibility of the interdomain hinge region. This study represents the first direct evidence that the “receptor-bound” conformations of β-arrestins1 and 2 are different. Seven transmembrane-spanning receptors (7TMRs), 3The abbreviations used are: 7TMR, seven transmembrane-spanning receptor; GRK, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase; V2R, human V2 vasopressin receptor; V2Rnp and V2Rpp, synthetic nonphosphopeptide and phosphopeptide, respectively; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GS, glutathione-Sepharose; LC/ESI-MS, liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; AT1aR, angiotensin 1A receptor. or G-protein-coupled receptors, constitute the largest known family of cell-surface receptors. Although individual properties of 7TMRs show some variation, the overall structural and regulatory features appear to be conserved. Fundamental to the regulation of 7TMRs are the families of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins, which facilitate receptor desensitization, clathrin-mediated internalization, and scaffolding of additional signaling processes to 7TMRs (1Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

GRKs are a distinct class of kinases that phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on the C terminus of agonist-occupied 7TMRs. This phosphorylation event facilitates subsequent binding of β-arrestins to 7TMRs, which precludes further interaction of the receptor with G-proteins (desensitization) (2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-352PubMed Google Scholar). The β-arrestins also recruit clathrin and other endocytic elements to 7TMRs, which initiate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of receptors (5Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that β-arrestins also function as adaptor proteins to recruit signaling molecules to activated, phosphorylated 7TMRs thereby initiating a wave of signaling that follows the initial G-protein-dependent signaling (6Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-arrestins 1 and 2 may have different roles in modulating cellular processes, although extant evidence suggests that the two β-arrestin isoforms are structurally very similar. The roles of β-arrestins in 7TMR desensitization, internalization, and signaling are agonist-dependent, which demonstrates that β-arrestins must first interact with agonist-occupied, phosphorylated 7TMRs suggesting that the conformation of “receptor-bound” β-arrestin is required to elicit some of its cellular functions. The arrestin gene family in mammals consists of four members as follows: arrestins 1 and 4 (visual arrestins) and arrestins 2 and 3, also known as β-arrestin1 and -2, respectively. Solved crystal structures of the basal state of visual arrestin1, visual arrestin4, and β-arrestin1 in conjunction with extensive biochemical and mutagenesis studies support the idea that a conformational change occurs in arrestins upon binding activated, phosphorylated 7TMRs (7Carter J.M.

The basal conformations of arrestins are elongated two-domain (N- and C-domain) molecules, and these domains are connected through a 12-residue linker, or hinge, region (Fig. 1A) (16Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that upon “activation” of β-arrestins, the N- and C-domains move relative to one another via flexibility of the hinge region. Two major intramolecular interactions have been suggested to stabilize the basal conformation of arrestins. The first is a series of hydrophobic interactions between α-helix I, β-strand I, and the C terminus of the molecule, which folds back onto the N-domain (Fig. 1B). The second intramolecular interaction that “holds” arrestins in their inactive state is the polar core; a distinctive interaction of five charged residues that are shielded from water and embedded at the fulcrum of the molecule between the N- and C-domains (Fig. 1C). This polar core contains elements of both the N and C termini of arrestins and also a lariat loop region (Arg282-Gly309). The lariat loop plays a central role in stabilizing the polar core because it contains the primary counterion, Asp290, for Arg169 in the polar core. This oop apparently lacks any secondary structure, yet its tertiary structure is virtually identical in both visual arrestin and β-arrestin1 suggesting that its conformation is essential in stabilizing the basal state of arrestins. Studies have suggested that upon binding to 7TMRs, the polar core of arrestins is disrupted, and its C terminus is released (7Carter J.M. Gurevich V.V. Prossnitz E.R. Engen J.R. J. Mol.

The C termini of β-arrestins contain both clathrin- and AP2-binding sites, and exposure of this C terminus is essential for clathrin-mediated receptor internalization (5Krupnick J.G.

Despite evidence for conformational changes in arrestins, no structure for the active, or receptor-bound, conformation has been determined for any arrestin family member. Moreover, conformational studies of arrestins are primarily limited to the visual arrestin system. β-Arrestin1 and -2 are ubiquitously expressed, and their universal regulation of 7TMRs attests to their importance in modulating cellular function. Despite the ubiquitous expression of both β-arrestin1 and -2, recent evidence has suggested that the two isoforms are in fact not functionally redundant. For example, β-arrestin1 is responsible for scaffolding RhoA activation in conjunction with Gαq/11 and also IGF-1 activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (30Barnes W.G. Reiter E. Violin J.D.

Our laboratory has previously reported conformational changes in β-arrestin2 with a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the human V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp) as assessed by limited tryptic proteolysis and MALDI-TOF analysis (29Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Nobles K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55744-55753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using this same approach, we now report that the conformation of β-arrestin1 is also altered upon binding V2Rpp, but in ways that suggest that its activated conformation is different from that of β-arrestin2. Peptide Synthesis—The synthesis of both V2Rnp and V2Rpp have been described elsewhere, and the sequence of both peptides is as follows with phosphorylation sites boldface and underlined: ARGRTPPSLGPQDESCTTASSSLAKDTSS (29Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Nobles K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55744-55753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two other nonspecific synthetic peptides, a 28- and 30-mer, derived from GRK2 were used as controls and have been described previously (29Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Nobles K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Purification of Recombinant Rat β-Arrestin1—Wild type rat β-arrestin1 was subcloned into a pGEX4T1 vector and expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-β-arrestin1). This construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. To overexpress GST-β-arrestin1, cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, and the cultures were then equilibrated to 17 °C. GST-β-arrestin1 expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h, and cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine) to give a 10% slurry (w/w). Cells were lysed with a cell cracker (Microfluidics) and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose (GS) column (GE Healthcare) by gravity and washed with 20 column volumes of column buffer 1 (CB1) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT). The GS resin with GST-β-arrestin1 bound was resuspended in 2 column volumes of CB1, and the GST fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin protease (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) at a mg/mg ratio of 1:1000 of thrombin: GST-β-arrestin1. The thrombin digestion was carried out at 4 °C for 16 h with gentle agitation of the GS resin, and the supernatant was collected followed by two additional washes of the GS resin with CB1. The washes and supernatant were pooled, and the NaCl concentration was diluted dropwise to 50 mm NaCl by the addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. The cleaved β-arrestin1, which contains eight additional amino acids at the N terminus after thrombin cleavage (Fig. 2), was then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Mono-Q column (GE Healthcare) and then eluted with a 50-500 mm linear NaCl gradient. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing β-arrestin1 were pooled and concentrated to 25 mg/ml and then loaded onto a Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column. β-Arrestin1 was eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing β-arrestin1 were pooled and concentrated to 5-25 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Protein purity was >95% as assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the yield was 5 mg/liter of cell culture. Limited Trypsin Proteolysis—In all experiments, except where noted, a 5:1 molar ratio of peptide:β-arrestin was used to assess the effects of peptides on the limited tryptic digestion patterns of β-arrestin1 and -2. Prior to proteolysis, β-arrestins were incubated with ligand (V2Rpp, V2Rnp, 28-mer, 30-mer, or heparin) for 30 min at 4 °C. An average molecular mass of 12,000 Da was used to determine the concentration of heparin (Sigma). l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) to β-arrestin1 ratio of 1:250 was used in all experiments shown; however, ratios of 1:100, 1:500, 1:1,000 and 1:2,000 were also used to assess the effects of the trypsin to β-arrestin1 ratio on the limited proteolysis pattern (data not shown). No proteolysis was seen in experiments containing trypsin:β-arrestin1 ratios of 1:1,000 or 1:2,000. In the case of β-arrestin2, a trypsin to β-arrestin2 ratio of 1:2,000 was used. Higher trypsin concentrations (1:250, 1:500, and 1:1000) were also tested, but these concentrations of trypsin completely digested β-arrestin2. After incubation with ligand, trypsin was added to the β-arrestin:ligand mixture, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for the indicated time points. At each time point, 5 μl (5 μg) of β-arrestin1 or -2 were removed and transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube containing 5 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, and samples were analyzed on 4-20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). For MALDI-TOF analysis, 5 μl of proteolysis sample were transferred to an empty microcentrifuge tube and flash-frozen in liquid N2. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—Spectra were collected in positive-ion mode on a Voyager DE Biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems Inc.) in linear mode using a N2 laser (337 nm). The acceleration voltage, grid voltage, guide wire voltage, delay time, low mass gate, and laser intensity were set to 25 kV, 92.5%, 0.11%, 1200 ns, 10,000 m/z and 2500, respectively. Sixty laser shots were collected for each sample, and the spectra shown represent the sum of these 60 laser shots. Samples for MALDI-TOF MS analysis were thawed on ice and immediately diluted 25-50-fold in matrix solution (45% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 5 mg/ml sinapinic acid) giving a final β-arrestin1 concentration of 2-4 μm before depositing 1 μl of the sample mixture onto the MALDI-TOF target plate (Applied Biosystems). Both internal and external standards were used to calibrate the data. For internal calibration, 1 μl of carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) was deposited on the MALDI-TOF target after the β-arrestin1 sample had dried. Apomyoglobin and aldolase (Sigma) were used as external calibrants and were deposited on empty target spots. Samples were air-dried at room temperature prior to MALDI-TOF analysis. For each limited tryptic digestion, the mean mass and standard deviations were calculated from at least five independent experiments (Table 1). For low abundance peaks, samples were prepared by quenching the tryptic digest with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and samples were then passed through a ZipTip (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were eluted from the ZipTip with matrix solution, and 1 μl was directly deposited on the MALDI-TOF plate. Protein Prospector was used to determine all theoretical trypsin digestion fragments for rat β-arrestin1. The theoretical trypsin digest was compared with experimentally determined masses to assign candidate fragments for each β-arrestin1 fragment observed in the MALDI-TOF spectra (Table 1). The limited proteolytic fragments with only one possible theoretical candidate fragment from Protein Prospector were assigned directly. Fragments with more than one theoretical candidate were assigned by Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognize either the N or C terminus of β-arrestin1 and by determining more accurate masses by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization MS (LC/ESI-MS).TABLE 1Assignment of the limited tryptic proteolytic fragments of β-arrestin1Final assignment of tryptic fragmentsCandidate fragments (theoretical)MALDI-TOF m/z (experimental)Apparent mass by SDS-PAGEConfirmed by ESI-MSPredicted tryptic fragments (amino acid)Predicted m/z within S.D.β-Arrestin1β-Arrestin1 + V2Rnpβ-Arrestin1 + V2RppkDaGly-8-Arg418Gly-8-Arg41847,83047,841 ± 3547,840 ± 4147,853 ± 3248Leu1-Arg418Leu1-Arg41847,00347,022 ± 1946,995 ± 28NA47Gly-8-Arg393Gly-8-Arg39344,993NAaNA indicates not applicableNA45,014 ± 2845+Leu1-Lys40045,007Leu1-Arg393Leu1-Arg39344,165NANA44,181 ± 3044Leu1-Arg363Leu1-Arg36340,74440,739 ± 2440,731 ± 2540,725 ± 2440Leu1-Arg285bRecognized by F4C1Leu1-Arg28532,33532,335 ± 2232,321 ± 2832,342 ± 932Lys107-Arg39532,346G5-R285-?bRecognized by F4C1Lys11-Lys29231,88831,905 ± 4831,900 ± 3731,920 ± 4132Glu50-Arg33131,913Leu1-Arg28231,922Gly5-Arg28531,922Leu108-Arg39331,934Asp26-Lys250bRecognized by F4C1Asp26-Lys25025,73225,742 ± 1725,736 ± 41NA25Val171-Lys40025,737Gln189-Arg41825,752Lys1-Arg188bRecognized by F4C1Glu206-Arg39521,24421,260 ± 1921,262 ± 2321,260 ± 1721+Leu1-Arg18821,270a NA indicates not applicableb Recognized by F4C1 Open table in a new tab LC/ESI-MS—β-Arrestin1 samples were proteolyzed as described above either in the absence of ligand or in the presence of V2Rnp or V2Rpp and flash-frozen in liquid N2 at various time points. Samples were analyzed on a Shimazu LC system (consisting of a solvent degasser, two LC-10A pumps, and an SCL-10A system controller) coupled to a QSTAR XL quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with an electrospray source. LC, with a Vydac C4 reverse phase column (2.1 × 50 mm), was operated at a flow rate of 200 μl/min with a linear gradient as follows: 100% A was held isocratically for 2 min and then linearly increased to 60% B over 18 min and then increased to 100% B over 5 min. Mobile phase A consists of water:acetonitrile (98:2 v/v) with 0.1% acetic acid. Mobile phase B consists of acetonitrile:water (90:10 v/v) with 0.1% acetic acid. The acquisition and deconvolution of ESI mass spectra were performed using the Analyst QS software. Clathrin Binding—To determine the effects of ligand on β-arrestin1 binding to clathrin, 2.5 μm β-arrestin1 was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of a 5:1 molar ratio of ligand:β-arrestin1 in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The β-arrestin1:ligand mixture was diluted to 50 nm β-arrestin1 (500 μl) with binding buffer, and clathrin was subsequently added at a 1:1 molar ratio to the reaction mixture. The reactions were tumbled at 4 °C for 4 h, and then 7 μl of a clathrin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) was added to the mixture and tumbled for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. 14 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) was then added to the mixture and tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 20,000 × g in a benchtop microcentrifuge and washed with 1 ml of binding buffer five times and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. β-Arrestin1 binding to clathrin was measured by Western blot analysis with an anti-β-arrestin1 antibody (A1CT). Samples were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with an anti-clathrin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) to normalize the amount of clathrin for each reaction. Conformational Changes in β-Arrestin1 upon V2Rpp Binding—Recombinant β-arrestin1 was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the primary sequence is shown in Fig. 2. To study conformational changes in β-arrestin1 upon its association with a 7TMR, we employed an in vitro model system utilizing both a phosphopeptide (V2Rpp) and nonphosphopeptide (V2Rnp) corresponding to the C terminus of the human V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R peptide sequences are given under “Experimental Procedures”). β-Arrestin1 was incubated in the absence or presence of ligand (a 5:1 molar ratio of ligand:β-arrestin1 was used in all experiments unless otherwise stated) and then subjected to limited tryptic proteolysis. The proteolysis patterns of β-arrestin1 alone or in the presence of V2Rnp are identical, and we will refer to this digestion pattern as “control pattern” (Fig. 3A, panels I and II). The control pattern in Fig. 3B illustrates that full-length β-arrestin1 (Gly-8-Arg418) has an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa, and the addition of trypsin results in slow, continuous digestion generating fragments with apparent molecular masses of 47, 40, 32, 25, and 21 kDa. The addition of the V2Rpp resulted in a distinct digestion pattern with an accelerated proteolysis of the 40- and 32-kDa species as well as the full-length protein (Fig. 3A, panel III). This new digestion pattern also featur"

Resveratrol, a naturally occurring compound possessing estrogenic activity, is thought to have considerable potential for therapy of osteoporosis. In the present study, resveratrol was found to exhibit bone-protective effects equivalent to those exerted by hormone replacement therapy and decrease the risk of breast cancer in the in vivo and in vitro models. Forkhead proteins were found to be essential for both effects of resveratrol. The bone-protective effect was attributable to induction of bone morphogenetic protein-2 through Src kinase-dependent estrogen receptor activation and FOXA1 is required for resveratrol-induced estrogen receptor-dependent bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression. The tumor-suppressive effects of resveratrol were the consequence of Akt inactivation-mediated FOXO3a nuclear accumulation and activation. Resveratrol is therefore anticipated to be highly effective in management of postmenopausal osteoporosis without an increased risk of breast cancer.

Resveratrol is therefore anticipated to be highly effective in management of postmenopausal osteoporosis without an increased risk of breast cancer. Osteoporosis is a major public health concern and is especially troublesome for menopausal and postmenopausal females who suffer from estrogen deficiency. It is widely believed that osteoporosis results from imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation leading to net bone loss (1Mundy G.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 83: 427S-430SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, hormone replacement therapy has lost favor due to the Women's Health Initiative finding that extended hormone replacement therapy increases the risks of both breast cancer and cardiovascular disease (2Couzin J. Science. 2003; 302: 1136-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The current challenge in prevention or therapy of osteoporosis, therefore, is to identify treatments that share the protective effects of estrogen but lack its side effects. Certain natural dietary substances may act to minimize bone loss in postmenopausal women. The phytoestrogens, therefore, are potentially important in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic phytoalexin compound found in various plants and has been characterized as a phytoestrogen based on its ability to bind to and activate estrogen receptor (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; BMP-2, bone morphogenetic protein-2; OVX, ovariectomized; primary OBs, primary cultured osteoblast cells; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BMD, bone mineral density; TNFα, tumor necrosis factorα; E2, 17β-estradiol; ERE, ER response element; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, short interfering RNA; ERα-binding probe, non-radiolabeled probe; FRE, FOXO-responsive elements; SIR, silent information regulator; IKK, IκB kinase; siRNA, short interference RNA; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.

As a potential antioxidant, resveratrol has been reported to exhibit a wide range of biological and pharmacological properties, including 1) cancer-chemopreventive potential by blocking carcinogenesis at various stages; 2) cardiovascular protection by promoting nitric oxide production, inhibiting platelet aggregation and inflammation, and reducing toxic cholesterol level; and 3) anti-aging potential demonstrated by the effect of increasing the lifespan of yeast and flies. The mechanism studies have indicated that resveratrol acts at multiple levels, such as cellular signaling, enzymatic pathways, apoptosis, and gene expression (4Jang M. Cai L. Udeani G.O. Slowing K.V.

Recent studies have shown that resveratrol stimulates osteoblast differentiation and has a marked effect in reducing loss of bone mass in ovariectomized (OVX) rat model (6Boissy P. Andersen T.L.

Periodontol. 2004; 75: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that resveratrol could be a preventive or therapeutic agent for osteoporosis. Details regarding the mechanisms through which resveratrol exerts its bone protection and tumor suppression are lacking. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms of action is essential for understanding both the beneficial and adverse effects of resveratrol. Although the mechanisms of osteoporosis are not entirely clear, they are likely relate to decreased availability or effects of bone growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMPs, structurally related to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, were originally identified by their capacity to induce ectopic bone formation in rodents (13Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3986) Google Scholar). Among BMP family members, BMP-2 has been extensively studied and demonstrated to play a crucial role in inducing osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during embryonic skeletal development and postnatal bone remodeling (14Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar, 15Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Skeletal aging studies have shown that both anabolic activity and gene expression of BMP-2 are decreased in the senile animals with osteopenia, suggesting that the decay of BMP-2 function may account for one of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of osteoporosis (16Fleet J.C. Cashman K. Cox K. Rosen V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4605-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Matsumoto A. Yamaji K. Kawanami M. Kato H. J. Periodontal. Res. 2001; 36: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A recent study has found a linkage of osteoporosis to specific polymorphisms in the BMP-2 gene, implicating that BMP-2 is an osteoporosis-associated gene (18Styrkarsdottir U. Cazier J.B. Kong A.

PLoS. Biol. 2003; 1: E69Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Findings of the present study reveal that resveratrol not only shares the bone-protective effects of hormone replacement therapy but also decreases the risk of occurrence of breast cancer. We found the forkhead protein, FOXA1, was involved in resveratrol-induced ER-dependent BMP-2 expression. Our findings also show that Akt inactivation-mediated FOXO3a nuclear accumulation and activity are required for the tumor suppressive effect of resveratrol. Forkhead proteins play a significant role in both resveratrol-mediated bone protective function and breast cancer suppression. We provide evidence that resveratrol would be a critical therapeutic strategy for prevention of osteoporosis.

Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For the cell cycle analysis, proliferating cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or resveratrol for 24 h. Cells were then subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described previously (19Su J.L. Yang P.C. Shih J.Y. Yang C.Y. Wei L.H. Hsieh C.Y. Chou C.H. Jeng Y.M. Wang M.Y. Chang K.J. Hung M.C. Kuo M.L.

Establishment of Stable Transfectants—MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 containing the dominant negative mutant Src, which were kindly provide by Dr. Ruey-Hwa Chen (Dept. of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan), or with the empty vector using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h, stably transfected cells were selected by media containing 600 μg/ml G418 for 4 weeks. Pools of six clones of MC3T3-E1/DN-Src or MC3T3-E1/vector were isolated for further studies. MDA-MB-231 cells were cotransfected with specific siRNA against FOXO3a cloned into pSuper vector and pcDNA3 in 10:1 ratio, which were kindly provide by Dr. Alex Toker (Dept. of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School). After 48 h, stably transfected cells were selected by media containing 800 μg/ml G418 for 4 weeks. Pools of 10 clones of MDA-MB-231/siFOXO3a or MDA-MB-231/siControl were isolated for further studies. BMD by DEXA—Female Wistar rats were sham-operated or OVX. BMD was measured in anesthetized rats (87 mg/kg ketamine and 13 mg/kg xylazine) after treated with various concentrations of resveratrol by orally feeding them every 2 days for 10 weeks using DEXA (QDR 4500a, Hologic, Inc.). Small animal software (Hologic, Inc.) was used to obtain BMD in the femur/tibia. The femur/tibia site consisted of the proximal half of the tibia and the entire femur. All animal work was performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University. Animals were maintained in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Colony-forming assays in soft agarose were performed as described previously (19Su J.L. Yang P.C. Shih J.Y. Yang C.Y. Wei L.H. Hsieh C.Y. Chou C.H. Jeng Y.M. Wang M.Y. Chang K.J. Hung M.C. Kuo M.L. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 209-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes in suspensions of 0.35% Agar noble in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum on top of a bed of 0.7% Agar noble in the same complete medium. After 3 weeks, tumor cell colonies measuring at least 50 μm were counted from six replicates per treatment under a dissecting microscope. Assaying the Levels of Osteocalcin, Osteopontin, and BMP-2—Osteocalcin, osteopontin, and BMP-2 ELISA kits were used to detect osteocalcin, osteopontin, and BMP-2 levels, respectively. Briefly, cells were treated with various concentrations of resveratrol for the indicated times. The culture medium was collected and measured for osteocalcin, osteopontin, and BMP-2, respectively. These samples were placed in 96-well microtiter plates coated with monoclonal-detective antibodies and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After removing unbound material by washing with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to bind to the antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase catalyzed the conversion of a chromogenic substrate (tetramethylbenzidine) to a colored solution, with color intensity proportional to the amount of protein present in the sample. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm. Results are presented as the percentage of change of the activity compared with the untreated control. cDNA Array Analysis—The GEArray Q series of Mouse Osteogenesis Gene Arrays from SuperArray Bioscience are application-specific cDNA arrays. GEArray Q series Mouse Osteogenesis Gene Array is designed to profile gene expression in the process of osteogenic differentiation. The genes regulating this process include growth factors and their internal cell signaling molecules, as well as the early and later differentiation genes. We used this Mouse Osteogenesis Gene Array to determine simultaneously the expression profile of the genes involved in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation. Experimental procedures and analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis as described previously (19Su J.L. Yang P.C. Shih J.Y. Yang C.Y. Wei L.H. Hsieh C.Y. Chou C.H.

Equal amounts of protein were incubated with specific antibody immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, boiled, and microcentrifuged. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, blots were incubated with specific primary antibodies. After washing and incubating with secondary antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with another antibody. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B and reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer sequences for osteocalcin were: 5′-ATGAGGACCCTCTCTCTGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAAACGGTGGTGCCATAGAT-3′ (reverse); for osteopontin were: 5′-ATGAGACTGGCAGTGGTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTTCATTGGAGTTGCT-3′ (reverse).

To construct a plasmid containing the ERE or Sp1 site mutations in pBMP-2-Luc, we used pBMP-2-Luc promoter as a template and designed a mutated ERE site (pBMP-2-LucmERE, GGCCACTCTGACC to AACCACTCTACCT) or a mutated Sp1 site (pBMP-2-Luc-mSp1, CGGCCCGCCCGCC to CTTCCCTTCCGCC) by using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The luciferase assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay kit (Promega) according to protocols provided by the manufacturer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, washed, and lysed. The nuclei were released by processing in a Dounce homogenizer followed by lysis in 100–200 μl of nucleus lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). One microgram of antibody was added to 0.5–1.0 ml of the lysate and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then pulled down by using protein G-conjugated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech), and the bound protein was eluted twice with 30 μl of 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3.0). The reverted DNA was purified with a Miniprep spin column (Qiagen) and then eluted in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for DNA binding in MC3T3-E1 cells was performed using the probe purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and [α-32P]dCTP end-labeled in a 20-μl reaction mixture for 20 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, a 5-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reactions. The reaction products were analyzed by 5% nondenaturing PAGE using Tris (12.5 mm), boric acid (12.5 mm), and EDTA (0.25 mm), pH 8.3, for a period of 4–5 h at 280–300 V and 10–12 mA. The gels were then dried and exposed, for an appropriate time period, to Amersham™ film (Amersham Biosciences) at –70 °C while using an intensifying screen. Quantification of Apoptotic Osteoblasts in Undecalcified Bone Sections—Four-month-old female Wistar rats were subjected to a sham operation or to ovariectomy. Lumbar vertebrae (L1 to L5) were removed from female rats after 10 weeks. Apoptotic osteoblasts were detected in undecalcified plastic-embedded sections by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining using the Klenow FragEL detection kit (Oncogene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Assay—Triplicate aliquots of 0.1% SDS cell lysates were used for biochemical evaluation of ALP activity using the Sigma-Aldrich kit number 104, according to the manufacturer's instruction. In Vitro Quantification of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and hypodiploid cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (Su et al. 19Su J.L. Yang P.C. Shih J.Y. Yang C.Y. Wei L.H. Hsieh C.Y. Chou C.H. Jeng Y.M. Wang M.Y. Chang K.J. Hung M.C. Kuo M.L. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 209-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in 500 μlofa buffer (0.5% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% RNase A) and incubated for 30 min. Then, 0.5 ml of propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml) was added. Cells were then left on ice for 15–30 min. Fluorescence emitted from propidium iodide·DNA complexes was quantified after laser excitation of the fluorescent dye by fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Finally, the extent of apoptosis was determined by measuring DNA content of the cells below the G0/G1 peak. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Real-time PCR was performed using a Roche LightCycler according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). After reverse transcription reaction (20 μl) using 2 μg of total RNA, real-time PCR was carried out in a 20-μl final volume using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The reaction mix contained 1× LightCycler-FastStart Master SYBR Green I, 0.5 μm of each primer, 4 mm MgCl2, and 2 μl of cDNA from (20 μl of) reverse transcription reaction. The conditions of the real-time PCR were as described previously (23Zhou S. Turgeman G. Harris S.E. Leitman D.C. Komm B.S. Bodine P.V. Gazit D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured at 82 °C for 5 s. Resveratrol Increases Osteogenic Responses and Prevents Ovariectomy-induced Bone Loss—To examine the effects of resveratrol on proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells, MC3T3-E1, MG63, and rat primary cultured osteoblast cells (primary OBs) were treated with various concentrations of resveratrol, and the fraction of cells in S-phase was determined. Treatment with resveratrol at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 1A significantly increased the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 and MG63 cells, closely matching the increase observed in primary OBs cultured under identical conditions. Biochemical analysis of the osteoblast differentiation marker, ALP, confirmed that enzyme activity increased in confluent preparations of these cells after treatment with resveratrol for 7 days (Fig. 1B). Expression of the osteoblast differentiation markers, osteocalcin and osteopontin, was measured by RT-PCR and ELISA assay. Resveratrol increased expression of both osteocalcin and osteopontin at the mRNA and protein levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 1C). The bone protective activity of resveratrol was also examined in ovariectomized mice. Resveratrol preserved both bone mineral density (BMD) and serum ALP activity in ovariectomized, but not sham-operated mice, and preservations were dose-dependent and significant (Fig. 1D). In addition, treatment with 10 mg/kg resveratrol restored BMD and serum ALP activity in ovariectomized mice to degrees observed in sham controls and as effectively as estradiol (Fig. 1D). To explore the anti-apoptotic effects of resveratrol in osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells and primary OBs were subjected to pro-apoptotic stimuli in the absence or presence of resveratrol. The phytoestrogen prevented induction of apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary OBs in response to etoposide or TNFα (Fig. 1E). Ovariectomy increased vertebral osteoblast apoptosis by 4.2-fold, compared with sham-operated controls (Fig. 1F). The osteoblast apoptosis was prevented in ovariectomized mice receiving either resveratrol or 17β-estradiol (Fig. 1F). These in vitro and in vivo findings support the potency and efficacy of resveratrol for prevention of both bone loss and osteoblast apoptosis. Resveratrol Prevents Breast Cancer Progression—To test the possibility that resveratrol increases the risk of breast cancer, effects of the drug on breast tumor growth were investigated. Estrogen-negative and estrogen-positive breast cancer cells were treated with vehicle, E2, or resveratrol and analyzed for extent of proliferation and anchorage-independent growth by DNA flow cytometry and the soft agar colony-forming assay, respectively. Treatment with resveratrol resulted in significant reductions in proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation in the ER-positive (Fig. 2A) and ER-negative (Fig. 2B) breast cancer cells. In the orthotropic tumor growth assay, treatment with resveratrol reduced either E2-induced MCF-7 tumor growth or MDA-MB-231 tumor growth (Fig. 2C). In addition, the induction of tumor formation in response to treatment with E2 was significantly decreased by resveratrol (100% versus 40%, respectively). Resveratrol also reduced tumor formation in MDA-MB-231-bearing mice (100% in vehicle and E2 treatment group versus 85% in resveratrol treatment group). Tumor weight decreased by 54.6% in MCF-7-bearing mice treated with resveratrol as compared with mice treated with E2 (134 ± 33 mg versus 295 ± 47 mg, respectively). Furthermore, tumor weight decreased by 43.6% in MDA-MB-231-bearing mice treated with resveratrol as compared with the vehicle-treated group (194 ± 57 mg versus 344 ± 43 mg, respectively). Findings from these two experiments are summarized in Table 1. Resveratrol is therefore concluded to inhibit the induction and growth of breast cancer cells.TABLE 1Resveratrol decreases breas"

Tap interacts directly with the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element (CTE), an element that enables export of unspliced, intron-containing mRNA. Based on our previous finding that Tap can promote polysome association and translation of CTE-RNA, we investigated the effect of 9G8 on cytoplasmic RNA fate. 9G8 was shown to enhance expression of unspliced RNA containing either the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus-CTE or the recently discovered Tap-CTE. 9G8 also enhanced polyribosome association of unspliced RNA containing a CTE. Hyperphosphorylated 9G8 was present in monosomes and small polyribosomes, whereas soluble fractions contained only hypophosphorylated protein. Our results are consistent with a model in which hypophosphorylated SR proteins remain stably associated with messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes during export and are released during translation initiation concomitant with increased phosphorylation. These results provide further evidence for crucial links between RNA splicing, export and translation.

These proteins all have C-terminal arginineand serinerich (RS) domains that can be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated on multiple serines by cellular kinases and phosphatases (2Graveley B.R. RNA (N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18050-18055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effects of SR proteins on splicing have been extensively studied. Based to a large extent on in vitro studies, it has been well established that SR proteins, in general, bind to cis-acting regulatory sequences in many RNAs and promote splicing (7Sanford J.R. Longman D. Caceres J.F. Prog. Mol. Subcell Biol. 2003; 31: 33-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although individual proteins can have specific effects, SR proteins often appear to display overlapping and redundant functions (2Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 8Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The SR proteins were initially thought to have solely nuclear functions, but it was subsequently shown that several of these proteins shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (9Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The functional importance of this remained unclear until studies by Steitz and colleagues demonstrated a potential role for two of the shuttling SR proteins (SRp20 and 9G8) in mRNA export (10Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 11Huang Y. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Steitz J.A. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Another study reported the presence of SR proteins in polyribosomes, suggesting a potential role in translational regulation (13Sanford J.R. Gray N.K. Beckmann K. Caceres J.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was reported that the SF2/ASF protein was able to promote translation of mRNAs from reporter constructs containing SR protein binding sites. Several recent studies have now provided additional support of a role for SR proteins in translation (14Blaustein M. Pelisch F. Tanos T. Munoz M.J. Wengier D. Quadrana L. Sanford J.R. Muschietti J.P. Kornblihtt A.R. Caceres J.F. Coso O.A. Srebrow A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Sanford J.R. Ellis J.D. Cazalla D. Caceres J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15042-15047Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the case of most mammalian genes, the primary RNA transcript contains multiple introns that must be removed by splicing before the mRNA can exit the nucleus (16Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Although it is not clear what restricts mRNA from export before splicing has been completed, the shuttling protein, Tap/NXF1 (hereafter referred to as Tap), is believed to play an important role in the export process of many mRNAs. It has been suggested that Tap is recruited to completely spliced mRNAs through multiple adaptor proteins (19Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition to the initially identified adaptor protein REF (21Luo M.L. Zhou Z. Magni K. Christoforides C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Reed R. Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 22Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), three shuttling SR proteins (9G8, SRp20, and SF2/ASF) have also been proposed to serve this function (10Huang Y. Steitz J.A.

The SR proteins are recruited to the RNA during transcription in a phosphorylated form, and dephosphorylation may trigger the recruitment of Tap (12Huang Y. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although Tap has been suggested to be recruited to most cellular mRNA through protein-protein interactions, it was originally identified as an RNA-binding protein that interacted specifically with a constitutive transport element (CTE) (24Gruter P. Tabernero C. von K.C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) present in the genomic RNA of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) (25Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E.

Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Hammarskjold M.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 259: 77-93PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that the Tap gene, itself, also contains a functional Tap-binding CTE, which exists in a retained intron (28Li Y. Bor Y.C. Misawa Y. Xue Y. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Nature. 2006; 443: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An mRNA that retains this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is translated into a small alternative protein isoform of Tap. Mutation of the Tap-binding loop of the Tap-CTE provides further evidence that Tap regulates its own expression through a mechanism that involves direct RNA binding. This clearly demonstrates that Tap is capable of binding directly to cellular mRNA. MPMV, like all other retroviruses, produces an unspliced mRNA with a retained complete intron that has to be efficiently exported and translated in the cytoplasm (25Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. Jeang K.T. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1256-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26Ernst R. Bray M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjöld M.-L. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 8: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This mode of genetic organization and gene expression presents a general problem for retroviruses, because mRNAs usually remain in the nucleus until all introns are removed (30Chang D.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 59: 789-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 31Legrain P. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 57: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In complex retroviruses, such as HIV, the problem is solved by the expression of specific viral proteins (Rev in the case of HIV) that interact with cis-acting RNA elements in the viral genome (RRE in the case of HIV) (32Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M.

In HIV infection, the Rev-RRE RNA complex is exported with the help of the Crm1 cellular export receptor (36Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 37Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). MPMV, however, does not encode any regulatory proteins. Instead, the CTE interacts directly with the Tap export protein and another cellular protein, NXT1/p15 (hereafter referred to as NXT1), to promote export (38Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have also shown that Tap/NXT1 enhances translation of CTE-containing RNA in the cytoplasm. Tap, but not NXT1, remained associated with polyribosomes (44Jin L. Guzik B.W. Bor Y.C. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3075-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These results suggest that productive nuclear export of Tap-RNA complexes might be coupled to translation initiation. Here we show that moderate SRp20 or 9G8 overexpression significantly stimulates translation from unspliced RNA containing a CTE. Using 9G8, we show that RNA export is not affected, but that SR protein expression enhances polyribosome association of RNA containing the CTE. Furthermore, we show that 9G8 is present in 80 S monosomes and small polyribosomes and that hyperphosphorylated forms of this protein are significantly enriched in these fractions. These results suggest further links between RNA export and translation and highlight the complexity of post-transcriptional gene regulation.

PGEM7ZfSEAP (pHR2653), the template used to prepare in vitro transcribed seap, was constructed by inserting the BamHI/SacI fragment of pCMVSEAP (pHR1831) into pGEM7Zf (Promega, Madison, WI). This plasmid was linearized with SacI to provide T7 polymerase a template for in vitro transcription. pGEXT2ZnK (pHR3035) was constructed by PCR amplification of pCGT79G8 (pHR2957) using oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGGGATCCGAAGATGCAGTACGAGGAC-3′ as the sense primer and oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGGAATTCGTAACGATGACAATCATAAGC-3′ as the antisense primer to obtain a fragment encoding the zinc knuckle domain of 9G8.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 293T/17 cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (51Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). p24 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and SEAP Quantitation—Supernatants from transfected cells were collected at 65-72 h post-transfection and centrifuged briefly to remove residual cells and debris. Expression levels of p24 (HIV capsid protein) were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocol using a p24 monoclonal antibody (183-H12-5C) and pooled human anti-HIV immunoglobulin G (52Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Methods. 1997; 12: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The p24 antibody was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and was contributed by Bruce Chesebro (NIAID, National Institutes of Health-Rocky Mountain Laboratories). SEAP activity in the supernatants was measured with the Phospha-Light Chemiluminescent Reporter Kit (Tropix). Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Proteins were separated by SDS-15% PAGE (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio: 30/0.14). Western blot analysis was performed essentially as previously described (33Hammarskjold M.L. Heimer J. Hammarskjold B. Sangwan I. Albert L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was blocked in 5% milk (or 5% bovine serum albumin for phospho-blots) and probed with antibody. For detection of T79G8 and T7SRp20, blots were probed with anti-T7 antibody (1:1000, Novagen). For detection of phospho-SR proteins, blots were probed with monoclonal antibody 104 (mAb104, 1:25, ATCC) (54Roth M.B. Murphy C. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To detect endogenous 9G8, blots were probed with a polyclonal 9G8 antibody raised in rabbits (1:250, BioSource) against a GST-9G8 zinc knuckle domain (amino acids 61-122) fusion protein produced from the pGEX2TZnK vector (pHR3035). After washing, blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000, Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed with ImageQuaNT analysis software. Polyribosome Analysis—Untransfected or transfected (48 h post-transfection) cells (4 × 107) were exposed to 50 μg/ml cycloheximide at 37 °C for 30 min (RNA analysis) or 5 min (protein analysis), washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, and harvested by scraping from the plate. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 250 μl of cold RSB (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), and 250 units of RNasin (Promega)) and lysed by the addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (RSB containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 2% Tween 20) with incubation for 10 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were loaded onto gradients of 10% to 50% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 75 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. In some experiments, before loading onto the gradient, EDTA was added to the lysate at a final concentration of 15 mm to disrupt the polysomes (55Calzone F.J. Angerer R.C. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2145-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 56Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in an SW41Ti rotor, the gradient was collected from the top using a Piston Gradient Fractionator (Biocomp) into 13 or 20 fractions, with the A254 continuously measured using a UV-M II monitor (Amersham Biosciences) during collection. Fractions were either isopropanol-precipitated or immunoprecipitated prior to SDS-PAGE, or they were purified for RNA. For the immunoprecipitations, fractions were diluted 1:2 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated 1 h with 20 μl of anti-T7 conjugated agarose (Bethyl Laboratories) at 4 °C with tumbling. For the isopropanol precipitations, an equal volume of ice-cold isopropanol was added to each fraction and incubated on ice 30 min. The precipitate was pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 15 min and washed in cold acetone. To purify RNA from the sucrose, 10 ng of in vitro transcribed seap RNA (produced using T7 polymerase and an SacI-digested pHR2653 template) was first added to 150-μl aliquots of each fraction and served as a control for recovery and RNA degradation. Samples were treated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K in 1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C. This was followed by phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction. Next, 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol was added, and the mixture was stored at -70 °C for 15 min. The fractions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. RNA pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 4 μl of water with 14 μl of RS buffer (1.3× MOPS (10× MOPS, 200 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA), 9.25% formaldehyde, 71.4% formamide), incubated at 55 °C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. Northern analysis was carried out by standard procedure, as described below. RNA Fractionation and Northern Blot Analysis—The methods used for nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA extraction, poly(A)+ mRNA selection, and Northern blot analysis were previously described (33Hammarskjold M.L. Heimer J. Hammarskjold B. Sangwan I. Albert L. Rekosh D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Hammarskjöld M.L. Li H. Rekosh D. Prasad S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 951-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were harvested at 65 h post-transfection. An SacI-BglII fragment of pHR146 containing nucleotides 682-2093 of the HIV-1 BH10 clone and a BamHI fragment of pHR1831 containing the human SEAP cDNA (nucleotides 213-1698) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the T7 Quickprime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blots were quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT analysis software. Phosphatase Treatment of 9G8—Sucrose gradient fractions were either left untreated or treated with 1 μl of highly active recombinant calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (140 units/μl, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. Fractions were immunoprecipitated using anti-T7-conjugated agarose and analyzed by Western blot. Two Shuttling SR Proteins Enhance Expression from Unspliced RNA Containing the MPMV-CTE—SRp20 and 9G8, two of the shuttling SR proteins, have been reported to bind to Tap in the nucleus and contribute to Tap-mediated RNA export (10Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 11Huang Y. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Steitz J.A. Mol.

Because Tap binds to the MPMV-CTE, and we have previously demonstrated that moderate overexpression of Tap and NXT1 increases translation from an RNA containing the CTE in 293T cells (44Jin L. Guzik B.W. Bor Y.C. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3075-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we decided to test the effect of these SR proteins on CTE-mediated expression. In these studies, we utilized a CTE reporter construct (pCMVGagPol-CTE) that encodes the HIV Gag and GagPol proteins from an mRNA that remains unspliced. This mRNA is efficiently exported because of the presence of the CTE, but it is inefficiently translated in 293T cells (44Jin L. Guzik B.W. Bor Y.C. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3075-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 50Coyle J.H. Guzik B.W. Bor Y.C. Jin L. Eisner-Smerage L. Taylor S.J. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Expression of the Gag and GagPol proteins from the mRNA results in the release of virus-like particles into the medium of transfected cells. This can be quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring the HIV p24 protein. In these assays, cells are also transfected with a plasmid expressing SEAP (pCMVSEAP) from a spliced RNA. SEAP activity is measured in the supernatant and serves as a control for transfection efficiency, potential promoter competition and other “nonspecific” effects. We have utilized this assay in many previous studies of CTE function (28Li Y. Bor Y.C. Misawa Y. Xue Y. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Nature. 2006; 443: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Guzik B.W. Levesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Mol.

Fig. 1A shows that expression of 9G8 or SRp20 in conjunction with the CTE reporter in 293T cells resulted in a significant enhancement of p24 expression but had no significant effects on SEAP levels (Fig. 1B). In the experiment shown, 1 μg of the SR-protein plasmids were used together with 5 μg and 0.25 μg of the CTE and SEAP reporter plasmids, respectively, to transfect 3 × 106 cells. Quantitative Western blot analysis using 9G8-specific antibodies (see Fig. 6) indicated that this led to ∼10-fold overexpression of 9G8 (data not shown). However, a similar enhancement was seen with as little as 100 ng of the SR plasmids (data not shown). Thus, moderate overexpression of either 9G8 or SRp20 specifically increased CTE function without significant effects on SEAP expression.FIGURE 6Development of 9G8-specific antibodies. A, a schematic diagram of the 9G8 protein is shown with its RNA recognition motif (RRM), the zinc knuckle domain (ZnK) and the RS domain. The region of 9G8 cDNA encoding the unique zinc knuckle that was fused to the GST coding sequence and expressed in Escherichia coli is also shown. Purified fusion protein was used to produce polyclonal antibodies in rabbits.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that the effect of the SR proteins was not limited to expression in transient transfections, we repeated the experiments using B2.23 cells, a 293T cell line that is constitutively expressing p24 from an integrated CMVGagPol-CTE plasmid. Because the effects of SRp20 and 9G8 on CTE expression were very similar, and these closely related SR proteins have been shown to have “overlapping” functions, we chose to perform the experiments with one of the SR proteins, 9G8. Transfection of B2.23 cells with the plasmid expressing 9G8 resulted in a significant (almost 10-fold) enhancement of p24 expression (Fig. 1C). As before, the cells were co-transfected with the SEAP-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1D). 9G8 had no significant effect on SEAP expression, confirming the results from the original experimen"
https://openalex.org/W1981259120,"Cannabinoids are secondary metabolites stored in capitate-sessile glands on leaves of Cannabis sativa. We discovered that cell death is induced in the leaf tissues exposed to cannabinoid resin secreted from the glands, and identified cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) and Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) as unique cell death mediators from the resin. These cannabinoids effectively induced cell death in the leaf cells or suspension-cultured cells of C. sativa, whereas pretreatment with the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor cyclosporin A suppressed this cell death response. Examinations using isolated mitochondria demonstrated that CBCA and THCA mediate opening of MPT pores without requiring Ca2+ and other cytosolic factors, resulting in high amplitude mitochondrial swelling, release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c and nuclease), and irreversible loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, CBCA and THCA are considered to cause serious damage to mitochondria through MPT. The mitochondrial damage was also confirmed by a marked decrease of ATP level in cannabinoid-treated suspension cells. These features are in good accord with those of necrotic cell death, whereas DNA degradation was also observed in cannabinoid-mediated cell death. However, the DNA degradation was catalyzed by nuclease(s) released from mitochondria during MPT, indicating that this reaction was not induced via a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the inhibition of the DNA degradation only slightly blocked the cell death induced by cannabinoids. Based on these results, we conclude that CBCA and THCA have the ability to induce necrotic cell death via mitochondrial dysfunction in the leaf cells of C. sativa."
https://openalex.org/W2094115098,"Nisin is a post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptide that has been widely used in the food industry for several decades. It contains five cyclic thioether cross-links of varying sizes that are installed by a single enzyme, NisC, that catalyzes the addition of cysteines to dehydroamino acids. The recent x-ray crystal structure of NisC has provided the first insights into the catalytic residues responsible for the cyclization step during nisin biosynthesis. In this study, the conserved residues His212, Arg280, Asp141, and Tyr285 as well as the ligands to the zinc in the active site (Cys284, Cys330, and His331) were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis. Binding studies showed that all mutants had similar affinities for NisA. Activity assays showed that whereas His212 and Asp141 were essential for correct cyclization as judged by the antimicrobial activity of the final product, Arg280 and Tyr285 were not. Mutation of zinc ligands to alanine also abolished the enzymatic activity, and these mutant proteins were shown to contain decreased levels of zinc. These results show that the zinc is essential for activity and support a model in which the zinc is used to activate the cysteines in the substrate for nucleophilic attack. These findings also argue against an essential role of Arg280 and Tyr285 as an active site general acid/base in the mechanism of cyclization.

Antimicrobial peptides containing nonproteinogenic amino acids are produced by numerous microorganisms (1Walsh C.T. Antibiotics: Actions, Origins, Resistance. 2003; (, American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.)Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Many of these secondary metabolites are assembled by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. In addition, nature also employs an alternative strategy featuring the use of the ribosome to prepare the peptide backbone and subsequent post-translational modification to increase the structural diversity of functional groups beyond the 20–22 proteinogenic amino acids (2Jack R.W. Jung G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A common theme found in both products of NRPS and posttranslational modification is that they often contain macrocyclic structures to constrain their conformation and enhance their activity, specificity, and stability. Post-translationally modified peptides include microcins, such as the Escherichia coli antibiotic microcin B17 that contains the five-member heteroaromatic oxazoles and thiazoles (3Li Y.M. Milne J.C. Madison L.L. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. Science. 1996; 274: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and the lantibiotics, a group of peptides containing unique intramolecular thioether linkages termed lanthionines and methyllanthionines (4Chatterjee C. Paul M. Xie L. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 633-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Nisin, the most prominent member of the lantibiotics, is highly effective (nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentrations) in inhibiting the growth of a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria including food-borne pathogens and multi-drug-resistant bacteria (5Cotter P.D. Hill C. Ross R.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The compound has been used extensively in the food industry as a preservative. Nisin exerts its high efficacy by pore formation in the membrane and disruption of cell wall biosynthesis. Both of these activities are mediated by binding to an indispensable cell wall biosynthetic intermediate, lipid II (6Breukink E. de Kruijff B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Nisin contains five cyclic thioethers with ring sizes varying from four to seven amino acids (Fig. 1). These thioether cross-links are installed in lantibiotics by a two-step process that first involves dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to the corresponding dehydroalanines and dehydrobutyrines, followed by regioselective addition of Cys residues to the dehydroamino acids (Fig. 1). Recent in vitro studies on the dehydration step for the lantibiotic lacticin 481 have started to provide insights into the molecular mechanism of catalysis (7Chatterjee C. Miller L.M. Leung Y.L.

Soc. 2007; 129: 2212-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but thus far little is known regarding the mechanism of the cyclization step of nisin biosynthesis. Previous work has shown that a single enzyme, NisC, is responsible for installing all five rings in nisin (10Koponen O. Tolonen M. Qiao M. Wahlstrom G. Helin J. Saris Per E.J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which are important for its biological activity. The opening or deletion of the rings, especially the A- and B-rings, results in a drastic decrease of biological activity (12Chan W.C. Bycroft B.W. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C.K.

Indeed, these two rings in nisin make direct contacts with the pyrophosphate moiety of lipid II in an NMR structure of the 1:1 complex (16Hsu S.T. Breukink E. Tischenko E. Lutters M.A. De Kruijff B. Kaptein R. Bonvin A.M. Van Nuland N.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The importance of the thioether cross-links has also been demonstrated for several other lantibiotics (15Kuipers O.P. Bierbaum G. Ottenwaölder B. Dodd H.M. Horn N. Metzger J. Kupke T. Gnau V. Bongers R. van den Bogaard P. Kosters H. Rollema H.S. de Vos W.M. Siezen R.J. Jung G. Goötz F. Sahl H.G. Gasson M.J.

Several previous studies have shown that cyclic lanthionines also increase the stability and activity of non-lantibiotic peptides (19Oösapay G. Prokai L. Kim H.S. Medzihradszky K.F. Coy D.H.

To date, the utility of the lanthionine conformational constraint has been underexplored, however, predominantly because chemical approaches to prepare lanthionine-containing peptides, although powerful in synthesizing small peptides (21Okeley N.M.

Chem. 2005; 2: 23-37Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, only one chemical synthesis of a lantibiotic, nisin, has been reported in the literature to date (28Fukase K. Kitazawa M. Sano A. Shimbo K. Horimoto S. Fujita H. Kubo A. Wakamiya T. Shiba T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1992; 65: 2227-2240Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Enzymatic cyclization is a promising alternative in this aspect, and lantibiotic biosynthetic enzymes appear to be good candidates for both reprogramming the structure of lantibiotics and introducing lanthionines into non-lantibiotic peptides (15Kuipers O.P.

A better understanding of the mechanism of the cyclization step will provide important information for these bioengineering studies. The x-ray structure of the nisin cyclase NisC displayed a zinc located at the mouth of an α,α-barrel with a tetrahedral coordination geometry (11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The ligands are made up of His331, Cys284, and Cys330, with a water molecule completing the coordination environment (Fig. 2). Other residues in the active site that are conserved in the LanC family of lantibiotic cyclases include His212, Asp141, Tyr285, and Arg280. In this study, the roles of the zinc ligands and active site residues of NisC were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis—The expression vector for His6-NisC, pET15b-NisC, was previously described (31Okeley N.M. Paul M. Stasser J.P. Blackburn N. van der Donk W.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13613-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared by using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Mutants were generated using the QuikChange method. The primer sequences were 5′-GGA TTA GCA AAT GGA CTT GCT GGA GTG GG-3′ (H212N), 5′-GGG ATT AGC ATT TGG ACT TGC TGG AGT GG-3′ (H212F), 5′-CAT TAG AGA TGC ATG GGC TTA TGG AGG TCC-3′ (C284A), 5′-CAT ATA TGA TTG CTC ATG GCT ATT CTG GTT TAA TAG AA-3′ (C330A), 5′-GGG AAG CAA GTT TCA TTA TGG ATG CAT GGT GCT ATG G-3′ (R280M), 5′-GGA AGC AAG TTT CAT TGC AGA TGC ATG GTG CTA TG-3′ (R280A), 5′-CAT TAC TCC TCC TGA TTA TAA CGT GAT TGA AGG TTT ATC-3′ (D141N), 5′-CAT TAC TCC TCC TGA TTA TGC CGT GAT TGA AGG TTT ATC-3′ (D141A), 5′-GAG ATG CAT GGT GCT TTG GAG GTC CAG GTA TTA G-3′ (Y285F), 5′-GAG ATG CAT GGT GCG CTG GAG GTC CAG GTA TTA G-3′ (Y285A), 5′-GAT TCA TAT ATG ATT TGC GCT GGC TAT TCT GG-3′ (H331A), and the corresponding reverse complementary fragments. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Overexpression and Purification of NisC Mutants—A 20-ml culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the NisC mutant constructs was grown in LB amp at 37 °C overnight with shaking. An aliquot of 10 ml of overnight culture was added to 1 liter of LB amp and grown at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.7–0.9. Overexpression of the protein was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the bacteria were grown in LB amp (supplemented with 100 μm ZnCl2) at 18 °C for 15–20 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 15 ml of resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.3) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were sonicated, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered and applied to a cobalt affinity column (Cobalt Talon; BD Biosciences). The column was washed with 15 column volumes of equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) and 5 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). NisC mutant proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of elution buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 150 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). Elution fractions were monitored by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing NisC mutant were combined and concentrated with Amicon-12 (YM-10; Millipore). The concentrated protein was desalted with a PD-10 desalting column (GE HealthCare) and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Removal of His Tag with Thrombin—The cleavage of the His tag was performed by incubating the His6-NisC (wild type or mutant) with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) overnight at 4 °C. Biotinylated thrombin was then removed with streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen). The resulting protein was purified by cobalt affinity chromatography on a fast flow column (BD Bioscience). Metal Analysis—All flasks and beakers used were prerinsed with 20% HNO3 and Milli-Q water. Dialysis was performed with Slidalyzers (Pierce) presoaked in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 10 g/liter Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad). NisC (wild type or mutant) was dialyzed against four changes of 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with 25–50 g/liter Chelex-100 in the beaker, over a total time of 48 h at 4 °C. The Chelex-100-treated protein was then concentrated with an Amicon-4 ultrafiltration set-up (YM-10; Millipore) that had been presoaked in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 10 g/liter Chelex-100. Metal content was determined by inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The zinc content was also analyzed using a spectroscopic assay based on the absorption change at 500 nm associated with the formation of a zinc complex with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR 2The abbreviations used are: PAR, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; ICP, inductively coupled plasma; MS, mass spectrometry. ; Sigma) as previously described (31Okeley N.M. Paul M. Stasser J.P. Blackburn N. van der Donk W.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13613-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Activity Assay—Dehydrated prenisin was overexpressed and purified as previously described (11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A sample of 3 μl of 2 mg/ml dehydrated prenisin (final concentration ∼21 μm) was mixed with 5 μl of 10× assay buffer (final concentration: 25 mm Tris, 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) and 2.5 μl of 20× ZnCl2 (final concentration 5 μm). Then NisC was added (final concentration of wild type NisC was 1 or 10 μm, and final concentration of NisC mutants was 10 μm). The total volume of the assay was brought up to 50 μl with distilled sterile water. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. A sample of 1 μl of 4.5 μm trypsin was added to each assay sample (final concentration ∼0.2 μm), and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The resulting mixtures were checked by MALDI-TOF MS, and the proteolytic fragment corresponding to mature nisin was observed. Calcd.: 3354. Found: 3355 M + H. Subsequent bioassays were performed as previously described (11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Constructs containing the nisC mutant genes encoding for C284A, C330A, H331A, D141A, D141N, R280A, H212N, H212F, R280M, W283H, W283A, Y285F, and Y285A were generated using the QuikChange protocol. The corresponding proteins were heterologously overexpressed in E. coli as histidine-tagged proteins. All mutants except W282H, W282A, and D141A could be purified to >95% homogeneity using Co2+ affinity chromatography. The D141A mutant was produced in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies, and both Trp mutants, while expressed in soluble form, could not be purified without precipitation during metal affinity chromatography. As a result, no purified protein was obtained. All purified proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism and displayed very similar spectra (see supplemental material). Furthermore, all mutants bound NisA that was fluorescently labeled at the N terminus with similar affinities as wild type NisC (see supplemental material). The mutant proteins in which a metal ligand was substituted or that did not show activity (see below) were analyzed by two methods for their zinc content. The proteins expressed in cells grown on media supplemented with 100 μm ZnCl2 were analyzed by ICP-MS after removal of the His6 tag and exhaustive dialysis against chelex-treated buffer. In addition, a spectrophotometric assay using the metallochromic indicator PAR (32Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was used to verify the metal content. In this method, the proteins were treated with guanidine hydrochloride and 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to trap reactive cysteines as disulfides as previously described (31Okeley N.M. Paul M. Stasser J.P. Blackburn N. van der Donk W.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13613-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and after the addition of PAR, the orange Zn(PAR)2 complex was observed and quantified by the absorbance at 500 nm. For proteins that contained nearly stoichiometric quantities of zinc, both approaches resulted in similar results. Mutants with a very low content of zinc as determined by the PAR assay were not analyzed by ICP-MS, since it would require large amounts of protein, given the limit of detection of the available instrumentation in this study. The data in Table 1 show that the relative zinc content of the zinc ligand mutants is significantly decreased, whereas the other mutants have zinc levels comparable with the wild type NisC, which contains one zinc per polypeptide (11Li B.

This value is the average of two PAR assays and ICP-MS analysis Open table in a new tab To date, the LanB dehydratase activity, including that of NisB, has not been reconstituted successfully in vitro (33Xie L. Chatterjee C. Balsara R. Okeley N.M. van der Donk W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Engelke G. Gutowski-Eckel Z. Hammelmann M. Entian K-D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3730-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, the lack of a functional NisB prevented in vitro characterization of the cyclization reaction. This hurdle was overcome by using a recently reported engineered Lactococcus lactis strain that carries a plasmid encoding the NisA, NisB, and NisT proteins but that lacks the genes for the NisC and NisP enzymes (35Kuipers A. De Boef E. Rink R. Fekken S. Kluskens L.D. Driessen A.J. Leenhouts K. Kuipers O.P. Moll G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22176-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was found to secrete the 8-fold dehydrated NisA peptide. In the current work, this organism was grown on a 3–5-liter scale, and the cells were then removed by centrifugation. Precipitation of all proteinaceous materials in the supernatant with trichloroacetic acid followed by resuspension of the pellet and purification by either high pressure liquid chromatography or a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge allowed isolation of the 8-fold dehydrated peptide. In the purification steps, much care had to be taken to remove exogenous nisin that was added to the growth medium to induce expression of the biosynthetic genes, because the compound is an autoinducer that regulates its own biosynthesis (36Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Ruyter P.G. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27299-27304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The removal of the wild type nisin was confirmed by a bioassay with concentrated dehydrated prepeptide. To test the cyclization activity of the NisC mutants, the dehydrated prenisin peptide was treated with each of the NisC mutants. The cyclization reaction does not bring about a change in molecular weight, and therefore routine mass spectrometry cannot be used to analyze the reaction. We therefore turned to an antimicrobial bioassay after removal of the leader peptide by a substoichiometric amount of trypsin. We note that use of a bioactivity assay to investigate the cyclization reaction is a very stringent test, since it probes not only the formation of the rings but also determines whether they are formed with the correct regio- and stereochemistry. This stringency is important, because nonenzymatic cyclization of cysteine residues onto dehydroamino acids is a rather facile process (21Okeley N.M. Zhu Y. van der Donk W.A. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 3603-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Zhou H. van der Donk W.A. Org. Lett. 2002; 4: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Burrage S. Raynham T. Williams G. Essex J.W. Allen C. Cardno M. Swali V. Bradley M. Chem.-Eur. J. 2000; 6: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but in the case of dehydrated prenisin, the nonenzymatic reaction does not produce bioactive compound (11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Zhu Y. Gieselman M. Zhou H. Averin O. van der Donk W.A. Org. Biomol.

The assay mixtures after trypsin treatment were checked by MALDI-TOF MS, and the proteolytic fragment corresponding to mature nisin was observed. Trypsin removes the leader peptide by proteolysis C-terminal to Arg-1; no peaks corresponding to cleavage within mature nisin was observed, presumably because Lys12 and Lys22 are adjacent to methyllanthionine rings, which deactivate trypsin cleavage. The resulting mixtures were applied to a lawn of bacteria of the nisin-sensitive strain L. lactis NZ9000. All NisC mutants were analyzed using the protocol described above. The H212N and H212F mutants were not able to convert the dehydrated NisA peptide into bioactive nisin (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, a clear zone of inhibition was observed with the assay products resulting from incubation of dehydrated NisA with R280A and R280M and subsequent trypsin treatment. Although not quantitative, the size of the inhibition zone was comparable with that of wild type NisC (Fig. 3A), suggesting that these mutants had similar activity as the wild type enzyme and that Arg280 is not essential for the cyclization activity of NisC. In contrast, replacement of the zinc ligands Cys284, Cys330, and His331 by Ala resulted in mutants that were not able to process the dehydrated prenisin peptide and produced a bioactive compound after the removal of the leader peptide (Fig. 3, B and C). Similar behavior was observed for D141N and Y285A, but Y285F did consistently show the production of bioactive nisin. The recent crystal structure of the nisin cyclase NisC revealed the first insights into the mechanism that the LanC enzymes may utilize to introduce the characteristic lanthionine and methyllanthionine rings into lantibiotics. Based on the x-ray structure, we postulated a working model in which the zinc functions as a docking site for the cysteines of the substrate (11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The rate constant for the addition of free thiols to α,β-unsaturated centers is 1010-fold smaller than observed for the corresponding thiolates (37Bednar R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3684-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); hence, substrate deprotonation is required for lanthionine formation at neutral pH. Metal coordination achieves a lowering of the pKa of the thiols and may also orient the resulting thiolate for regioselective nucleophilic attack onto the dehydroalanine (Dha) or dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) residues (Fig. 4). The zinc site in other enzymes that alkylate thiols (38Penner-Hahn J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) is thought to have a finely balanced coordination environment that on the one end facilitates a role as a Lewis acid to lower the pKa of the thiol substrates (39Rozema D.B. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13138-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Huang C.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15555-15562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and at the same time activates the thiolate for nucleophilic attack. The strong rate acceleration of thiolate alkylation by increasing the number of sulfur donors to the catalytic zinc has been established in several model studies on small molecule metal complexes with varying sets of donor ligands (42Wilker J.J.

Chem. 2006; 45: 4571-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, upon substrate coordination, the zinc in NisC is liganded by three thiolates in the model (Fig. 4). Based on the proximity of His212 to a water molecule that was liganded to zinc in the crystal structure (Fig. 2), our model further suggested that this residue might be the active site base that deprotonates the cysteines that coordinate to the zinc. In this scenario, Arg280, Tyr285, or a water molecule could be the active site acid that protonates the enolate intermediate formed upon nucleophilic attack of the cysteine onto the dehydroamino acids. When proposing the model, we recognized that alternative scenarios, such as use of His212 as active site acid to protonate the enolate, could not be ruled out, since no substrates or analogs were bound in the x-ray structure, and the binding pocket is rather shallow, allowing different binding conformations (11Li B. Yu J.-P. J. Brunzelle J.S. Moll G.N. van der Donk W.A. Nair S.K. Science. 2006; 311: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study, we used mutagenesis to probe the previously proposed model. The mutants involving the zinc ligands Cys284, Cys330, and His331 were all unable to achieve correct cyclization of the dehydrated NisA substrate, supporting an essential role for the zinc in the cyclization reaction. Similar results were very recently reported in a study on the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin in which the zinc ligands of the subtilin cyclase SpaC were mutated within the producing organism resulting in abolishment of subtilin production (53Helfrich M. Entian K-D. Stein T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the current work, we show that replacement of the cysteine ligands to the zinc with alanine results in severely compromised zinc content of the NisC mutant proteins. The H331A mutant contained higher amounts of zinc than the mutants involving the two cysteine ligands, but it, too, resulted in an inactive enzyme even when high concentrations of protein were used in the assay. In previous studies on enzymes catalyzing zinc-dependent alkylation of thiols, mutation of the metal ligands also resulted in completely inactive or catalytically severely impaired proteins for protein farnesyl transferase (54Harris C.M. Derdowski A.M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10554-10562Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the Ada protein (55Sun L.J. Yim C.K. Verdine G.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15915-15926Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and epoxyalkane: CoM transferase (60Krum J.G. Ellsworth H. Sargeant R.R. Rich G. Ensign S.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5005-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In all cases except the Ada protein, which contains four Cys ligands, mutations of one of the zinc ligands resulted in proteins with depleted amounts of Zn2+. The current work also sheds light on the importance of the other active site residues in NisC. Arg280 is not essential for cyclization, since both R280A and R280M were able to produce active nisin. These results agree with the recent in vivo mutagenesis of SpaC in which mutation of the corresponding Arg299 to Ala in Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633 did not abolish subtilin production (53Helfrich M. Entian K-D. Stein T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The finding that Arg280 is not critically important for cyclization activity may also explain why this residue, although completely conserved in the currently reported LanC proteins, is absent in the related LanM lantibiotic synthetases that contain a C-terminal domain with low but detectable sequence identity with the LanC proteins (Fig. 5). If Arg280 is not essential, it sheds doubt on a role as an active site general acid that protonates the enolate, leaving Tyr285, His212, or water to fulfill this role. Y285F-NisC showed activity in the in vitro cyclization assay, whereas Y285A did not. The latter result is consistent with in vivo mutagenesis of SpaC involving the corresponding tyrosine (Tyr304) (53Helfrich M. Entian K-D. Stein T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the Y304F-SpaC mutant was not reported. The activity of the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant of NisC suggests that the presence of an aromatic residue is critical but it argues against the involvement of this residue as active site acid. Like Arg280, Tyr285 is not conserved in the cyclization domain of the LanM proteins (Fig. 5). The data obtained with the mutants of Arg280 and Tyr285 leave the question of the identity of the active site acid that protonates the enolate intermediate. Although our data do not rule out the possibility that a water molecule fulfills this role, the findings reported here lead us to reevaluate the proposed role of His212 as a general base that deprotonates the thiol of the substrate. It is noteworthy that no such dedicated active site base for deprotonation of the thiol substrate is present in the crystal structures of farnesyl transferase (61Park H.W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), methionine synthase (62Pejchal R. Ludwig M.L. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e31Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 63Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Hilgers M.T. Romanchuk G. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3729-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (64Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Jiracek J. Castro C. Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Ludwig M.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1159-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Indeed, the pKa of the cysteine substrate of farnesyl transferase is depressed to about 6–7 upon metal coordination (39Rozema D.B. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13138-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Huang C.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 41Hightower K.E. Huang C.C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15555-15562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), indicating that an enzymatic base may not be essential. However, our mutagenesis studies show that both His212 and Asp141 that is hydrogen-bonded to His212 in the crystal structure of NisC are required for correct cyclization. Mutation of the corresponding His in the subtilin cyclase SpaC (His231) to Ala also aborted the in vivo production of subtilin. Thus, it is certainly possible that this pair is involved in the protonation of the enolate or, alternatively, in the electrophilic activation of the carbonyl group of the dehydroamino acids. The final residue that is not a zinc ligand that was mutated in this study is Trp283. This amino acid is conserved in both the LanC and LanM proteins (Fig. 5) and is located close to the active site in the NisC structure (Fig. 2). Based on the mutagenesis studies presented here, this residue is important for the stability of the protein, since mutants at this position were prone to precipitation and could not be purified. Whether it also plays a role in catalysis could therefore not be investigated in this study. Mutation of the analogous Trp302 in SpaC in a subtilin-producing strain also abolished lantibiotic production, confirming the importance of the residue (53Helfrich M. Entian K-D. Stein T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In summary, this study shows that mutation of the ligands to the zinc in lantibiotic cyclases abolishes correct macrocyclization of the dehydrated NisA substrate. The results presented also indicate that His212 and Asp141 are critical to control cyclization, whereas Arg280 and Tyr285 are not absolutely required. Definitive assignment of the role of His212 as either general acid or general base will require a co-crystal structure of the substrate or substrate analog with the enzyme. The mutants reported herein may facilitate obtaining such a structure. Download .pdf (.29 MB) Help with pdf files"

Analysis of 100 ALS-associated mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) shows that these are site-selective with a preference to decrease the proteins' net repulsive charge. For each SOD1 monomer this charge is normally -6. Because biomolecules as a rule maintain net negative charge to assure solubility in the cellular interior, the result lends support to the hypothesis of protein aggregation as an initiating event in the ALS pathogenesis. The strength of the preferential reduction of repulsive charge is higher in SOD1-associated ALS than in other inherited protein disorders.

At the molecular level, studies of how the individual ALS-associated mutations affect the SOD1 molecule have further indicated protein stability as an important factor in the disease mechanism (19Khare S.D.

In this study, we shed further light on the disease-provoking properties of the SOD1 molecule by examining bioinformatically the chemical nature of 100 ALS-associated missense mutations. The results reveal an additional disease factor; the mutations have an overall tendency to decrease the net negative charge of the proteins. The negative charge repulsion that generally assures macromolecular solubility in vivo is diminished. This tendency is stronger for ALS mutations than in other hereditary protein disorders and cannot be discerned in the interspecies variability of the SOD1 sequence. In the few contrasting cases where the SOD1 mutations produce an increased repulsive charge, the side chain substitution tends also to be structurally obstructive and to occur in strictly conserved positions. That is, the opposed effect of increased repulsive charge is not sufficiently strong to compensate for the accompanying penalties in protein stability. The observation shows that the decreased net negative charge of SOD1 is a critical contributory factor to the ability of the mutation to cause neural damage. Taken together with the impact of decreased protein stability, the data also provide genetic support for the idea that abnormal associative processes involving SOD1 molecules play a key role in the ALS mechanism. Mutation Data—In this study we analyze missense mutations in SOD1 and eight other disease-associated genes. For each gene we only count mutations resulting in a unique amino acid substitution, i.e. multiple mutations at a site resulting in the same amino acid is only counted as one. This is done because we are interested in the effect of the mutations at the protein level. Table 1 shows an overview of the genes studied and the resources used to download the mutations. TTR was selected because the majority of the mutations are amyloidogenic (26Sekijima Y. Wiseman R.L. Matteson J. Hammarstrom P. Miller S.R. Sawkar A.R. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and represent a diverse set of phenotypes. For G6PD we only include type I mutations because Miller and Kumar (27Miller M.P.

Coding sequences from a total of 22201 genes were analyzed. Charge—In this study we are interested in how disease mutations affect the total charge of the wild type protein. We consider Arg and Lys as positively charged and Asp and Glu as negative. All of the other amino acids are neutral in our calculations including His, which is usually not protonated at pH 7 under physiological conditions. Test for Charge Selectivity—To quantify these statements, we made χ2 tests of how well the charge distributions of the disease mutations are described by the charge distributions of the models. To this end we classify each mutation into one of three categories: +, -, or 0 depending on whether the mutation increases, decreases, or leaves unchanged the charge of the wild type protein. Because a mutation must belong to one of the categories, the number of degrees of freedom is two. We use each model to calculate the expected number of mutations in each category and compare it with the observed values. χ2 tests are then performed to accept or reject the null hypothesis (the model) (see Table 2).TABLE 2Charge bias ( c¯) of disease-associated mutations compared with the values generated for the interspecies variation, random mutations, and the selective site modelGeneChargeWTDisease c¯Interspecies c¯Charge distributionRandom c¯Charge distributionSelective site c¯Charge distributionχ2Pχ2Pχ2PSOD1-60.30 ± 0.060.06 ± 0.0710.06.6e-030.05 ± 0.0212.81.6e-030.15 ± 0.036.20.05TTR-50.16 ± 0.060.01 ± 0.068.10.020.05 ± 0.023.80.150.11 ± 0.031.60.45CFTR190.11 ± 0.03-0.01 ± 0.01246<1.0e-090.03 ± 0.0137.86.2e-090.07 ± 0.0125.52.9e-06PAX6110.06 ± 0.090.0 ± 0.013.51.2e-030.04 ± 0.016.50.039-0.05 ± 0.0310.64.9e-03TSC2-30.03 ± 0.09-0.02 ± 0.02124<1.0e-090.04 ± 0.016.90.0320.03 ± 0.032.70.25RS1-40.0 ± 0.090.0 ± 0.04180<1.0e-090.06 ± 0.0215.54.2e-040.02 ± 0.038.50.01PAH-60.00 ± 0.04-0.06 ± 0.0941.01.3e-090.04 ± 0.012.480.280.05 ± 0.023.10.22L1CAM-24-0.1 ± 0.1-0.05 ± 0.030.20.890.05 ± 0.013.20.20-0.06 ± 0.040.760.68G6PD-4-0.1 ± 0.1-0.07 ± 0.041.90.380.04 ± 0.013.80.150.00 ± 0.041.50.47 Open table in a new tab Codon Bias: Establishing the Base Line for Genetic Variation—Upon examination of how ALS-associated missense mutations affect the charge of SOD1, it is necessary first to account for the intrinsic bias of the genetic code. The three nucleotides of each codon allow at most nine unique missense mutations, representing only a subset of the 20 amino acids. Consequently, when subjected to mutations, different amino acids will have different propensities for altering the charge. This propensity is determined by the exact codons used in the human genome (supplemental Table S1). For simplicity, we define ci as the charge difference between the new and original amino acid, and c¯ as the average over the allowed set of unique missense mutations (M). c¯=1MΣci1 c¯ varies considerably between the different codons, and the largest variations are observed for the codons encoding charged amino acids (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg). This is just because a mutation in a charged position is most likely to result in a neutral residue. If all of the codons were used with the same probability, i.e. 1/61, random mutations would on the whole decrease the charge ( c¯ =-0.028). However, this is not the case. For human genes there is instead a small propensity for mutations to increase the charge, ( c¯ =-0.036) (supplemental Table S1). On top of this bias, there is also a biological preference for certain types of mutations caused by variable susceptibility of the different codons to become chemically modified in vivo (29Antonarakis S.E. Krawczak M. Cooper D.N. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2000; 159 (, (Suppl. 3) -S178): S173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as will be discussed below. Accordingly, mutations can modulate the charge in two different ways: by selection of the sites for mutation and by selection of the mutations themselves. For example, increased positive charge can result either from random mutations in sites with a negative charge or from mutations that selectively favor positive side chains. Charge Bias of ALS-associated SOD1 Mutations: Comparison with Other Disease Genes—The 100 ALS-associated mutations analyzed in this study have been obtained from the public data base alsod1.iop.kcl.ac.uk/ and are outlined in Fig. 1. According to Equation 1, the average charge difference, c¯, induced by these mutations is +0.30. This value is an order of magnitude larger than what is expected for random mutations (see above). Because the net charge of wild type SOD1 is -6, this means that there is a preference for the ALS mutations to reduce the net negative charge of the proteins. This subset of ALS mutations contribute thus to decrease the Coulombic repulsion between the individual SOD1 molecules. To compare the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations with disease-associated mutations in other proteins, we use two different sets of genes. The first set includes eight genes (Table 1). Seven of these have previously been used by Miller and Kumar (27Miller M.P. Kumar S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). As an additional disease gene, we include TTR coupled to familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system amyloidoses (26Sekijima Y. Wiseman R.L. Matteson J. Hammarstrom P. Miller S.R. Sawkar A.R. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 73-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), diseases that resemble SOD1-associated ALS in several respects. In all cases, the genes have a large number of recorded mutations (Table 1). Interestingly, the charge bias of SOD1 is substantially higher than observed for the other genes (Table 2). Second to SOD1 is TTR with c¯ = 0.16. It is also apparent that c¯ exhibits a wide variation among the nine genes ranging from 0.30 for SOD1 to -0.1 for L1CAM and G6PD. However, only for SOD1 and TTR do the disease mutations result in a decrease of the net negative charge (Table 2). The similarity between SOD1 and TTR is possibly coupled to the disease mechanism of these proteins; both familial amyloid polyneuropathy, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system amyloidoses (26Sekijima Y. Wiseman R.L. Matteson J. Hammarstrom P. Miller S.R. Sawkar A.R. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 73-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and ALS (30Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) are dominantly inherited gain-of-toxic function disorders accompanied by protein aggregation. Second, we compared the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations with all 920 disease-associated genes listed in the SWISSPROT data base in April 2006 (31Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Wu C.H. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B. Ferro S. Gasteiger E. Huang H. Lopez R. Magrane M. Martin M.J. Natale D.A. O'Donovan C. Redaschi N. Yeh L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). For proteins with positive net charge, we multiplied c¯ with -1 to monitor directly how the mutations affect their Coulombic interactions. The results show that among the 76 genes with more than 50 known disease mutations SOD1 has the second largest c¯, and among the 159 genes with more than 25 mutations SOD1 has the fourth largest c¯ (Fig. 2). Comparison with genes with fewer mutations yields an overall similar picture but with higher statistical errors. On this basis, we conclude that the preference of ALS mutations to decrease the net negative charge of individual protein molecules is, on the whole, atypical for disease genes. An explanation for this mismatch could be that ALS is a protein misfolding/aggregation disorder that represents only a small subset of the disease-associated genes in the data set. The mechanism of such disorders is structural and triggered by the gain of new cytotoxic properties rather than the loss of protein function.FIGURE 2Charge bias ( c¯) of disease mutations in 159 genes with more than 25 known mutations. For simplicity of comparison, the sign of c¯ has been reversed for all genes with a positive wild type charge.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Models of Mutational Variability: Establishing the Origin of the Charge Bias—To examine the origin of the charge bias, the mutational spectrum of each disease was compared with three different models of amino acid substitutions: (a) The “interspecies” model describes the evolutionary amino acid variation between different species. This model is obtained by aligning the human amino acid sequence to a set of sequences from other vertebrates in SWISSPROT (31Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Wu C.H. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B. Ferro S. Gasteiger E. Huang H. Lopez R. Magrane M. Martin M.J. Natale D.A. O'Donovan C. Redaschi N. Yeh L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The number of sequences used for each gene are listed in Table 1, and the sequences were aligned with the T-Coffee software using default parameters (32Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). (b) The “random” model consists of all amino acid substitutions that can result from single nucleotide substitutions in the wild type sequence. Comparison with this model shows to what extent the spectrum of observed disease mutations is caused by random mutations in all sites of the wild type gene. (c) The “selective site” model is the same as the random model but counts only substitutions occurring in disease-harboring sites. The three models are compared with the disease mutations of SOD1 and the eight other genes in Table 2. Interspecies Variability Is Approximately Charge Neutral—From the data in Table 2 and Fig. 3, it is apparent that the variation in amino acid composition across different species yields only small values of c¯. With the exception of L1CAM and G6PD, c¯ is within one standard deviation of zero for all genes. Miller and Kumar (27Miller M.P. Kumar S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) showed that for L1CAM, G6PD, PAX6, CFTR, PAH, and RS1, the disease-associated mutations are generally more extreme than those observed in the interspecies variability. Therefore it is not surprising that the interspecies model poorly reproduces c¯ for the disease mutations. It is nevertheless interesting to note that, although decreased net repulsive charge seems to be a disease factor in ALS, the SOD1 net charge varies quite substantially across the different vertebrates, ranging from -2 in red deer to -6 in humans. An explanation for this tolerance to accommodate different net charge could be that the life span of other vertebrates is simply too short to develop ALS (the mean age of onset of ALS associated with SOD1 gene mutations is 46-47 years) or that the non-charge-related propensity of SOD1 to undergo pathogenic misfolding is different for different species. The SOD1 Charge Bias Is Not Due to Unusual Codon Composition—In the random model, where the result depends only on the sequence composition of the different genes, the values of c¯ turn out relatively small and show little variation (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Accordingly, it can be concluded that the overall codon composition shows little difference between the various disease-associated genes, at least with respect to their intrinsic susceptibility to biasing the charge upon random mutation. This, in turn, means that the atypical c¯ observed for ALS-associated SOD1 mutations is not caused by an unusual codon composition. ALS Mutations Are Site-selective by Not Occurring in Positions with Positive Charge—Notably, the variation of the c¯ values becomes much wider when we restrict the random mutations to disease-harboring sites (Table 2). The result shows that the actual types of residues targeted for mutation differ between the different diseases. We also note that the selective site model better reproduces the disease mutations than the random model, i.e. the correlation with the observed values of c¯ improves (Fig. 3). The improvement is particularly clear for SOD1, revealing that the ALS mutations are site-selective. To establish the nature of this site selectivity, we tested the hypothesis that the ALS mutations occur with equal probability in sites with negative, positive and neutral charge. From Table 3 we see that there are 82 mutations in neutral sites, 17 in negative sites, and only one in a positively charged site, compared with expected values of 73.8, 15.5, and 10.7, respectively (Fig. 4). The mismatch shows that the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations are not randomly distributed but site-selective by being underrepresented in positions with positively charged side chains. With the exception for RS1, such pronounced selectivity among charged amino acid positions is not observed for mutations in the other disease-associated proteins in Table 3 (supplemental Table S2). For TTR with a slightly lower c¯ value of 0.16, the deviation from a random distribution is less clear. For this protein 80 mutations are found in neutral sites, 15 in negative sites, and 5 in positively charged sites compared with expected values of 74.8, 15.3, and 10.2, respectively. Because disease-causing mutations, on the whole, are most frequently found in conserved sites (27Miller M.P. Kumar S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we tested also whether the selection of sites could be based on the degree of conservation rather than on the charge itself. For SOD1, 46.4% of the amino acid positions are strictly conserved in vertebrates, and these positions harbor 62% of the ALS mutations (Fig. 1). Even so, SOD1 displays no clear difference in the degree of conservation between negatively and positively charged sites (supplemental Table S2), reinforcing the idea that for this gene the sites for disease-provoking mutations are influenced by charge. In notable contrast, the disease-associated TTR mutations indicate no preference for conserved sites.TABLE 3The number of ALS-associated SOD1 mutations in sites with positive, negative, and neutral charges and to what extent they alter the proteins' net repulsive chargeDisease sitesMutationsCharge preferencesTypeNo. of sitesTotal no. of mutationsDecreased repulsionIncreased repulsionCharge neutralc¯X2PAny6710033 (23.0)6 (9.4)61 (67.6)0.3 (0.15)6.20.05+11 (10.7)0 (0)1 (1)0 (0)-1017 (15.5)17 (14.4)0 (0)0 (2.6)1.2 (0.95)2.80.2405682 (73.8)16 (8.6)5 (8.0)61 (65.4)0.13 (0.01)7.60.02 Open table in a new tab Indications of a Selective Preference for Mutation to Arginine—To examine further the degree of randomness of the ALS-provoking mutations, the neutral and negative sites were also analyzed separately (Fig. 3). Compared with the full set of mutations, the selective site model better reproduces c¯ for the mutations in negative sites, whereas it is poorer for the neutral sites (Table 3). Thus, within the negative sites, the identity of the ALS mutations approximately matches a random distribution. Yet, it is interesting to note that all the 17 mutations in negative sites make the overall repulsive charge smaller, although the selective site model allows charge-preserving mutations. The c¯ value for negative sites ( c¯ = 1.2) is accordingly higher than that predicted by the selective site model ( c¯ = 0.95), indicating that mutations within this group are to some degree also charge-selective (Table 3). This deviation from a random pattern is emphasized by an even weaker correlation with the selective site model for the neutral sites. Upon restricting the analysis to neutral sites, the p value drops to 0.02; only 5 of the 82 mutations in neutral sites decrease the charge, whereas 16 increase it. Moreover, the selective site model predicts no charge bias for these sites ( c¯ = 0.01), although the observed bias is c¯ = 0.13. Mutations to positively charged side chains are overrepresented. Most significantly, 15 of the 82 ALS mutations in neutral sites are to Arg compared with an expected value of 7 from the selective site model (supplemental Table S3). In apparent contrast, there is only one mutation to Lys, but 1.68 expected. Although the detailed mechanism of this selectivity is not yet established, it is apparent that the identity of the targeted side chain plays a key role; of the 15 mutations to Arg, 5 are from Gly and 4 from His (Fig. 1). Apparently there is a biological preference for certain mutations to occur that goes beyond the simple assumptions used in the present analysis. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the ALS mutations in SOD1 are not only selective with respect to the charge of the targeted residue but also to other features that bias the outcome toward positive values of c¯. ALS Mutations with Increased Repulsive Charge: the Apparent Exceptions That Confirm the Rule—Folding studies of SOD1 have previously demonstrated that ALS mutants that do not affect the protein charge are commonly associated with decreased protein stability (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), either as direct effects on the monomer or dimer structures or as a result of impaired ability to coordinate the metal ions. The same conclusions can be drawn from thermal unfolding studies (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J.

Kassmann C.J. Lo T.P. Bruns C.K. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 601-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, these SOD1 stability losses are not always observed for ALS mutations that decrease the net negative charge of the proteins. Representative examples of such mutations are E100K, D101N, D124V, D125H, and N139K (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), underpinning the idea that ALS can be triggered either by decreased protein stability or by decreased repulsive forces between individual molecules (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this perspective it is interesting that there are also some ALS-associated mutations that actually increase the net repulsive charge of the SOD1 molecule, i.e. V7E, G41D, N86D, G93D, R115G, and G141D (Fig. 4). However, these opposing mutations seem at the same time severely destabilizing by being sterically obstructive, and with the sole exception of G141D, they all occur in strictly conserved sequence positions. V7E displays a thermal midpoint that is lowered by 6.6 degrees (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) matching the melting characteristics of the mutant L144F that is destabilized by ∼2 kcal/mol (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Similarly, the apo monomer of G41D is just partly folded in physiological buffer (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), N86D is a type 2 mutation with severely weakened dimer interface (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), 3R. Bystroöm and M. Oliveberg, unpublished observations. and G93D displays a thermal stability significantly lower than that of V7E (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A.

The only mutations for which there are yet no stability data are R115G and G141D, even though it can be noted that the former is directly interfering with the dimer interface (36Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y. Getzoff E.D. Hu P. Herzfeldt B. Roos R.P. Science. 1993; 261: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), and the latter involves a substitution that falls outside the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (37Gunasekaran K. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, the ALS mutations with increased repulsive charge can be seen as the exceptions that confirm the rule. Protein disease seems to rely on the combined action of stability and charge, and the apparent benefit of increased repulsive charge is in these cases insufficient to compensate for the accompanying losses in protein stability. In addition, it is reasonable to assume that the gain of cytotoxicity can depend on more specific sequence features like those modulating the intrinsic aggregation propensity of the coil (38Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 39Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat.

Biol. 2006; 16: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) or the aggregation gatekeepers preventing the folded structures from assembling erroneously with one another (41Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 42Thirumalai D. Klimov D.K. Dima R.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 146-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For example, the relatively high fraction of ALS mutations occurring in Gly positions could partly be explained by the intrinsic ability of the glycine residues to inhibit aggregation, a feature that appears to be evolutionarily conserved feature in other systems (43Parrini C. Taddei N. Ramazzotti M. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Chiti F. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). With the present set of ALS-associated SOD1 mutations, however, we have not been able to explicitly identify such sequence factors. The major reason is that there are as yet no disease mutations that cannot simply be accounted for by decreased SOD1 stability or decreased repulsive charge. Implications for the ALS Mechanism—Because the ALS-associated SOD1 mutations with only few exceptions have full penetrance (44Andersen P.M. Restagno G. Stewart H.G. Chio A. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 55: 298-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and inevitably lead to death, the chemical signatures of these mutations report directly on the factors triggering neurodegeneration at a molecular level. On this basis we conclude that mutations that decrease the proteins net repulsive charge not only affect the disease progression, as has been implicated earlier (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but actually contribute to trigger neural damage. Molecular features that are solely modulating would not have full disease penetrance. From the cases where the ALS mutations are charge neutral or even increase the charge repulsion, we can also conclude that a second ALS-promoting factor is decreased protein stability (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In other words, ALS can be triggered either by SOD1 mutations that alter the protein charge or by SOD1 mutations that decrease the protein stability. Representative examples of ALS mutations that seem to affect mainly the repulsive charge are E100K, D101N, and N139K (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, ALS mutations that seem to selectively decrease the SOD1 stability are A4V, L84V, and L106V (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, there are ALS mutations that reduce both charge and stability, e.g. H43R, D90A, and E100G (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), as well as mutations where the disease factors partly, but not sufficiently, compensate one another, e.g. V7E (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10516-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), G41D (20Lindberg M.J. Bystrom R. Boknas N. Andersen P.M. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9754-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and G93D (33Rodriguez J.A. Shaw B.F. Durazo A. Sohn S.H. Doucette P.A. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Eggers D.K. Tiwari A.

Meiering E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6184-6193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Altogether this relation to decreased charge and stability constitutes the hallmark for an underlying aggregation process. Notably, aggregation refers here not only to the assembly of identical copies of SOD1 molecules but includes also abnormal interactions between SOD1 and other negatively charged biomolecules, e.g. membranes, DNA/RNA, and other proteins. Moreover, the hereditary penetrance of these factors suggests that this aggregation process is not only a secondary disease event but is actually involved in triggering neurodegeneration in ALS.

However, its role in cancer is unknown, and its biochemical properties are not well established. Here we found a marked increase in MT6-MMP expression within in situ dysplasia and invasive cancer in 61 samples of human colon cancer. Expression of MT6-MMP in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells promoted tumori-genesis in nude mice. Histologically, the MT6-MMP-expressing tumors demonstrated an infiltrative leading edge in contrast to a rounded leading edge in vector control tumors. Biochemical and biosynthesis analyses revealed that MT6-MMP displayed on the cell surface exists as a major form of 120 kDa that likely represents enzyme homodimers linked by disulfide bonds. Upon reduction, a single 57-kDa active MT6-MMP was detected. Interestingly, neither membrane-anchored nor phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-released MT6-MMPs were found to be associated with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and did not activate pro-gelatinases (pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9) even in the presence of exogenous TIMP-2 or TIMP-1. A catalytic domain of MT6-MMP was inhibited preferentially by TIMP-1 (Ki = 0.2 nm) over TIMP-2 (Ki = 2.0 nm), because of a slower association rate. These results show that MT6-MMP may play a role in colon cancer and exhibit unique biochemical and structural properties that may regulate proteolytic function at the cell surface.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 9-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The MMP family includes secreted and membrane-anchored proteases (3Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and thus they are mediators of proteolysis in the pericellular space and at the cell surface. The membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily includes six members, four of which are anchored to the plasma membrane via a transmembrane domain (MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, and MMP24, also referred to as MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMP, respectively) and two of which are membrane-anchored via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety (MMP17 and MMP25, referred to as MT4- and MT6-MMP, respectively) (4Hernandez-Barrantes S.

Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is a significant amount of information on the transmembrane MT-MMPs, little is known about the properties and functions of GPI-anchored MT-MMPs. MT6-MMP was originally cloned from human leukocytes (6Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and from a fetal liver cDNA library (7Velasco G. Cal S. Merlos-Suarez A. Ferrando A.A. Alvarez S. Nakano A. Arribas J. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar). In human normal tissues, MT6-MMP mRNA is predominantly expressed in leukocytes (polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes) but is also detected in lung and spleen (6Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Velasco G. Cal S. Merlos-Suarez A. Ferrando A.A. Alvarez S. Nakano A. Arribas J. Lopez-Otin C.

Brain. 2003; 126: 2738-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Because of its abundance in leukocytes, MT6-MMP is also known as leukolysin (6Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Functional studies with a recombinant catalytic domain showed that MT6-MMP can degrade various extracellular matrix components, including type IV collagen, gelatin, fibrin, fibronectin, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, and dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (9English W.R. Velasco G. Stracke J.O. Knauper V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that MT6-MMP may contribute to pericellular extracellular matrix degradation. MT6-MMP was also shown to inactivate α1-proteinase inhibitor (10Nie J. Pei D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and thus may play a role in inflammation (11Sosne G. Christopherson P.L. Barrett R.P. Fridman R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 2388-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), consistent with its high expression in leukocytes. Several transmembrane MT-MMPs initiate a cascade of zymogen activation at the cell surface by promoting the activation of pro-MMP-2 (5Zucker S. Pei D. Cao J. Lopez-Otin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some MT-MMPs can also partner with members of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) family to accomplish pro-MMP-2 activation. This process, which has been demonstrated with MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP, involves the generation of a ternary complex on the cell surface, which is formed by an active MT-MMP, TIMP-2, or TIMP-3 and pro-MMP-2 (12Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 13Zhao H. Bernardo M.M.

The activation of pro-MMP-2 is then initiated by a neighboring TIMP-free MT-MMP. However, conflicting results were reported regarding the ability of MT6-MMP to accomplish pro-MMP-2 activation (9English W.R. Velasco G. Stracke J.O. Knauper V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Kojima S. Itoh Y. Matsumoto S. Masuho Y. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Nie J. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6758-6762PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of TIMP-2 was not examined. MT6-MMP is inhibited by both TIMP-2 and TIMP-1 (9English W.R. Velasco G. Stracke J.O. Knauper V. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which sets it apart from other MT-MMPs, such as MT1-MMP, known to be insensitive to TIMP-1. TIMP-1 inhibition of MT6-MMP raises the question as to whether MT6-MMP can accomplish the surface activation of pro-MMP-9, which is known to bind TIMP-1, in a process analogous to the ternary complex mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation. Evidence indicates that several MT-MMPs are highly expressed in cancer tissues and play a role in cancer progression (5Zucker S. Pei D. Cao J. Lopez-Otin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies showed high levels of MT6-MMP mRNA expression in brain, colon, and urothelial and prostate cancers (7Velasco G. Cal S.

However, the localization of MT6-MMP protein in cancer tissues and its role in cancer progression remain to be investigated. To gain more insight into the expression and properties of MT6-MMP, we examined the expression of MT6-MMP by immunohistochemistry in human colon cancer tissues, its role in tumorigenicity, and its properties when overexpressed in colon cancer cell lines.

Human TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A recombinant catalytic domain of human MT6-MMP expressed in Escherichia coli was a generous gift from Dr. Alex Strongin (The Burnham Institute, San Diego). Human recombinant Clusterin was purchased from Axxora, LLC (San Diego). The rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) against the hinge region (Ab39031) of MT6-MMP was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Rabbit pAb against the C-terminal end (RP2-MMP-25) or the prodomain (RP4-MMP-25) of human MT6-MMP were from Triple Point Biologics (Forest Grove, OR).

The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human MT6-MMP (mAb1142) with unknown epitope was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide (107RYALSGSVWKKRTLT) from the catalytic domain of human MT6-MMP was produced by Invitrogen and referred to as pAb107. The specificity of pAb107 for MT6-MMP was tested by immunoblot analysis using purified recombinant catalytic domains of all human MT-MMPs (MT1-MMP to MT5-MMP) (supplemental Fig. 1), which were purchased from Calbiochem. Two mouse mAbs against human Clusterin were purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (RDI-CLUSTabm-41D, Flanders, NJ), and Axxora, LLC (ALX-804-126-C100), respectively. Rabbit pAbs to human caveolin were from BD Biosciences. The mAb against human TIMP-1 (IM32L) was from Calbiochem. The mAb101 to human TIMP-2 was described previously (20Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M.

The mAb MAB050 against polyhistidine was from R&D Systems. The mAb to human β-actin was from Sigma. cDNA Constructs—The full-length human MT6-MMP cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. D. Pei, University of Minnesota) was cloned into the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1™/myc-His(-)A (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-MT6 for stable transfection. The human MT6-MMP cDNA was also cloned into the pTF7-EMCV-1 vector for expression in the vaccinia system (21Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The correct sequences of the insert and junctions in the vectors were verified by DNA sequencing of both strands. The pTF7-EMCV-1 expression vector containing human MT6-MMP cDNA under control of the T7 promoter was used to generate an MT6-MMP-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF-MT6) by homologous recombination, as described previously (21Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A chimeric GPI-anchored human pro-MT1-MMP (GPI-MT1) containing the GPI-anchoring sequence of MT6-MMP (Ala539–Arg562) cloned in the pTF7-EMCV-1 expression vector was described previously (22Toth M. Sohail A. Mobashery S. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Tissue Samples and Immunohistological Analyses—Representative tissues were collected from archived human colon cancer resection specimens in the Department of Pathology at the University of Chicago under an IRB-approved protocol. Paired samples of invasive colonic adenocarcinoma and adjacent uninvolved benign colon from 61 patients were used to create tissue microarrays using from paraffin-embedded tissue using an ATA-27 automated arrayer (Beecher Systems, Sun Prairie, WI). Each patient's specimen was represented by four tissue cores, two each of tumor and benign tissue. Four-micron-thick sections of the arrays were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving slides in 7.5 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. After a brief rinse in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8.0, endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific background staining were blocked by incubating for 30 min in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol followed by 30 min in 0.3% bovine serum albumin in TBS. Slides were rinsed for 2 min each in TBS, TBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100, and TBS followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit antiserum pAb107 to human MT6-MMP (1:400 dilution). Slides were then rinsed in TBS and incubated for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer (Envision+ System, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). This incubation was followed by additional TBS rinses, visualization with diaminobenzidine chromogen (DAKO), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls used preimmune rabbit serum in place of the primary antibody. The sections were blindly analyzed for histopathological features by two pathologists (C. R. Weber and J. R. Turner). Intensity of staining in the epithelial cells of duplicate tumor and paired benign control samples was scored semi-quantitatively from 0 to2(0 = negative, 1 = weak staining, and 2 = strong staining). Staining scores for each patient were calculated as the mean score of the duplicate samples. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA of SW480, HCT-116, FET, and HT-29 cells was extracted with RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA from human polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells was kindly provided by Dr. Sosne (Wayne State University School of Medicine). RT-PCR was performed with 1 μg of each total RNA sample using SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subsequently HotStar Taq® master mix kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers' instructions. The sequences of the specific primers (IDT, Coralville, IA) for human MT6-MMP used are as follows: forward, 5′-ATG GCC TGC AGC AAC TCT AT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGG GGC CTT TGA AGA AGA AA-3′. Thirty two cycles of PCR were performed with 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was also amplified and used as an internal control. The sequences of the human GAPDH primers (IDT) are as follows: forward, 5′-CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC-3′. The amplified genes were resolved by 1% agarose gels and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Generation of Stable HT-29 and HCT-116 Transfectants—HT-29 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells were grown until 60–80% confluence. The cells were then transfected with pcDNA3.1-MT6 or pcDNA3.1 without insert (referred to as EV). Twenty four hours later, the cells were grown in complete medium supplemented with geneticin (500 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for selection. Single clones were then selected from pooled populations by serial dilutions using standard protocols. In some studies, two to three independent clones from each transfectant (MT6 and EV) of HCT-116 and HT-29 cells were pooled to generate the MT6-MMP pools (referred to as MT6-HCT and MT6-HT) and the EV pools (referred to as EV-HCT and EV-HT). Co-infection and Infection-Transfection Procedures—vTF7-3, a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was described previously (21Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). BS-C-1 cells were co-infected with 1 plaque-forming unit/cell each of vTF-MT6 and vTF7-3 in infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS and antibiotics) for 45 min. As a control, BS-C-1 cells in parallel wells were infected only with the vTF7-3 virus. In some experiments, BS-C-1 cells were co-infected to express MT6-MMP with pro-MMP-9 or pro-MMP-2 using the appropriate recombinant viruses (13Zhao H. Bernardo M.M. Osenkowski P. Sohail A. Pei D. Nagase H. Kashiwagi M. Soloway P.D. DeClerck Y.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8592-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For infection-transfection, BS-C-1 cells were infected with vTF7-3 virus followed by transfection with plasmid vector encoding for MT6-MMP, MT1-MMP, or GPI-MT1 as described previously (20Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The cells were then analyzed for MT-MMP expression by immunoblot analyses or for ability to promote pro-gelatinase activation as described below. Tumorigenicity Assays—All experimental procedures were performed on 4-week-old female NCr nude mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) according to the Animal Welfare Regulations at Wayne State University. HCT-116 transfectants (MT6 clone M2 and EV clone E2 and pooled clones MT6-HCT and EV-HCT) were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen). Each mouse was inoculated subcutaneously with 3 × 106 cells in 100 μl of PBS. The volume of the tumor was measured three times a week with a caliper, using the formula V = LW2 × 0.4 (where V is volume (mm3); L is biggest diameter (mm); W is smallest diameter (mm)). Data were analyzed for statistical significance by unpaired t test with Welch correction using the GraphPad InStat® version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). The differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. The mice were euthanized 4–5 weeks after tumor was inoculated, and the tumors were harvested and fixed in formalin or frozen for histopathological analyses. Histopathological Analyses of Tumor Xenografts—Formalin-fixed tumors were embedded in paraffin. Four-micron-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and tumor invasiveness was calculated by determining the fraction of length along the tumor/stroma interface that showed an irregular invasive, rather than smooth pushing, border. The sections were blindly analyzed for histopathological features by two pathologists (C. R. Weber and J. R. Turner). To examine the expression of MT6-MMP in the tumor xenograft, frozen tumors (50 mg each) were homogenized in 500 μl of cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 60 mm β-octyl glucoside, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (PI) mixture mix (Roche Applied Science)) using a Tissue Tearor™ (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA procedure (Pierce). The lysates (250 μg each) were pre-absorbed with immobilized protein A beads (Pierce) and centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with either 4 μg/ml pAb Ab39031 to the hinge region of MT6-MMP or rabbit IgG and protein A beads. The immunoprecipitates were mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer, with or without β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analyses using anti-MT6-MMP mAb1142. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were lysed with cold lysis buffer. In some experiments, the lysis buffer was supplemented with freshly added 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) before cell solubilization. Briefly, the cells were incubated with lysis buffer for 1 h on ice and centrifuged (14,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined by the BCA procedure (Pierce). An aliquot of each lysate was mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with or without 1% β-ME, boiled (95 °C, 5 min), and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analyses using various antibodies. Crude Plasma Membrane Fractions—Confluent MT6-HCT cells from three 150-mm culture dishes were scraped in cold PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA. The cells were recovered by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 50 mm NaCl, and 8.5% sucrose supplemented with PI mixture mix. The cells were homogenized by passing though 22½-gauge needle, 20 times on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged (18,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) to remove cell organelles. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged (200,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors and stored at -80 °C until used. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA procedure. PI-PLC Treatment—Confluent HT-29 and HCT-116 transfectants in 6-well plates were washed with cold PBS and treated with 0.3 units/well of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS for 30 min on ice. The supernatant was clarified and concentrated with Microcon® centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in the presence of the PI mix. An aliquot of each concentrated supernatant was mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with or without β-ME, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. PMN Cell Isolation—Lysates of human PMNs were kindly provided by Dr. Gabriel Sosne (Wayne State University School of Medicine). Briefly, freshly drawn blood in 8-ml EDTA vacutainers was centrifuged at ∼700 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The leukocyte-rich plasma and upper layer were transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge tube and subjected to gradient centrifugation through a layer of Histopaque®-1077 reagent over a layer of Histopaque®-1119 reagent (Sigma) (volume ratio blood, 1077:1119 = 2:1:1) at ∼700 × g for 30 min at room temperature. PMNs enriched at the interface of Histopaque®-1077 and -1119 were carefully collected and washed with PBS at room temperature and pelleted (∼700 × g, 5 min, room temperature). The lysate of PMNs was prepared by lysing ∼107 cells in 0.5 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with PI mix). An aliquot of the lysate was mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with or without β-ME, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Successive Detergent Extraction of Lipid Rafts—The procedure was adapted from Solomon et al. (23Solomon K.R. Mallory M.A. Finberg R.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were scraped in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) on ice. An equal volume of the same buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and the PI mix was added. The tube contents were gently mixed and incubated on ice for 30 min. Insoluble fractions were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The Triton-soluble protein fraction was collected and labeled as nonlipid raft fraction. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm β-octyl glucoside, and PI mix). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the cellular debris, insoluble fraction, was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g), and β-octyl glucoside soluble protein was marked as lipid raft fraction. An aliquot of the nonlipid raft (referred to as S fraction) and lipid raft (referred to as I fraction) fractions were mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with or without β-ME, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using various anti-MT6-MMP antibodies. The blots were reprobed with antibodies to human caveolin, a lipid raft protein. Pulse-Chase Analyses—MT6-HCT cells (80% confluent) in 6-well plates were incubated for 30 min with 1 ml/well of starving medium (DMEM without methionine and cysteine supplemented with 10 mm HEPES). The cells were then pulsed with 500 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine in starvation medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed FBS (0.5 ml/well) for 15 min at 37 °C. After the pulse, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with PBS before the addition of 1 ml/well chase medium (DMEM with 1% dialyzed FBS, 5 mm methionine, and 5 mm cysteine). At the end of the chase period (0–120 min at 37 °C), the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with cold lysis buffer as described before. The lysates were clarified by a brief centrifugation and were pre-absorbed with immobilized protein A beads (Pierce). The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either MT6-MMP antibodies or rabbit IgG (Pierce) and immobilized protein A beads. The immunoprecipitates were mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer, with or without β-ME, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Pro-gelatinase Activation Assays—These assays were carried out with infected BS-C-1 cells and with the HT-29 and HCT-116 transfectants. Briefly, BS-C-1 cells were co-infected to express wild type MT6-MMP and MT1-MMP or infected with control virus as described above. Four hour post-infection, the cells were incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM supplemented without or with various amounts (0–50 nm) of human recombinant TIMP-2 or TIMP-1. Then the media were aspirated and the cells were gently washed with DMEM to remove unbound TIMPs. The cells were then incubated (up to 8 h at 37 °C) with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 nm purified pro-MMP-2 or pro-MMP-9. The media were collected, and the cells were lysed with lysis buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2108167859,"Repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT) induce long-term facilitation (LTF) of the synapses between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. To explore how apCAM downregulation at the plasma membrane and CREB-mediated transcription in the nucleus, both of which are required for the formation of LTF, might relate to each other, we cloned an apCAM-associated protein (CAMAP) by yeast two-hybrid screening. We found that 5-HT signaling at the synapse activates PKA which in turn phosphorylates CAMAP to induce the dissociation of CAMAP from apCAM and the subsequent translocation of CAMAP into the nucleus of sensory neurons. In the nucleus, CAMAP acts as a transcriptional coactivator for CREB1 and is essential for the activation of ApC/EBP required for the initiation of LTF. Combined, our data suggest that CAMAP is a retrograde signaling component that translocates from activated synapses to the nucleus during synapse-specific LTF."
https://openalex.org/W2085809469,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2/4 play critical roles in early embryogenesis and skeletal development. BMP-2/4 signals conduct into cells via two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, known as BMPR-I (IA and IB) and BMPR-II. Here we identified splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3b4) as a molecule that interacts with BMPR-IA, using a yeast two-hybrid screening with a human fetal brain cDNA library. Co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis confirmed their interaction in mammalian cells. By separation of the cell components, SF3b4 was present in the cell membrane fraction with BMPR-IA as well as in the nucleus. Overexpression of SF3b4 inhibited BMP-2-mediated osteogenic and chondrocytic differentiation of C2C12 and ATDC5 cells, respectively, and the endogenous expression level of SF3b4 decreased during differentiation in ATDC5 cells. By reporter gene assay, SF3b4 suppressed Id reporter gene activity, specific to the Smad1/5/8 pathway, but not TGFβ-mediated reporter gene activity. Biotin labeling of the cell surface proteins followed by their immunoblot revealed that SF3b4 decreased the cell surface BMPRI-A levels. Further analysis by molecular modeling of the intracellular domain of BMPR-IA, coupled with binding studies of its several mutants, indicated that the site(s) for SF3b4 binding is not directly associated with the C-terminal lobe and the activation segment. Taken together, these results suggest that SF3b4, known to be localized in the nucleus and involved in RNA splicing, binds BMPR-IA and specifically inhibits BMP-mediated osteochondral cell differentiation.

In the early stages, BMP-2/4, expressed in specific areas of the limb bud, are essential for prechondrogenic condensations (6Pizette S. Niswander L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 219: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and in the late stages, BMP-2, expressed in the growth plate, accelerates longitudinal bone growth by stimulating chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy (7De Luca F. Barnes K.M. Uyeda J.A. De-Levi S. Abad V. Palese T. Mericq V. Baron J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). BMP-mediated signals conduct into the cell via two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors known as BMP receptor type I (IA and IB) and type II receptors (8Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). With regard to BMP-2/4 signaling, three structurally related type I receptors, BMPR-IA (also known as ALK3), BMPR-IB (also known as ALK6), and ActRIA (also known as ALK2) and one type II receptor, BMPR-II, have been identified. When the ligand interacts with the receptor complex, BMPR-II transphosphorylates BMPR-I at the GS box to activate its kinase. BMPR-I activation induces the phosphorylation of transiently associated Smad1/5/8. These Smads then form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, which is then translocated into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, they regulate the transcription of specific target genes in concert with various DNA-binding proteins, co-activators, or co-repressor proteins. Although the Smad pathway is widely represented in most of the cell types and tissues, additional pathways, including those of MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, SAPK/JNK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Wan M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) are activated following treatment with BMPs.

In contrast, only a few molecules, such as BRAM1 (BMP-receptor associated molecule 1) (17Kurozumi K. Nishita M. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have been identified that bind BMP receptors. Since BMP transduces MAPKs as well as Smad1/5/8, there may be specific molecules that mediate those signaling pathways. In this study, we attempted to identify these intervening molecules specific to BMP-mediated signal transduction pathways, using a yeast two-hybrid system with a BMPR-IA intracellular domain (ICD) as a bait protein, and found that a molecule previously reported as splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3b4) strongly binds the ICD but not its constitutively active form. In mammalian cells, a proportion of SF3b4 was present together with BMPR-IA in the cell membrane fraction, and co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis demonstrated their direct interaction. Overexpression of SF3b4 inhibited osteogenic and chondrocytic differentiation of C2C12 and ATDC5 cells, respectively. A reporter gene assay demonstrated that SF3b4 inhibits the Smad1/5/8-specific Id reporter gene activity. The levels of cell surface BMPR-IA in SF3b4-overexpressing cells were substantially decreased. We further performed molecular modeling of BMPR-IA, which provided insight into the sites of the interaction, although it was not determined. These results suggest that SF3b4 regulates osteochondral differentiation by interacting with BMPR-IA and down-regulating its cell surface levels. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To screen the molecules that bind the BMPR-IA ICD, a ProQuest™ two-hybrid system with Gateway™ technology (Invitrogen) and a ProQuest™ pre-made human fetal brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) were used. To construct bait plasmids, cDNA fragments encoding BMPR-IA ICD and the BMPR-IA constitutively active form (Q223D) ICD were prepared using the PCR technique and subcloned into an entry vector DONR201 (Invitrogen) by Gateway™ technology, with forward primer 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGAAAAAAGCAGGCTACAAACATTATTGCAAGAGCATCTCAAGCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCATCAGATTTTTACATCTTGGGATTCAACCATCTTGGC-3′. Expression plasmids of BMPR-IA ICD (pcDNA-HASL-ALK3 (WT)) and its constitutively active Q223D form (pcDNA3-HASL-ALK3 (QD)) with a HA tag at the C terminus (a kind gift from Dr. T. Imamura) were used as templates. Primers to generate full-length cDNA of SF3b4 and its mutants are summarized in Table 1. The fragments were subcloned into DEST32 yeast expression vector (Invitrogen). The bait plasmid and cDNA library were co-transfected into a MaV203 host yeast strain according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast transformants were plated and screened on the synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking leucine (L), tryptophan (W), and histidine (H) containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) (i.e. SC - L - W - H + 3AT. After 60 -72 h, robust colonies over 2 mm in diameter were replica-cleaned and incubated for the following 2 days. Colonies that recovered after replica-cleaning were restreaked onto the SC - L - W and grown for 2 days. They were then further screened for the expression of three reporter genes (HIS3, URA3, and lacZ) by growth on SC - L - W - H + 3AT and SC - L - W - uracil (U), no growth on SC - L - W + 0.2% 5-fluoroorotic acid, and change of color to blue in the presence of X-gal. Plasmids were extracted from positive colonies and transformed into Escherichia coli strain ElectroMAX™ DH10B cells (Invitrogen), using the electroporation technique. Clones harboring the target cDNA were isolated, and their cDNA sequence was determined using an ABI-310 DNA sequencer.TABLE 1Primers for deletion mutants of SF3b4PrimerSequenceDeletion mutants of SF3b4 for yeast two-hybrid assay using with Gateway™ technologyFull-lengthForwardGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGCCATGGCTGCCGGGCCGATCTCCGAGCGGAATCReverseGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTTACTGAGGGAGAGGGCCTCGAAGTGGGCCTCGR-R-PGForwardGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCACTGTGTACGTGGGGGGCCTGGATGAGAAGR-PGForwardGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCCAACATTTTCATTGGGAACCTGGACCCTGAGPGForwardGGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTCTTATGCCTTCAAGAAGGACTCCAAGGGTGAGR1ReverseGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTGTTCACCCGTATTGGCTTCCCATAGAGR2ReverseGGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTAAGATACGGTGATAGGACGGTTACAGAGGTACTGCCCpBFX deletion mutants for immunoprecipitation in mammalian cellsFull-lengthForwardACGTACGTCGACACTGTGTACGTGGGGGGCCTGGATGAG (SalI; compatible cohesive end)ReverseGGATCCTTACTGAGGGAGAGGGCCTCGAAGTGG (BamHI)R-PGForwardACGTACGTCGACAACATTTTCATTGGGAACCTGGACCCTGAG (SalI; compatible cohesive end)PGForwardACGTACGTCGACTATGCCTTCAAGAAGGACTCCAAGGGT (SalI; compatible cohesive end)CMV14 deletion mutants for localization in mammalian cellsFull-lengthForwardCGCGGATCCGACGGCGGGATCTCTTTCGCCATGGCTGCCGGGCCGATCTCCGAGCGGAAT (BamHI)ReverseCCGGGATCCCTGAGGGAGAGGGCCTCGAAGTGGGCCTCG (BamHI)PG-lessReverseCCGGGATCCAGATACGGTGATAGGACGGTTACAGAGGTACTGCCC (BamHI) Open table in a new tab Cell Culture, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot—COS7 and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and C2C12 cells in DMEM containing 15% FBS. ATDC5 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% FBS. For the induction of chondrocyte differentiation, ITS PREMIX (insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), and selenous acid (5 ng/ml)) (BD Biosciences) was added to the confluent cells. All medium contained 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma, rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10) from Roche Applied Science, anti-cadherin from LAB VISION, and anti-histone H1 (clone AE-4) from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit antibodies against p-ERK1/2, p-SAPK/JNK, p-p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, p38 MAPK, and phospho-Smad1/5/8 were from Cell Signaling Technology. The secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase were from Cappel. Expression plasmids of SF3b4 and its truncation forms were prepared by inserting the cDNAs into pBFX (18Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28057-28065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using XhoI and BamHI sites, or p3xFlag-CMV14 (Sigma) using the restriction sites as indicated in Table 1. 293 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids as indicated, using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Lysates were gently stirred and then clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min). An aliquot of the lysate was applied to immunoblotting, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated for 1 h with an anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Applied Science) and 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in the above lysis buffer, applied to 10% SDS-PAGE under a reducing condition, and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with 5% skim milk in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl), containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Anti-FLAG M2 and anti-HA antibodies were used as the primary antibody diluted in TBS-T containing 1% skim milk. The signal was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was performed with Western Lightning Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To immunoblot MAPKs and Smad1/5/8, following treatment with BMP-2 (500 ng/ml; R&D Systems) for the indicated times at 37 °C, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3PO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 tablet/10 ml of Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblot was performed as described above. All of the primary antibodies were diluted to 1:1000 with TBS-T containing 1% skim milk. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with essentially similar results. To examine the effects of SF3b4 on the BMPR-IA levels on the cell surface, COS7-stable transfectants overexpressing HA-tagged BMPRI-A were prepared by transfecting pcDNA3-HASL-ALK3. Then these cells were transfected with SF3b4/p3xFlag-CMV14 or an empty vector as the mock. Two identical cell plates were prepared: one for biotin-labeling and the other for direct immunoblot analysis. After 48 h, the cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin. Briefly, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (PBS2+) and incubated for two 20-min periods at 4 °C with 1.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) diluted in PBS2+, and the cells were harvested and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, supernatant was incubated for 2 h with streptavidin-agarose CL4B beads (Fluka) at 4 °C. The precipitates were applied to immunoblot analysis using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science). Cells of the other plate were collected and applied to immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 and 12CA5 to detect SF3b4 and total BMPR-IA, respectively. Cell Fractionation by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—COS7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HASL-ALK3 (WT) together with SF3b4/p3xFlag-CMV14 or an empty vector as the mock. Cells were lysed with 1 mm dithiothreitol in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, after washing with PBS. Cell lysates were given 30 strokes with a glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was then adjusted to 30% sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 0.25 mm CaCl2 and then overlaid on 45% sucrose solution. The samples were centrifuged (550 × g, 30 min) at 4 °C, and the upper layer was collected. The residual solution on the boundary was overlaid onto 45% sucrose and centrifuged at 1200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the upper layer was collected and combined with the upper layer solution of the initial centrifugation. The solution at the boundary of the second centrifugation was used as the nuclear fraction. The combined solution above was overlaid onto a discontinuous sucrose layer (45, 55, and 60% sucrose) and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The fraction in the 55% sucrose layer was collected, diluted to 10% sucrose, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. The precipitate was used as the membrane fraction. Nuclear and membrane fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Anti-histone H1 and anti-cadherin were used to detect these markers of the nucleus and cell membrane, respectively. Assay for Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity—For the ALP assay, C2C12 cells were plated onto a 96-well plate at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in growth medium. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS and BMP-2. At the days indicated after plating, the test medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Then 200 μl of ALP buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40 in 0.1 m glycine, pH 9.6) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Ten microliters of the cell lysate was diluted 10 times by adding 90 μl of ALP buffer, and then 100 μl of 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate was added. The sample was mixed well and incubated in a 96-well plate at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Histochemical analysis of ALP activity was performed as described previously (19Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 7 × 104/well in 12-well plates. After 14 h (designated as day 1), the medium was replaced with medium containing BMP-2 (300 ng/ml). At the time points indicated, cells were fixed for 10 min with 10% buffered formalin at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma), 0.5% N,N-dimethylformamide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.6 mg/ml fast blue BB salt (Sigma) at room temperature. Alcian Blue Staining—ATDC5 cells were plated at 4.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates. At each time point, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 30 min, and stained with 0.1% Alcian blue in 0.1 m HCl overnight. Excess stain was washed off with distilled water, and pictures were taken. Staining levels were quantified by solubilizing the sample in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 8 h at room temperature. The absorbance at 630 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. Real Time RT-PCR—At the time points indicated, mRNA was isolated from ATDC5 cells using a Micro-FastTrack™ 2.0 kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript™ preamplification system (Invitrogen). The mouse aggrecan primers, mouse SF3b4 primers, and their TaqMan probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan probe contained a reporter dye at the 5′-end and a quencher dye at the 3′-end. The sequences of the primers and probe are as follows: forward primer (5′-GATACTTTCAGCGCCTTTGGA-3′), reverse primer (5′-AGGCAAAATTAATGAAGGCGTAAC-3′), and probe (5′-CAGACCCCCAAGATCATGCGGG-3′) for SF3b4; forward primer (5′-CTGCCCTTGCCCCGTAA-3′), reverse primer (5′-GACAGGTCAAAGATGGGCTTTG-3′), and probe (5′-CCCTGGGCAGCGTGATCCTCAC-3′) for Agc; and forward primer (5′-CAGCAAGAGCAAGGAAAAGAAA-3′), reverse primer (5′-ATCGCCATAGCTGAAGTGGAA-3′), and probe (5′-GAGAGACCATGAACGG-3′) for Col2a1. RT-PCR was carried out with an ABI PRISM 7700. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 40 ng of total RNA, 200 μm primers, and 600 μm probe in 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control reagents were used as an internal control. The reverse transcription reaction was run according to the manufacturer's recommended program. Data quantification and analysis were also performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (PE Biosystems). Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate to obtain the values. Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Expression plasmids of Smad1, Smad4, and BMP-4 were from Dr. T. Imamura. pGL3-Id985WT (20Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and pGL3ti-(SBE)4 (21Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) were from Dr. T. Katagiri and Dr. P. ten Dijke, respectively. C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 15% FBS in 6-cm dishes. Four hours before transfection, the growth medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2% FBS. Transfection was performed using a calcium phosphate method. In some experiments, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 (R&D Systems). Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using a Dual-luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The reporter gene assays for BMP-2/4 and TGFβ were performed as previously described, using pGL3-Id985WT and pGL3ti-(SBE)4, respectively (22Oka C. Tsujimoto R. Kajikawa M. Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Ina J. Yano M. Tsuchiya A. Ueta Y. Soma A. Kanda H. Matsumoto M. Kawaichi M. Development. 2004; 131: 1041-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with TGFβ had no effect on pGL3-Id985WT activity (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the pGL3-Id985WT reporter gene for BMP-2/4. Firefly luciferase activities were standardized by Renilla luciferase activities. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Homology modeling of BMPR-IA ICD—A three-dimensional structure model of human BMPR-IA ICD (amino acids 204-532) was generated by MODELLER version 8.1 (23Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) using the three-dimensional structure of TGFβ receptor I(TβR-I) ICD (Protein Data Bank code 1b6c, chain B) as a template. The three-dimensional structure model of BMPR-IA ICD was validated by WHAT_CHECK (24Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar) and VERIFY_3D (25Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). Estimation of SF3b4-binding Sites of BMPR-IA ICD—To obtain amino acid sequences of the BMPR-I family, BLASTP homology search of the NCBI nr data base was performed using the amino acid sequence of human BMPR-IA ICD as the query. The obtained sequences were aligned using ClustalW, and the alignment of ICD regions of the BMPR-I family was extracted from the entire alignment. According to their biochemical properties, amino acid residues were categorized into five groups as follows: group 1 (acidic, polar), Asp, Glu, Asn, and Gln; group 2 (basic), Arg, Lys, and His; group 3 (small), Gly, Ala, Pro, Ser, and Thr; group 4 (aliphatic), Val, Leu, Ile, Met, and Cys; group 5 (aromatic), Phe, Tyr, and Trp. In the pairwise alignment of human BMPR-IA ICDs and BMPR-IB ICDs, we selected positions where amino acid residues belonging to different groups were aligned. If the degree of conservation of the selected position in each BMPR-I subfamily (IA and IB) was low, we considered that the position was less important, and it was not used in the following analysis. The selected positions were mapped on the three-dimensional structure model of BMPR-IA ICD. Identification of a Molecule That Interacts with BMPR-IA—To search for molecules that interact with BMPR-IA, we screened ∼700,000 yeast transformants from a human fetal brain cDNA library with BMPR-IA ICD and its constitutively active form (Q223D) as bait. We obtained 22 colonies by screening with BMPR-IA ICD, and of them, 17 were identified as splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3b4). Another colony was identified as Exportin 7, and the other four colonies turned out to be false positive. Colonies expressing SF3b4 fulfilled all of the screening conditions, including the blue color on the X-gal plate, growth on SC - L - W - H + 10 mm 3AT and SC - L - W - U plates, and sterility on the SC - L - W + 0.2% 5-fluoroorotic acid plate, indicating strong interaction. The interaction with BMPR-IA was further confirmed using a colony expressing full-length SF3b4 (Fig. 1B). The colony expressing Exportin 7 became slightly blue on the X-gal plate after 24 h but did not fulfill either of the other conditions (data not shown). The inability to bind to BMPR-IA ICD was confirmed using a colony expressing full-length Exportin 7. With the BMPR-IA constitutively active form (Q223D) ICD as bait, no colonies grew on the screening plates. Thus, the following experiments focused on SF3b4. SF3b4 is a 49-kDa protein involved in splicing of a region immediately upstream of the branch point sequence in the pre-spliceosomal complex (26Champion-Arnaud P. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This molecule contains two well conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) at the N terminus and a proline- and glycine-rich motif (Pro-Gly motif) at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). To characterize the interaction between BMPR-IA and SF3b4, SF3b4 truncation mutants were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and tested for their ability to interact with the BMPR-IA ICD in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Full-length, R-R-PG, and R-PG bound BMPR-IA, but PG, R1, and R2 did not, suggesting that a stretch of RRM2 and the Pro-Gly motif is sufficient for the interaction (Fig. 1B). We further examined whether SF3b4 binds BMPR-IB and found that full-length SF3b4 did not bind the ICD of BMPR-IB in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). SF3b4 Interacts with BMPR-IA in Mammalian Cells—Next, we tested whether a similar association occurs in mammalian cells, using a full-length SF3b4 and several deletion mutants with Flag tag at the N terminus (Fig. 2A). 293 cells were transiently transfected with both an expression plasmid of FLAG-tagged SF3b4 (FLAG-SF3b4) and pcDNA3-HASL-ALK3 (WT), and co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis was performed. When BMPR-IA-HA was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, full-length SF3b4 was co-precipitated, but R-PG and PG were not (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that SF3b4 actually binds BMPR-IA in the cell, but its full-length is required for adequate interaction, contrasting with the interaction in the yeast two-hybrid"
https://openalex.org/W2042334193,"Myosin V is a molecular motor that transports a variety of cellular cargo, including organelles, vesicles, and messenger RNA. The proper peripheral distribution of melanosomes, a dense pigment-containing organelle, is dependent on actin and the activity of myosin Va. The recruitment of myosin Va to the melanosome and proper transport of the melanosome requires melanophilin, which directly binds to myosin Va and is tethered to the melanosome membrane via Rab27a. Here we use highly purified proteins to demonstrate that the globular tail domain of myosin Va binds directly to an intrinsically unstructured domain of melanophilin. The myosin Va binding domain of melanophilin lacks stable secondary structure, and 1H NMR measurements indicate that the protein is unfolded. This domain is extremely sensitive to mild proteolysis and has a hydrodynamic radius that is consistent with a random coil-like polypeptide. We show that myosin Va binding does not induce the global folding of melanophilin. Truncations of melanophilin were utilized to define a short peptide sequence (26 residues) within melanophilin that is critical for myosin Va binding. We demonstrate that a peptide corresponding to these residues binds directly to the globular tail domain with the same affinity as melanophilin. We discuss the possible implications of protein intrinsic disorder in recruitment and maintenance of myosin Va on melanosome membranes.

Myosin V is a processive, actin-based molecular motor that transports a variety of organelles and other cargo. The biological function of myosin V in the transport of melanosomes has been studied in great detail. Melanosomes are dense, pigment-producing organelles, and mice harboring mutations in the dilute gene have a lightened coat color that is a consequence of defective melanosome transport (1Provance Jr., D.W.

Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Mutations in either the catalytic head domain of myosin Va or in its C-terminal globular tail domain can give rise to the dilute phenotype (4Huang J.D. Mermall V. Strobel M.C. Russell L.B.

Rab27a localizes to the melanosome membrane, and in its GTP-bound, active form recruits melanophilin. Melanophilin is a modular protein that contains several functional domains including the N-terminal Rab27a effector domain, a medial myosin Va binding domain, and a C-terminal F-actin and endbinding protein 1 interaction domain (6Kuroda T.S.

Together myosin Va, melanophilin, and Rab27a constitute an organelle-specific transport complex.A number of recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction between myosin Va and melanophilin involves at least two distinct molecular interactions.

This interaction is required but not sufficient for melansome transport. In vivo a second interaction between myosin Va and melanophilin requires a melanocyte-specific exon (exon F) that is present in the putative coiled-coil domain of myosin Va (10Wu X. Wang F. Rao K.

Hammer J.A. II I Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The exon F binding site was mapped to residues 300-400 of melanophilin. In a recent study, Hume et al. (12Hume A.N. Tarafder A.K. Ramalho J.S. Sviderskaya E.V. Seabra M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4720-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that the exon F binding site of melanophilin is required to rescue the melanosome transport defect in leaden melanocytes. In the same study the authors found that the globular tail domain binding site is not required for melanosome transport and membrane localization of myosin Va but may function to stabilize the complex in vivo.In addition to its role in the localization of the motor to its cargo, the globular tail domain can also regulate the activity of the myosin Va motor. In the absence of free Ca2+, the globular tail domain inhibits the activity of the motor domain (13Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the addition of purified melanophilin partially restores the activity of myosin Va in vitro (14Li X.D. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17815-17822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, melanophilin does not activate myosin Va as well as the addition of Ca2+ (Vmax = 6.6 versus 20 s-1 head-1, respectively). It is not clear whether melanophilin and Ca2+ activate the myosin Va motor by the same mechanism, but melanosome transport and activation of the myosin Va motor require the direct interaction of the globular tail domain and melanophilin. To date, a detailed biochemical study of the interaction of myosin Va and melanophilin has not been reported. Indeed, biochemical characterization of the binding of any motor to its cargo has been very limited.Fukuda and Itoh (15Fukuda M. Itoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22314-22321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) demonstrated that melanophilin contains several predicted PEST-like motifs and that these sites are sensitive to proteolysis. PEST (proline-, glutamate-, serine-, and threonine-rich) motifs are sites of targeted protein proteolytic degradation and are often localized to regions of protein disorder (16Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar). Although most cellular proteins must fold into a single well defined structure to fulfill their biological function, modern genomic and proteomic approaches have led to the discovery of proteins lacking a characteristic compact, globular conformation (17Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nature reviews. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref Scopus (2980) Google Scholar, 18Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar).

IUPs are often part of signal transduction pathways and often interact with many binding partners (19Dosztanyi Z. Chen J. Dunker A.K. Simon I. Tompa P. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 2985-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 20Ward J.J. Sodhi J.S. McGuffin L.J. Buxton B.F. Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). Understanding the function of unstructured proteins may also have medical significance. IUPs are overrepresented in genes associated with diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease (21Cheng Y. LeGall T. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10448-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Iakoucheva L.M. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar).Here we use a variety of biochemical and biophysical approaches to demonstrate that melanophilin, specifically its myosin Va binding domain, is an intrinsically unstructured protein. We show that it lacks any stable secondary structure, and 1H NMR measurements indicate that it does not have a stable tertiary fold. Purified melanophilin is very sensitive to mild proteolysis, and its hydrodynamic radius is inconsistent with a compact, globular protein. These conclusions are supported by an analysis of its primary sequence and are consistent with the previously published observation that melanophilin expressed in mammalian cells is sensitive to proteolysis. In addition, we do not find any evidence that melanophilin folds into a compact, globular structure when bound to myosin Va. Finally, we identify a 26-amino acid peptide that is both necessary and sufficient to bind to the myosin Va globular tail domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The globular tail domain of mouse myosin Va was amplified from a spleen mRNA library (Clontech). The sequence encoding the globular tail domain (accession number Q99104, amino acids 1446-1853) was cloned into a modified pET28b vector in which the thrombin recognition sequence was replaced with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sequence. N-terminal His-tagged myosin Va globular tail domain (M5-GTD) was overexpressed in Rosetta 2 (DE3) cells (Novagen). Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into 2× YT media containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached ∼0.6. After 3 h at 37 °C the cells were harvested and stored at -80 °C.For the preparation of His-tagged M5-GTD, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) including Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell with a cell pressure of 16,000 p.s.i. The lysate was clarified at 37,000 × g for 30 min and then combined with 2 ml of washed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose/g of cell pellet. This slurry was mixed for 45 min at 4 °C and then washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer. Bound protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Eluted protein was dialyzed into TEV buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and then digested at 4 °C with 1 mg of His-TEV-Arg/200 mg of recombinant protein overnight. His-TEV-Arg was expressed as a maltose-binding protein fusion and purified as previously described (23Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Uncleaved M5-GTD and the TEV protease were removed by passing the sample again over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The flow-through was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The concentration of M5-GTD was determined by measuring its absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient calculated from its amino acid sequence (ɛ = 31400 m-1 cm-1).Melanophilin (Mlph) was amplified from a full-length cDNA obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC-11931). Mlph residues 147-403 were cloned either into pGEX-4T or a variant of pGEX-4T that contains a TEV protease recognition sequence. Nonsense mutations were introduced into the coding sequence of GST-Mlph147-403 by site-directed mutagenesis to create truncations. For pulldown experiments GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare).Untagged Mlph147-403 and Mlph147-240 were purified according to the following procedure. Cells expressing GST-Mlph147-403 (or GST-Mlph147-240) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm DTT and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm membrane. Filtered lysate was applied to a GSTPrep column 16/10 (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 15 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl and 5 mm DTT. GST-Mlph147-403 was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. Overnight treatment of the GST-Mlph147-403 fusion protein with recombinant His-TEV-Arg resulted in site-specific cleavage. The TEV-treated sample was passed over a GSTPrep column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0, to remove uncleaved fusion protein and GST. The flow-through was loaded on a Mono Q 10/10 column and eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl. The purified proteins migrated anomalously on SDS-PAGE gels; for example, Mlph147-403, which has a predicted molecular mass of 28 kDa, migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was performed at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic acid facility. The observed mass of Mlph147-403 (28,023.7 m/z) and Mlph147-240 (10690.3 m/z) were consistent with their predicted molecular masses. The concentrations of the cleaved Mlph proteins were determined from their absorbance at 280 nm as described above (Mlph147-403 ɛ = 2980 m-1 cm-1, and Mlph147-240 ɛ = 1490 m-1 cm-1).Limited Proteolysis—Mlph147-403 and monomeric BSA were dissolved to 0.5 mg ml-1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0. Trypsin (Roche Applied Science) or proteinase K (New England Biolabs) was added to 1 μgml-1 to initiate the reaction. Proteolysis was performed on ice. The reaction was stopped at the indicated time points by the addition of an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer and immediately boiling the sample. The samples (2 μg) were then separated on NuPage 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) with MOPS-SDS running buffer. The observed bands were excised from the gel, and tandem mass spectrometry was performed at Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility to identify the products of the proteolysis reaction.Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 68S spectrometer in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette. Proteins were exchanged into 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and diluted to 6 μm. To measure spectra of the complexes, both proteins were mixed (6 μm each) in CD buffer and incubated overnight on ice. For each experiment at least three scans were taken from 270 to 190 nm in 0.5-nm increments with a 2-s averaging time. The scans were averaged, and then blank scans were subtracted. Mean residue ellipticity ([τ]) was calculated according to Equation 1, where τ is the raw signal in millidegrees, l is path length in cm, n is the number of amino acids, and c is the concentration of the protein in moles per liter. [θ]=θ10lnc1 The theoretical spectra were calculated from the spectra of the individual proteins according to Equation 2, where [τ]isthe observed mean residue ellipticity for the indicated protein, and n is the number of residues for the indicated protein(s). In both cases a 1:1 stoichiometry was assumed based on observations from other experiments. [θ]=[θ]GTD×nGTDncomplex+[θ]Mlph×nMlphncomplexMeasurement of Hydrodynamic Properties—The hydrodynamic radius of Mlph147-403, M5-GTD, and the complex were measured by size-exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Purified Mlph147-403 or M5-GTD, 10 nmol each, was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR column equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected and analyzed on NuPage 12% Bis-Tris gels run with MOPS-SDS running buffer. The hydrodynamic radius (Rh) was determined by comparing its elution volume to several standard proteins of known Rh. To measure Rh of the complex, 10 nmol of Mlph147-403 was mixed with 10 nmol of M5-GTD and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The complex was then applied to the Superdex 200 HR column as described above.For DLS measurements the peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 15-20 μm, and clarified for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The clarified samples were analyzed in a DynaPro Titan (Wyatt Technology Corporation) instrument. In all cases the samples were observed to contain a single monodisperse scattering source. The diffusion coefficient for each sample was determined from the second-order autocorrelation function. The hydrodynamic radius was then calculated according to the Stokes-Einstein equation.The oligomerization state of Mlph147-403 and M5-GTD was measured by size-exclusion chromatography with inline multiple angle light scattering. Briefly, 100 μl of protein samples at 3 mg ml-1 were injected onto a Shodex Protein KW-803 HPLC column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. The columns were equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Protein concentration was determined with an Optilab rEX refractive index detector, and scattering was detected with a Dawn 18 angle multiple angle light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technology Corp.). In all cases detectors 7-15 were used for the final determination of the molecular mass.1H NMR Spectra—Protein samples were exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate, 75 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, by passing the samples over a Superdex 200 16/60 column. The proteins were then concentrated by ultrafiltration. D2O was added to 10% just before recording proton spectra. Spectra were acquired on 400 μm protein samples as well as 10-fold dilutions. One-dimensional 1H spectra of Mlph147-403 and Mlph147-240 were acquired on a 600-MHz Varian Inova spectrometer running VNMR 6.1C at the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory. A variable temperature controller was used to regulate samples at 25 °C. Presaturation water suppression experiments (1-s presaturation) and WET water suppression experiments (24Smallcombe S.H. Patt S.L. Keifer P.A. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 117: 295-303Crossref Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were acquired with 8192 points, 8384.86 Hz spectral width, and 1.49-s recycle delay. 64 scans were acquired per experiment for the 400 μm samples, and greater than 350 scans were acquired for the 40 μm samples. Spectra were processed with 1 Hz line-broadening and manually baseline-corrected.GST Pulldown Assays—GST-Mlph fusion proteins, 1 or 10 μm, were mixed with a 5-fold excess of M5-GTD and 50 μl glutathione-agarose in 500 μl of 25 mm HEPES-KOH, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. The amount of GST fusion loaded in each well was normalized in Fig. 5B for clarity.To compare the relative affinity of the GST-Mlph truncations for M5-GTD, 1.6 μm GST-Mlph fusion proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of M5-GTD (0.3-10 μm) and 50 μl glutathione-agarose as above. The amount of M5-GTD retained on the glutathione-agarose beads was quantified using Image J. Briefly, the observed integrated density value (IDV) of M5-GTD was normalized to the average IDV of the GST fusion proteins to correct for gel-to-gel variation in Coomassie staining intensity. Then the amount of M5-GTD bound was plotted as a function of total M5-GTD and fit to the rectangular hyperbola in Equation 3, where c is a constant that describes the maximum observed signal, and KGTD is the concentration of M5-GTD in μm that produced half-maximal saturation of the binding equation. For GST-Mlph147-403, GST-Mlph147-220, and GST-Mlph147-201 both c and KGTD were free parameters. Because neither GST-Mlph147-192 nor GST-Mlph147-176 binding curves approached saturation, c was fixed in these fits as the average of the other fits. M5−GTDbound=[M5−GTD]×c[M5−GTD]+KGTDCompetitive Displacement Assay—Peptides corresponding to melanophilin residues 176-201 and 193-201 were synthesized at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility. Unpurified peptides (80-90% pure as judged by analytical HPLC) were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% Me2SO. Note that because these peptides were not purified and the concentrations used in the competition experiments are based on the mass dissolved, the concentrations of peptide in the experiment are approximate. Competitive binding experiments were performed with 1 μm GST-Mlph147-403, 5 μm M5-GTD, and 2.5-40 μm Mlph-derived peptides. The amount of M5-GTD non-specifically retained by the beads was subtracted from each data point.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC measurements were performed on a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Inc.) at 30 °C. In all cases the titration experiment was initiated with 2 × 2 μl injections followed by 28 × 8-μl injections. Untagged M5-GTD and Mlph147-403 were prepared as described above, and both were dialyzed extensively into 20 mm MES-KOH, 100 mm NaCl, 1mm DTT, pH 6.5. Mlph147-403 (150 μm) was injected into a 15 μm solution of M5-GTD. To measure the affinity of Mlph176-201 for M5-GTD, a peptide corresponding to these residues plus a C-terminal tyrosine for accurate concentration determination was purchased at >95% purity (Genscript Corp.) and dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 115 μm. Mlph176-201 was injected into a 10 μm solution of M5-GTD that had been dialyzed into the same buffer. Each sample was degassed immediately before use. The dissociation constant (Kd), stoichiometry (n), and the enthalpy change (ΔH) were determined by fitting the data to a single-site interaction model using the Origin software package provided by the manufacturer.RESULTSPrimary Sequence Analysis of Melanophilin—Melanophilin contains an N-terminal Rab-binding domain, a myosin Va binding domain, and a C-terminal end-binding protein 1 (EB1)/actin binding domain (Fig. 1A). We used the Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions to identify potential unstructured domains in melanophilin (25Li X. Romero P. Rani M. Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 1999; 10: 30-40PubMed Google Scholar, 26Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, much of melanophilin is predicted to be unstructured, which is consistent with the high fractional composition of disorder-promoting amino acids (Ala, Arg, Gly, Gln, Ser, Pro, Glu, and Lys) relative to order-promoting amino acids (Trp, Cys, Phe, Ile, Tyr, Val, and Leu). A notable exception is the N-terminal Rab binding domain. This domain shares high sequence identity with the N terminus of rabphilin 3A, which forms a well ordered structure bound to Rab3A (27Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These analyses suggest that both the myosin Va binding domain and the C-terminal domain, or more than two-thirds of the total protein, probably lack a well defined, compact fold.FIGURE 1A, schematic of the known functional domains of melanophilin, including the N-terminal Rab binding domain, the myosin Va binding domain, and the end binding protein 1 (EB1)/F-actin binding domain. Residue numbers above the schematic define the boundaries between these domains. B, Predictors of Natural Disordered Region (PONDR) analysis of mouse melanophilin.

The raw data (inset) was integrated and fit to a single-site binding model (solid line) using the Origin software package. The observed dissociation constant (Kd) for each titrant is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Evaluating the Affinity of the Globular Tail Domain-Melanophilin Interaction—Melanophilin residues 147-403 or 147-240 (Mlph147-403 or Mlph147-240, respectively) were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography. The Mlph fragments were cleaved from GST as described above and purified to homogeneity. The myosin Va globular tail domain (M5-GTD) was expressed with an N-terminal His tag and purified to homogeneity. Subsequently the His tag was removed leaving only two non-native residues (Gly-His) at the N terminus of the recombinant protein.We tested the ability of M5-GTD to interact directly with Mlph147-403 and Mlph147-240 using purified proteins. The thermodynamics of the interaction were measured by ITC. A typical ITC experiment is shown in Fig. 1C. We found that M5-GTD binds directly to Mlph to form a 1:1 complex and that M5-GTD binds to both Mlph147-403 and Mlph147-240 with a dissociation constant of ∼0.5 μm. This is the first time the stoichiometry and affinity of this protein-protein interaction has been measured.The Myosin Va Binding Domain of Melanophilin Is Intrinsically Unstructured—Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a sensitive means to assess the secondary structural features of a protein in solution. To investigate the secondary structure of Mlph147-403, CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (Fig. 2A). The spectrum of Mlph147-403 exhibits a large minimum at ∼200 nm and a shallow trough between 215 and 235 nm. There is no evidence for any stable secondary structure; distinct minima at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of α-helices, are not present. Nor do we observe a minimum at 217 nm, which would indicate the formation of some stable β-sheet secondary structure. We monitored the helicity at 222 nm as a function both of temperature and urea concentration. Neither increasing temperature (up to 80 °C) nor urea concentrations to 8 m had a significant effect on the observed helicity, which is consistent with an unstructured protein. Spectra recorded in phosphate-buffered saline, a more physiological buffer, were very similar to those reported here (data not shown).FIGURE 2The myosin Va binding domain of melanophilin is intrinsically unstructured. A, the CD spectra of Mlph147-403 (black line) and Mlph147-240 (gray line) recorded at 25 °C are consistent with an unfolded protein. B, 1H NMR spectrum of 400 μm Mlph147-403 shows that all of the amide proton peaks are clustered between 7.8 and 8.6 ppm, and we do not observe any up-shifted methyl peaks. Both results are consistent with an unfolded protein. C, BSA and Mlph147-4"
https://openalex.org/W2027459133,"Endothelin-1 (ET1) is a vasoactive peptide that stimulates hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) through diverse signaling pathways mediated by G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> heterotrimeric G proteins. We have found that ET1 stimulates the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in VSMC as profoundly as the G<sub>s</sub>-linked β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), but in a transient manner. PKA activation by ET1 was mediated by type-A ET1 receptors (ETA) and recruited an autocrine signaling mechanism distinct from that of ISO, involving G<sub>i</sub>-coupled βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2, cyclooxygenase COX-1 (but not COX-2) and prostacyclin receptors. In the functional studies, inhibition of PKA or COX-1 attenuated ET1-induced VSMC hypertrophy, suggesting the positive role of PKA in this response to ET1. Furthermore, we found that ET1 stimulates a Gβγ-mediated, PKA-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), an enzyme that regulates cell growth. Together, this study describes that (i) PKA can be transiently activated by G<sub>i</sub>-coupled agonists such as ET1 by an autocrine mechanism involving Gβγ/calcium/ERK/COX-1/prostacyclin signaling, and (ii) this PKA activation promotes VSMC hypertrophy, at least in part, through PKA-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3."

They catalyze the covalent linkage of myristate, a rare 14-carbon saturated fatty acid (tetradecanoate, C14:0), from myristoyl-CoA (MYA) to the N-terminal glycine of proteins, a process that occurs following the removal of the initiator methionine residue of growing polypeptide chains (3Johnson D.R.

Typically, the consequences of attaching an extended alkyl chain to the protein result in increased lipophilicity, facilitating its association with cellular/subcellular membranes and mediating interactions with other proteinaceous partners (for reviews, see Refs. 3Johnson D.R.

Kinetic studies with MYA and peptide substrates or their analogs have shown that NMT catalysis conforms to an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism (16Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Rocque W.J. Lennon P.J. Getman D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9732-9739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial binding of MYA to the enzyme induces a conformational change and subsequent formation of a binding site for the protein substrate. Following the reaction, CoA is released prior to dissociation of the myristoylated peptide.Genetic and biochemical data have established that NMTs are essential for growth and survival of a number of human yeast strains and parasites, such as C. albicans and C. neoformans (17Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2996-3009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the protozoa Leishmania major and Trypanosoma brucei (18Price H.P.

Sequence comparison and biochemical studies have shown that human and fungal NMTs share high sequence conservation at the MYA-binding site, but have divergent peptide substrate specificities (3Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These properties make NMT an attractive therapeutic target for antifungal agents (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Higgins M. McWherter C.A. Sikorski J.A. Devadas B. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

In addition, because of its essential role in cell viability, NMT is a potential target for antiviral, antiparasitic, and even antineoplastic chemotherapy (18Price H.P. Menon M.R. Panethymitaki C.

Thus, understanding the structural basis of the recognition and binding of the substrates with the enzyme should be useful for the development of new therapeutic agents.Crystal structures of NMTs from two species have been determined, including those of C. albicans NMT in apo-form, in binary complexes with several non-peptidic inhibitors, and in ternary complex with MYA and the peptide inhibitor SC-58272 (25Weston S.A.

Futterer K. Farazi T.A. Korolev S. Murray C.L. Jackson-Machelski E. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6335-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical data have defined how the substrates are bound relative to each other at the active site and have revealed insights into the substrate binding specificity and the catalytic mechanism. However, the N-terminal region of NMTs, which has been implicated to play a pivotal role in the subcellular localization of NMT in mammalian cells (29Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is absent in all of those structures because it is either disordered in the structures or removed to facilitate the structural studies.Kinetic studies of synthetic peptides based on the N-terminal sequences of known N-myristoylproteins indicate that optimum peptide substrates for ScNMT have an absolutely conserved Gly residue at position +1 and a marked preference for Ser and Lys at positions +5 and +6, respectively (9Towler D.A.

Based on this preference, a large number of peptide-based and peptide-like inhibitors that are effective against C. albicans and C. neoformans (19Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Higgins M.

Because of the limitations of peptide-based therapeutics, however, alternative small non-peptidic inhibitors have been screened, and some have been identified with very high activity and selectivity against NMTs of pathogenic fungal species (26Sogabe S.

In all three structures, the majority of the N-terminal region adopts a well defined structure with an α-helix and a loop located near the substrate-binding site and involved in the binding of MYA. The structural and kinetic data indicate that the N-terminal region plays an important role in the binding of both MYA and peptide substrate, but not in the subsequent catalytic reaction. Analyses of the interactions between the protein and the bound inhibitors also provide valuable information for further development of improved therapeutic agents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The ScNMT gene fragment corresponding to residues 3-455 was cloned into a customized expression plasmid (pBX3) that introduces a His tag (MRGSHHHHHHSMA) at the N terminus of the expressed protein. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Bacterial transformants were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C until A600 = 0.8, and then protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 23 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed on ice by sonication, and the insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C.Protein purification was carried out by a combination of affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography at 4 °C. The lysis supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A and then washed with buffer A supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. The target protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 100 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were pooled together and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA) for 3 h and then loaded onto a DEAE cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with buffer B, and the target protein existed in the flow-through fractions. SDS-PAGE and dynamic light scattering analyses indicated that the protein sample had high purity and homogeneity.Expression plasmids of ScNMTs containing point mutations were generated from the vector containing the wild-type enzyme using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of these mutant genes were verified by DNA sequencing. Three ScNMT truncates were generated with deletion of residues 1-20 (Δ1-20), 1-30 (Δ1-30), and 1-40 (Δ1-40) of the N-terminal region, respectively. As a negative control, mutant ScNMT encoding the enzyme with deletion of C-terminal residues 452-455 (Δ452-455) was generated by mutating the codon specifying Val452 to a stop codon (TAG). Mutant ScNMT proteins were expressed and purified following the procedures used for the wild-type enzyme.To perform the myristoylation enzymatic activity assay of ScNMT, an octapeptide (PARF1, GLFASKLF) corresponding to the N-terminal residues of the native substrate ARF1 of ScNMT was synthesized (Shanghai Science Peptide Biological Technology Co., Ltd.). The quality of the peptide was determined by analytical reverse-phase chromatography and mass spectral analysis and shown to have a purity of >95%.Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection—Crystallization was performed at 4 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. MYA was dissolved in deionized water to a concentration of 15 mm, and the non-peptidic inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO to a concentration of 25 mm.To prepare crystals of the binary complex of ScNMT with MYA, the ScNMT protein solution (∼20 mg/ml) was first mixed with the MYA solution at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 and then incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h before crystallization setup. Sheet-shaped crystals of the binary complex were grown in drops containing equal volumes (2 μl) of the protein mixture solution and the reservoir solution (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.1) and 2.6 m (NH4)2SO4) to a maximum size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm3 in 10 days. Diffraction data of the binary complex were collected to 2.9-Å resolution from a flash-cooled crystal at -176 °C at beamline 6A of the Photon Factory (Ibaraki, Japan) and processed with the HKL2000 suite (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). To prepare crystals of the ternary complex of ScNMT with MYA and non-peptidic inhibitors, the ScNMT protein solution was first mixed with the MYA and inhibitor solutions at a molar ratio of 1:1.5:5 and then incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h before crystallization setup. Single crystals of the ternary complexes were grown under the same conditions as the binary complex to a maximum size of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.2 mm3. Diffraction data of the ternary complexes were collected to ∼3.0-Å resolution from flash-cooled crystals at -180 °C on an in-house Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate detector equipped with a rotating anode generator. Diffraction data processing and scaling were performed using the CrystalClear suite (35Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). All of these complexes are of space group C2 and contain six ScNMT molecules in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of ∼50%.

Waksman G. Gordon J.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6335-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as the search model. The structures of the two ScNMT·MYA·inhibitor ternary complexes were determined by molecular replacement using the binary complex structure as the search model. Structure refinement was carried out with CNS following standard protocols (energy minimization, simulated annealing, and B factor refinement), and model building was facilitated using the program O (37Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). There are six ScNMT molecules in the asymmetric unit; thus, strict 6-fold non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied in the early stage of refinement, but released in the later stage of refinement. The final structure refinement was performed using the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in the program REFMAC5 (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13781) Google Scholar). A bulk solvent correction and a free R factor monitor (calculated with 5% of randomly chosen reflections) were applied throughout the refinement. The stereochemical quality of the structure models during the course of refinement and model building was evaluated with the program PROCHECK (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The statistics of structure refinement are summarized in Table 1.Myristoylation Enzymatic Activity Assay—The myristoylation activity of both wild-type and mutant ScNMTs was assayed by monitoring the production of CoA over time as described previously (40Howell D.M. Xu H. White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 331-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein samples were diluted to 0.025 mg/ml (∼0.5 μm) with HEPES buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.5), and the PARF1 octapeptide was diluted to 1 mm with HEPES buffer as a stock solution. The reaction solution consisted of 0.04 μm ScNMT, 0.16 mm MYA, and varying concentrations of PARF1 (0.16-0.80 mm with a concentration interval of 0.08 mm) in a total volume of 50 μl upon mixing with HEPES buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 35 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and distilled water to a total volume of 0.50 ml. The absorbance at 412 nm was recorded and blanked against an identical incubation sample without PARF1. The micromoles of CoA produced were calculated from a standard curve generated with known concentrations (0-200 mm) of β-mercaptoethanol. The production of CoA was found to be linear over the 1-h time period of the assay, and product formation was a linear function of the amount of enzyme added. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation with nonlinear regression. All experiments were repeated at least twice under the same conditions.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure of ScNMT—The crystal structures of ScNMT in binary complex with MYA and in ternary complexes with MYA and non-peptidic inhibitors Compounds I and II were solved by molecular replacement and refined to 2.9-, 3.1-, and 3.0-Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains six ScNMT molecules forming two pseudotrimers, which are almost identical with an average root mean square deviation of ∼0.45 Å based on superimposition of all C-α atoms. As with other reported NMT structures, the enzyme has a compact saddle-shaped β-sheet that spans the protein core surrounded by several α-helices. The NMT fold has an internal pseudo 2-fold symmetry with each half topologically equivalent to the monomer structure typical of a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. In all three complex structures, there was very good electron density for the bound MYA and the majority of the N-terminal region of the enzyme in all six protomers of the asymmetric unit. In the structure with Compound I bound, there was good electron density for the inhibitor in each ScNMT molecule. However, in the complex with Compound II, there was good electron density for the inhibitor in only two ScNMT molecules, but poor density in the other four molecules. The model of the ScNMT·MYA complex comprises approximately residues 5-30 and 37-455 of each ScNMT molecule. The models of the ScNMT·MYA·Compound I/II complexes contain approximately residues 5-21 and 38-455 of each ScNMT molecule.The overall structure of ScNMT in all three complexes (Fig. 2) is very similar to that described previously (27Bhatnagar R.S.

(27Bhatnagar R.S. Futterer K. Farazi T.A. Korolev S. Murray C.L. Jackson-Machelski E. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Waksman G. Nat. Struct.

For the first time, it can be seen that this segment adopts a well defined conformation in all three of our complex structures, whereas the equivalent region is either disordered (27Bhatnagar R.S. Futterer K. Farazi T.A. Korolev S. Murray C.L. Jackson-Machelski E. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Waksman G. Nat. Struct.

Interestingly, the N-terminal region (residues 1-60) is also invisible in the structures of C. albicans NMT both in the apo-form and in complexes with inhibitors (25Weston S.A. Camble R. Colls J.

The ordered N-terminal region in the ScNMT structures reported here forms an α-helix (αB′) and loop (B′A′) motif (Fig. 3). The αB′ helix packs along a hydrophobic surface patch and appears to stabilize the overall structure. The B′A′ loop is located on the surface of the protein near the MYA- and peptide-binding sites with interactions with the bound MYA and Ab loop. Another marked difference occurs in the Ab loop (residues 103-110), which adopts an open conformation in all three of our complex structures (Fig. 2B and Table 2), but assumes varying conformations in different structures reported previously (27Bhatnagar R.S. Futterer K. Farazi T.A. Korolev S. Murray C.L. Jackson-Machelski E. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Farazi T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2029398151,"We have previously identified ligands from combinatorial peptide libraries that target tumor vasculature after in vivo selection. These ligands bind to differentially expressed receptors in angiogenic vasculature such as alpha(v)beta3/alpha(v)beta5 integrins, aminopeptidase N, and aminopeptidase A. We hypothesized that we can use these ligands to target angiogenic vasculature in retinopathies. Pathological retinal angiogenesis in conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and age-related macular degeneration is a major cause of blindness for which current treatments are inadequate. Here we tested whether known tumor vasculature targeting peptide ligands displayed on bacteriophage particles would home to the proliferating blood vessels of the retina in a standard mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity. We found that activated retinal blood vessels share many of the endothelial and periendothelial cell receptors expressed in tumor vasculature. Furthermore, these vascular receptors--alpha(v) integrins and aminopeptidases--are accessible through the circulation and mediate phage homing and internalization to endothelial and periendothelial cells. Treatment of mice with a peptide containing a alpha(v)beta3/alpha(v)beta5-integrin targeting domain fused to a proapoptotic domain significantly reduced oxygen-induced retinal angiogenesis by selectively inducing activated endothelial cell apoptosis. Targeted proapoptotic peptides may prove useful in the management of angiogenic retinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2034318979,"We investigated whether transfer of the gene encoding the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin into the NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line could inhibit renal tumor growth in vivo. NIH/3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the murine endostatin (ES) gene. SCID mice bearing CaKi-1 derived tumors were given a subcutaneous injection of either ES-transduced cells or control cells and were monitored for tumor growth. At the end of the in vivo experiment, the mean tumor volume of treated mice was 51.6 +/- 2.4 mm3, while the tumor volume of control was 234.5 +/- 14.8 mm3. Microvascular density was significantly decreased on treatment (control 9.79 vs. ES 2.53%, <0.001) accompanied by a 23-fold increase in intratumoral necrotic area and a 2.94-fold increase in the apoptotic index, determined by immunohistochemistry with anti-activated caspase-3. Apoptotic cells were found in foci enriched in infiltrating leukocytes. In conclusion, retroviral endostatin gene transfer led to secretion of functional endostatin that was sufficiently active to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. A second mechanism may also be implied in endostatin-dependent tumor regression, associated with tumor infiltration of leukocytes. Besides its antiangiogenic properties, endostatin may be a promising adjuvant to immunotherapy."
