https://openalex.org/W2107710538,"The serpentinite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field is a remarkable submarine ecosystem in which geological, chemical, and biological processes are intimately interlinked. Reactions between seawater and upper mantle peridotite produce methane- and hydrogen-rich fluids, with temperatures ranging from &lt;40° to 90°C at pH 9 to 11, and carbonate chimneys 30 to 60 meters tall. A low diversity of microorganisms related to methane-cycling Archaea thrive in the warm porous interiors of the edifices. Macrofaunal communities show a degree of species diversity at least as high as that of black smoker vent sites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, but they lack the high biomasses of chemosynthetic organisms that are typical of volcanically driven systems."
https://openalex.org/W2126147651,"I constructed a temperature history for different parts of the world from 169 glacier length records. Using a first-order theory of glacier dynamics, I related changes in glacier length to changes in temperature. The derived temperature histories are fully independent of proxy and instrumental data used in earlier reconstructions. Moderate global warming started in the middle of the 19th century. The reconstructed warming in the first half of the 20th century is 0.5 kelvin. This warming was notably coherent over the globe. The warming signals from glaciers at low and high elevations appear to be very similar."
https://openalex.org/W1977313055,"To elucidate molecular, cellular, and circuit changes that occur in the brain during learning, we investigated the role of a glutamate receptor subtype in fear conditioning. In this form of learning, animals associate two stimuli, such as a tone and a shock. Here we report that fear conditioning drives AMPA-type glutamate receptors into the synapse of a large fraction of postsynaptic neurons in the lateral amygdala, a brain structure essential for this learning process. Furthermore, memory was reduced if AMPA receptor synaptic incorporation was blocked in as few as 10 to 20% of lateral amygdala neurons. Thus, the encoding of memories in the lateral amygdala is mediated by AMPA receptor trafficking, is widely distributed, and displays little redundancy."
https://openalex.org/W2009880851,"Environmental temperature is thought to be directly sensed by neurons through their projections in the skin. A subset of the mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels has been implicated in this process. These “thermoTRPs” are activated at distinct temperature thresholds and are typically expressed in sensory neurons. TRPV3 is activated by heat (&gt;33°C) and, unlike most thermoTRPs, is expressed in mouse keratinocytes. We found that TRPV3 null mice have strong deficits in responses to innocuous and noxious heat but not in other sensory modalities; hence, TRPV3 has a specific role in thermosensation. The natural compound camphor, which modulates sensations of warmth in humans, proved to be a specific activator of TRPV3. Camphor activated cultured primary keratinocytes but not sensory neurons, and this activity was abolished in TRPV3 null mice. Therefore, heat-activated receptors in keratinocytes are important for mammalian thermosensation."

We measured emissions from the combustion of biofuels, used widely in south Asia for cooking, and found that large amounts of carbonaceous aerosols are emitted per kilogram of fuel burnt. We calculate that biofuel combustion is the largest source of black carbon emissions in India, and we suggest that its control is central to climate change mitigation in the south Asian region."
https://openalex.org/W2130250591,"Atrogin1/MAFbx is an ubiquitin ligase that mediates muscle atrophy in a variety of catabolic states. We recently found that H2O2 stimulates atrogin1/MAFbx gene expression. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulates both reactive oxygen production and general activity of the ubiquitin conjugating pathway, we hypothesized that TNF-alpha would also increase atrogin1/MAFbx gene expression. As with H2O2, we found that TNF-alpha exposure up-regulates atrogin1/MAFbx mRNA within 2 h in C2C12 myotubes. Intraperitoneal injection of TNF-alpha increased atrogin1/MAFbx mRNA in skeletal muscle of adult mice within 4 h. Exposing myotubes to either TNF-alpha or H2O2 also produced general activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): p38, ERK1/2, and JNK. The increase in atrogin1/MAFbx gene expression induced by TNF-alpha was not altered significantly by ERK inhibitor PD98059 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125. In contrast, atrogin1/MAFbx up-regulation and the associated increase in ubiquitin conjugating activity were both blunted by p38 inhibitors, either SB203580 or curcumin. These data suggest that TNF-alpha acts via p38 to increase atrogin1/MAFbx gene expression in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1995058974,"Fragile X syndrome is a leading heritable cause of mental retardation that results from the loss of FMR1 gene function. A Drosophila model for Fragile X syndrome, based on the loss of dfmr1 activity, exhibits phenotypes that bear similarity to Fragile X-related symptoms. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment with metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists or lithium can rescue courtship and mushroom body defects observed in these flies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dfmr1 mutants display cognitive deficits in experience-dependent modification of courtship behavior, and treatment with mGluR antagonists or lithium restores these memory defects. These findings implicate enhanced mGluR signaling as the underlying cause of the cognitive, as well as some of the behavioral and neuronal, phenotypes observed in the Drosophila Fragile X model. They also raise the possibility that compounds having similar effects on metabotropic glutamate receptors may ameliorate cognitive and behavioral defects observed in Fragile X patients."
https://openalex.org/W1964581938,"Caspase-8, a proapoptotic protease, has an essential role in lymphocyte activation and protective immunity. We show that caspase-8 deficiency (CED) in humans and mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc receptors, or Toll-like receptor 4 in T, B, and natural killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the αβ complex of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) to associate with the upstream Bcl10-MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue) adapter complex. Recruitment of the IKKα, β complex, its activation, and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB require enzyme activity of full-length caspase-8. These findings thus explain the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and combined immunodeficiency in human CED."

https://openalex.org/W2020667613,"Although both tooth enamel and bone are composed of organized assemblies of carbonated apatite crystals, enamel is unusual in that it does not contain collagen nor does it remodel. Self-assembly of amelogenin protein into nanospheres has been recognized as a key factor in controlling the oriented and elongated growth of carbonated apatite crystals during dental enamel biomineralization. We report the in vitro formation of birefringent microribbon structures that were generated through the supramolecular assembly of amelogenin nanospheres. These microribbons have diffraction patterns that indicate a periodic structure of crystalline units along the long axis. The growth of apatite crystals orientated along the c axis and parallel to the long axes of the microribbons was observed in vitro. The linear arrays (chains) of nanospheres observed as intermediate states before the microribbon formation give an important indication as to the function of amelogenin in controlling the oriented growth of apatite crystals during enamel mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1999417414,"Using an absorption cell, we measured the Doppler shifts of the interstellar hydrogen resonance glow to show the direction of the neutral hydrogen flow as it enters the inner heliosphere. The neutral hydrogen flow is found to be deflected relative to the helium flow by about 4 degrees . The most likely explanation of this deflection is a distortion of the heliosphere under the action of an ambient interstellar magnetic field. In this case, the helium flow vector and the hydrogen flow vector constrain the direction of the magnetic field and act as an interstellar magnetic compass."
https://openalex.org/W2097551408,"The obligately anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis , an opportunistic pathogen and inhabitant of the normal human colonic microbiota, exhibits considerable within-strain phase and antigenic variation of surface components. The complete genome sequence has revealed an unusual breadth (in number and in effect) of DNA inversion events that potentially control expression of many different components, including surface and secreted components, regulatory molecules, and restriction-modification proteins. Invertible promoters of two different types (12 group 1 and 11 group 2) were identified. One group has inversion crossover ( fix ) sites similar to the hix sites of Salmonella typhimurium . There are also four independent intergenic shufflons that potentially alter the expression and function of varied genes. The composition of the 10 different polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters identified (7 with associated invertible promoters) suggests a mechanism of synthesis similar to the O-antigen capsules of Escherichia coli ."
https://openalex.org/W2011123221,"Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is the founding member of a family of sterol-binding proteins implicated in vesicle transport, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. Here, OSBP was found to function as a cholesterol-binding scaffolding protein coordinating the activity of two phosphatases to control the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Cytosolic OSBP formed a approximately 440-kilodalton oligomer with a member of the PTPPBS family of tyrosine phosphatases, the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A, and cholesterol. This oligomer had dual specific phosphatase activity for phosphorylated ERK (pERK). When cell cholesterol was lowered, the oligomer disassembled and the level of pERK rose. The oligomer also disassembled when exposed to oxysterols. Increasing the amount of OSBP oligomer rendered cells resistant to the effects of cholesterol depletion and decreased the basal level of pERK. Thus, cholesterol functions through its interaction with OSBP outside of membranes to regulate the assembly of an oligomeric phosphatase that controls a key signaling pathway in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1998893768,"Unexpected, biologically salient stimuli elicit a short-latency, phasic response in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Although this signal is important for reinforcement learning, the information it conveys to forebrain target structures remains uncertain. One way to decode the phasic DA signal would be to determine the perceptual properties of sensory inputs to DA neurons. After local disinhibition of the superior colliculus in anesthetized rats, DA neurons became visually responsive, whereas disinhibition of the visual cortex was ineffective. As the primary source of visual afferents, the limited processing capacities of the colliculus may constrain the visual information content of phasic DA responses."
https://openalex.org/W2139275024,"Deep-sea life requires adaptation to high pressure, an extreme yet common condition given that oceans cover 70% of Earth's surface and have an average depth of 3800 meters. Survival at such depths requires specific adaptation but, compared with other extreme conditions, high pressure has received little attention. Recently, Photobacterium profundum strain SS9 has been adopted as a model for piezophily. Here we report its genome sequence (6.4 megabase pairs) and transcriptome analysis. The results provide a first glimpse into the molecular basis for life in the largest portion of the biosphere, revealing high metabolic versatility."
https://openalex.org/W2132772974,"Apigenin is a nontoxic dietary flavonoid that has been shown to possess anti-tumor properties and therefore poses special interest for the development of a novel chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent for cancer. Ovarian cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death among women. Here we demonstrate that apigenin inhibits expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human ovarian cancer cells. VEGF plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis and growth. We found that apigenin inhibited VEGF expression at the transcriptional level through expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Apigenin inhibited expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF via the PI3K/AKT/p70S6K1 and HDM2/p53 pathways. Apigenin inhibited tube formation in vitro by endothelial cells. These findings reveal a novel role of apigenin in inhibiting HIF-1 and VEGF expression that is important for tumor angiogenesis and growth, identifying new signaling molecules that mediate this regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2009985663,"The brain of Homo floresiensis was assessed by comparing a virtual endocast from the type specimen (LB1) with endocasts from great apes, Homo erectus, Homo sapiens, a human pygmy, a human microcephalic, specimen number Sts 5 (Australopithecus africanus), and specimen number WT 17000 (Paranthropus aethiopicus). Morphometric, allometric, and shape data indicate that LB1 is not a microcephalic or pygmy. LB1's brain/body size ratio scales like that of an australopithecine, but its endocast shape resembles that of Homo erectus. LB1 has derived frontal and temporal lobes and a lunate sulcus in a derived position, which are consistent with capabilities for higher cognitive processing."
https://openalex.org/W2053596672,"Aquaporin-7 (AQP7) is a water/glycerol transporting protein expressed in adipocyte plasma membranes. We report here remarkable age-dependent hypertrophy in adipocytes in AQP7-deficient mice. Wild type and AQP7 null mice had similar growth at 0–16 weeks as assessed by body weight; however, by 16 weeks AQP7 null mice had 3.7-fold increased body fat mass. Adipocytes from AQP7 null mice of age 16 weeks were greatly enlarged (diameter 118 μm) compared with wild type mice (39 μm). Adipocytes from AQP7 null mice also accumulated excess glycerol (251 versus 86 nmol/mg of protein) and triglycerides (3.4 versus 1.7 μmol/mg of protein). In contrast, at age 4 weeks, adipocyte volume and body fat mass were comparable in wild type and AQP7 null mice. To investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for the progressive adipocyte hypertrophy, glycerol permeability and fat metabolism were studied in adipocytes isolated from the younger mice. Plasma membrane glycerol permeability measured by [14C]glycerol uptake was 3-fold reduced in AQP7-deficient adipocytes. However, adipocyte lipolysis, measured by free fatty acid release and hormone-sensitive lipase activity, and lipogenesis, measured by [14C]glucose incorporation into triglycerides, were not affected by AQP7 deletion. These data suggest that adipocyte hypertrophy in AQP7 deficiency results from defective glycerol exit and consequent accumulation of glycerol and triglycerides. Increasing AQP7 expression/function in adipocytes may reduce adipocyte volume and fat mass in obesity.

Impaired glycerol transport in AQP3-deficient epidermal cells produced a low glycerol concentration in epidermis and stratum corneum (with normal serum glycerol), resulting in reduced stratum corneum hydration, elasticity, and biosynthesis, each of which could be corrected by glycerol replacement therapy (7Hara M.

Here, we investigated a possible role for AQP7-mediated glycerol transport in fat cell physiology by phenotype analysis of transgenic mice with targeted AQP7 gene disruption. During the preparation of our manuscript Maeda et al. (18Maeda N. Funahashi T. Hibuse T. Nagasawa A. Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Nakamura T. Kihara S. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Here, we report in older AQP7 null mice marked adipocyte hypertrophy and increased body fat. Mechanistic analysis of adipocyte hypertrophy in AQP7 deficiency suggests pharmacological modulation of adipocyte AQP7 as a possible therapy in obesity. Mice—AQP7 null mice were generated by targeted deletion of exon 2 (manuscript describing gene knock-out procedures in preparation) and backcrossed into a CD1 genetic background. The mice were maintained in air-filtered cages and fed normal mouse chow in the University of California, San Francisco, Animal Care Facility. All procedures were approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Animal Research. RNA and Protein Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from epididymal fat and kidney using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were done using sequence-specific primers (GenBank™ accession numbers: NM_007473 (AQP7), NM_011146 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)), NM_007678 (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)). Immunoblotting was done using polyclonal anti-PPARγ and C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Fat Mass and Morphology—White adipose tissue (WAT) from epididymal or gonadal, mesenteric, and inguinal tissues of wild type and AQP7 null mice at various ages (4–16 weeks) was excised and weighed. WAT was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, and sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. For measurement of diameter, adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pad by collagenase digestion (19Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and photographing at high magnification for image analysis. Glycerol Permeability and Release—Glycerol permeability was measured in isolated adipocytes by modification of the method of Ma et al. (5Ma T. Hara M. Sougrat R. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The adipocyte suspension was incubated for specified times with 100 mm glycerol in Krebs-Ringer Hepes (KRH) containing tracer [3H]glycerol (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. After separating on glass fiber filters and washing five times with ice-cold KRH in a suction filtration apparatus, cells were disrupted with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Glycerol release from WAT was determined as described previously (20Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Epididymal fat tissue was diced and incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1–3 h. Released glycerol was assayed using a glycerol assay Kit (Sigma). Glycerol, Free Fatty Acids, and Triglycerides in WAT and Serum— WAT was excised from the gonadal fat pad (female mice, age 16 weeks) and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. Lipid and aqueous phases were extracted by method of Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42828) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the lipid phase were resolved by TLC for measurement of free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride (TG). Glycerol was assayed enzymatically (Roche Applied Science). For serum analysis, enzymatic assay kits were used for the determination of serum nonesterified fatty acids (Wako) and glycerol, glucose, and total TG (Sigma). Lipolysis, Hormone-sensitive Lipase Activity, and Lipogenesis— Lipolysis was assayed using isolated adipocytes as described previously (22Morimoto C. Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 132-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in KRH buffer supplemented with 2.5% BSA, and release of FFA was measured. Hormone-sensitive lipase activity was measured using a lipase kit (Research Diagnostics, Inc.) as described previously (23Zhou Z. Yon Toh S. Chen Z. Guo K. Ng C.P. Ponniah S. Lin S.C. Hong W. Li P. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Lipogenesis was assayed as described previously (24Kimura Y. Ohminami H. Okuda H. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1998; 59: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were incubated with [U-14C]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 nm insulin and 4% BSA for 1 h at 37°C. The lipid fraction was extracted and resolved by TLC, and 14C radioactivity in the TG fraction was measured. RT-PCR analysis in Fig. 1A confirmed AQP7 transcript expression in adipocytes and kidney from wild type but not homozygous AQP7 null mice. Analysis of mouse growth through age 16 weeks showed similar mouse body weight, although mouse length was reduced in the AQP7 null mice at 16 weeks (Fig. 1B). AQP7 null mice had remarkably greater gonadal fat mass compared with wild type mice as seen grossly (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D (left) shows that fat mass from indicated sites was significantly elevated in both male and female AQP7 null mice at 16 weeks. Epididymal fat mass was comparable in wild type and AQP7 null mice until age 4 weeks but became greatly different as the mice aged (Fig. 1D, right). Fig. 2A shows histology of gonadal fat at 16 weeks, which was representative of the appearance of fat at multiple sites. Adipocytes were remarkably larger in AQP7 null mice than in wild type mice. Averaged adipocyte area was increased in AQP7 null mice (5322 ± 157 versus 2014 ± 67 μm2), suggesting that the greater fat mass in the AQP7 null mice is a consequence of adipocyte hypertrophy. Fig. 2B (top) shows light micrographs of adipocytes isolated from wild type and AQP7 null mice at age 4 and 16 weeks, which were used for subsequent cell-based studies. While adipocyte size was comparable in mice at age 4 weeks, adipocytes were remarkably enlarged in AQP7 null mice at age 16 weeks. Adipocyte diameter in AQP7 null mice was increased ∼3-fold (Fig. 2B, bottom). Fig. 2C summarizes the concentrations of glycerol, FFA, and TG in serum and adipocytes from mice at age 16 weeks. Serum parameters were unaffected by AQP7 deletion; similar results were obtained from age 4 week mice (data not shown). However, adipocyte glycerol, FFA, and TG content, expressed per milligram of total protein, were significantly elevated in the AQP7 null mice. To investigate the mechanism for the progressive adipocyte hypertrophy in AQP7 deficiency, measurements were made of adipocyte plasma membrane glycerol permeability, glycerol release, lipolysis, and lipogenesis. Plasma membrane glycerol permeability was measured from the initial uptake of [14C]-glycerol into isolated adipocytes from the younger wild type and AQP7 null mice (Fig. 3A), where adipocyte size is comparable. Uptake of [14C]glycerol was measured at 5 min based on initial studies showing linear uptake at this time (Fig. 3A, inset). [14C]Glycerol uptake was significantly reduced by 3.0-fold in AQP7 null mice compared with wild type mice. Permeability coefficients, Pglycerol, computed from uptake rates and adipocyte surface-to-volume ratio, were 2.5 × 10–6 cm/s and 0.7 × 10–6 cm/s for wild type and AQP7-deficient adipocytes, respectively. Glycerol release from minced fat tissue was determined by assay of glycerol in the physiological bathing solution at 1 and 3 h after incubation at 37 °C. Fig. 3B shows that glycerol release, expressed per WAT weight, was significantly reduced in the AQP7 null mice. However, these release data do not provide direct information about adipocyte lipolysis because glycerol release depends on several factors, including the rate of lipolysis, cytoplasmic glycerol concentration, and plasma membrane glycerol permeability. To assess lipolysis, FFA release from isolated adipocytes was measured, as well as the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, a key regulator of lipolysis. Fig. 3C shows that lipolysis was not affected by AQP7 deletion. Lipogenesis was assayed in isolated adipocytes from the incorporation of [14C]glucose into TG. Fig. 3D shows similar lipogenesis in wild type and AQP7 null mice. We also determined whether PPARγ and C/EBPα were induced, which are transcription factors involved in adipogenesis. Immunoblot analysis in Fig. 3E shows similar C/EBPα protein expression in wild type and AQP7 null mice (1.0 ± 0.03-fold protein; 1.1 ± 0.3-fold mRNA, n = 5), although PPARγ was slightly reduced in AQP7 null mice at 16 weeks (0.79 ± 0.1-fold protein; 0.42 ± 0.3-fold reduced mRNA, n = 5). We found marked adipocyte hypertrophy and increased fat mass in AQP7-deficient mice, which developed progressively after age 6 weeks. Mechanistic studies in isolated adipocytes and minced fat tissue suggested that the ∼3-fold reduced glycerol permeability of the adipocyte plasma membrane was responsible for the marked adipocyte hypertrophy in AQP7 deficiency, rather than primary defects in adipocyte lipolysis, lipogenesis, or PPARγ induction (25Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). We propose that reduced adipocyte glycerol permeability results in intracellular glycerol and TG accumulation, as was verified experimentally, resulting in progressive adipocyte expansion. The recent phenotype study of Maeda et al. (18Maeda N. Funahashi T. Hibuse T. Nagasawa A. Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Nakamura T. Kihara S. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17801-17806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) did not report data on adipocyte morphology or fat mass but looked only at relatively young mice focusing on basal and stimulated release of glycerol into the blood. They concluded from adipocyte glycerol release measurements that impaired glycerol “gateway” function was responsible for the phenotype of reduced plasma glycerol. However, although we agree that adipocyte glycerol permeability is impaired in AQP7-deficient adipocytes (from glycerol uptake measurements in Fig. 3A), glycerol gateway function cannot be deduced from the glycerol release measurements of Maeda et al. (18Maeda N. Funahashi T. Hibuse T. Nagasawa A. Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Nakamura T. Kihara S. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17801-17806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which depend on glycerol permeability as well lipolysis rate and steady-state adipocyte glycerol content. Increased adipocyte size and fat mass in AQP7-deficient mice were not noted by Maeda et al. (18Maeda N. Funahashi T. Hibuse T. Nagasawa A. Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Nakamura T. Kihara S. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17801-17806Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), possibly because the phenotype of older mice was not studied. Fig. 3F shows a proposed mechanism for progressive TG accumulation in AQP7-deficient adipocytes. Reduced plasma membrane glycerol permeability in AQP7 deficiency results in an increase in steady-state glycerol concentration in adipocyte cytoplasm. The 3.0-fold reduced plasma membrane glycerol permeability is consistent with the 2.9-fold increase in steady-state adipocyte glycerol concentration. Increased adipocyte glycerol concentration would then increase glycerol 3-phosphate and hence TG biosynthesis. Our results thus focus attention on adipocyte glycerol permeability as a novel regulator of adipocyte size and whole body fat mass. Modulation of adipocyte AQP7 expression and/or function may thus alter fat mass, providing a rational basis for investigation of AQP7 up-regulation as therapy in some forms of obesity.

https://openalex.org/W2000912568,"Innate immunity in higher plants invokes a sophisticated surveillance system capable of recognizing bacterial effector proteins. In Arabidopsis , resistance to infection by strains of Pseudomonas syringae expressing the effector AvrRpt2 requires the plant resistance protein RPS2. AvrRpt2 was identified as a putative cysteine protease that results in the elimination of the Arabidopsis protein RIN4. RIN4 cleavage serves as a signal to activate RPS2-mediated resistance. AvrRpt2 is delivered into the plant cell, where it is activated by a eukaryotic factor that we identify as cyclophilin. This activation of AvrRpt2 is necessary for protease activity. Active AvrRpt2 can then directly cleave RIN4."
https://openalex.org/W2008304259,"Crystal structures of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genotype 2a of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from two crystal forms have been determined. Similar to the three-dimensional structures of HCV polymerase genotype 1b and other known polymerases, the structures of the HCV polymerase genotype 2a in both crystal forms can be depicted in the classical right-hand arrangement with fingers, palm, and thumb domains. The main structural differences between the molecules in the two crystal forms lie at the interface of the fingers and thumb domains. The relative orientation of the thumb domain with respect to the fingers and palm domains and the beta-flap region is altered. Structural analysis reveals that the NS5B polymerase in crystal form I adopts a ""closed"" conformation that is believed to be the active form, whereas NS5B in crystal form II adopts an ""open"" conformation and is thus in the inactive form. In addition, we have determined the structures of two NS5B polymerase/non-nucleoside inhibitor complexes. Both inhibitors bind at a common binding site, which is nearly 35 A away from the polymerase active site and is located in the thumb domain. The binding pocket is predominantly hydrophobic in nature, and the enzyme inhibitor complexes are stabilized by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. Inhibitors can only be soaked in crystal form I and not in form II; examination of the enzyme-inhibitor complex reveals that the enzyme has undergone a dramatic conformational change from the form I (active) complex to the form II (inactive)."

We show, using unialgal versus mixed algal diets of different nutritional status (i.e., nitrogen:carbon ratio) fed to Acartia tonsa, that diatoms per se are not toxic but that single-diatom diets are inadequate. Additionally, the nutritional state of the phytoplankton has a profound effect on copepod growth and growth efficiency. The ecological significance of laboratory demonstrations of diatom toxicity needs to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2052004855,"Human corneal epithelial cells respond rapidly following injury to restore the integrity of the ocular surface. What stimulates and guides cells to move into the wound to heal? One candidate is the wound-induced electric field. Using vibrating probe techniques, we provide detailed temporal and spatial mapping of endogenous electric currents at rat corneal wounds. We find Cl- and Na+ are the major components of electric currents in rat corneal wounds. Na+ is the major component of ionic transport in the resting (nonwounded) rat cornea and of the wound center leakage current, whereas Cl- is a more important component of the endogenous electrical current at the wound edges. Enhancing or decreasing Cl- flow with clinically approved pharmacological agents such as aminophylline, ascorbic acid, or furosemide increased or decreased endogenous wound electric currents, respectively. These changes in wound currents correlated directly with the rate of wound healing in vivo. Thus, pharmacologically enhancing or decreasing wound-induced electric currents increased and decreased wound healing rate, respectively. This may have wide-reaching and novel therapeutic potential in the management of wound healing and may help explain some mechanistic aspects of the effects of some clinically used agents."
https://openalex.org/W2129150800,"We performed proteomic analysis of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) obtained by laser capture microdissection from pyramidal neurons in hippocampal sector CA1 in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) using liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. We discovered a total of 155 proteins in laser captured NFT's, 72 of which were identified by multiple unique peptides. Of these 72 proteins, 63 had previously unknown association with NFTs; one of these was glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). We validated by immunohistochemistry that GAPDH co-localized with the majority of NFTs as well as plaque-like structures in AD brain and was co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies to abnormal forms of tau in AD, but not tau from AD temporal cortex. Characterization of GAPDH showed that it, along with phosphorylated tau and Abeta peptides, was present in detergent-insoluble fractions from AD temporal cortex but not from age-matched controls. These data are the first proteomic investigation of NFTs. Moreover, our results validate this approach by demonstrating that GAPDH, a glycolytic and microtubule binding protein, not only co-localized to NFTs and immunoprecipitated with PHF-tau, but also is one of the few proteins known to undergo conversion to a detergent-insoluble form in AD."

Laser ablation and whole-rock multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry magnesium isotope analyses of calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from CV3 meteorites demonstrate that some CAIs had initial 26 Al/ 27 Al values at least 25% greater than canonical and that the canonical initial 26 Al/ 27 Al cannot mark the beginning of solar system formation. Using rates of Mg diffusion in minerals, we find that the canonical initial 26 Al/ 27 Al is instead the culmination of thousands of brief high-temperature events incurred by CAIs during a 10 5 -year residence time in the solar protoplanetary disk."
https://openalex.org/W2150583394,"Hyperinflammatory responses to infection have been postulated as a component of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Studies have linked intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) mobilization with inflammatory responses in several systems. We have reported that the pro-inflammatory mediator bradykinin (BK) promotes larger Ca2+i signals in CF compared with normal bronchial epithelia, a response that reflects endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Ca2+ store expansion induced by chronic luminal airway infection/inflammation. The present study investigated whether CF airway epithelia were hyperinflammatory and, if so, whether the hyperinflammatory CF phenotype was linked to larger Ca2+ stores in the ER. We found that ΔF508 CF bronchial epithelia were hyperinflammatory as defined by an increased basal and mucosal BK-induced interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. However, the CF hyperinflammation expressed in short-term (6–11-day-old) primary cultures of ΔF508 bronchial epithelia was lost in long-term (30–40-day-old) primary cultures of ΔF508 bronchial epithelia, indicating this response was independent of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Exposure of 30–40-day-old cultures of normal airway epithelia to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from CF airways reproduced the increased basal and mucosal BK-stimulated IL-8 secretion of short-term CF cultures. The BK-triggered increased IL-8 secretion in SMM-treated cultures was mediated by an increased Ca2+i mobilization consequent to an ER expansion associated with increases in protein synthesis (total, cytokines, and antimicrobial factors). The increased ER-dependent, Ca2+i-mediated hyperinflammatory epithelial response may represent a general beneficial airway epithelial adaptation to transient luminal infection. However, in CF airways, the Ca2+i-mediated hyperinflammation may be ineffective in promoting the eradication of infection in thickened mucus and, consequently, may have adverse effects in the lung.

It remains controversial whether the inflammatory response of CF airways to infection is intrinsically excessive and, thus, accelerates lung disease. As evidence for excessive inflammation, cytokines are elevated in sputa from CF compared with disease control (asthmatic) patients (6Koller D.Y. Nething I. Otto J. Urbanek R. Eichler I. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 155: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and bronchoalveolar lavage studies have revealed higher levels of cytokines and inflammatory cells referenced to bacterial number or endotoxin levels in CF versus non-CF patients with acute lung infection (4Muhlebach M.S.

Many studies have addressed the magnitude of airway epithelial inflammatory responses to infection in CF by focusing on the regulation of cytokine production by the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB (8Konstan M.W.

In addition, intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) signals resulting from heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation by inflammatory mediators or infectious agents also modulate NF-κB activation by a Ca2+i-dependent mechanism (11Hu Q.

Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L63-L69PubMed Google Scholar) and induces interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in non-CF and CF human airway epithelia (19Rodgers H.C. Pang L. Holland E. Corbett L. Range S. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L612-L618Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CF pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus promote IL-8 secretion by a Ca2+i mobilization-dependent mechanism in airway epithelial cells (20Ratner A.J. Bryan R.

We have shown that apical purinoceptor (P2Y2 receptors) or BK receptor activation induces larger Ca2+i signals in CF compared with normal human airway epithelia (21Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and this exaggerated Ca2+i response results from luminal infection/inflammation-induced up-regulation of the apically confined endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores (22Ribeiro C.M.P.

The possibility that the amplified ER-derived Ca2+i responses provide a clue to the pathogenesis of CF hyperinflammation was raised by studies of other diseases. For example, in a model for Gaucher disease, hippocampal cells expressed a greater glutamate-dependent ER Ca2+ release, consequent to an increased ER size, which appeared linked to the neuronal toxicity characteristic of this disease (23Korkotian E. Schwarz A. Pelled D. Schwarzmann G. Segal M. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21673-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, presenillin mutations in Alzheimer disease have been associated with increases in ER size, Ca2+ stores, and cytokine production (24Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Patterson P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of CF, the possible relationships among ER expansion, enhanced cytokine release, and CF airways inflammation are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that CF airway epithelia express a hyperinflammatory phenotype resulting from luminal infection/inflammation-induced up-regulation of ER Ca2 stores. Accordingly, we investigated the following: 1) whether CF airway epithelia have increased IL-8 release in response to the inflammatory peptide BK as compared with normal airway epithelia; 2) whether this response is an epithelial adaptation to luminal infection/inflammation or depends on mutant ΔF508 CFTR; and 3) whether greater ER-derived Ca2+i responses contribute to the increased cytokine release in an in vitro model for CF airway epithelial inflammation. Cell Culture and Freshly Excised Tissue—Tissues and cells were obtained under the auspices of protocols approved by the Institutional Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. Excess tissues from human donor lungs and excised recipient lungs were obtained at the time of lung transplantation from main stem or lobar bronchi. Tissues were either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin or used for cell isolation. Bronchial epithelial cells were provided by the University of North Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center Tissue Core. Normal and CF (ΔF508 homozygous) cells were harvested and cultured as previously described (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at an air-liquid surface interface, and polarized primary cultures were studied at 6–11 days (short-term cultures) or at 30–40 days (long-term cultures). IL-8 Secretion—For basal, apical BK-stimulated, UTP-stimulated, or SMM from CF airways (see “Studies with Infectious/Inflammatory Material from CF Airways”)-stimulated IL-8 secretion, the serosal media were collected at selected times from short-term or long-term cultures of normal and CF bronchial epithelia. IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems) in duplicate. Studies with Infectious/Inflammatory Material from CF Airways— Mucopurulent material was harvested from the airway lumens of excised human CF lungs infected with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at the time of transplant and provided by the Tissue Core of the University of North Carolina Cystic Fibrosis Center as recently described (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This material was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (60 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and frozen at –80 °C. Preliminary studies revealed that treatment of airway epithelia with SMM from individual CF lungs infected with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus induced epithelial hyperinflammation. Because of the small volume of SMM per patient and the large number of experiments, SMMs from nine CF lungs (five males and four females; age, 17–48 years; four ΔF508 homozygous and five unknown genotypes) were pooled to assure homogeneous stimulus throughout experiments. PBS or SMM (40 μl) was applied to the mucosal surfaces of normal or CF bronchial epithelia, and the following protocols were utilized. First, to compare the inflammatory response of normal versus CF cultures to luminal infectious/inflammatory stimuli, cultures were treated with PBS or SMM, and a time course was performed for IL-8 secretion. Second, to test whether SMM-treated cultures were sensitized to a subsequent inflammatory stimulus, cultures were treated with PBS or SMM for 24–36 h, and the serosal media were replaced by fresh media, followed by mucosal BK (5 μm) or UTP (100 μm) and serial measurements of IL-8 secretion. Third, to address the role of Ca2+i mobilization on SMM-potentiated BK-induced IL-8 secretion, cultures were treated with PBS or SMM for 36 h, followed by removal of the medium and BAPTA/acetoxymethyl ester loading as previously described (21Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). BK (5 μm) was subsequently mucosally added to cultures in a nominally Ca2+-free solution (21Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and Ca2+i mobilization was assessed as previously reported (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); in parallel experiments, IL-8 release into the serosal compartment was measured 2 h later. Fourth, to assess the effect of SMM on IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1β secretion, cultures were treated with PBS or SMM for up to 120 h, and the serosal media were collected and replaced every 24 h for cytokine measurements. Fifth, to address the effect of SMM on total protein synthesis, the incorporation of 35S-labeled amino acids into proteins synthesized by cultures metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine (26Coligan J.E. Gates F.T. II I Kimball E.S. Maloy W.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 413-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was measured after 48 h of PBS or SMM treatment. Immunostaining of ER Protein Synthetic Markers—The immunostaining of ER chaperone proteins in cultures of bronchial airway epithelia or deparaffinized native bronchial epithelial sections was performed according to a modification of our previous method (27Ribeiro C.M. Reece J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26555-26561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cultures or epithelial sections were incubated with the primary antibodies, a rabbit (1:100 dilution) and a mouse (5 μg/ml; Stressgen) antibody, for BIP and PDI, respectively, followed by a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody and a Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:200 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). As controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. The fluorescent signals were studied by laser confocal microscopy (Leica model TCS 4D; PL APO 63x/1.20 mm water lens) in the XZ or XY scanning mode. The quantification of the fluorescence intensity of labeled BIP and PDI was performed according to a previous method (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Multiple scans were obtained from each sample, and regions of interest were designated in the apical domains with the MetaMorph software. The same acquisition parameters (e.g. laser power, contrast, brightness, and pinhole value) for each channel were employed to acquire the images from paired normal bronchial epithelial cultures treated in different ways or native normal versus CF bronchial epithelia in experiments performed on the same day. The fluorescence intensity values from the regions of interest were averaged from paired cultures and native bronchial epithelial tissues. XBP-1 mRNA Splicing—The assessment of XBP-1 mRNA splicing was an adaptation of a previous method (28Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 29Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Long-term bronchial epithelial cultures were mucosally treated with 40 μl of PBS or SMM for 48 h or 1 μm thapsigargin (TG) for 24 h, followed by three washes with PBS. 1 ml of RNAlater™ (Qiagen) was added to the mucosal and serosal surfaces, and cultures were frozen at –20 °C. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen), and 200 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed by SuperScript II RNase H+ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 250 ng of random primers. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 270-bp region of XBP-1 (sequence number NM_005080). The PCR product spans a 26-bp intron that, when spliced by IRE1, results in a translated XBP-1 mRNA that codes for an active transcription factor. The unspliced PCR product contains a PstI site, which is destroyed after splicing. The PCR protocol was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 7 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 7 min and holding at 4 °C. The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, column-purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and digested with PstI to visualize the 270-bp product (spliced product) and the two ∼140-bp products (unspliced product). To quantify the amount of unspliced product, a Southern blot was performed using the PstI-digested PCR product from PBS- and SMM-treated cultures. DNA was run on a 2% agarose gel, capillary blot transferred, cross-linked to the membrane, and probed (Megaprime DNA Labeling Kit; Amersham Biosciences) with the 270-bp PCR product from PBS-treated samples. Data were quantified with a Storm phosphorimaging system. Quantitation of BIP mRNA—Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to evaluate changes in BIP mRNA from PBS- and SMM-treated cultures utilizing the LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). RNA was isolated according to standard RNA isolation procedures involving phenol/choloroform extraction and purification/DNase treatment using the Qiagen RNeasy purification kit. cDNA was generated from RNA samples (200 ng) using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. PCR amplification utilized the following primer sequences: 5′ forward, TCCTATGTCGCCTTCACTCC; and 3′ reverse, TTTCCCAATAACCTCAGC. Primers were initially tested for specificity by PCR and then by melting curve analysis in the LightCycler instrument. A standard curve was run utilizing a positive control cDNA to determine PCR reaction efficiency. PBS- or SMM-treated samples were run in duplicate, and cross-points were calculated using the LightCycler internal software. As a control gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also run in duplicate on each of the samples. Ratios of gene expression were calculated as previously reported (30Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). Statistics—Data represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three experiments from three individual donors and were analyzed by unpaired t test or two-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Short-term Primary Cultures of CF Airway Epithelia Exhibit Increased Basal and BK-stimulated IL-8 Secretion—To investigate whether CF airway epithelia exhibit hyperinflammation, we first compared the basal IL-8 secretion in 6–11-day-old normal versus ΔF508 homozygous CF primary bronchial epithelial cultures. Fig. 1A illustrates that the baseline IL-8 secretion was increased in short-term CF compared with normal cultures. The effect of the pro-inflammatory agonist BK on IL-8 secretion was measured in parallel 6–11-day-old primary cultures of normal and ΔF508 homozygous CF bronchial epithelia. Mucosal treatment with a maximal dose of BK (5 μm) (18Paradiso A.M. Cheng E.H.C. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L63-L69PubMed Google Scholar) promoted greater IL-8 secretion in CF compared with normal cultures (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that short-term primary cultures of CF bronchial airway epithelia express a hyperinflammatory phenotype. Is the CF Hyperinflammatory Phenotype the Result of an Intrinsic ΔF508 CFTR Defect or an Acquired Epithelial Response to Chronic Airway Infection/Inflammation?—To address this issue, IL-8 secretion under basal and BK-stimulated conditions was studied in long-term normal versus ΔF508 homozygous CF primary bronchial epithelial cultures. Fig. 1C demonstrates that the increased baseline IL-8 secretion in short-term CF cultures compared with normal cultures (Fig. 1A) was lost after 30–40 days in culture. Furthermore, 30–40-day-old CF cultures responded in the same manner to 5 μm mucosal BK-dependent IL-8 secretion as 30–40-day-old normal cultures (Fig. 1D). These data strongly suggest that the hyperinflammatory state observed in short-term CF cultures does not represent a defect intrinsic to the ΔF508 CFTR genotype but, rather, is a response to the persistent infectious/inflammatory milieu found in CF airways in vivo that wanes with prolonged periods in the absence of the stimulus. Can the CF Hyperinflammatory Phenotype Be Transferred to Normal Airway Epithelia by Mucosal Exposure to CF Airway Mucopurulent Material?—To test more directly for the role of persistent infection and inflammation on hyperinflammatory responsiveness, we prepared a SMM from CF airway lumens, exposed the lumens of airway epithelial cultures to it for prolonged periods, and measured basal and BK-induced IL-8 release. SMM-dependent IL-8 secretion was first investigated in long-term 30–40-day-old primary cultures of normal and CF bronchial epithelia acutely exposed to mucosal SMM for up to 6 h. Fig. 2A illustrates that the acute SMM treatment triggered IL-8 secretion, but this response was similar in long-term normal and CF cultures for each interval. We next assessed whether prolonged SMM pretreatment (36 h) conferred a “CF-like hyperinflammatory phenotype,” i.e. an increased IL-8 secretory response to mucosal BK, in normal airway epithelia and whether this response was different in long-term cultures of CF epithelia. SMM-pretreated 30–40-day-old normal epithelia exhibited an increased IL-8 secretion to BK (Fig. 2B) compared with 30–40-day-old normal epithelia exposed to BK in the absence of SMM pretreatment (Fig. 1D). Moreover, an increased BK-dependent IL-8 secretion was induced in 30–40-day-old CF cultures pretreated for 36 h with SMM (Fig. 2B), as compared with non-SMM treated cultures (Fig. 1D). Notably, the IL-8 response of SMM-pretreated CF cultures in the absence (Fig. 2A) or presence (Fig. 2B) of mucosal BK was similar to that of normal cultures. Thus, these data again argue against an intrinsic hyperinflammatory defect associated with the ΔF508 genotype but suggest that chronic infection/inflammation (SMM) itself can induce the hyperinflammatory phenotype. Can the CF-like Hyperinflammatory Phenotype, e.g., the Amplified BK-dependent IL-8 Secretion in SMM-pretreated Normal Cultures, Be Reproduced with the Activation of Another Receptor Coupled to Ca2+i Mobilization?—Like BK receptors, P2Y2 receptors are coupled to Ca2+i mobilization (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether activation of this class of receptors with UTP stimulated IL-8 secretion in airway epithelia and, if so, whether SMM potentiated this response. Following a 24-h PBS pretreatment, 100 μm mucosal UTP induced a modest increase in IL-8 secretion in 30–40-day-old normal bronchial epithelia compared with vehicle-treated cultures (Fig. 3). In contrast, cultures pretreated with SMM secreted much higher levels of IL-8 in response to 100 μm mucosal UTP compared with PBS-treated cultures (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the increased IL-8 secretion triggered by apical activation of BK receptors in SMM-pretreated cultures (Fig. 2B) may be a general finding associated with the activation of GPCRs that trigger increased Ca2+i mobilization in chronically infected/inflamed airway epithelia (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Is SMM-potentiated BK-dependent IL-8 Secretion Dependent on SMM-induced Expansion of the Releasable ER Ca2+ Stores?—To address the role of Ca2+i signals on the amplified SMM-induced BK-dependent inflammatory response, we investigated BK-induced Ca2+i mobilization in 30–40-day-old normal bronchial airway epithelial cultures treated with PBS versus SMM for 36 h. Mucosal BK (5 μm) elicited Ca2+i mobilization in both PBS- and SMM-treated cultures, but the BK-dependent Ca2+i signal was amplified in SMM-treated epithelia (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). The compiled data for BK-dependent Δ340/380 Fura-2 fluorescence (peak – baseline values, an index of ER Ca2+ store capacity in airway epithelia) (22Ribeiro C.M.P. Paradiso A.M. Carew M.A. Shears S.B. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) illustrate that SMM pretreatment increased the ER Ca2+ stores that can be mobilized following apical BK receptor activation (Fig. 4E). Utilizing a protocol previously shown to effectively buffer Ca2+i signals in airway epithelia (21Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the Ca2+i-mobilizing effect of BK was completely blocked in BAPTA-loaded PBS- or SMM-pretreated cultures (Fig. 4, C and D). We next tested the effect of Ca2+i clamping on BK-dependent IL-8 secretion in epithelia treated with PBS versus SMM for 24 h. Fig. 5 illustrates that BAPTA was ineffective in blocking BK-dependent IL-8 secretion in PBS-treated cultures. In contrast, the “hyperinflammatory” component of BK-dependent IL-8 secretion in SMM-treated cultures was inhibited by BAPTA. These data suggest that BK induces IL-8 secretion by Ca2+i-independent and -dependent mechanisms. We speculate that the absence of an effect of Ca2+i buffering on BK-induced IL-8 secretory responses in PBS-treated cultures reflects the fact that the small BK-induced Ca2+i signals in cells with normal ER Ca2+ stores did not reach the critical threshold necessary to induce the Ca2+i-mediated component of IL-8 secretion (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the larger BK-dependent Ca2+i signals resulting from the up-regulation of ER Ca2+ stores by SMM (Fig. 4B) were sufficient to produce a significant Ca2+i-dependent activation of signal transduction pathway(s) involved in amplified IL-8 secretion. To further investigate the Ca2+i-independent component of BK-induced IL-8 secretion in normal airway epithelia, cultures were pretreated for 24 h with the ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor TG to deplete the ER Ca2+ stores (31Ribeiro C.M.P. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the IL-8 response to BK in cultures whose ER Ca2+ stores were depleted with TG was the same as that seen in PBS-treated cultures. Furthermore, BAPTA had no additional effect on BK-dependent IL-8 secretion in TG-treated cultures (Fig. 5). Collectively, these data suggest that apical BK receptor activation triggers a Ca2+i-independent component of IL-8 secretion in PBS-, SMM-, and TG-pretreated cultures (indexed as BAPTA-insensitive secretion) and a Ca2+i-dependent, BAPTA-sensitive component that requires SMM-dependent up-regulation of ER Ca2+ stores (Figs. 4 and 5).

The Gαs interaction site was mapped to an 83-amino acid region of GIV that is enriched in highly charged amino acids. BLAST searches revealed two additional mammalian family members, Daple and an uncharacterized protein, FLJ00354. These family members share the highest homology at the Gα binding domain, are homologous at the N terminus and central coiled coil domain but diverge at the C terminus. Using affinity-purified IgG made against two different regions of the protein, we localized GIV to COPI, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport vesicles concentrated in the Golgi region in GH3 pituitary cells and COS7 cells. Identification as COPI vesicles was based on colocalization with β-COP, a marker for these vesicles. GIV also codistributes in the Golgi region with endogenous calnuc and the KDEL receptor, which are cis Golgi markers and with Gαi3-yellow fluorescent protein expressed in COS7 cells. By immunoelectron microscopy, GIV colocalizes with β-COP and Gαi3 on vesicles found in close proximity to ER exit sites and to cis Golgi cisternae. In cell fractions prepared from rat liver, GIV is concentrated in a carrier vesicle fraction (CV2) enriched in ER-Golgi transport vesicles. β-COP and several Gα subunits (Gαi1–3, Gαs) are also most enriched in CV2. Our results demonstrate the existence of a novel Gα-interacting protein associated with COPI transport vesicles that may play a role in Gα-mediated effects on vesicle trafficking within the Golgi and/or between the ER and the Golgi.

Because classical receptors and effectors had not been identified at intracellular sites, investigators have attempted to gain understanding of the role of trimeric G proteins on intracellular organelles by identifying and characterizing Gα-interacting proteins. Within the last 5–10 years, a remarkable array of novel Gα-binding proteins have been identified and shown to play various roles in regulating heterotrimeric G protein signaling. These include 1) the RGS proteins (regulators of G protein signaling) (14De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 15Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev.

Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8356-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The discovery and characterization of these proteins has implicated heterotrimeric G proteins in a surprisingly diverse variety of cell processes including assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, growth factor receptor down-regulation, and mitosis. For example, the RGS protein p115RhoGEF serves as a GTPase-activating protein for Gα13 proteins, through its RGS domain, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho, through its DH/PH domain, and links G proteins to Rho signaling (14De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). RGSPX1, which serves as a GTPase-activating protein for Gαs and binds phosphoinositides through its PX domain, delays degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and thus links heterotrimeric G protein signaling to vesicular trafficking (9Zheng B.

LGN and its Drosophila ortholog Pins play an essential role in the assembly and organization of the mitotic spindle (24Yu F. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X. Chia W.

Biol. 2000; 10: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), which is a Gαo-mediated process in Drosophila. In this report, we describe the discovery and molecular characterization of GIV (Gα-interacting vesicle-associated protein), which has a novel Gα-interacting domain and is found on vesicles concentrated in the Golgi region where it colocalizes with β-COP, a marker for COPI, ER-Golgi transport vesicles. Previously, heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in regulation of ER-Golgi transport (3Stow J.L. de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 26Helms J.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms involved are not yet understood. The discovery of a Gα-interacting protein located on these transport vesicles provides a new tool that may provide insights into the role of Gα subunits in vesicular trafficking. The localization and structure of GIV suggest that it may serve to connect COPI transport vesicles to Gα subunits and microtubules. Yeast Two-hybrid Interactions—For yeast two-hybrid screening 50 μg of a rat GC cell (pituitary) cDNA library in pACT2 was transformed into yeast HF7c (pGBT9Gαi3) as described (27De Vries L. Mousli M.

Twenty-four positive clones, grouped by insert size and restriction pattern, were sequenced from the 5′- or 3′-end. Among these were three partial clones for GIV, grossly encoding the C-terminal third of the molecule (aa 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; EST, expressed sequence tag; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); CV, carrier vesicle; ERGIC, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. 1174–1898, see below). For 1 to 1 two-hybrid interactions, rat GIV in pACT2 vector was cotransformed in yeast strain SFY526 (BD Biosciences) with the following G protein subunits subcloned into pGBT9 vector: rat Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, and Gαz, mouse Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq, rat Gαs, and Gαs(Q226L), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPA1. Interactions were analyzed qualitatively by a colony lift assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl d-galactoside, and the appearance of blue colonies was assessed after 2, 4, and 8 h (29De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 657-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). No background color was detected after 20 h. BLAST Searches—Online BLAST searches were performed via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website (30Madden T.L. Tatusov R.L. Zhang J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 131-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homologous human EST clones were purchased from Incyte (Palo Alto, CA). Protein alignments were carried out with the ClustalW program (31Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) InterProScan (EMBL-EBI) for domain and motif searches, PSORTII for protein topology predictions, TMpred for the prediction of transmembrane, and Coils for the prediction of coiled coil domains via the ExPASy proteomics tools server website. Isolation of GIV cDNA—PCR was used to isolate 5.25 kb of GIV cDNA from human Fetal Brain QUICK-Clone cDNA (BD Biosciences) using Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene), encoding the near-complete GIV open reading fame (aa 56–1843). The 5.25-kb insert was sequenced by automated sequencing (Center for AIDS Research, DNA sequencing facility, University of California San Diego (UCSD)). Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple tissue blots of poly(A)+ RNA from rat (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) or human (BD Biosciences) tissues were hybridized to a 976-bp rat cDNA fragment (corresponding to rat GIV aa 1174–1499). The probe was labeled by random priming with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of 109 cpm/μg. ExpressHyb solution (BD Biosciences) was used under high stringency conditions for hybridization (68 °C) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and high stringency washes were performed in 0.1% SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) plus 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiographs were exposed for 1–3 days at –70 °C. Expression and Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase GIV Fusion Proteins—For the production of recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, various deletion mutants of rat GIV (corresponding to aa 1174–1404, 1399–1546, 1399–1481, and 1480–1546) were subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector (Pharmacia Biotechnology, Inc.) and transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21DE3). GST-GIV fusion proteins were affinity-purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Interactions—Wild-type rat Gαi3 cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) (27De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription/translation of Gαi3 from the T7 promoter was performed using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-GIV fusion proteins (6 μg) or GST alone (6 μg) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 15,000 cpm 35S-labeled, in vitro translated Gαi3 in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) as described previously (32Mochizuki N. Hibi M. Kanai Y. Insel P.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated by rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were loaded on 10% SDS gels and exposed for autoradiography.

Rabbit antiserum to α-mannosidase II (Man II) was prepared as described (35Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and polyclonal anti-ERGIC53 was kindly provided by Dr. Hans Peter Hauri (Biocentrum, Basel, Switzerland). Anti-Calnuc IgY (chicken) was prepared by Dr. Ping Lin (UCSD). Preparation of Antibodies against GIV—The central region of rat GIV (CC, aa 1174–1499) containing a portion of the coiled coil domain without the Gα binding domain and the C terminus of human GIV (CT, aa 1574–1843), which has no homologies to other known mammalian proteins, were expressed in bacteria as GST-fusion proteins, and the recombinant proteins were purified and injected into rabbits. For affinity purification, purified recombinant fusion protein was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Antibodies were then bound to the coupled beads and eluted sequentially with 0.1 m glycine, HCl, pH 2.5, and 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 11.5. Both antisera recognized 10 pg of affinity-purified GST-tagged GIV by immunoblotting (1:5000 dilution). By immunoblotting they also recognized endogenous GIV (180–200 kDa) in cell lysates prepared from COS7 and NRK cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7, NRK, HeLa, PC12, Madin-Darby canine kidney, AtT-20, GH3, CHO-K1, Rat1, REF52, NIH3T3, and HEK293 cells were grown as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection. COS7 cells were grown on coverslips and maintained in Dulbecco's high glucose medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). To transiently overexpress pcDNA3/Gαi3-YFP (Weiss et al. (44Weiss T.S. Chamberlain C.E. Takeda T. Lin P. Hahn K.M. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fischer T. Niesman I. Harding T. McQuistan T. Von Zastrow M. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cells and Tissue Lysates—Rat tissues were isolated at 4 °C and homogenized using a POLYTRON MR2100. Cells and rat tissues were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors (Sigma). Immunoblotting—Tissue lysates (20 μg), cell lysates (30 μg), and liver fractions (40 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8–12% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp). After blocking with 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween) for 1 h, the membranes were probed with 0.85 μg/ml affinity-purified, anti-GIV IgG or with other primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 in TBST) (Amersham Biosciences) and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL (Pierce). Subcellular Fractionation—HeLa or COS7 cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin (100 units/ml). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were homogenized by 15 passages through a 27.5-gauge needle, and a postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation for 3 min at 600 × g. Membrane pellets were prepared by centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °Cina Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The resulting pellet (crude membrane fraction) was resuspended in a volume of PBS equal to that of the supernatant. Preparation of Rat Liver Fractions—Fractions were prepared from rat liver by density gradient centrifugation and characterized as described previously (37Saucan L. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Jin M. Saucan L. Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30105-30113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each fraction was determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and 40 μg of protein of each fraction was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy—For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 25 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min), and incubated for 1 h with primary rabbit polyclonal or mouse mAbs followed by an incubation (1 h) with highly cross-absorbed Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit, or Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-chicken F(ab′)2 (Molecular Probes). Cells were mounted in 25% PBS, 75% glycerol with 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine and then examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for epifluorescence, or they were analyzed by deconvolution microscopy with the DeltaVision imaging system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) coupled to a Zeiss S100 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For cross-sectional images of cells, stacks were obtained with a 150-nm step-width to optimize the reconstruction of the center plane image. Deconvolution was done on an SGI work station (Mountain View, CA) using Delta Vision reconstruction software, and images were processed as TIFF files using Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For immunogold labeling at the electron microscope level (39De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1124-1134Google Scholar), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, cryoprotected, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were cut at –100 °C using a Leica Ultracut UCT Microtome with an EMFCS cryoattachment (Leica), placed on glow-discharged nickel grids, stored on 2% gelatin, PBS at 4 °C, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by 5 or 10 nm gold, goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS with in 10% fetal calf serum. Grids were absorption stained with 0.2% neutral uranyl acetate, 0.2% methyl cellulose, and 3.2% polyvinyl alcohol. Identification of GIV—To identify proteins that interact with the heterotrimeric G protein, Gαi3, we screened a rat GC pituitary cell cDNA library as described previously (27De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28Lin P. Le-Niculescu H. Hofmeister R. McCaffery J.M. Jin M. Hennemann H.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 3 of 24 positive, independent clones contained partially overlapping inserts, making up 3.2 kb in sequence, coding for the 724 C-terminal residues (aa 1174–1898) of a novel protein (Fig. 1). A BLAST search of the nucleotide data base with this rat cDNA sequence revealed identity to a hypothetical rat protein of 1898 aa (GenBank™ XP_223709), which we named GIV (Fig. 1). The human ortholog, KIAA1212, has 1843 aa residues (GenBank™ NP_060554), and the mouse ortholog (GenBank™ CAI24878) has 1845 residues. EST data base searches also indicated that there are numerous alternative splice variants of GIV. Rat and human GIV have predicted molecular masses of 220 and 213 kDa, respectively, based upon amino acid sequence, with a theoretical pI of 7.6 and 5.7. GIV Is a Member of a Novel Coiled Coil Family of Proteins— As shown in Fig. 1, human GIV is largely composed of coiled coil regions spanning more than two-thirds of the protein (from aa 240 to 1384, according to Coils, EMBnet-CH, and PSORTII SMART ExPaSy Molecular Biology server for proteomic tools). GIV contains a high frequency of leucine residues that are arranged in periodic repeats at every seventh position, which is the characteristic structure of leucine zipper motifs (InterPro Scan). The leucine zipper motif forms an α-helical conformation that is a coiled coil, which has been shown to facilitate dimerization (40O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 41Rasmussen R. Benvegnu D. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By performing yeast two-hybrid 1 to 1 interactions, we found that GIV can homodimerize within the coiled coil domain (data not shown). BLAST searches with full-length human GIV indicated that there are two additional mammalian family members (Fig. 1): Daple (GenBank™ MP_080957), which is 2009 aa in the mouse, and its human ortholog KIAA1509 (1898 aa), and an uncharacterized human protein FLJ00354 (GenBank™ NP_115627) (1214 aa) deduced from cDNA, which might not be a full-length complete protein, because the sequence is missing the stop codon at the C terminus. The closest member to GIV is Daple, a recently isolated protein that interacts with the PDZ domain of Dvl, a protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway (42Oshita A. Kishida S. Kobayashi H. Michiue T. Asahara T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Daple acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibiting Wnt-3a-dependent accumulation of β-catenin and transcriptional activation of Tcf-4 (42Oshita A. Kishida S. Kobayashi H. Michiue T. Asahara T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Daple possesses 48% identity and 67% similarity overall to GIV, and FLJ00354 shows 36% identity and 58% similarity to GIV. Together, GIV, Daple, and FLJ00354 constitute a three-protein family whose genes are located on human chromosomes 2, 14, and 11, respectively. These three proteins share a conserved N-terminal domain and a central coiled coil domain, whereas they diverge at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The N terminus of members of this family also shows homology (29% identity, 52% similarity) to the N-terminal microtubule-binding domain of the HOOK family, and the coiled coil domain in GIV and Daple shows homology to myosin heavy chain. All three family members also contain several putative peroxisomal targeting signal consensus sequences (PTS2) within the coiled coil domain as predicted by PSORT. GIV also was predicted by PSORT to contain an ATP/GTP consensus binding site within the C-terminal domain. We found one ortholog of this family in Drosophila (NP 647780.1), one in Anopheles gambiae (EAA07494) and one in Caenorhabditis elegans (T27075), with Drosophila having the highest homology to rat GIV. There is no S. cerevisiae ortholog. The Region C-terminal of the Coiled Coil Domain Is Required for Interaction with Gαi3—From sequencing and analysis of the three clones isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen it was evident that GIV interacts with Gαi3 within the 724-aa fragment spanning the C-terminal region of rat GIV (aa 1174–1898) (Figs. 1 and 2A). We further mapped the Gαi3-binding domain by generating a series of deletion mutant GST fusion constructs, GST-GIV(1174–1404), GST-GIV(1399–1546), GST-GIV(1399–1481), and GST-GIV(1480–1546), which we tested in an in vitro binding assay with various mutants of GST-GIV bound to glutathione-agarose beads and in vitro translated Gαi3. We found that Gαi3 bound specifically to GST-GIV(1174–1898), GST-GIV(1399–1546), and GST-GIV(1399–1481) (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 3, and 5) but not to GST alone, GST-GIV(1174–1404), or GST-GIV(1480–1546) (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 4, and 6). Thus, the 83-aa region spanning amino acids 1399–1481 was sufficient to interact with Gαi3 in this in vitro binding assay. A Novel Gαi3 Binding “Motif”—The 83-aa region of human rat GIV that interacts with Gαi3 is highly conserved among species, i.e. C. elegans, A. gambiae, Drosophila, mouse, rat, and human (Fig. 2C). This region consists of highly charged amino acids and is also the region in Daple and FLJ00354 that is most homologous to GIV. Daple is 66% identical and 81% similar to GIV at this Gα binding domain (Fig. 2C). A deletion mutant of Daple containing this region also interacts with Gαi3 in an in vitro binding assay (data not shown). FLJ00354 contains a region that also has homology to the Gα binding domain of GIV (48% identity, 80% similarity) (Fig. 2C), but it does not interact with Gαi3 in the same assay or in a two-hybrid 1 to 1 assay (data not shown). GIV Interacts with the Gαi and Gαs Subfamilies of G Proteins—We used the two-hybrid system to test whether GIV interacts with other G protein α-subunits. Based on the semiquantitative β-galactosidase filter assay (Fig. 3), GIV interacted with all members of the Gαi subfamily (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, and Gαz) as well as wild-type Gαs and GPA1 (yeast homolog of Gαi) but not with Gαq, Gα12, or Gα13. Interestingly, GIV interacts only weakly with GαsQ226L (which mimics the GTP-bound form of Gαs) compared with wild-type Gαs in this assay. These results suggest that GIV specifically interacts with members of the Gαi and Gαs subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins. We tested for the regulatory activity of GIV on Gαi3 subunits by performing classical single turnover GTPase assays, guanine nucleotide exchange factor assays, and guanine dissociation inhibitor assays (both the latter through G"

Reports of proteolytic processing of cell surface receptors to release an intracellular domain (ICD) has raised the possibility of novel signaling mechanisms directly mediated by the receptor ICD. The receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB4/HER4 (referred to here as ERBB4) undergoes sequential processing by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme and presenilin-dependent γ-secretase to release the ERBB4 ICD (4ICD). Our recent data suggests that regulation of gene expression by the ERBB4 nuclear protein and the proapoptotic activity of ERBB4 involves the γ-secretase release of 4ICD. To determine the role γ-secretase processing plays in ERBB4 signaling, we generated an ERBB4 allele with the transmembrane residue substitution V673I (ERBB4-V673I). We demonstrate that ERBB4-V673I fails to undergo processing by γ-secretase but retains normal cell surface signaling activity. In contrast to wild-type ERBB4, however, ERBB4-V673I was excluded from the nuclei of transfected cells and failed to activate STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein promoter. These results support the contention that γ-secretase processing of ERBB4 is necessary to release a functional 4ICD nuclear protein which directly regulates gene expression. We also demonstrate that 4ICD failed to accumulate within mitochondria of ERBB4-V673I transfected cells and the potent proapoptotic activity of ERBB4 was completely abolished in cells expressing ERBB4-V673I. Our results provide the first formal demonstration that proteolytic processing of ERBB4 is a critical event regulating multiple receptor signaling activities.

Activated single transmembrane cell surface receptors typically transmit extracellular signals through the recruitment of membrane and cytosolic signal transduction proteins. These complex cascades of protein:protein interactions and post-translational modifications culminate in the nucleus where the activation of specific target genes regulates diverse cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. Recent biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the presenilin-dependent γ-secretase processing of cell surface receptors contributes to cellular signaling through novel pathways involving an active receptor intracellular domain (ICD) 1The abbreviations used are: ICD, intracellular domain; 4ICD, ERBB4 ICD; APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HRG, heregulin β1; NICD, Notch ICD; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PS1, presenilin 1; STAT5A, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; TPA, tetradecaonylphorbol-13-acetate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

For example, the presenilin-dependent γ-secretase processing of the transmembrane receptor Notch results in release of the Notch ICD (NICD) and subsequent NICD transcription factor activity in the nucleus (3De Strooper B.

The receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB4 also undergoes γ-secretase processing releasing the ERBB4 intracellular domain (4ICD); however, the contribution of this event to ERBB4 signaling remains to be determined. ERBB4 is a member of the ERBB-family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes the epidermal growth factor receptor, ERBB2/HER2/Neu, and ERBB3. This receptor family controls several cell fate decisions during multiple stages of embryonic and postnatal development (6Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). ERBB4 activation has been associated with diverse cellular responses including proliferation (7Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Campiglio M. Issing W. Ullrich A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cell migration (8Kainulainen V. Sundvall M. Maatta J.A. Santiestevan E. Klagsbrun M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The biochemical details of ERBB4 proteolytic processing resulting in ERBB4 ectodomain shedding and nuclear accumulation of 4ICD have been elucidated. Activated ERBB4 is first cleaved within the juxtamembrane region through the activity of tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) (12Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10379-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This cleavage event results in shedding of the 120-kDa ERBB4 ectodomain and membrane association of the m80 ERBB4 transmembrane region and endodomain. Subsequent cleavage of TACE processed ERBB4 by γ-secretase releases 4ICD from cellular membranes. ERBB4 proteolytic processing results in nuclear accumulation of ERBB4 (13Lee H.J. Jung K.M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and our recent biochemical data indicates that 4ICD is the predominant form of nuclear ERBB4 (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Similar to Notch, proteolytic processing of ERBB4 may contribute to novel ERBB4 signaling properties. For example, ERBB4 is essential for lactation initiation and milk-gene expression in the mouse mammary gland at parturition (9Long W. Wagner K.-U. Lloyd K. C.K. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A. Mathers K. Stern D.F. Gassmann M. Golding J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Moreover, ERBB4 regulates milk-gene expression through the direct association of nuclear 4ICD with a transcription complex at the endogenous β-casein promoter, which includes the signal transducer and activator of transcription family member STAT5A (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Indeed, nuclear accumulation of 4ICD is necessary for STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein promoter suggesting that 4ICD regulates gene expression by functioning as a nuclear chaperone for STAT5A (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that ERBB4 induces cell-killing of malignant human breast cell lines. We further demonstrate that 4ICD accumulation within mitochondria correlates with apoptosis. Taken together these results support the hypothesis that multiple ERBB4 activities are regulated by proteolytic processing and subsequent membrane release of 4ICD; however, the functional significance of ERBB4 proteolytic processing remains to be confirmed. Here we demonstrate that an ERBB4 allele lacking a transmembrane γ-secretase cleavage site retains canonical cell surface receptor signaling activity but fails to regulate gene expression and lacks cell-killing activity. ERBB4 cDNA—The human ERBB4 cDNA used in these experiments has been sequenced in its entirety (17Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc.

This isoform retains both TACE and γ-secretase recognition sequences and is therefore an ERBB4 isoform that undergoes complete proteolytic processing at the cell surface following ligand stimulation.

Cell Lines and Transfections—The COS-7 cell line was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Because of the cell-killing activity of ERBB4 we performed all functional assays in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line MCF-7B, which was modified to stably overexpress BCL-2 (20Burow M.E.

MCF-7B cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm Na-pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Transfections were performed on 2 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes or 1.0 × 106 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes with 2 and 5 μg of each transfected DNA, respectively, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer. In each experiment transfected cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Preparation of Membrane and Cytosolic Cellular Fractions—Membrane and cytosolic fractions were isolated from COS-7 cells transfected with vector control, ERBB4-Flag, or ERBB4-V673I-Flag and treated at 2 days post-transfection with 100 ng/ml of tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C using a modification (15Williams C.C.

Cytosolic and membrane fractions were subjected to ERBB4 immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Fractionated cell lysates or total cell lysates were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Hybond ECL (Amersham Biosciences) membrane, and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (10Jones F.E. Welte T. Fu X.-Y. Stern D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-ERBB4 (Santa Cruz), anti-STAT5A (Santa Cruz), anti-P-STAT5 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-phospho-Akt (S473) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-α-tubulin (Upstate) and anti-phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz). Deconvolution Microscopy—Transfected MCF-7B cells cultured on coverslips in a 35-mm tissue culture dish were mock-stimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml of heregulin β1 (referred to here as HRG) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. In some experiments cells were pretreated with the γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E at 10 nm overnight in growth media with 2% fetal bovine serum. Following appropriate treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, briefly washed in phosphate-buffered saline, counterstained in 500 mm DAPI (Molecular Probes), and coverslipped with Prolong Antifade Media (Molecular Probes). The slides were analyzed on a Leica DMRXA automated upright epifluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) equipped with a 63× (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective and a Sensicam QE CCD digital camera, and quantitation of intranuclear enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was performed exactly as described elsewhere (15Williams C.C.

Luciferase Assay—Transfections were performed on MCF-7B cells as described above with combinations of ERBB4 and STAT5A expression plasmids and a β-casein promoter luciferase reporter plasmid (15Williams C.C.

Cell lysates were prepared in 500 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and the luciferase assay was performed on 30 μl of lysate using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a Berthold AutoLumat Plus luminometer. Each sample was performed in duplicate, and the data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences between data sets were determined using the paired Student's t test. Apoptosis Assay—The COS-7 cell line was transfected in 6-well tissue culture plates with the indicated cDNA fused to EGFP using Fu-GENE 6, and apoptosis was analyzed at 2 days post-transfection. Apoptosis was determined visually by examining cells using an inverted Leica DMIRB fluorescent microscope and calculating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells displaying morphological signs of apoptosis. The percentage of apoptotic cells induced by each treatment minus the percentage of apoptotic cells observed in the EGFP vector control was reported. When indicated, ERBB4-transfected cells were treated with 10 nm Compound E overnight in growth medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. All samples were prepared in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Significant differences between data sets were determined using the paired Student's t test. Isolation of Subcellular Fractions—The SKBr3 breast cancer cell line was transfected with pEGFP vector control, ERBB4-EGFP, or ERBB4-V673I-EGFP, and at 40 h post-transfection subcellular fractions including cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum/endosomal, and mitochondrial were isolated exactly as described previously. 2W.

Although γ-secretase cleaves APP with a relatively relaxed specificity (26Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) a single base substitution within the mouse Notch1 transmembrane abolished γ-secretase processing and Notch1 function in vivo (27Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether γ-secretase cleavage of ERBB4 has an impact on ERBB4 function we incorporated the base substitution V673I within the ERBB4 transmembrane, which is positioned similar to both the inactivating base substitution described for Notch1 (28Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) and a valine critical for γ-secretase processing of APP (26Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H.

A Point Mutation (V673I) within the ERBB4 Transmembrane Abolishes γ-Secretase Processing—We used Western blot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions from transiently transfected COS-7 cells to confirm that the ERBB4-V673I base substitution abolished ERBB4 γ-secretase processing and subsequent cytosolic accumulation of 4ICD. In the absence of TPA, Western blot analysis of ERBB4 immunoprecipitates revealed the membrane-associated 180-kDa holoreceptor and the TACE-processed ERBB4 m80 fragment (Fig. 2, lane 2). Detection of the m80 fragment in ERBB4-V673I immunoprecipitates indicates that the V673I mutation does not impact TACE processing or ERBB4 ectodomain shedding (Fig. 2, lane 3). The treatment of ERBB4-transfected cells with TPA stimulates γ-secretase processing of ERBB4 and subsequent accumulation of cytosolic 4ICD (14Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 11). In contrast, TPA treatment of ERBB4-V673I-transfected cells failed to liberate 4ICD from cellular membranes, confirming that this base substitution abolishes γ-secretase processing of the ERBB4 m80 fragment (Fig. 2, lane 12). ERBB4-V673I Retains Normal Signaling Activity—Growth factor stimulation of the wild-type ERBB4 receptor results in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including co-transfected STAT5A (10Jones F.E. Welte T. Fu X.-Y. Stern D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), MAPK (Erk1/2), and PI3K/Akt (8Kainulainen V. Sundvall M. Maatta J.A. Santiestevan E. Klagsbrun M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8641-8649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine the impact of the transmembrane mutation in ERBB4-V673I on ERBB4 signaling activity we examined HRG-stimulated activation of ERBB4-V673I and activation of the downstream signaling pathways STAT5A (see Fig. 5), Akt, and Erk1/2. Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells indicated similar levels of ERBB4 and ERBB4-V673I tyrosine phosphorylation in response to HRG (Fig. 3, IP: ERBB4 and IB: P-Tyr). Likewise, despite lower levels of ERBB4-V673I expression, HRG treatment of cells expressing ERBB4-V673I or ERBB4-activated equivalent levels of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). In another experiment, ERBB4-V673I regulated phosphorylation of coexpressed STAT5A at the regulatory Tyr-694 (Fig. 5A). Taken together these results indicate that the residue substitution in ERBB4-V673I does not impact signal transduction mediated by the ERBB4 holoreceptor. γ-Secretase Processing Is Required for ERBB4 Nuclear Translocation—We have previously demonstrated that ERBB4 nuclear translocation is mediated by a NLS harbored within 4ICD (residues 676–684) and positioned immediately downstream of the potential γ-secretase cleavage site (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Other investigators have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibitors of γ-secretase abolished ERBB4 nuclear localization (14Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), presumably because 4ICD was tethered at cellular membranes. Here we have shown that ERBB4-V673I fails to generate a cytosolic 4ICD fragment (Fig. 2). We therefore reasoned that a mutation of the γ-secretase cleavage site within ERBB4 would abolish ERBB4 nuclear translocation. In this experiment, we used deconvolution microscopy to visualize nuclear accumulation of ERBB4 proteins fused at the carboxyl terminus with EGFP. Consistent with our recent observations (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), wild-type ERBB4 expressed on the cell surface of transiently transfected MCF-7B cells (Fig. 4A, arrowhead), was translocated to the perinuclear region (Fig. 4B, arrow) and nucleus (Fig. 4, B N, and E) following HRG stimulation. Similar to other reports, HRG stimulation of ERBB4 in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor, Compound E, prevented nuclear translocation of ERBB4 (14Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 30Lai C. Feng L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and resulted in the retention of ERBB4 at the cell membrane (Fig. 4C, arrowhead) and also within perinuclear structures resembling late endosomes (Fig. 4C, arrow). ERBB4-V673I was also observed at the cell surface following HRG stimulation (Fig. 4D, arrowhead). Significantly, HRG-stimulated ERBB4-V673I was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4, D and E) and accumulated within perinuclear endosome-like structures (Fig. 4D, arrow) identical to those observed in Compound E-treated cells transfected with wild-type ERBB4 (Fig. 4C, arrow). Taken together these results strongly imply that the mutant ERBB4-V673I fails to undergo γ-secretase processing at the cell membrane thereby preventing nuclear translocation of 4ICD. ERBB4-V673I Activates STAT5A but Fails to Stimulate β-Casein Promoter Activity—We have previously demonstrated that ERBB4 activates STAT5A (10Jones F.E. Welte T. Fu X.-Y. Stern D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and in the developing breast the ERBB4/STAT5A signaling pathway is essential for expression of critical milk genes during lactation (9Long W. Wagner K.-U. Lloyd K. C.K. Binart N. Shillingford J.M. Hennighausen L. Jones F.E. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Tidcombe H. Jackson-Fisher A.

Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 555-559PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERBB4 regulates STAT5A transcriptional activation of the β-casein promoter by functioning as a STAT5A nuclear chaperone (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We therefore predict that ERBB4-V673I, which remains tethered to cellular membranes, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation of 4ICD, would lack the ability to induce STAT5A stimulation of a bovine β-casein promoter fused to luciferase. Co-transfection of STAT5A with ERBB4 or ERBB4-V673I resulted in significant levels of STAT5A phosphorylation at the regulatory Tyr-694 (Fig. 5A). In concordance with our previous observations (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), co-transfection of STAT5A and ERBB4 resulted in significant stimulation of the β-casein promoter leading to luciferase expression (Fig. 5B). In contrast, ERBB4-V673I failed to induce STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein promoter (Fig. 5B). The inability of ERBB4-V673I to cooperate with STAT5A and stimulate gene expression provides additional evidence that γ-secretase processing of ERBB4 is required for nuclear translocation of the functionally active 4ICD. Furthermore, these results corroborate our recent observations demonstrating that 4ICD nuclear localization is necessary to induce STAT5A stimulation of gene expression (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cytosolic/Mitochondrial 4ICD Is Necessary and Sufficient for ERBB4 Apoptotic Activity—We have demonstrated that ERBB4 induces apoptosis of malignant cell lines. Here we have determined the apoptotic activity of ERBB4-V673I fused to EGFP in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Consistent with our unpublished observations,2 ectopic ERBB4 and 4ICD induced significant levels of COS-7 cell killing (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, ERBB4 lacking an intact NLS (ERBB4muNLS) harbored apoptotic activity equivalent to wild-type ERBB4 (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that nuclear translocation of 4ICD is dispensable for 4ICD apoptotic activity. The treatment of ERBB4-transfected cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor, Compound E, dramatically reduced ERBB4 cell-killing activity (Fig. 6B). Moreover, apoptosis was essentially abolished in cells transfected with ERBB4-V673I, clearly demonstrating that proteolytic processing of ERBB4 by γ-secretase is necessary for ERBB4 apoptotic activity. (Fig. 6B). Ectopic overexpression of ERBB4 and ERBB4-V673I results in the generation of the membrane-bound TACE catalyzed ERBB4 cleavage product, m80. The m80 ERBB4 product, however, lacks apoptotic activity as demonstrated by the lack of cell killing induced by ERBB4 in the presence of Compound E or ERBB4-V673I. Equivalent levels of ERBB4 and ERBB4-V673I expression (Fig. 6A) indicates that cell-killing activity of ERBB4 is regulated by proteolytic processing. Interestingly, the apoptotic activity of 4ICD was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than the ERBB4 holoreceptor suggesting that proteolytic processing of ERBB4 to release 4ICD represents the limiting step during ERBB4-induced cell killing. Our unpublished results indicate that mitochondrial accumulation of 4ICD regulates ERBB4 cell-killing activity.2 We therefore performed an experiment to determine whether the mutation in ERBB4-V673I prevents mitochondrial accumulation of 4ICD. Cell fractionation of ERBB4 transfected SKBr3 breast cancer cells indicates 4ICD accumulation within endosomal/endoplasmic reticulum (E) and mitochondrial (M) fractions (Fig. 6C). Although ERBB4-V673I and m80 were detected within the endosomal/endoplasmic reticulum fractions of ERBB4-V673I-transfected cells, we failed to detect mitochondrial accumulation of 4ICD (Fig. 6C). These results support the contention that mitochondrial accumulation of 4ICD is essential for ERBB4 apoptotic activity and provides a mechanistic explanation for the lack of ERBB4-V673I cell-killing activity. Taken together, these data indicate that membrane-associated ERBB4 fails to activate apoptosis, and cytosolic/mitochondrial accumulation of 4ICD is both necessary and sufficient for ERBB4 cell-killing activity. A canonical transmembrane signal transduction pathway involves ligand stimulation of a cell surface receptor followed by recruitment and activation of downstream signaling molecules. A cascade of protein:protein interactions or phosphorylation events or both culminate in the cell nucleus where modulated gene expression elicits specific cellular responses. The transmembrane receptor ERBB4 undergoes proteolytic processing at the cell membrane to release the 4ICD through the sequential activities of TACE (12Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J.

Although the treatment of cells with pharmacological inhibitors of γ-secretase results in membrane retention of 4ICD (13Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4561-4565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the functional consequence of disrupted ERBB4 proteolytic processing remains to be established. We have employed a genetic approach to investigate the contribution of ERBB4 γ-secretase processing to recently described ERBB4-signaling activities including activation of gene expression and induction of apoptosis. A valine residue within the Notch1 transmembrane was shown to be essential for γ-secretase processing of this receptor (27Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We predicted that a similarly positioned ERBB4 transmembrane base substitution (V673I) would abolish γ-secretase processing of ERBB4. Several lines of experimental evidence confirmed that the mutant receptor, ERBB4-V673I, was no longer a substrate for γ-secretase processing. For example, the introduction of the V673I mutation into full-length ERBB4 completely abolished TPA-induced accumulation of 4ICD in cytosolic cell fractions and prevented mitochondrial accumulation of 4ICD in cells ectopically expressing ERBB4-V673I. Furthermore, we show that ERBB4-V673I failed to translocate to the nucleus and accumulated within cytosolic endosome-like structures. Similar endosomal ERBB4 accumulations were observed in cells transfected with wild-type ERBB4 and treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E. Using the ERBB4-V673I mutant, we investigated the impact of impaired ERBB4 proteolytic processing on the ERBB4 regulation of gene expression. We have recently identified the in vivo contribution of ERBB4 signaling to STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein and whey acidic protein genes during lactation (9Long W. Wagner K.-U. Lloyd K. C.K.

Interestingly, ERBB4 functions as a STAT5A nuclear chaperone and ERBB4-induced STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein promoter required an intact ERBB4 NLS harbored within 4ICD (15Williams C.C.

These results implied that ERBB4 processing and subsequent nuclear translocation of 4ICD was necessary for ERBB4/STAT5A activation of the β-casein promoter. In support of this contention, co-expression of ERBB4-V673I and STAT5A resulted in phosphorylation of STAT5A at the regulatory Tyr-694, but ERBB4-V673I failed to induce STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein promoter. Taken together our results support a model of ERBB4/STAT5A stimulation of gene expression where γ-secretase processing of ERBB4 at the cell surface is a critical event regulating the release and subsequent nuclear translocation of 4ICD (Fig. 7). Interestingly, ERBB4 and Notch1 appear to employ similar molecular mechanisms while regulating gene expression. Modulation of transcriptional activation by ERBB4 and Notch1 first requires receptor ectodomain cleavage followed by transmembrane cleavage of the processed receptor by γ-secretase, nuclear translocation of 4ICD and the NICD, respectively, and association with a DNA-binding protein at the target gene promoter. STAT5A appears to provide the DNA binding activity for 4ICD association with the β-casein promoter (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), whereas Notch1 interacts with members of the CSL (CBF1, SuH, Lag-1) family of DNA-binding proteins (28Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 33Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A.

In addition to a role in gene regulation, ERBB4 functions as a proapoptotic protein, inducing cell death of breast cancer cells.2 Interestingly, independent expression of 4ICD was sufficient to mediate ERBB4 cell-killing activities with malignant cell specificity.2 Here we have shown that γ-secretase processing of ERBB4, generating cytosolic 4ICD, is not only sufficient but also necessary to mediate ERBB4 apoptotic activity. Indeed, the unprocessed ERBB4 receptor, ERBB4-V673I, failed to accumulate 4ICD within mitochondria and completely lacked cell-killing activity. In addition, an ERBB4 receptor that undergoes γ-secretase processing but lacks an intact NLS, positioned within 4ICD (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), induces apoptosis at levels equivalent to wild-type ERBB4, indicating that nuclear translocation of 4ICD is dispensable for 4ICD apoptotic activity. Taken together these results support a model of ERBB4-induced apoptosis where TACE and γ-secretase processing of activated ERBB4 at the cell surface is necessary to release the proapoptotic BH3-only protein 4ICD (Fig. 7). An active ERBB4 intrinsic tyrosine kinase is required for both ERBB4 nuclear localization with subsequent regulation of gene expression and ERBB4-induced apoptosis. Kinase activity is dispensable, however, for nuclear translocation and the cell-killing activity of independently expressed 4ICD (15Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).2 Although we have shown that ERBB4-V673I activates downstream signal transduction pathways, this mutant receptor failed to induce apoptosis or regulate STAT5A stimulation of the β-casein promoter. These results imply that canonical signaling pathways regulated by the holoreceptor are dispensable for these ERBB4 activities. Moreover, our results imply that the intrinsic kinase activity of ERBB4 contributes to 4ICD signaling, in part, by regulating proteolytic processing of ERBB4. Indeed, an interaction between 4ICD and presenilin 1, which harbors γ-secretase activity, has been reported (32Ni C.Y. Yuan H. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4561-4565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Likewise, presenilin 1 directly interacts with the substrates Notch1 (36Ray W.J. Yao M. Nowotny P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Notch1 actively recruits presenilin 1 to the cell surface establishing the proteolytic complex (4Ray W.J. Yao M. Mumm J. Schroeter E.H. Saftig P. Wolfe M. Selkoe D.J. Kopan R. Goate A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36801-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the ability of activated ERBB4 to promote the formation of stable proteolytic complexes containing presenilin 1 and the ERBB4 substrate. Alternatively, ERBB4 kinase activity may stimulate signaling cascades that regulate proteolytic processing at the cell surface. For example, enhanced TACE activity is associated with cellular growth stimulation and intracellular kinase activity (11Black R.A. Doedens J.R. Mahimkar R. Johnson R. Guo L. Wallace A. Virca D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In summary, we have generated the ERBB4 allele, ERBB4-V673I, with a mutated γ-secretase cleavage site that effectively abolishes two ERBB4 functional activities, 4ICD nuclear translocation with subsequent regulation of gene expression and the independent proapoptotic activity of 4ICD. Interestingly, ERBB4-V673I retains canonical signal transduction activities; however, signal transduction through the holoreceptor appears to be dispensable for both ERBB4 regulation of gene expression and ERBB4-induced apoptosis. Our results represent the first demonstration of a physiological function for ERBB4 proteolytic cleavage and underscore the essential contributions of transmembrane receptor proteolytic processing to novel signal transduction mechanisms.

By comparing the angular rotation rate with the inclination and rotation speed, we obtained a distance of 730 ± 168 kiloparsecs. This distance is consistent with the most recent Cepheid distance measurement. M33 is moving with a velocity of 190 ± 59 kilometers per second relative to the Milky Way.

https://openalex.org/W2043766237,"Several recent works have shown that a brief ischemia applied during the onset of reperfusion (postconditioning) is cardioprotective in different animal models and that the early minutes of reperfusion are critical to its cardioprotection. This effect has been related to prevention of oxidative stress, but mechanisms have not been clearly demonstrated. The present study tested the hypothesis that mitochondria play a central role in peroxide production and oxidative stress during reperfusion and are responsible for the protective effect of postconditioning. Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to complete global ischemia for 45 min and reperfused for 40 min. Normoxic group was reperfused with a Krebs-Henseleit solution with the preischemic pO2 level (600 mmHg); in the ""hypoxic group,"" normoxic reperfusion was preceded by 3 min with 150 mmHg pO2. Reperfusion was stopped at 3 and 40 min. The rate of hydroperoxide production, GSH, GSSG, and carbonyl protein levels were measured in mitochondria at 3 min and at the end of reperfusion. GSH and GSSG were also measured in tissue. Hemodinamic function was monitored during the experiment. LVEDp increased and LVDp decreased in the normoxic group but not in the hypoxic group. The rate of mitochondrial peroxide production was higher in normoxic than in the hypoxic group 3 min after reperfusion and at its conclusion. Accordingly, GSH was oxidized in normoxic but not in hypoxic hearts. Mitochondria carbonyl proteins were significantly higher in normoxic than in the hypoxic group at the end of reperfusion. In this model, 1) hypoxic reperfusion at the onset of reperfusion reduces myocardial injury; 2) the major rate of mitochondrial peroxide production is 3 min after the onset of reperfusion; 3) cardioprotection of postconditioning correlates with reduced mitochondria peroxide production and prevention of GSH oxidation."

Muscle development is regulated through the coordinated expression of myogenic regulatory factors that include MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and Mrf4, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of the p21WAF1/CIP1 family (34Kablar B. Rudnicki M.A. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 649-656PubMed Google Scholar, 35Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). MyoD and Myf5 direct primary myocyte differentiation, myogenin directs secondary differentiation, and p21WAF1/CIP1 expression promotes cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation. In differentiating myoblasts and regenerating adult muscle, up-regulation of MyoD, myogenin, and p21WAF1/CIP1 expression occurs concurrently through transcriptional mechanisms and post-transcriptional mRNA stabilization by specific RNA-binding proteins (35Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Figueroa A. Cuadrado A. Fan J. Atasoy U. Muscat G.E. Munoz-Canoves P. Gorospe M. Munoz A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4991-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that MyoD, myogenin, and p21WAF1/CIP1 are novel target genes essentially regulated by NF90. Our results led us to propose that the phenotype of muscle weakness and increased apoptosis in NF90(–/–) mice is explained by defects in skeletal myocyte differentiation arising from insufficient expression of myogenic regulatory factors. Genomic Cloning and Targeting Vector Generation—The murine genomic NF90/ILF3 was isolated from a 129SvJ library using the human NF90 cDNA probe (performed at Incyte Genomics). The nucleotide sequence and intron-exon structure of the 29,085-bp gene was determined and deposited in GenBank™ (AF506968). A targeting vector was designed for constitutive disruption of NF90 exons 2–4 (Fig. 1A). The 5′ targeting arm was a 6.75-kb BamH1 restriction fragment digested from a genomic NF90 subclone, and the 3′ targeting arm was 2.8 kb generated with PCR primers that introduced flanking EcoR1 restriction sites (sense primer b3: 5′-GGAGTGGGTCTTCCTGGCCAGTTGCG-3′ and antisense primer c3: 5′-GGCGAATTCTCTGCCAGCTATCAAGGA-3′). These targeting arms were cloned into pKO Scrambler NKTV-1903 targeting vector, which contains a positive selection neomycin resistance gene and a herpes thymidine kinase negative selection gene (Stratagene). Embryonic stem cells (R1) were transfected by electroporation and selected for resistance to G418 and ganciclovir. Genotype Analysis by Southern Hybridization and PCR—Genomic DNA was isolated from ES cells or tail biopsy specimens, digested with HindIII (3′ analysis) or EcoR1 (5′ analysis), separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Southern hybridization of the specific wild-type and targeted genomic fragments was performed using randomly primed 32P-labeled probes outside the targeting arms (Fig. 1A), or an internal probe that hybridized to the neomycin gene, according to standard methods. Genotyping was also performed by PCR across the 3′ targeting arm, using LA Taq™ (Takara Bio) with locus primers, b3-, 5′-GGAGTGGGTCTTCCTGGCCAGTTGCGGTGG-3′ & C4-*, 5-GGTCCAGCGTCCCTGACTGGATAAGCTAAGAGGGC-3′, or target primers, Neo-1179, 5′-TATCAGGACATAGCGTTGGCTACCCGTGATATT-3′ & C4-*. PCR amplification was conducted according to the manufacturer's directions consisting of an initial incubation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 3 min. Expression Analysis by Northern and Western Hybridizations—Total RNA was extracted from newborn mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 20 μg was fractionated in a 1% denaturing agarose gel, then transferred to nitrocellulose. Northern hybridization was performed using a randomly primed 32P-labeled probe for NF90. Extracted total proteins (20 μg) from newborn mice were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (8% separating gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antisera (1:1000 dilution) generated against recombinant NF90 protein (5Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000 dilution), and detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting analysis of wild-type murine tissue extracts was performed using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes NF90 (anti-DRBP76, Transduction Laboratories 612154), followed by a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC-2031). Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and in Situ TUNEL Analysis— Whole embryos or newborn mice with skin removed were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin followed by paraffin-embedding and tissue-sectioning at 4-μm thickness. Staining with hematoxylin and eosin was performed according to standard procedures. For immunodetection of NF90, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, then boiled for 20 min in 10 mm citric acid in a microwave oven. Blocking of nonspecific mouse antigens was performed by incubation with 3% H2O2 for 5 min followed by incubation with the Vector M.O.M. immunodetection kit (Vectorlabs) for 1 h. Anti-DRBP76 monoclonal antibody specific for NF90/ILF3/DRBP76 (Transduction Laboratories) was incubated at 1:100 dilution for 35 min at room temperature. The signal was amplified by using VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Reagent (Vector Laboratories) and visualized by a horseradish peroxidase reaction using stable diaminobenzidine (Invitrogen). In situ apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL (TACS 2 TdT, Trevigen). Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reactions—RT-PCR analysis was performed to detect mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors and cell cycle control protein p21WAF1/CIP1. Total RNA from skeletal muscles of newborn mice (2–5 μg) was used as template for first strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's directions. PCR amplifications were subsequently performed using 20% of the first strand cDNA mixture, and specific primers for p21WAF1/CIP1 (NM_007669) 511 + 5′-GGCAGACCAGCATGACAGATTTC (with one mismatched base from human p21WAF1/CIP1 underlined) and 883- 5′-CCCTCCCAACCCAAGCTCTG (372 bp), myogenin (BC048683) 5′-GAGCGCGATCTCCGCTACAGAGG and 5′-CTGGCTTGTGGCAGCCCAGG (380bp), and MyoD (N-M_010866) 5′-AGGCTCTGCTGCGCGACC and 5′-TGCAGTCGATCTCTCAAAGCACC (489 bp). Control amplification of murine β-actin mRNA was performed using primers 5′-AGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA and 5′-CTAGAAGCACTTGCGGTGCACGATGGAAGGG (671 bp). The PCR cycling conditions were 24 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C. Northwestern Blotting—Partial cDNAs of murine MyoD, myogenin, and p21WAF1/CIP1 were amplified by RT-PCR from skeletal muscle RNA. Nested amplifications were performed with a forward primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase recognition sequence, T7, CCAAGCTTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA. Primers to generate DNA templates for T7-directed in vitro transcription of the 3′-UTRs were: MyoD forward (T7–1241+), 5′ T7-GACACTCTTCCCAACTGTCC and MyoD reverse (1762-), 5′-GCACTACACAGCATGCCT (36Figueroa A.

Radiolabeled RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase, in the presence of 32P-labeled UTP (36Figueroa A. Cuadrado A. Fan J. Atasoy U. Muscat G.E. Munoz-Canoves P.

Murine tissue extracts (testis, brain, skeletal muscle, 80 μg each) or recombinant NF90 and NF45 proteins (5Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol.

The proteins were renatured by incubating the membranes overnight at room temperature in Northwestern buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Tween 20, containing salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml). The membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled RNA probes (2–4 × 107 cpm) for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of yeast tRNA (50 μg/ml) (29Larcher J.C. Gasmi L. Viranaicken W. Edde B.

Commun. 1993; 191: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), washed twice for 5 min at room temperature and once at 45 °C for 2 h, followed by autoradiography. Generation of Mice with Targeted Disruption of NF90 Gene— The targeting strategy for NF90 was to disrupt exons 2–4, eliminating the ATG translation initiation codon and introducing a translational frameshift that disrupts the open reading frame (Fig. 1A). The targeting vector was introduced into R1 embryonic stem cells by electroporation and transfected ES cells were subjected to positive and negative selection. 12 of 110 G418/gancyclovir-resistant ES cell clones showed appropriate gene targeting. The targeted allele shows a Southern hybridization signal at 9 kb, in addition to the wild-type allele with a hybridization signal of 7.4 kb (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Targeted ES cell clones were further analyzed for correct integration using an internal probe for the neomycin resistance gene (data not shown). Three independently derived ES cell lines were injected into blastocyts (C57BL/6), and chimeric mice were derived. Two separate NF90-targeted ES cell lines transmitted through the germline. In mice examined through 18 months of age, NF90(+/–) heterozygote mice demonstrate no abnormal phenotypes. Gross Phenotype of NF90(–/–) Mice—Following heterozygous intercrossing, homozygote NF90(–/–) mice were present in utero at the Mendelian frequency (Table I and Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 8). At the time of delivery, all NF90(–/–) mice were smaller and weighed 35% less than their littermates (Table I and Fig. 1D). Approximately half of the NF90(–/–) mice died immediately after birth. The surviving NF90(–/–) mice appeared weak and showed almost no spontaneous movements. When lifted by their tails, they emitted a very weak cry compared with their littermates. Over the course of several hours, the NF90(–/–) mice became increasingly cyanotic compared with their littermates, and oxygen saturation was noted to be 65% in a cyanotic NF90(–/–) mouse, compared with 85–98% in littermates (Fig. 1D). Video analysis of breathing revealed that NF90(–/–) mice displayed more rapid and shallow tidal breathing, with no sighs, compared with their heterozygote and wild-type littermates. The NF90(–/–) mice never suckled for milk, and were ignored by their mothers. In over 400 live births, no homozygote NF90(–/–) mice animals survived beyond 12 h after delivery. Thus, the NF90 gene is essential for perinatal survival.Table IGenotype analysis of progeny from NF90+/- heterozygous intercrossesAgeNF90(+/+)NF90(+/-)NF90(-/-)NumberWeightNumberWeightNumberWeight%%%<2 h32 (25)1.42 ± 0.2465 (50.8)1.39 ± 0.2531 (24.2)0.94 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab Gene Expression Analysis in NF90(–/–) Mice—We analyzed the expression of NF90 mRNA and protein in Day 1 NF90 homozygote, heterozygote, and wild-type littermates. The Northern blot analysis shows that wild-type mice express a single NF90 mRNA migrating at 3.4 kb (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 4, and 5), and heterozygote mice express two isoforms of NF90 mRNA, migrating at 3.4 and 3.1 kb (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). These mRNA sizes are consistent with transcription of both wild-type and targeted NF90 alleles. The NF90(–/–) mice demonstrate expression of a single isoform of NF90 mRNA migrating at 3.1 kb (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7), and this size is consistent with transcription just of targeted alleles, which lack exons 2–4. The prominent intensity of the truncated 3.1-kb targeted NF90 mRNA in NF90(–/–) mice indicates that the endogenous NF90 promoter is functional following deletion of exons 2–4. Furthermore, the increase in intensity of the 3.1-kb truncated form of NF90 mRNA compared with the 3.4-kb wild-type form (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7 versus 2, 4, and 5) suggests that the null phenotype (absent NF90 protein, Fig. 2B) is associated with increased transcription of the NF90 gene. Because the targeting strategy introduced a translational frameshift downstream of exon 4, there was no NF90 protein synthesized in NF90(–/–) mice (see below and Fig. 2B). Our prior studies demonstrated that transgenic expression of histidine-tagged NF90 protein potently suppressed the expression of endogenous NF90 protein (5Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the absence of NF90 protein in NF90(–/–) mice is associated with increased mRNA expression of the 3.1-kb targeted NF90 allele, through transcriptional or post-transcriptional up-regulation. We analyzed protein expression of NF90 in extracts prepared from newborn wild-type, heterozygote, and homozygote NF90 mice by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). In NF90 wild-type and heterozygote mice we observed a prominent immunoreactive band at 90 kDa, and a fainter band at 110 kDa, similar to the principal size observed in human Jurkat T-cell nuclear extracts (5Kao P.N. Chen L. Brock G. Ng J. Kenny J. Smith A.J. Corthesy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20691-20699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–5). The level of NF90 protein expression in heterozygote NF90 mice was slightly decreased from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 3 versus 2, 4, 6). The NF90(–/–) mice showed complete absence of the 90- and 110-kDa bands (Fig. 2B, lanes 6, 7 versus 1–5), demonstrating that the translational frameshift in the knock-out phenotype was associated with complete absence of NF90 and NF110 protein expression.

We recently identified a novel ubiquitin ligase, KPC (Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex), consisting of KPC1 and KPC2, which regulates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p27 at G1 phase. We have now investigated the structural requirements for the interactions of KPC1 with KPC2 and p27. The NH2-terminal region of KPC1 was found to be responsible for binding to KPC2 and to p27. KPC1 mutants that lack this region failed to mediate polyubiquitylation of p27 in vitro and expression of one such mutant delayed p27 degradation in vivo. We also generated a series of deletion mutants of p27 and found that KPC failed to polyubiquitylate a p27 mutant that lacks the CDK inhibitory domain. Interestingly, the cyclin E·CDK2 complex prevented both the interaction of KPC with p27 as well as KPC-mediated polyubiquitylation of p27. A complex of cyclin E with a kinase-negative mutant of CDK2 also exhibited these inhibitory effects, suggesting that cyclin E·CDK2 competes with KPC1 for access to the CDK inhibitory domain of p27. These results suggest that free p27 is recognized by the NH2-terminal region of KPC1, which also associates with KPC2, and that p27 is then polyubiquitylated by the COOH-terminal RING-finger domain of KPC1.

The association of CDK inhibitors with cyclin-CDK complexes is triggered by a variety of antimitogenic signals and results in inhibition of the catalytic activity of these complexes and consequent restraint of cell cycle progression (1Morgan D.O.

Degradation of p27 is triggered by its phosphorylation on Thr187 by the cyclin E·CDK2 complex (11Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

The phosphorylation of Thr187 is required for the binding of p27 to Skp2, the F-box protein component of an SCF ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex, and such binding in turn results in the polyubiquitylation and degradation of p27 (13Carrano A.C.

However, Skp2 is not expressed until the G1-S transition of the cell cycle, unequivocally later than the degradation of p27 apparent at G0-G1 (22Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K.

Moreover, p27 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at G0-G1 (23Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S.

The discrepancies between the temporal and spatial patterns of p27 expression and those of Skp2 expression suggested the existence of a Skp2-independent pathway for the degradation of p27. Consistent with this notion, p27 appears to be degraded normally at the G0-G1 transition in Skp2–/– mice (22Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol.

Biochemical analysis of crude extracts of Skp2–/– cells revealed the presence in the cytosolic fraction of a Skp2-independent E3 activity that mediates the polyubiquitylation of p27 (22Hara T.

This ubiquitylation is not dependent on the phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187, which is a prerequisite for Skp2-mediated ubiquitylation. Skp2 seems to play an important role in ubiquitylation and degradation of p27 during S and G2 phases (26Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Miyake S. Ishida N. Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M.

The factor to induce p27 ubiquitylation at G1 phase had been elusive until recently.We recently identified an E3 complex, designated KPC (Kip1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex), consisting of KPC1 and KPC2 subunits, as a potential mediator of p27 ubiquitylation in G1 phase (28Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). KPC1 contains a RING-finger domain, and KPC2 contains a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The nuclear export of p27 mediated by CRM1 appears to be necessary for its KPC-mediated ubiquitylation and proteolysis. KPC is thus localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and ubiquitylates p27 that is exported from the nucleus. Depletion of KPC1 by RNA interference inhibited p27 degradation. KPC thus likely regulates degradation of p27 in G1.We have now investigated the molecular interactions among p27, KPC1, and KPC2. We determined the domains of KPC1 that are required for its interactions with p27 and KPC2 as well as for its ability to ubiquitylate p27 and to promote p27 degradation. Detailed structural and functional analyses of KPC2 will be described elsewhere. 2T. Hara, T. Kamura, and K. I. Nakayama, manuscript in preparation. 2T. Hara, T. Kamura, and K. I. Nakayama, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, we also identified the region of p27 that is necessary for binding to KPC. KPC1 and the cyclin E·CDK2 complex were found to bind to p27 in a competitive manner. Our data suggest that KPC targets free p27 that is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to KPC1 and to KPC2 were described previously (28Kamura T.

Monoclonal antibodies to p27, to glutathione S-transferase (GST), and to HSP90 were obtained from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies (M2 and M5) to FLAG were from Sigma, a monoclonal antibody to T7 was from Novagen, and a monoclonal antibody (9E10) to Myc was from Roche Applied Science. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Y11) to the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Expression of Recombinant Proteins in HEK293T Cells—Complementary DNAs encoding wild-type or mutant (ΔS, Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, and ΔR) forms of human KPC1, each tagged at their NH2 termini with hexahistidine (His6) and FLAG, and a cDNA for human KPC2 containing COOH-terminal His6 and HA tags were subcloned into pCI-neo (Promega). Complementary DNAs encoding wild-type or mutant (1–258, 1–507, 1–766, 259–507, 259–766, 508–766, 767–1314, 1–450, 1–399, 1–350, and 132–507) forms of human KPC1, each tagged at their NH2 termini with three copies of the FLAG epitope (3×FLAG) were also subcloned into pCI-neo. HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figures by using the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed with a solution containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol.

The encoded GST-p27 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and purified with the use of glutathione beads. The GST moiety of the purified fusion proteins was removed with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Saccharomyces cerevisiae Uba1, human UbcH5A, and a GST fusion protein of mouse ubiquitin were prepared as described previously (22Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I.

Kitamura, University of Tokyo) (31Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), and the resulting vectors were used to transfect Plat E cells and thereby to generate recombinant retroviruses. NIH 3T3 cells were infected with the recombinant retroviruses and selected in medium containing puromycin (10 μg ml–1). Cells stably expressing the recombinant proteins were pooled for experiments.In Vitro Assay of Ubiquitylation Activity—For assay of the ability of immunoprecipitated wild-type or mutant (ΔS, Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, and ΔR) forms of KPC1 to mediate polyubiquitylation of p27, lysates of Sf21 insect cells that had been infected with baculoviruses encoding the KPC1 derivatives and KPC2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG (M2) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were mixed with 50 ng of Uba1, 100 ng of UbcH5A, 3 μg of GST-ubiquitin, and 50 ng of recombinant p27 in a final volume of 15 μl containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.5 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 26 °C. For assay of the ability of purified recombinant KPC1·KPC2 or SCFSkp2 complexes to mediate polyubiquitylation of p27, each complex (200 ng) was mixed with 50 ng of recombinant p27 in the absence or presence of 100 ng of recombinant cyclin E·CDK2 and was then subjected to the in vitro ubiquitylation assay as described above.In Vitro Binding Assay—For assay of the ability of wild-type or mutant (ΔS, Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, and ΔR) forms of KPC1 to bind to p27, lysates of Sf21 insect cells that had been infected with baculoviruses encoding the KPC1 derivatives were mixed with 500 ng of recombinant mouse wild-type p27, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG (M2) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences).For assay of the ability of the purified recombinant KPC1·KPC2 complex to bind to p27, the complex (1 μg) was mixed with 500 ng of recombinant T7-tagged human wild-type p27 in the absence or presence of 750 ng of recombinant cyclin E·CDK2, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG (M2) immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSThe NH2-terminal Region of KPC1 Is Required for Interaction with KPC2—We previously showed that KPC1 is an authentic RING finger-type E3 (Fig. 1A) and that a deletion mutant, KPC1(ΔR), that lacks the RING-finger domain retains the ability to interact with KPC2, suggesting that this domain is dispensable for binding to KPC2 (28Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To identify the region of KPC1 responsible for binding to KPC2, we expressed HA-tagged KPC2 together with FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type (Wt) KPC1 or a series of internal deletion mutants thereof in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG or to HA, and the resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with these same antibodies. Whereas Wt, Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, and ΔR forms of KPC1 were associated with KPC2, the ΔS and Δ1 mutants had lost the ability to interact with KPC2, suggesting that KPC2 binds to an NH2-terminal region of KPC1 that includes the SPRY domain (32Ponting C. Schultz J. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 193-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To delineate the region of KPC1 that is sufficient for interaction with KPC2, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with cells expressing various portions of 3×FLAG-tagged KPC1 (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis of the resulting precipitates revealed that endogenous KPC2 coprecipitated with KPC1-(1–507) and KPC1-(1–766) in addition to the Wt protein, consistent with the results obtained with the internal deletion mutants of KPC1 (Fig. 1B). We then tested additional deletion mutants derived from KPC1-(1–507) for the ability to interact with KPC2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1D). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the 3×FLAG-tagged KPC1 derivatives 1–507, 1–450, and 1–399 interacted with endogenous KPC2, whereas the derivatives 1–350 and 132–507 did not. These results thus indicate that the NH2-terminal region of KPC1 comprising residues 1–399 and including the SPRY domain is sufficient for binding to KPC2.The NH2-terminal Region of KPC1 Is Responsible for Recognition of p27—We previously showed that KPC1 directly interacts with p27 in vivo and in vitro (28Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To map the region of KPC1 required for interaction with p27, we performed an in vitro binding assay with KPC1 deletion constructs and p27. Lysates of Sf21 insect cells that had been infected with baculoviruses encoding FLAG-tagged KPC1 derivatives were mixed with recombinant mouse p27 and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG. Immunoblot analysis of the resulting precipitates revealed that p27 coprecipitated with Wt, Δ3, Δ4, and ΔR forms of KPC1 (Fig. 2A; the data are also summarized in Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the NH2-terminal portion of KPC1 also interacts with p27, although the region required for association with p27 extends more COOH-terminally than does that required for interaction with KPC2.Fig. 2Identification of the region of KPC1 responsible for recognition of p27. A, lysates of Sf21 cells expressing the FLAG-tagged KPC1 derivatives described in Fig. 1B were incubated with recombinant mouse p27 and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (M2). The resulting precipitates, as well as a portion of the original cell lysates, were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to FLAG (M2) or to p27. B, lysates of Sf21 cells coexpressing the FLAG-tagged KPC1 derivatives and HA-tagged KPC2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (M2), and a portion of the resulting precipitates was subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to FLAG (M2) or to HA. A portion of the original cell lysates was also subjected directly to immunoblot analysis with the same antibodies. C, the remainder of the immunoprecipitates prepared in B were assayed for E3 activity in an in vitro assay of p27 polyubiquitylation with GST-ubiquitin (Ub). The reaction products were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to p27 or to GST. IgH, immunoglobulin heavy chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next evaluated the ability of the KPC1 derivatives to mediate the polyubiquitylation of p27. Lysates of Sf21 insect cells that had been infected with baculoviruses encoding FLAG-tagged KPC1 derivatives and HA-tagged KPC2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FLAG. Immunoblot analysis of the resulting precipitates (Fig. 2B) yielded results for the binding of KPC2 to the KPC1 derivatives that were identical to those obtained with HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). The immunoprecipitates were also assayed for ubiquitylation activity with p27 in vitro (Fig. 2C; the data are also summarized in Fig. 1B). As previously demonstrated, KPC1(ΔR) did not mediate polyubiquitylation of p27 (28Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition, the ΔS, Δ1, and Δ2 mutants of KPC1, which did not bind to p27, also did not catalyze polyubiquitylation of p27. In contrast, KPC1(Δ3) and KPC1(Δ4) retained the ability both to associate with p27 and to mediate its polyubiquitylation, although the catalytic efficiency of the mutants appeared reduced compared with that of wild-type KPC1. Given that KPC1(Δ2) interacted with KPC2 but not with p27, the inability of this mutant to polyubiquitylate p27 was not attributable to an inability to associate with KPC2. These data indicate that an NH2-terminal region (residues 1–766) of KPC1, which includes the KPC2 binding domain, is responsible for recognition of p27.Expression of an NH2-terminal Deletion Mutant of KPC1 Inhibits p27 Degradation—A KPC1 mutant that lacks the RING-finger domain acts in a dominant negative manner to delay the degradation of p27 at the G0-G1 transition in NIH 3T3 cells (28Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We therefore next examined the effect of expression of the mutant KPC1-(508–1314), which lacks the NH2-terminal region but retains the RING-finger domain (Fig. 3A), on p27 degradation at G0-G1 in NIH 3T3 cells. The cells were infected with retroviral vectors encoding KPC2 and either wild-type KPC1 or KPC1-(508–1314). Expression of wild-type KPC1 and KPC2 markedly promoted the degradation of p27 compared with that apparent in control cells, as described previously, whereas expression of KPC1-(508–1314) with KPC2 resulted in a substantial delay in p27 degradation (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that KPC1-(508–1314) functions as a dominant negative mutant, possibly as a result of competition with the endogenous wild-type protein for the E2 enzyme or other unidentified molecule(s) that interacts with KPC1-(508–1314).Fig. 3Dominant negative effect of a KPC1 mutant lacking the NH2-terminal region on p27 degradation in vivo. A, schematic representation of the structures of wild-type (Wt) KPC1 and the mutant KPC1-(508–1314). B, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged KPC2 and either wild-type KPC1 or KPC1-(508–1314), each containing a 3×FLAG tag at their NH2 termini, were synchronized in G0 phase by contact inhibition and serum deprivation and then stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by replating at a density of ∼40% and incubation in complete medium for the indicated times. Cells infected with the corresponding empty retroviruses (Mock) were used as a control. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to p27, to FLAG (M5), to KPC1, to KPC2, or to HSP90 (loading control), as indicated.

Although some of these show constitutive activation, it is not clear how such GPCRs undergo homo-oligomerization with transmembrane helix movement. We previously reported that angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor, a GPCR, showed constitutive activation and induced apoptosis independent of its ligand, Ang II. In the present study, we analyzed the translocation and oligomerization of the AT2 receptor with transmembrane movement when the receptor induces cell signaling. Constitutively active homo-oligomerization, which was due to disulfide bonding between Cys35 in one AT2 receptor and Cys290 in another AT2 receptor, was localized in the cell membrane without Ang II stimulation and induced apoptosis without changes in receptor conformation. These results provide the direct evidence that the constitutively active homo-oligomeric GPCRs by intermolecular interaction in two extracellular loops is translocated to the cell membrane and induces cell signaling independent of receptor conformation and ligand stimulation.

Inhibition experiments were performed in the presence of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-specific inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) and the caspase-3 inhibitor (1 μm) for 48 h after serum starvation. CHO Cell Transfection and Establishment of CHO Cell Lines—The rat AT2 receptor gene described earlier was used (10Feng Y.H. Saad Y. Karnik S.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The wild-type (WT), N127G, inactive mutant AT2 receptor (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and C35A, C290A, and C35A/C290A genes (10Feng Y.H. Saad Y. Karnik S.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) cloned in the pEGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein), pEYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein)), pECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein), and pDsRed (discosoma red fluorescent protein) vectors that contain the neomycin (G418) resistance gene were transfected into CHO cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 liposomal reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Clonal cell lines that permanently expressed AT2 receptor were selected by 800 μg/ml G418 and evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. PAGE, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Cell membrane and cytoplasmic fraction were prepared as described previously (11Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Miura S. Zhang J. Boros J. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3720-3725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, equal amounts of samples on a protein basis as determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) were resolved on non-reducing 12% SDS-PAGE. Cell membrane was incubated with or without 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 30 °C for 1 h and with loading buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at room temperature for 30 min. Western blot analysis was performed with primary antibodies as specified in each case. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate system (Amersham Biosciences) were used as a detection system. The signal was independently quantified by a digital image analysis system. Analysis of Apoptosis—Nuclear fragmentation and condensation analysis with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining was used to identify apoptotic cells at the cellular level with a DMIRB digital fluorescent microscope (Leica) and a LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Co. Ltd.). For imaging, the cells were plated on lysine-coated microscope slides and then treated for up to 48 h. The cells were washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min and then stained with DAPI. Five images of separate locations were taken for each sample, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified. The percentage of apoptotic cells was also determined by the in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red™, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics). Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nicked end labeling (TUNEL) reaction mix was added. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Caspase-3-like Activity Assay—Caspase-3-like protease activity was determined by colorimetric assay using the CaspACE™ assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected and control cells (106) were lysed in lysis buffer by freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Caspase-3-like activity was measured in supernatant following proteolytic cleavage of the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. DEVD-pNA was used as a standard in the assay buffer (max405 nm). Radioligand Binding Studies—Kd and Bmax of the receptor were estimated by 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding experiments were carried out under equilibrium binding and Scatchard plot analysis, as described previously (11Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Miura S. Zhang J. Boros J. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3720-3725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Membranes expressing the WT or the mutant receptor were incubated with 300 pm 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II for 1 h at 22 °C in a 125-μl volume. The binding experiments were stopped by filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, which were extensively washed further with binding buffer. The bound ligand fraction was determined from the cpm remaining on the membrane. Binding kinetics values were determined using the computer program Ligand. Reactions with MTS Reagents by Reporter Cysteine Accessibility Mapping—Aliquots of cell membranes (20 μl) were incubated with or without MTS reagents at the stated concentrations (0.1–12.5 mm) at 22 °C for the indicated times (2–10 min) in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction mix was then diluted 75-fold with cold buffer to stop the reaction, centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer. A 150-μl aliquot was used for 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding analysis. The percent inhibition of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding was calculated as {1-[(specific binding after MTS reagent)/(specific binding without reagent)]} × 100%. The experiment was performed 4–10 times. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three or more independent determinations. Significant differences in measured values were evaluated with an analysis of variance using Bonferroni's test and the unpaired Student's t test. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated. Statistical significance was set at <0.05. The PC12W pheocromocytoma cell line has been used as a model for study because apoptosis in these cells (13Nakajima M. Hutchinson H.G. Fujinaga M. Hayashida W. Morishita R. Zhang L. Horiuchi M. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10663-10667Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) resembles the in vivo situation described in ovarian granulosa cells and other remodeling tissues (14Pucell A.G. Hodges J.C. Sen I. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1947-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Serum starvation leads to a ∼5-fold increase in AT2 receptor expression (Fig. 1a). Immunoblotting showed that the AT2 receptor underwent homo-oligomerization in the cell membrane (Fig. 1a). AT2 receptor-expressing native cell lines are not a suitable model for concluding the localization and homo-oligomerization of constitutively active AT2 receptor for apoptosis and are even less appropriate for concluding a role for the induced overexpression of AT2 receptor protein. Since CHO cells are an established epithelial lineage of non-transformed cells that are capable of growing under serum starvation with appropriate supplements and since we previously reported that exogenous overexpression of the AT2 receptor induced apoptosis in CHO cells (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we used these cells as surrogate models to link the de novo expression of the AT2 receptor to apoptosis. Using molecular imaging techniques, which show the translocation of the AT2 receptor to the cell membrane in living cells, we analyzed the translocation of AT2-WT-EGFP receptor that had been permanently transfected in CHO cells (Fig. 1b). Although the expression level of the AT2 receptor in normal adult tissues is ∼10–20 fmol/mg of protein (Bmax), it is re-expressed ∼5–25-fold over basal levels during the remodeling of tissues, where the AT2 receptor is thought to play a role in the apoptosis of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (14Pucell A.G. Hodges J.C. Sen I. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1947-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a CHO cell line, which showed an expression level of 341 ± 13 fmol/mg of protein in the cell membrane (Table I), was used for pharmacological examinations. As shown in Fig. 1b, AT2-WT-EGFP receptor was localized in the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions, whereas serum starvation by itself did not induce EGFP translocation. The expression level of AT2-WT-EGFP receptor in the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions was about 2.4-fold higher than the expression under serum conditions (Table I). In addition, AT2-WT-EGFP receptor was localized in the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions (Fig. 1b), suggesting that AT2-WT-EGFP receptor translocation in the cell membrane may induce cell signaling.Table IBmax of wild-type and mutant AT2 receptors to the cell membrane under serum or 24 hours after serum-free conditions *, p < 0.05 versus serum(+) conditions in each receptor. t, p < 0.05 versus WT.ReceptorBmaxFold increase (serum(-)/serum (+))(serum(+))(serum(-))pmol/mg of proteinWT341 ± 13821 ± 32* (No treatment)2.42.3788 ± 41* (+ [Sar1]Ang II)2.4815 ± 35* (+ PD123319)N127G389 ± 23989 ± 22*2.5C35A364 ± 33756 ± 29*2.1C290A660 ± 27t708 ± 191.1C35A/C290AaExpression levels in cytoplasm are shown309 ± 20289 ± 110.9a Expression levels in cytoplasm are shown Open table in a new tab Morphological features associated with apoptotic cells, such as nuclear DNA condensation and fragmentation, began ∼24 h (the time at which growth arrest was established) after shifting to serum starvation and was complete after 48 h in a CHO cell line expressing AT2-WT-EGPF receptor (Fig. 1c). The TUNEL method was used to analyze the percentage of apoptotic cells under various treatments (Fig. 1d); the CHO cell line expressing AT2-WT-EGPF receptor showed 64 ± 5% apoptosis. These cells also exhibited membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and inhibition of protein synthesis (data not shown). Although we established five different AT2-WT-EGPF receptor-expressing CHO cell lines, all of them showed similar apoptotic effects under serum-free conditions. In contrast, DAPI staining of cells that expressed AT2-N127G-EGFP receptor, which is an inactive AT2 receptor (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), revealed cell nuclei with sharp round edges and diffuse chromatin (Fig. 1c). In addition, the expression level of AT2-N127G receptor in the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions was about 2.5-fold higher than the expression under serum conditions, and this increase in the expression level of AT2-N127G receptor is comparable with that of AT2-WT receptor (Table I). The translocation of the AT2 receptor to the cell membrane may be necessary but not sufficient to induce apoptosis. Since we previously reported that AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis in A7r5 cells was blocked by the pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK and caspase-3 (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the effects of p38 MAPK inhibitor and caspase-3 inhibitor were analyzed in this cell system. The p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 blocked AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis by about 60%. The caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-cmk (1 mm) inhibited AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis by about 40% (Fig. 1d). Combined treatment with SB203580 and Ac-DEVD-cmk almost completely blocked AT2-WT-receptor-induced apoptosis. To determine whether the homo-oligomerization of the AT2 receptor in the cell membrane induces apoptotic signaling, immunoblotting of the AT2-WT and AT2-N127G receptors was performed. AT2-WT receptor homo-oligomerized in the cell membrane under serum-free conditions for 24 h (Fig. 1e). Although AT2-N127G receptor mainly homo-oligomerized in the cell membrane, a monomer band was also observed. After being pretreated with DTT under non-reducing conditions, AT2-WT receptor showed only a monomer band, suggesting that disulfide bonding may be important for homo-oligomerization (Fig. 1e). In addition, whereas both receptors mainly homo-oligomerized in the cell membrane under serum-free conditions for 48 h (Fig. 1f), only homo-oligomerized AT2-WT receptor induced apoptosis. Although the AT2 receptor contains consensus sites for phosphorylation, it is not phosphorylated in response to Ang II and does not internalize (17Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a constitutively active homo-oligomerized AT2-WT receptor but not an inactive homo-oligomerized AT2 receptor (N127G)-induced apoptosis. Next, we co-transfected CHO cells with AT2-WT-EGFP and AT2-WT-DsRed receptors to confirm the homo-oligomerization of AT2-WT receptor in the cell membrane. AT2-WT-EGFP and AT2-WT-DsRed receptors were co-localized in the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions (Fig. 2a). Many studies on GPCR oligomerization have used the co-immunoprecipitation of differentially epitope tagged forms of GPCRs. Co-expression of both the EGFP- and the DsRed-fusion forms of the AT2 receptors in this study followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFP antibody and immunoblotting of the precipitated samples with an anti-DsRed antibody detected the presence of DsRed-fused AT2 receptors. In addition, AT2 receptors appear to be localized in a perinuclear compartment, and this may be an artifact of oligomerization. These results indicate that AT2-WT-EGFP and AT2-WT-DsRed receptors homooligomerized (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, CHO cells, which were co-transfected with AT2-WT-EGFP and AT2-WT-DsRed receptors, also showed morphological features of apoptotic cells, such as irregular nuclei and membrane blebbing under serum-free conditions. Although early studies using radioligand binding and cross-linking had predicted homo-oligomeric receptors, the significance of these findings was not clear at that time. Although the functional importance of homo-oligomerization is much better defined for other receptors, such as tyrosine-kinase and steroid-hormone receptors (18Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar), in light of several reports on GPCR oligomers, it is not yet clear whether or not these receptors exist functionally as homo-oligomers. Although constitutive activity has been observed for more than 60 wild-type GPCRs and different species including humans (19Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), this is the first report in which a constitutively active GPCR, the AT2 receptor, has been shown to be functionally homo-oligomerized in the cell membrane. The agonist [Sar1]Ang II and the antagonist PD123319 do not modulate apoptosis in AT2 receptor-transfected A7r5 cells (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Serum starvation by itself induced the translocation of AT2-WT-EGFP receptor from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, whereas treatment with [Sar1]Ang II or PD123319 did not induce the delocalization of AT2-WT-EGFP from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2d). Immunoblotting indicated that the homo-oligomerization of AT2-WT-EGFP receptors was not affected by [Sar1]Ang II or PD123319 for up to 24 h under serum-free conditions (Fig. 2e). In addition, the expression level of AT2-WT-EGFP receptor in the cell membrane also did not show any changes in the presence of [Sar1]Ang II or PD123319 after 24 h under serum-free conditions. AT1 receptor is stabilized in the R state (inactive state), and agonist binding causes transition to the R* state (fully active state). In the AT1 receptor, this transition may proceed through a relaxed intermediate activated R′ state (partially active state) (20Miura S. Saku K. Karnik S.S. Hypertens. Res. 2003; 26: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of the AT2 receptor, constitutively active AT2 receptor may be in the R′ state but not in the R state. Since PD123319 is a neutral antagonist but not an inverse agonist for constitutively active AT2 receptor-induced apoptosis (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the antagonist may not affect AT2 receptor translocation, and the AT2 receptor may remain in the R′ state in the cell membrane. Taken together, ligand-independent AT2 receptor-induced signaling may cause apoptosis associated with AT2 receptor translocation and homo-oligomerization. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (21Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (22Angers S. Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar) are valuable approaches for analyzing the oligomerization of receptor after ligand stimulation. Although fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis was performed using CHO cells, which co-expressed both the AT2-EYFP and the AT2-ECFP receptors (data not shown), there was no energy transfer after Ang II stimulation because the AT2 receptor undergoes constitutive homo-oligomerization independent of Ang II. Since fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer were not useful in this study, several AT2 mutant receptors were used to analyze the specificity of the constitutive homo-oligomerization of the AT2 receptor. Four Cys residues, Cys35, Cys117, Cys195 and Cys290, in the AT2 receptor are located in the extracellular domain, where the redox environment may facilitate two disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond linking transmembrane (TM) 3 and extracellular loop 2 occurs in >91% of GPCRs (23Karnik S.S. Gogonea C. Patil S. Saad Y. Takezako T. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of the AT2 receptor, a disulfide bond between Cys117 and Cys195 in the extracellular domain is critical for the polypeptide to gain a ligand binding conformation, and in its absence, the polypeptide is irreversibly misfolded (15Stoll M. Steckelings U.M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cys35 in the N terminus and Cys290 in extracellular loop 3 in the AT2 receptor may play a central role in homo-oligomerization of the receptor through intermolecular or intramolecular interaction by disulfide linkage. AT2 receptor translocation was analyzed using C35A-EGFP, C290A-EGFP, and C35A/C290A-EGFP receptors (Fig. 3a). C35A-EGFP and C290A-EGFP receptors were translocated to the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions, whereas C35A/C290A was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3a). C35A-EGFP and C290A-EGFP receptors but not C35A/C290A-EGFP receptor were homo-oligomerized by immunoblotting (Fig. 3b) and induced apoptosis after 48 h under serum-free conditions (Fig. 3c), suggesting that the interaction of Cys35 and Cys290 in the homo-oligomerization of the AT2 receptor may be critical for inducing apoptosis. Since AT2 receptor expression-linked apoptosis has been shown to activate caspase-3 (4Miura S. Karnik S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4026-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we examined caspase-3-like activity as an AT2 receptor-induced signal. Basal caspase-3-like activity in cell lines that expressed WT-EGFP, C35A-EGFP, and C290A-EGFP receptors was much higher than that in cell lines that expressed EGFP as a control and N127G receptor, which is an inactive receptor, under serum-free conditions (Fig. 4a). Basal caspase-3-like activity in C35A/C290A-EGFP was comparable with that in cell lines that expressed EGFP or N127G (Fig. 4a). However, [Sar1]Ang II caused a significant increase in caspase-3-like activity in cell lines that expressed WT, C35A, C290A, and N127G receptors but not C35A/C290A receptors. The increased activity was not suppressed when cells were pretreated with PD123319. As shown in Table I, the expression level of C35A receptor in the cell membrane after 24 h under serum-free conditions was 2.1-fold higher than that in serum conditions, which is comparable with the results in WT, whereas there was no significant difference in the expression level of C290A receptor between serum and serum-free conditions because C290A receptor is already located in the cell membrane under serum conditions. Homooligomeric AT2 receptor in the cell membrane is not sufficient but may be necessary for caspase-3-like activation. The activation of caspase-3 is thought to be important for specific cleavage of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as p21waf1 and p27kip1, in apoptotic cells (24Levkau B. Koyama H. Raines E.W. Clurman B.E. Herren B. Orth K. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Since we previously reported that constitutive activation of AT1 receptor induces movement of the TM2–TM7 helix by reporter cysteine accessibility mapping using sulfhydryl-specific reaction with MTSEA (11Miura S. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24299-24305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Miura S. Zhang J. Boros J. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3720-3725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we also analyzed AT2 receptor TM movement by reporter cysteine accessibility mapping (Fig. 4, b and c). Exposure of native Cys residues to a water-accessible ligand pocket was measured. The percentage of inhibition of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-specific binding treated with 2.5 mm MTSEA+ for 2–10 min in the inactive N127G receptor was significantly lower than that in the constitutively active WT receptor (Fig. 4b). Exposure of the constitutively active WT receptor to MTSEA for 2 min reduced specific binding of the peptide antagonist 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II by nearly 47%, whereas exposure of the inactive N127G receptor reduced specific binding by 18% (Fig. 4c). In the case of N127G receptor, the Cys residues are moved to an area inaccessible by water, and this may reduce the specific binding of the peptide antagonist 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. There are three Cys residues in the upper site of the plasma membrane that face the extracellular space: Cys169 and Cys172 in TM IV and Cys269 in TM VI. Since one or more of these Cys residues may expose the ligand pocked in WT receptor, we replaced these Cys residues by Ala (C169A, C172A, and C269A). Cys accessibility for C169A was only 10%, suggesting that Cys169 in TM IV was exposed to the ligand pocket in WT receptor. Interestingly, Cys accessibilities for C35A, C290A, and C35A/C290A receptors are similar to that of WT receptor, indicating that these mutations did not induce conformational changes in the AT2 receptor. In addition, Cys accessibilities for C35A/N127G, N127G/C290A and C35A/N127G/C290A receptors are similar to that for N127G receptor. C35A/C290A receptor but not N127G receptor did not express and form a homo-oligomer in the cell membrane, suggesting that both Cys35 and Cys290 are important for making a disulfide bond and translocating the receptor to the cell membrane but not for creating a constitutively active form (Fig. 3b). EGFP and DsRed in C35A/C290A receptors did not mainly overlap in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4d). Most C35A/C290A receptors did not form a homo-oligomer in the cytoplasm and mainly formed a monomer by immunoblotting (Fig. 4e). Several recent studies have identified novel intercellular proteins that interact with the C-terminal tails of GPCRs (25Daviet L. Lehtonen J.Y. Tamura K. Griese D.P. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17058-17062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). AT2 receptor-interacting protein has a novel coiled-coil domain that contains protein that interacts with the AT2 receptor (26Nouet S. Amzallag N. Li J.M. Louis S. Seitz I. Cui T.X. Alleaume A.M. Di Benedetto M. Boden C. Masson M. Strosberg A.D. Horiuchi M. Couraud P.O. Nahmias C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28989-28997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This kind of protein may still form a homo-oligomer even if interaction between Cys35 and Cys290 is disrupted. To reconcile the observations presented here with those reported earlier, we propose a model of constitutively active homo-oligomeric AT2 receptor in the cell membrane (Fig. 4f). Inactive N127G receptor forms a homo-oligomer in the cell membrane but does not induce apoptosis. If Cys35 in the AT2 receptor binds to Cys290 in another AT2 receptor, C35A/C290A receptors do not form a homo-oligomer. Although the conformation of C35A/C290A receptor is similar to that of WT receptor, C35A/C290A mutant did not form a homo-oligomer in cytoplasm. Therefore, disulfide bonding in the extracellular loop in the WT receptor was disrupted by DTT treatment, and Cys35 in the AT2 receptor may establish some intermolecular contact such as a disulfide bond with Cys290 in another AT2 receptor. Other regions of intermolecular contact that have been proposed in other GPCRs include a region or regions within TM domains 1–3 from one receptor interacting with TM domains 1–3 from another for the V2 vasopressin receptor (27Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15884Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and docking of helix 8 with the loop between helices 5 and 6 for rhodopsin (28Davies A. Gowen B.E. Krebs A.M. Schertler G.F. Saibil H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The relative arrangement of receptors and the orientation of helix 8 are also based on the crystalline array of squid rhodopsin and on the hypothesis that there is both a symmetrical dimer interface that involves TM domain 4 and an interaction that involves helix 8 with the third intracellular loop. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that two conserved extracellular Cys residues (Cys140 and Cys220), which are present in almost all GPCRs of the rhodopsin family, play key roles in the formation of disulfide-linked m3′ receptor dimmers (8Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Since the two conserved Cys residues are likely to form an intramolecular disulfide bond, their findings indicate that the two conserved extracellular Cys residues can also participate in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. In the case of constitutively active AT2 receptor, two conserved Cys residues form an intramolecular disulfide bond. Two other Cys residues (Cys35 and Cys290) may form intermolecular disulfide bonds independent of ligand stimulation and receptor conformation changes, and the homo-oligomer induces cell signaling. Although oligomerization affects GPCR signaling, other roles still need to be identified. This discovery should help us to elucidate what is likely to be a common underlying mechanism for oligomerization of constitutively active GPCRs and to obtain a better understanding of the structure and function of these receptors in cells. We thank M. Fujino, Y. Matsuo, and S. Tomita for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2028856933,"We report the cloning and molecular analysis of Drosophila mitochondrial transcription factor (d-mtTF) B1. An RNA interference (RNAi) construct was designed that reduces expression of d-mtTFB1 to 5% of its normal level in Schneider cells. In striking contrast with our previous study on d-mtTFB2, we found that RNAi knock-down of d-mtTFB1 does not change the abundance of specific mitochondrial RNA transcripts, nor does it affect the copy number of mitochondrial DNA. In a corollary manner, overexpression of d-mtTFB1 did not increase either the abundance of mitochondrial RNA transcripts or mitochondrial DNA copy number. Our data suggest that, unlike d-mtTFB2, d-mtTFB1 does not have a critical role in either transcription or regulation of the copy number of mitochondrial DNA. Instead, because we found that RNAi knockdown of d-mtTFB1 reduces mitochondrial protein synthesis, we propose that it serves its primary role in modulating translation. Our work represents the first study to document the role of mtTFB1 in vivo and establishes clearly functional differences between mtTFB1 and mtTFB2.

Mitochondrial number and DNA content vary widely depending on cellular energy requirements, which are met in large part by ATP production by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Expression of the 13 polypeptides involved in oxidative phosphorylation that are encoded in the mtDNA 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; d-mtTF, Drosophila mitochondrial transcription factor; h-mtTF, human mitochondrial transcription factor; sc-mtTF, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial transcription factor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA; SSPE, saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA; S-AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine. genome is essential for this process. Transcription in animal mitochondria is thought to involve mitochondrial RNA polymerase and three distinct transcription factors (1Gaspari M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Mitochondrial transcription factor A (formerly referred to as mtTFA) contains two HMG boxes and was shown in organello to bind nonspecifically at regularly phased intervals to the control region of human mtDNA (3Ghivizzani S.C.

Human mitochondrial transcription factor A was also shown to be required for specific initiation at mitochondrial promoters in vitro (6Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G.

Two additional human transcription factors, mtTFB1/TFB1M and mtTFB2/TFB2M, have also been shown to activate transcription from mitochondrial promoters in the presence of mitochondrial transcription factor A and mitochondrial RNA polymerase in vitro, and h-mtTFB2 is more active in promoting transcription than h-mtTFB1 (6Falkenberg M.

McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that its in vitro transcriptional activation and methylase activities can be inactivated differentially by mutation (12McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5816-5824Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies show that both mtTFB1 and mtTFB2 support transcription from human mitochondrial promoters (6Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), their relative importance and specific physiological roles are not well understood. In a recent study (13Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we showed that RNAi knockdown of d-mtTFB2 reduces the abundance of specific mitochondrial RNA transcripts and decreases the copy number of mtDNA in Drosophila cultured cells. This finding suggests that endogenous d-mtTFB1 cannot complement a deficiency in d-mtTFB2 and thus is not functionally redundant with d-mtTFB2, pointing to specialized roles for the two transcription factors in vivo. Here, we report the cloning and overexpression of Drosophila mtTFB1 and the knockdown pheno-type of Drosophila Schneider cells treated with d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi. Our results do not support an important role for mtTFB1 in either efficient mitochondrial transcription or maintenance of mtDNA. Rather, we found that mtTFB1 modulates mitochondrial translation. Identification and Sequence Analysis of d-mtTFB1 cDNA—The amino acid sequence of d-mtTFB1 was used to search the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project Data Base. One sequence (CG7319) was identified that has a high level of homology to d-mtTFB1. Full-length cDNA was prepared using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), total RNA from Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, and the following primers; 5′-TTACCCAACTTGCTACTCTTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGGCACCTTGGCTATGAATTTGTGCTC-3′ for 5′-RACE, and 5′-CAAAATGGACGGTGGTTCCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGAATTCCTTCAAGCACTTGATCAACTCC-3′ for 3′-RACE. RACE products were purified from an agarose gel and sequenced, and sequence analysis was performed using MacDNASIS version 3.7 (Hitachi Software). Similarity searches against the non-redundant GenBank™ data base were performed using BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence was checked for targeting signal peptides using iPSORT (15Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) and MITPROT (16Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Bacterial Overexpression of d-mtTFB1 and Preparation of d-mtTFB1 Antibody—To express d-mtTFB1 in Escherichia coli, a PCR fragment of d-mtTFB1 cDNA encoding amino acid residues Gly-12 to Leu-330 was cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI. Bacterial cells harboring the plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside. The C-terminal His6 tag was utilized for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification of recombinant d-mtTFB1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Rabbits were immunized by injection of column-purified d-mtTFB1 in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by secondary immunization in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. To prepare affinity-purified antiserum, purified d-mtTFB1 (100 μg) was bound to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the filter was preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in PBS, incubated for 1 h with crude antiserum (1 ml in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.4) (∼5 ml). The eluted antibody was neutralized with 1 m Tris base. Preparation of Inducible Plasmids Expressing d-mtTFB1 and d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi—The plasmid pMt/B1/Hy, in which d-mtTFB1 cDNA is regulated by the metallothionein promoter, was constructed as follows: a fragment of d-mtTFB1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′-GGGCTCGAGGAAGTCGTTGCACAACAG-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-GCGCACTAGTCAGGAGTGAAATCGTTGC-3′ as 3′-primer. The PCR fragment was cleaved by XhoI and SpeI and subcloned. The plasmid pMt/invB1/Hy carries an inverted repeat of a nucleotide sequence from d-mtTFB1 cDNA that is transcribed from the metallothionein promoter. The insert in pMt/invB1/Hy was generated from two PCR-amplified fragments of d-mtTFB1 cDNA. One fragment has terminal XhoI and EcoRI sites and was prepared using the following pair of primers: 5′-CGCCTCGAGACTAGTACGGACAAGATAGTCAAGTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCGAATTCGGGATCGATTAGCTTCTCAGCAACCTCCTC-3′ (reverse). A second fragment has terminal SpeI and EcoRI sites and was prepared using the primers 5′-CGCCTCGAGACTAGTACGGACAAGATAGTCAAGTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCGAATTCAAAAAGCTTTAGCTTCTCAGCAACCTCCTC-3′ (reverse). The two PCR products were ligated and cloned into the pMt/Hy vector cleaved with XhoI and SpeI. Generation and Induction of Stable Cell Lines—Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Drosophila Schneider Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were subcultured to 3 × 106 cells/ml every third day. Cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen). Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected with 200 μg/μl hygromycin. Cells were passaged at least five times in hygromycin-containing medium and then cultured in standard medium. The cell lines were grown to a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml and then treated with 0.4 mm CuSO4 to induce high level expression from the metallothionein promoter (18Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Overexpression of d-mtTFB1 was effected by growth of the cell culture in the presence of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.4 mMCuSO4. Analysis of Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis—Cell lines were grown in the presence or absence of 0.4 mm CuSO4 for 10 days. Cells were harvested at room temperature, washed twice with methionine-free Grace's insect culture medium (Invitrogen), and resuspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in methionine-free Grace's insect culture medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml emetine, and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Five minutes after cell resuspension, 35S-Trans-label (ICN) was added to 300 μCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. After incubation, the cells were diluted with 2 volumes of Schneider Medium and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. Total cellular protein (30 μg/lane) was fractionated by 15–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried. The gels were autoradiographed by exposure to x-ray film (Kodak) for 3–10 days; the mitochondrial polypeptides indicated at right in Fig. 5 were quantitated from two independent experiments using the Kodak 1D program software. RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCRs were performed to determine mtTFB1 mRNA levels in Schneider cells. Reactions contained 5 μg of total RNA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 20 units of RNasin (Promega) in a total volume of 50 μl. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 20 pmol of (dN)6 primers. Five microliters of the reaction was added to PCR mix (50 μl) containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl, 30 pmol of 5′-primer, 30 pmol of 3′-primer, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (35 cycles for mtTFB1 and 25 cycles for RP49), with an initial step of 94 °C for 1 min and a final step of 72 °C for 2 min) was performed with primer combinations of 5′-d-mtTFB1 (5′-TGCAGTTCATGAAGCTGATC-3′) and 3′-d-mtTFB1 (5′-AGTCTGTATAGCTTCACCAG-3′) and 5′-RP49 (5′-GACCATCCGCCCAGCATAC-3′) and 3′-RP49 (5′-AGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG-3′). RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels and detected by staining with ethidium bromide. Immunoblotting—Total cellular protein (20 μg/lane) was fractionated by 10.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in PBS, followed by incubation for 1 h with d-mtTFB1 antibody (1:20) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Filters were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Protein bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibody against Drosophila mtTFB2 was prepared and used as described in Ref. 13Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. Northern and Southern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (5 μg/lane) was fractionated in a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to 32P-labeled probes for each of the following four genes: ribosomal protein 49 (RP49), cytochrome b (Cytb), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4), and 12S rRNA. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 42 °C in 5× SSPE (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA), 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 50% formamide. The membrane was washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, washed twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C, and then analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The signal for RP49 was used to normalize mitochondrial transcripts. Genomic DNA was purified from Drosophila Schneider S2 cells by standard methods. DNA (5 μg/lane) was cleaved with XhoI, fractionated in a 0.8% agarose/TBE gel, and transferred to nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed as described above. Filters were washed three times for 10 min at room temperature with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, washed once for 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Blots were probed with radiolabeled DNAs for the mitochondrial gene Cytb and the nuclear histone gene cluster. The ratio of the signals for these two genes was used to determine the relative copy number of mtDNA. RNAi-dependent Knockdown of d-mtTFB1 Does Not Reduce Mitochondrial Transcription and Does Not Induce mtDNA Depletion in Schneider Cells—The sequence of a putative d-mtTFB1 (10McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was used to identify and clone a full-length cDNA by RACE. The cDNA clone obtained is 1530 nucleotides and encodes a predicted polypeptide of 330 amino acids. Rabbit antiserum was raised against a recombinant, truncated form of d-mtTFB1 (Gly-12 to Leu-330). The antibody detects a single polypeptide in mitochondrial extracts from Drosophila Schneider cells with an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to an approximate molecular mass of 38 kDa (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions of Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrated that d-mtTFB1 is localized to the mitochondria (data not shown). The abundance of d-mtTFB1 was reduced by expressing a metallothionein-inducible d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi species (19Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 20Baulcombe D.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R599-R601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Kennerdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) from the plasmid pMt/invB1/Hy. The RNA species produced forms a double-stranded RNA hairpin homologous to d-mtTFB1. Previous studies indicate that double-stranded RNA hairpins are efficient RNAi inhibitors (22Lam G. Thummel C.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Kennerdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 24Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 13: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing pMt/invB1/Hy or the control plasmid pMt/Hy were cultured for 10 days in the presence or absence of 0.4 mm CuSO4. Immunoblot analysis of copper-treated cells showed an undetectable level of d-mtTFB1 in cells carrying pMt/invB1/Hy (Fig. 1B). Basal, uninduced expression from pMt/invB1/Hy also repressed expression of d-mtTFB1 by 6-fold. In contrast, expression of d-mtTFB2 was unchanged under all experimental conditions. RT-PCR analysis of copper-treated cells showed that cells carrying pMt/invB1/Hy expressed 20-fold less d-mtTFB1 RNA than cells carrying the control vector, and basal, uninduced expression from pMt/invB1/Hy also suppressed expression of d-mtTFB1 RNA by 7-fold (Fig. 1C). Copper-treated cells carrying pMt/invB1/Hy showed moderate growth retardation, but copper treatment had no adverse effects on growth of control cells (data not shown). This finding contrasts with the poor growth and reduced viability phenotype we observed upon similar reduction of d-mtTFB2 using the RNAi strategy (13Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The biological function of d-mtTFB1 was examined in cells expressing d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi. Transcription of several mitochondrial genes and mtDNA copy number were measured in cells with no plasmid and cells carrying pMt/Hy or pMt/invB1/Hy. Northern blots were used to quantitate the relative expression of the Cytb, ND4, and 12S rRNA genes in cells grown for 10 days in the presence or absence of copper. Neither basal nor induced expression of d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi resulted in reduced transcript levels for 12S rRNA, ND4, or Cytb (Fig. 2); transcript levels were unchanged, both before and after induction, as compared with the level of transcripts from the nuclear gene RP49 used as a control. These results argue that either d-mtTFB1 is not critical for transcription of either strand of Drosophila mtDNA or its endogenous level is markedly higher than that which is required for transcription. With regard to the latter, however, we find that the physiological level of d-mtTFB1 is, at most, severalfold higher than that of d-mtTFB2 (data not shown). RNAi knockdown of d-mtTFB2 (13Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but not d-mtTFB1 results in a substantial reduction in mitochondrial transcription. This, combined with the observation that mtTFB2 is apparently 10-fold more effective in stimulating mitochondrial transcription in vitro than mtTFB1 (6Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), supports our conclusion of the relative lack of physiological importance of mtTFB1 in mitochondrial transcription. The copy number of mtDNA was also unchanged in cells expressing d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi. Total cellular DNA was isolated from cells with no plasmid and cells carrying pMt/Hy or pMt/invB1/Hy, cleaved with XhoI, and analyzed by Southern blot. Blots were hybridized sequentially with probes for the nuclear histone gene cluster and for the mitochondrial gene Cytb (Fig. 3A). Relative mtDNA copy number was determined from the ratio of Cytb hybridization to histone cluster hybridization (Fig. 3B). After induction of d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi for 10 days, relative mtDNA copy number was almost the same as the control. This result suggests that d-mtTFB1 is not critical for maintenance of mtDNA. Overexpression of d-mtTFB1 Has No Effect on Mitochondrial Transcription or mtDNA Copy Number—d-mtTFB1 was subcloned into the inducible expression vector pMt/Hy under the control of the metallothionein promoter. The resulting expression vector, pMt/mtTFB1/Hy, was introduced into Schneider cells, and stable cell lines harboring this plasmid were cultured in the presence of 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.4 mm CuSO4. After 10 days of incubation, immunoblot analysis indicated a 2–50-fold increase in d-mtTFB1 relative to that in the uninduced control (Fig. 4A). At the same time, d-mtTFB2 expression was unchanged under all experimental conditions (Fig. 4A). Overexpression had no effect on cell growth or viability (data not shown). The effect of d-mtTFB1 overexpression on mitochondrial transcript abundance was evaluated by Northern blots. Blots were probed for transcripts from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, ND4, and Cytb genes and for nuclear RP49 gene as a control (Fig. 4B). We found that the levels of all three mitochondrial RNA transcripts were unchanged. Similarly, we found that the relative copy number of mtDNA was also unchanged in cells that overexpress d-mtTFB1 (Fig. 4C). RNAi-dependent Knockdown of d-mtTFB1 Reduces the Efficiency of Mitochondrial Translation—The apparent lack of molecular defects in either mitochondrial transcription or mtDNA replication, upon either RNAi knockdown or overexpression of d-mtTFB1, and recent studies showing that human mtTFB1 catalyzes rRNA adenosine dimethyltransferase activity when expressed in E. coli (11Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) led us to examine mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells with no plasmid and cells carrying pMt/Hy or pMt/invB1/Hy. The cell lines were cultured for 10 days in the presence or absence of 0.4 mm CuSO4. Pulse labeling of mitochondrial translation was then performed for 2 h in the presence of emetine and cycloheximide, specific inhibitors of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, and Fig. 5 shows the mitochondrial protein synthesis pattern obtained. This pattern was eliminated in the presence of 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis (data not shown). We observed no significant effect on mitochondrial translation in either cells carrying no plasmid or cells carrying pMt/Hy in the presence or absence of induction. However, basal expression of d-mtTFB1-targeted RNAi reduced the newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins to 70% of their levels in control cells, and after induction in the presence of copper, mitochondrial protein synthesis was reduced further to 40% of that in control cells. These data show that d-mtTFB1 modulates mitochondrial translation in Schneider cells. The fact that we observed only a modest effect on translation despite a large reduction in mtTFB1 levels suggests endogenous d-mtTFB1 exceeds that required for dimethylation of mitochondrial 12S rRNA. Consistent with that conclusion, we found that a 2–50-fold overexpression of d-mtTFB1 has no effect on either the pattern or abundance of mitochondrial proteins (data not shown). Drosophila mtTFB1 shares homology with human mtTFB1, which has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial transcription in vitro (6Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and to have rRNA adenine dimethyltransferase activity in bacteria (11Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In Drosophila Schneider cells treated with RNAi, d-mtTFB1 is expressed at 5% of the endogenous level. Although abundance of mitochondrial transcripts and mtDNA copy number were unchanged, RNAi treatment reduces the level of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Overexpression of d-mtTFB1 does not stimulate transcription of mitochondrial genes, nor does it increase mtDNA copy number. These data provide the first evidence that animal mtTFB1 plays a significant role in mitochondrial translation but apparently does not serve a critical function in mitochondrial transcription or mtDNA maintenance in vivo. In an earlier report (13Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the abundance of d-mtTFB2 influences both mitochondrial transcription and the efficiency of mtDNA replication. It is particularly significant that RNAi knockdown of d-mtTFB2 lowers the efficiency of mitochondrial transcription in Drosophila cultured cells because the data suggest strongly that endogenous mtTFB1 cannot complement a deficiency in mtTFB2. In striking contrast, neither RNAi knockdown nor overexpression of mtTFB1 affects the levels of mitochondrial transcripts or mtDNA copy number in Drosophila cultured cells. In vitro studies have shown that both mtTFB1 and mtTFB2 support transcription from human mitochondrial promoters (6Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but their relative importance and specific roles are not well understood. Our data argue strongly that either mtTFB1 does not play an important role in mitochondrial transcription in vivo or endogenous mtTFB2 is functionally redundant with the role of mtTFB1 in transcription. In this regard, it has been reported that h-mtTFB1 has rRNA methyltransferase activity (11Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that h-mtTFB2 is at least 1 order of magnitude more active in promoting transcription in vitro than h-mtTFB1 (6Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In composite, our current and previous data (13Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) document functional differences between mtTFB1 and mtTFB2 in vivo. Both mtTFB1 and mtTFB2 are related in primary sequence to a family of rRNA adenine dimethyltransferases that modify two adjacent adenosine bases near the 3′-end of small subunit rRNA to produce N6,N6-dimethyladenosine (25Van Knippenberg P.H. Van Kimmenade J.M. Heus H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and Shadel and co-workers (11Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that h-mtTFB1 can methylate E. coli small rRNA in vivo. Fig. 6 shows an amino acid sequence alignment between bacterial (KsgA and ErmC′) and yeast (Dim1) rRNA adenine dimethyltransferases and mtTFBs. KsgA and ErmC′ are well-studied rRNA adenine dimethyl-transferases (26Lu Q. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5243-5246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Maravic G. Feder M. Pongor S. Flogel M. Bujnicki J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Maravic G. Bujnicki J.M. Feder M. Pongor S. Flogel M.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 177: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure of sc-mtTFB (30Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is very similar to those of KsgA (31O'Farrell H.C. Scarsdale J.N. Rife J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 337-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and ErmC′ (32Bussiere D.E. Muchmore S.W. Dealwis C.G. Schluckebier G. Nienaber V.L. Edalji R.P. Walter K.A. Ladror U.S. Holzman T.F. Abad-Zapatero C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7103-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we aligned KsgA, ErmC′, and sc-mtTFB based on their structures, and the mtTFB1s and mtTFB2s are aligned based on sequence homology with KsgA and ErmC′. The N-terminal domains of KsgA and ErmC′ share a negatively charged pocket that corresponds to residues in the canonical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (S-AdoMet)-binding site, and 12 residues in ErmC′ were shown to interact directly with S-AdoMet (33Schluckebier G. Zhong P. Stewart K.D. Kavanaugh T.J. Abad-Zapatero C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Most of these residues are well conserved in ErmC′, KsgA, Dim1, and mtTFB1s but are poorly conserved in sc-mtTFB and mtTFB2s. Absolutely conserved residues among KsgA family members that are indicated in Fig. 6 are also well conserved in ErmC′, Dim1, and mtTFB1s. In contrast, fewer than half are conserved in sc-mtTFB and mtTFB2s. Notably, mutations in these residues have been documented to be poorly tolerated for methyltransferase activity. For example, the activity of the N101A mutant in ErmC′ is reduced to 10% in vivo and is eliminated in vitro; a Y104A mutation in ErmC′ was inactive both in vivo and in vitro (27Maravic G. Feder M. Pongor S. Flogel M. Bujnicki J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These 2 residues are not well conserved in sc-mtTFB and mtTFB2. The comparative data suggest strongly that d-mtTFB1 has rRNA adenine dimethyl-transferase activity like h-mtTFB1 and that sc-mtTFB and mtTFB2 do not. Modification by dimethylation of two adjacent adenosine bases at the 3′-end of the small rRNA is conserved in bacteria and animal mtDNA (25Van Knippenberg P.H. Van Kimmenade J.M. Heus H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, the structure of this entire region is highly conserved. Whereas the functional role of the dimethyladenosine modification in mitochondrial small rRNA is unknown, the importance of this modification has been studied in E. coli using mutants in ksgA. ksgA mutants fail to dimethylate the 16S rRNA and, in consequence, are resistant to kasugamycin, an antibiotic in the aminoglycoside family (29van Buul C.P. Visser W. van Knippenberg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 177: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Helser T.L. Davies J.E. Dahlberg J.E. Nat.

The non-dimethylated ribosome is mildly impaired in protein synthesis, mainly at the initiation and elongation steps, and ksgA mutants show a slight decrease in growth (29van Buul C.P. Visser W. van Knippenberg P.H. FEBS Lett. 1984; 177: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Van Knippenberg P.H. Hardesty B. Kremaer G. Structure, Function and Genetics of Ribosomes.

Kashiwagi K. Tatokoro I. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 113: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our data show that the abundance of d-mtTFB1 influences the efficiency of mitochondrial translation and is consistent with these observations. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dim1, an ortholog of KsgA, is an 18S rRNA dimethylase. S. cerevisiae Dim1 is essential for viability, and loss of S. cerevisiae Dim1 activity that eliminates 18S rRNA methylation also results in the inhibition of rRNA processing of the 18S precursor at a step prior to adenosine dimethylation. In contrast, rRNA processing does not occur in animal mitochondria, and in mtTFB1-depleted Drosophila cells, we did not detect any change in either the level or electrophoretic mobility of the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA. Differing from animals, S. cerevisiae has only one mtTFB gene, sc-mtTFB, and mitochondrial 12S rRNA is not methylated on the two adenosine bases (25Van Knippenberg P.H. Van Kimmenade J.M. Heus H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Klootwijk J. Klein I. Grivell L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is particularly significant that RNAi knockdown of d-mtTFB1 lowers the efficiency of mitochondrial translation in Drosophila cultured cells because the data suggest strongly that endogenous mtTFB2 cannot complement a deficiency in mtTFB1 in its role in translation. These data are consistent with a lack of adenine dimethyltransferase activity in sc-mtTFB and mtTFB2s. Taken together, our data suggest strongly that the primary roles of mtTFB1 and mtTFB2 differ in vivo; mtTFB1 is an rRNA adenine dimethyltransferase that influences the efficiency of mitochondrial translation, and mtTFB2 is a critical mitochondrial transcription factor.

Similarly, in the MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA complex a favorable hydrogen bond or ion pair interaction between the cationic 1′-pyrrolidine atom and WAT3 is crucial for tight affinity. Distance analysis of the nucleophile and leaving group show that MT-ImmA is a mimic of an early transition state, while MT-DADMe-ImmA is a better mimic of the highly dissociated transition state of E. coli MTAN.

A Look at Nucleosidase Transition State Analogue Binding♦Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 18PreviewThe nucleosides, 5′-methylthioadenosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, are involved in many key cellular reactions such as methylation, polyamine biosynthesis, and methionine recycling. In many pathogenic microbes, both nucleosides are broken down by 5′-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTAN). Because this enzyme is not present in mammals it is a potential antimicrobial target. As such, several MTAN inhibitors have been developed, including the transition state analogues 5′-methylthio-immucillin A (MT-ImmA) and 5′-methylthio-DADMe-immucillin A (MT-DADMe-ImmA).

The breakdown of these nucleosides differs in microbial and mammalian systems. In many pathogenic microbes, such as Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Helicobacter pylori, MTA and SAH are catabolized by the dual substrate specific enzyme, MTA/SAH nucleosidase (MTAN). MTAN irreversibly cleaves the glycosidic bond of MTA or SAH to form adenine and 5-methylthioribose or S-ribosylhomocysteine, respectively (8Duerre J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3737-3741Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, in mammalian systems the nucleosidase is not present and the breakdown of MTA and SAH requires two separate enzymes, MTA phosphorylase (MTAP) (9Pegg A.E. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 682-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SAH hydrolase (10de la Haba G. Cantoni G. J. Biol.

Given the similarities in transition state structure, inhibitors developed for PNP and MTAP were tested for their ability to inhibit MTAN. There has been extensive inhibitor development for MTAP and PNP. Such interest stems from the observation that in humans a genetic deficiency in PNP leads to a build up of dGTP and results in the cell death of proliferating T-cells (22Markert M.L. Immunodefic. Rev. 1991; 3: 45-81PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of PNP provides a target for the treatment of T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorders and T-cell malignancies (23Montgomery J.A. Med. Res.

In general, the Immucillins replace the ribosyl O4′ with a positive charge (N4′) to match the electrostatic state of a partially dissociated oxacarbenium ion. Furthermore, the purine N9 is replaced by a carbon to provide a non-hydrolyzable C-C ribosidic bond which increases the pKa of N7 to >10 and allows for protonation. The DADMe-Immucillin inhibitors were developed with a methylene bridge between the deazaadenine and pyrrolidine group to mimic the highly dissociated or advanced bond order of the leaving group (33Evans G.B.

In addition, the positive charge is shifted to the anomeric position from the ribosyl O4′ to mimic the delocalization of the positive charge between the O4′ and C1′ atoms.

Aromatic substitutions to the 5′-thio group provided seventeen inhibitors with dissociation constants from 10-12 to 10-14 m. 5′-p-Cl-phenylthio-DADMe-ImmA (Ki* = 47 fm) is one of the most powerful non-covalent inhibitors ever reported. MT-ImmA and MT-DADMe-ImmA were selected for structural analysis as the parent compounds of the two transition state analogue classes. The structures of MTA/SAH nucleosidase complexed with the inhibitors MT-ImmA (MTAN-MT-ImmA) and MT-DADMe-ImmA (MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA) have been determined to 2.2 Å resolution. Comparisons of MTAN-MT-ImmA and MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA with the previously determined MTAN-MTT and MTAN-FMA structures has permitted a dissection of the interactions between the active site and the inhibitors that account for the tight affinity of the transition state analogues. The structures reveal that affinity of MT-DADMe-ImmA likely results from more favorable interactions between the cationic charge on the pyrrolidine moiety and the nucleophilic water either through an energetically favorable hydrogen bond or an ion pair. The structures of MTAN complexed with MT-ImmA and MT-DADMe-ImmA are compared with a structure resembling the Michaelis complex and demonstrate increased and more favorable hydrogen bond contacts together with ionic interactions with the carbocation mimics inherent in the Immucillin structures. Crystallization of MTAN-MT-ImmA and MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA— E. coli MTA/SAH nucleosidase was expressed and purified as described previously (39Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The transition state analogues MT-ImmA and MT-DADMe-ImmA were synthesized as reported previously (37Singh V. Shi W. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The enzyme was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and incubated with 1 mm MT-ImmA or MT-DADMe-ImmA for 2 h on ice before crystallization. All crystallization experiments were performed at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Rod-shaped MTAN-MT-ImmA crystals (0.15 × 0.15 × 0.7 mm) were obtained over 3 weeks using 37% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 200, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CoCl2.6H2O. MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA crystallizes over a 2-week period as thin rods (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm) in 1.4 m sodium chloride and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6. Data Collection and Processing—The MT-ImmA-complexed nucleosidase crystal was frozen directly in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K without the need for cryoprotection. The MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA crystal was first transferred to a cryoprotectant containing 1.6 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate, 1 mm MT-DADMe-ImmA, and 30% (v/v) glycerol for 2 min prior to flash freezing in a stream of nitrogen gas (100 K). Data were collected on both MTAN-MT-ImmA and MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA crystals to 2.2 Å resolution on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator with Osmic optics and R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate. All data were internally reduced using the d*TREK package (40Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Prior to structure determination and refinement, the DREAR program package (41Blessing R.H. Cryst. Rev. 1987; 1: 3-58Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar) was used to apply Bayesian statistics to the data to improve the weak data as well as to eliminate negative intensities.

For each structure the initial MTAN-MTT dimer (Protein Data Bank code: 1NC1), from which all water and inhibitor molecules were omitted, was subjected to a round of rigid body refinement in CNS (42Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Interactive rounds of manually rebuilding using Xfit in XtalView (43McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and amplitude-based maximum-likelihood torsion angle simulated annealing (44Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and individual B-factor refinement with an overall anisotropic temperature and bulk solvent correction were performed. The progress of the refinement was monitored by the reduction in Rcryst and Rfree. σA-weighted difference Fourier maps revealed ordered water molecules and strong unambiguous positive Fo - Fc difference electron density corresponding to the MT-ImmA or MT-DADMe-ImmA inhibitor. The MT-ImmA coordinates were generated by modifying the Protein Data Bank file of MTA downloaded from the HIC-UP server (45Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The coordinates for MT-DADMe-ImmA were generated using the web-based program, CORINA (www2.chemie.unierlangen.de/software/corina/index.html). The topology and parameter files were subsequently produced using the XPLOD-2D server (46Kleywegt G.J. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar). Water molecules with proper hydrogen-bonding coordination and electron densities larger than 1 σ on 2Fo - Fc and 3 σ on Fo - Fc σA-weighted maps were progressively introduced while monitoring the decrease in Rfree. After the inclusion of water and inhibitor molecules into the models, alternating rounds of crystallographic conjugate gradient minimization refinement and model rebuilding in Xfit were performed. Chymotrypsin digestion of the enzyme results in the cleavage of 21 residues of the 31 residue N-terminal 6-histidine fusion tag. The remaining 10 residues of the N-terminal fusion tag were located in a region of weak electron density and only residues -2 to 232 in monomer A and residues 1-232 in monomer B were sufficiently ordered enough to be built into the model. The side chains of Cys31 and Thr218 in both MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA monomers were found to exist in two orientations and were modeled and refined as such. The MTAN-MT-ImmA and MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA structures were refined to Rcryst = 19.4% and Rfree = 24.4% and Rcryst = 19.8% and Rfree = 24.6%, respectively.

The refinement statistics are reported in Table I. Superimposition of Structures—The MTA/SAH nucleosidase structures were aligned by non-linear least squares fit of selected main chain (N-Cα-C) atoms in the central β-sheet using the program PROFIT (Version 6.0), written by G. David Smith. The residue ranges used in the refinement of the superposition were Lys2-Ile6, Glu42-Leu46, Leu62-Ala77, Val90-Arg96, Pro116-Ala121, and Val187-Val191. Conformational Energetics for MTA and Inhibitors—Energetics of the sugar-analogue ring pucker and the C-ribosyl torsion angles for MTA, MT-ImmA, and MT-DADMe-ImmA were calculated in vacuum, using the Sybyl force constants in Spartan, Version 5.13. Energies for sugar pucker were minimized at 10-degree intervals of sugar pucker indexed for the dihedral defined by O4′-C1′-C2′-C3′ in MTA, N4′-C1′-C2′-C3′ in MT-ImmA and C4′-N1′-C2′-C3′ in MT-DADMe-ImmA. Note that the C4′ carbocyclic carbon of MT-DADMe-ImmA is unnumbered in Fig. 1. Energies for glycosyl torsion angles were minimized at 10-degree intervals for the full rotation of the 9-deazadenine ring with respect to the ribosyl group. Energetic minimizations were conducted for neutral MTA and both neutral and cationic forms of MT-ImmA and MT-DADMe-ImmA. All energetic barriers are assumed to be upper limits, since they are calculated in vacuum and the energies are expected to be lower in water where the electrostatic repulsions/attractions are shielded. The overall structures of MTAN-MT-ImmA and MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA are similar to the ligand-induced closed conformation structures of MTAN complexed with FMA or MTT (12Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8761-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer and contains one active site per subunit (Fig. 2a) (11Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Each subunit contains an α/β structure with a central nine-stranded mixed β-sheet and a smaller five-stranded β-sheet. The central β-sheet is surrounded by six α-helices and one small 310 helix (Fig. 2b). The dimer interface is primarily hydrophobic, consisting of residues from the α2, α5, α6, and 310 helices and the loops between β2-β3 and β4-α2. The nucleosidase active site has three subsites to accommodate the adenine, ribose, and 5′-alkylthio substituents of the substrate (Fig. 3). Although, MTAN-MT-ImmA and MTAN-MT-DADMe-ImmA were crystallized at pH 4.7 and 4.6, respectively, the low pH values are not expected to affect activity. MTAN previously has been characterized to be completely active at pH 4.5 (49Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Crossref PubMed Sc"

Whereas PhLPL directly inhibits Gβγ-stimulated signaling, the G βγ-inhibitory mechanism of PhLPS is not understood. We report here that inhibition of Gβγ signaling in intact HEK cells by PhLPS was independent of direct Gβγ binding; however, PhLPS caused down-regulation of Gβ and Gγ proteins. The down-regulation was partially suppressed by lactacystine, indicating the involvement of proteasomal degradation. N-terminal fusion of Gβ or Gγ with a dye-labeling protein resulted in their stabilization against down-regulation by PhLPS but did not lead to a functional rescue. Moreover, in the presence of PhLPS, stabilized Gγ subunits did not coprecipitate with stabilized Gβ subunits, suggesting that PhLPS might interfere with Gβγ folding. PhLPS and several truncated mutants of PhLPS interacted with the subunit tailless complex polypeptide-1α (TCP-1α) of the CCT chaperonin complex, which is involved in protein folding. Knock-down of TCP-1α in HEK cells by small interfering RNA also led to down-regulation of Gβγ. We therefore conclude that the strong inhibitory action of PhLPS on Gβγ signaling is the result of a previously unrecognized mechanism of Gβγ-regulation, inhibition of Gβγ-folding by interference with TCP-1α.

In contrast, the short splice variant PhLPS, which has a more restricted expression, lacks this motif and did not seem to exert a major Gβγ inhibition, when tested with purified proteins. However, we recently demonstrated that PhLPS showed a more pronounced Gβγ inhibition than PhLPL in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells (12Humrich J. Bermel C. Grübel T. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4474-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although PhLPL is the more abundantly expressed splice variant in most tissues, it is expressed at high levels in some tissues (e.g. adrenal gland) and has been suggested to play a role in regulation of catecholamine release (12Humrich J. Bermel C. Grübel T. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4474-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Gensse M. Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bader M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This suggests that PhLPS has an effect on Gβγ that is not mediated by direct binding to Gβγ. Therefore, we set out to investigate this (potentially indirect) mechanism of Gβγ inhibition by PhLPS in intact cells. We report that transfection of PhLPS was associated with down-regulation of transfected and endogenously expressed Gβγ and that this down-regulation involved a proteasome-dependent pathway. It was recently reported that PhLP might inhibit the function of the cytosolic chaperonin complex (chaperonin complex containing TCP subunits (CCT)), which is involved in the folding of several proteins (14McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Such an interaction might result in misfolding of G-protein subunits and might, thereby, provide an indirect mechanism of G-protein inhibition. In fact, we observed that PhLPS interacted with a subunit of the CCT complex and thereby appears to prevent proper folding of Gβγ complexes. Materials—[32P]NAD and myo-[2-3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Pertussis toxin was from Sigma. Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-PhLP-CT (12Humrich J.

Secondary antibodies were from Dianova (goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse with horseradish peroxidase) or from Calbiochem (goat anti-rat horseradish peroxidase). Construction of Expression Vectors—All of the cDNAs used in these studies were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cDNAs for PhLPL, PhLPS, and PhLPLA18–20 have been described previously (2Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The construction of deletion mutants and Trp-66 to Val mutants of PhLPL was done by PCR and confirmed by automated sequencing. In order to generate Gβ or Gγ subunits resistant to N-terminal destabilization, the dye-labeling protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT) (15Keppler A. Gendreizig S. Gronemeyer T. Pick H. Vogel H. Johnsson K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar), was subcloned N-terminal of either the Gβ or Gγ subunit in pcDNA3 by PCR and also confirmed by automated sequencing. Phosphorylation of PhLPL and PhLP/Gβγ Binding Assays—PhLPL, PhLPS, and GST were purified from Escherichia coli as C-terminally His6-tagged proteins as described (4Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and casein kinase 2 (CK2) kinase assays were performed with recombinant human CK2 enzyme (Roche Applied Science). A 100-μl reaction containing 5 μm of recombinant PhLPL, CK2 buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 0.3 milliunits of CK2, and 200 μm ATP (0.1 μCi of [32P]ATP for tracing) was incubated at 37 °C for 120 min. As controls, His6-tagged PhLPL, PhLPS, and GST were incubated under similar conditions but in the absence of CK2. For binding assays, HEK cell extract was prepared by disrupting cells of one 10-cm dish in 1 ml of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and Tris-Cl, pH 7.5), followed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min). Protein content of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method. Binding was then performed by adding this supernatant from Gβγ-transfected HEK cells (100 μg of protein) to 400 nm His6-tagged PhLPL, PhLPS, or GST (phosphorylated or control-treated). For certain binding experiments, cell extract of PhLP isoform-transfected cells was combined with cell extract of Gβ1·His6-Gγ2-expressing cells. After incubation (37 °C for 30 min), reactions were diluted with 5 volumes of ice-cold binding buffer supplemented with 50 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and rotated at 4 °C for 10 min. The beads were then washed, eluted with SDS-Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (anti-Gβ antibody or anti-PhLP-CT antibody as indicated). Co-immunoprecipitations—For the co-immunoprecipitation of PhLP constructs and endogenous TCP-1α, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated cDNA, and, 42 h later, cells were lysed in PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). Precipitation was performed with the PhLP-CT antibody pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After washing four times in lysis buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Detection of bound TCP-1α was performed with anti-TCP-1α antibody (rat; Calbiochem). For co-immunoprecipitation of AGT-Gβ1 and AGT-Gγ2, cells were transfected with AGT-Gβ1 or AGT-Gγ2 and were lysed and treated as before. Then AGT-Gβ1 was precipitated with the Gβ antibody pre-coupled to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Elution from the resin was done with 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.0. After neutralization, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with the Gγ2 antibody. ADP-ribosylation of G-protein α Subunits—G-protein αo and βγ subunits were purified from bovine brain as described (16Neer E. Lok J. Wolf L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sternweis P. Robishaw J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the ADP-ribosylation, 4 nm Gαo, 6 nm Gβγ, and 100 ng of activated pertussis toxin were incubated in a 50-μl reaction in 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA-Na2, 0.05% Lubrol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Na2-HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 100 μm [32P]NAD (2.5 μCi), 100 mm ATP, and PhLPL (phosphorylated or control-treated) at concentrations of 10–1000 nm or PhLPS at concentrations of 300–1000 nm. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped on ice by adding SDS-Laemmli buffer and subsequent boiling, followed by separation on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Radiolabeled Gαo was then visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 or HEK 293-TSA cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and were kept in a 7% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Usually, cells were transfected by using the CaPO4 method (18Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) on 10-cm dishes at 70% confluence with a constant total amount of DNA. In assays with endogenous Gβγ, cells were transfected at 40% confluence, and measurements were performed 66 h after transfection. In the case of membrane current measurements in HEK 293 cells stably expressing GIRK1/4, transfections were performed with the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 0.2 μg of CD8 cDNA as transfection reporter system (19Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar), 0.2 μg of α2A-adrenergic receptor cDNA, and 0.6 μg of PhLPS cDNA or empty plasmid. Transfection efficiency was usually between 60 and 80% and was equal for the different PhLP isoforms as judged by transfection of different green fluorescent protein-tagged constructs. Control of protein expression by Western blotting was performed as described (12Humrich J. Bermel C. Grübel T. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4474-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Design and Use of siRNA for TCP-1α Knock-down—Two siRNAs directed against human TCP-1α were designed with the help of the MWG design tool (available on the World Wide Web at www.mwgbiotech.com) and the RNA sequence according to the Refseq human data base at NCBI (accession number NM_030752). The targeted sequences were 5′-GAA GUU GGA GAU GGA ACU ATT (positions 272–292) and 5′-GAA GUG GUA CAG GAG AGA ATT (positions 1067–1087). Both sequences were run on a Blast search and found to interact only with human TCP-1α. They were produced (MWG) as preannealed duplex RNAs (sense and antisense each ending with dTdT). For control experiments, siRNA directed against GFP was designed as described recently (5′-CGU AAA CGG CCA GUU CTT, positions 64–84 (20Lewis D.L. Hagstrom J.E. Loomis A.G. Wolff J.A. Herweijer H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar)). Transfection of HEK 293-TSA cells with the siRNAs was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed 42 h later. In pilot experiments, both specific anti-TCP-1α siRNAs (in concentrations between 40 and 80 pmol/transfection in a 12-well plate) were found to be effective in reducing the amount of TCP-1α by roughly 50–70% as determined by Western blots (data not shown). In all further experiments, they were subsequently used in combination (at 40 pmol/well each; for simplification named siTCP-1α). siRNA against GFG was used in parallel at a concentration of 80 pmol/well. Measurement of GIRK Channel Currents and Inositol Phosphate Generation—Membrane currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions, using conventional whole cell patch clamp techniques exactly as described recently (21Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IK was measured as an inward current using a holding potential of –90 mV, and voltage ramps (from –120 to +60 mV in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine current-voltage (I-V) relationships. All measurements were performed at room temperature, and summarized results are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was done to test for significance of differences. Inositol phosphate measurements were performed in triplicates and results were analyzed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Analysis of variance and post-test comparison (Bonferroni) were done as appropriate. RNA Preparation, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative PCR— For total RNA preparation, cells seeded on 6-well plates were lysed and treated according to the instructions of the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and after DNase digestion. RNA preparations were routinely controlled on a denaturing formaldehyde gel. One μg of total RNA of each sample was reverse-transcribed with the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase-Kit (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) to produce first strand cDNA. For PCR of the human Gβ1 cDNA, the primers were chosen to distinguish the cDNA product (95 bp) from a potentially contaminating genomic DNA product (324 bp): (a) 5′-CTTGCTGGGTACGACGACTT-3′ and (b)5′-AGCTGACGCGGTTGTCAT-3′. For PCR of the rat PhLP cDNA the primers were (a) 5′-ATGGAGCGGCTGATCAAAAAG and (b) 5′-CAAATTCTTGTCCATCATACC-3′, resulting in a 144-bp product. Real time PCR (in triplicates) was performed on an ABI PRISM Sequence Detection System 7700 (Applied Biosystems) with Sybr Green (Cambrex) as fluorescent, 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as reference dye and Hot-Taq (Eppendorf) as polymerase. A standard curve was generated with several dilution steps of the cDNA from control cells, and relative amounts of cDNAs were then calculated assuming a PCR efficiency of 100%. As controls, real time PCR of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin were performed and were not significantly different between groups. Effects of Phosphorylation of PhLPL by CK2 on Gβγ Binding—We have recently demonstrated that PhLPL is constitutively phosphorylated by CK2 and that this phosphorylation inhibited the effect of PhLP on Gβγ-mediated inositol phosphate generation in intact HEK 293 cells (12Humrich J. Bermel C. Grübel T. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4474-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The homologous protein phosducin is also phosphorylated at the N terminus by several different kinases, and these phosphorylations lead to a loss in affinity toward Gβγ subunits (11Savage J.R. McLaughlin J.N. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30399-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J.

We therefore tested whether CK2-mediated phosphorylation affected directly Gβγ-binding of PhLPL. Recombinant C-terminally His6-tagged PhLPL was purified from E. coli by Ni2+-NTA affinity purification and was phosphorylated with recombinant CK2. Completion of phosphorylation was monitored and controlled by a mobility shift of the Coomassie-stained PhLPL band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Equimolar concentrations (400 nm) of PhLPL, phosphorylated PhLPL, PhLPS-His6, or GST-His6 were incubated with lysates from HEK 293 cells overexpressing Gβγ subunits. The His6-tagged proteins were then precipitated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose, and the amounts of coprecipitated Gβγ subunits were monitored by Western blotting with a Gβ-specific antibody (Fig. 1A, lower panel). These experiments showed that Gβγ subunits were coprecipitated in a complex with PhLPL as well as with phosphorylated PhLPL, but there was no change in the amount of coprecipitated Gβγ after phosphorylation of PhLPL. In contrast, PhLPS bound to Gβγ only weakly. These findings were confirmed in the effects of PhLP on pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of G-protein αo subunits (Gαo). This ADP-ribosylation is stimulated by the presence of Gβγ subunits. As depicted in Fig. 1B, the Gβγ-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gαo was inhibited by PhLPL and by phospho-PhLPL to a similar extent, whereas the inhibition by PhLPS was only partial. IC50 values for PhLPL and PhLPS (18.7 ± 4.5 and 160 ± 44.6 nm, respectively) were within the previously published range (4Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but were not different between PhLPL and phospho-PhLPL (16.5 ± 5.2 nm). Therefore, a decrease in the Gβγ binding affinity of CK2-phosphorylated wild-type PhLPL did not seem to account for its reduced capacity to inhibit Gβγ-stimulated inositol phosphate generation in intact cells. Gβγ-binding by PhLPL Is Dependent on Trp-66 in Its N Terminus—To further analyze the Gβγ regulatory role of PhLPL in intact cells, we mapped the Gβγ-interacting sites. In the homologous retinal protein phosducin, the exchange of a tryptophan to a valine (Trp-29 to Val) within a conserved amino acid sequence of the N terminus leads to reduced Gβγ binding (7Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The resolution of the crystal structure of the phosducin·Gβγ complex shows that this conserved region forms the first α-helical region of phosducin and PhLPL (8Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In order to investigate the functional role of this homologous region in PhLPL, we mutated Trp-66 in PhLPL (which is analogous to Trp-29 in phosducin) to valine (PhLPLW66V). We further created a double mutant where, in addition to the Trp-66 to Val exchange, the CK2-dependent phosphorylation sites (Ser-18, Thr-19, and Ser-20) were replaced by alanines (PhLPLAV). To prove that the mutation of Trp-66 was sufficient to reduce binding of PhLPL to Gβγ subunits, we used a His6-tagged-Gγ2 cDNA (His6-Gγ2) and performed a co-precipitation experiment with HEK 293 cell lysates. For this experiment, we expressed all PhLP isoforms transiently in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1C) and separately expressed Gβ1 plus His6-Gγ2. We then lysed the cells with a detergent-containing buffer and incubated equal amounts of the Gβ1·His6-Gγ2-containing lysate with cell lysate containing each of the PhLP isoforms. Subsequently, Gβ1·His6-Gγ2 complexes were precipitated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Then the amount of co-precipitated PhLP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As depicted in Fig. 1C, there was strong binding of cellular PhLPL to the Gβ1·His6-Gγ2 complex, whereas either mutation at the Trp-66 site (as in PhLPLW66V and PhLPLAV) or the loss of the N terminus (as in PhLPS) led to a marked decrease in binding to the Gβ1·His6-Gγ2 complex. Thus, direct binding of PhLPL to Gβγ subunits was clearly dependent on Trp-66. In addition, Gβγ-stimulated inositol phosphate generation was not inhibited when Trp-66 was mutated (Fig. 1D). The PhLPL N Terminus and PhLPL Exhibit Similar Gβγ Regulatory Function in Cells—Because of the marked effect of the N-terminal W66V mutation, we hypothesized that the N terminus of PhLPL alone should be able to inhibit inositol phosphate generation to the same extent as the wild-type PhLPL. We constructed several N-terminally deleted mutants of PhLP (Fig. 2A) and tested their ability to inhibit Gβγ-mediated inositol phosphate generation (Fig. 2B). Expression of the diverse constructs was comparable (Fig. 2B, lower panel). We found that the N-terminal constructs (containing at least the first 83 amino acids of PhLPL) inhibited Gβγ-stimulated signaling to a similar extent as did the wild-type full-length PhLPL in intact cells (by about 40–50%). PhLPS and Phosphorylation-deficient PhLPL Down-regulate Gβγ Protein—Looking at the effect of PhLPS and of both phosphorylation-deficient mutants PhLPLA18–20 and PhLPLAV (Fig. 3A), we found that not only PhLPS but also the two mutants were able to inhibit the inositol phosphate signal more effectively than wild-type PhLPL. This was seen although direct binding of Gβγ to PhLPS and PhLPLAV (which bears the Trp-66 to Val mutation in addition to the A18–20 mutation) was less than that of wild-type PhLPL (Fig. 1C). We therefore concluded that a different type of regulation on Gβγ subunits must exist in cells, which is distinct from direct Gβγ binding. In line with this conclusion, the protein content of both G-protein subunits, Gβ and Gγ, were dramatically decreased in HEK 293 cells co-transfected with PhLPLA18–20, PhLPLAV, or PhLPS (Fig. 3B). As a control, the protein level of PLCβ2 was unchanged (Fig. 3B, lower panel). The decrease in the amount of Gγ2 by PhLPS was partially restored by a 4-h incubation with the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystine, suggesting the involvement of proteasomal degradation in the PhLPS-induced Gγ decrease (Fig. 3C). The Fate of Gβγ Subunits—To analyze whether the PhLPS-mediated decrease in Gβγ protein levels accounted for the apparent inhibition of Gβγ-mediated inositol phosphate signaling, we attempted to prevent Gβγ degradation by stabilization of Gβ and/or Gγ subunits. Recently, it was demonstrated that the Gγ2 subunit is a substrate for ubiquitinylation and degradation via the N-end rule pathway in bovine brain (27Hamilton M.H. Cook L.A. McRackan T.R. Schey K.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5081-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). That means that posttranslational modification of the N terminus leads to susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation. It was also demonstrated that mutation of the N terminus could protect the Gγ subunit from degradation. We therefore stabilized the Gβ and Gγ subunits by N-terminal fusion to the dye-labeling protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase, AGT (15Keppler A. Gendreizig S. Gronemeyer T. Pick H. Vogel H. Johnsson K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). These modifications did not prevent functional interaction with PLCβ2 (see below). In line with previous observations, this modification stabilized Gβ as well as Gγ subunits (27Hamilton M.H. Cook L.A. McRackan T.R. Schey K.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5081-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and prevented Gβ and Gγ from disappearance in the presence of PhLPS (Fig. 4A). However, expression of the AGT-stabilized N-terminal constructs of Gβ and Gγ either with the wild-type partner or in combination did not change the pattern of functional inhibition seen with PhLPS (Fig. 4B). These experiments also illustrate that the AGT-modified Gβ and Gγ subunits were functional, since their transfection increased the inositol phosphate generation, although less than the wild-type forms (compare control (ctr) to basal in each panel). Taken together, PhLPS led to down-regulation of Gβγ (most probably by the proteasome pathway and via the N-end rule) in cells. But Gβγ down-regulation did not seem to account for PhLPS-mediated inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated signaling in cells. To further analyze the mechanism of Gβγ dysfunction in the presence of PhLPS we analyzed the interaction of Gβ and Gγ by co-precipitation. In contrast to PhLPL, expression of PhLPS led to a strongly decreased interaction of Gβ with Gγ as determined by the failure of precipitated AGT-Gβ1 to co-precipitate AGT-Gγ2 in the presence of PhLPS (Fig. 4C). Since efficient interaction of Gβ and Gγ is indicative of the proper folding of the Gβ subunit (28Garcia-Higuera I. Gaitatzes C. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9041-9049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the lack of Gβ-Gγ interaction is suggestive of Gβ misfolding induced by PhLPS. Structural Determinants in PhLPS for Gβγ Down-regulation—We further analyzed the mechanism of PhLPS on Gβγ and therefore consecutively truncated the N terminus of PhLPS to investigate the structural requirements for the Gβγ-down-regulating effect of PhLPS in intact cells (Fig. 5A). The C-terminal constructs PhLP 119–301 and PhLP 132–301 were able to inhibit inositol phosphate generation to the same extent as was PhLPS (Fig. 5B). Further truncating the N terminus (PhLP 145–301) decreased Gβγ-regulating effects. We therefore concluded that the ability of PhLPS to regulate Gβγ was dependent on the function of α-helix 3 together with the C-terminal half of PhLP. Recently, it was reported that PhLPL can bind and inhibit the cytosolic chaperonin complex (CCT; a hexadacamer consisting of eight different subunits) via binding to one of its subunits named TCP-1α (14McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that PhLPL inhibited the folding of luciferase and the Gt-protein α subunits, but a role in Gβγ folding has not been addressed so far. To analyze whether TCP-1α does also interact with PhLPS, we performed co-immunoprecipitations of TCP-1α with PhLPS. Immunoprecipitation of PhLPS and the C-terminal constructs revealed that TCP-1α interacted with the same constructs that caused inositol phosphate inhibition (Fig. 5C) and Gβγ down-regulation (data not shown). In order to investigate whether TCP-1α plays a role in the folding of Gβγ, we performed additional knock-down experiments with the help of siRNA technology (for a review see Ref. 29Hannon J.G. Rossi J.J. Nature. 2004; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Fig. 5D shows a representative experiment where the specific knock-down of endogenous TCP-1α in HEK-TSA cells led to down-regulation of transfected Gγ2 subunits. Cells transfected with siRNA (siTCP-1α or, for control, siGFP) were unaffected in terms of expression of other transfected (PLCβ2) or endogenous proteins (β-actin). We therefore conclude that CCT inhibition either by PhLPS or by siRNA-induced protein reduction of the subunit TCP-1α had similar consequences on the levels of functional Gβγ-complexes in intact cells. Analysis of endogenous Gβ1 (Fig. 5E) showed that knock-down of TCP-1α reduced the expression not only of co-transfected but also of endogenous members of the Gβγ complex. Effects on Endogenous Gβγ Subunits—To show that the effect of PhLPS on Gβγ (suggested to occur by induction of Gβγ-misfolding) was also effective with endogenously expressed Gβγ, we investigated function and down-regulation of endogenous Gβ subunits in HEK 293 cells. In order to investigate potential effects of PhLPS on mRNA synthesis, total RNA was collected from HEK 293 cells, which were transfected and treated as for inositol phosphate determination. RNA was reverse-transcribed, and quantitative PCR of the human Gβ1 cDNA was performed. No differences in Gβ1 cDNA levels between control and PhLPS-transfected cells were detected (Fig. 6A), indicating that PhLPS did not exert an inhibition of Gβ mRNA synthesis. We then determined PLCβ2-mediated inositol phosphate generation in HEK 293 cells and found that PhLPS was effective in inhibiting inositol phosphate generation mediated by endogenously expressed Gβγ subunits (Fig. 6B). We measured the endogenous Gβ content by Western blotting and found that PhLPS decreased Gβ (Fig. 6C). To further analyze the functional role of PhLPS on Gβγ signaling, we measured α2A-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling. Experiments were performed in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel composed of subunits 1 and 4 (GIRK1/4). Basal and agonist-induced (1 μm norepinephrine) currents of GIRK channels have been shown to depend on Gβγ function (30Ito H. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 476: 55-68Google Scholar, 31Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31186-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both signals were significantly inhibited by PhLPS (Fig. 6D). This indicates that PhLPS effectively inhibits signals by endogenous Gβγ complexes stimulated by a G-protein-coupled receptor. In this work, we show that inhibition of Gβγ-mediated signaling by PhLP occurs through at least two different mechanisms: (a) through direct binding by a high affinity N-terminal Gβγ binding site (PhLPL; Figs. 1, 2, and 7) or (b) through inhibition of, most likely, Gβγ folding and subsequent down-regulation of Gβ and Gγ protein levels (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). The down-regulation (as a putative indicator of misfolded Gβγ) was a specific phenomenon seen with PhLPS and the phosphorylation-deficient mutants of PhLPL (bearing the A18–20 mutation). This finding would imply that regulation of PhLP (either by dephosphorylation of the constitutively phosphorylated PhLPL or by alternative splicing to produce PhLPS) can switch the Gβγ-regulatory function of PhLP from direct binding toward inhibition of Gβγ-folding (Fig. 7). We further show that the diminished protein levels of Gβ and Gγ were sensitive to modification of the N terminus. This finding is in agreement with a recent report that the Gγ subunit is subject to regulation by the proteasome via the N-end rule pathway (27Hamilton M.H. Cook L.A. McRackan T.R. Schey K.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5081-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In line with this, we observed a partial reversal of the down-regulation by PhLPS in intact cells by the proteasome-specific inhibitor lactacystine (Fig. 3C). We also show that endogenous Gβ was effectively down-regulated by PhLPS and that this resulted in inhibition of PLCβ and receptor-activated GIRK activity. Recently, it was reported that PhLPL selectively inhibited the function of CCT, which is involved in the folding of actin, tubulin, and Gα subunits but has been suggested to participate, more importantly, in folding of WD40 repeat proteins like the G-protein β subunit (33Valpuesta J.M. Martin-Benito J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, a role in Gβγ subunit folding remained to be elucidated (14McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the siRNA-induced gene silencing of the CCT subunit TCP-1α resulted in a reduction of both endogenous Gβ1 and co-transfected Gβγ subunits. Since Gβγ down-regulation was the prominent feature seen with PhLPS, this observation suggests that PhLPS-dependent Gβγ-down-regulation occurred via inhibition of TCP-1α-mediated Gβγ folding. To add further evidence to this contention, we show that the Gβγ-down-regulating domains of PhLPS and the TCP-1α-binding domains are identical (Fig. 5). Given the fact that PhLPL was constitutively phosphorylated by CK2 in HEK cells and diverse tissue types (12Humrich J. Bermel C. Grübel T. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4474-4481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and combined with the observation that phosphorylated PhLPL was not able to down-regulate Gβγ, inhibiting the function of CCT could be the crucial step in regulating Gβγ function, when PhLP is dephosphorylated or alternatively spliced. Thus, PhLP can inhibit Gβγ-mediated effects via two entirely different mechanisms: direct Gβγ binding and impairment of Gβγ folding. The switch between these two mechanisms is regulated either at the level of PhLP synthesis by alternative splicing or at the post-translational level by CK2-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Such a switch between two entirely different types of regulation is, to our knowledge, without precedent and illustrates that PhLP is a unique and complex regulator of G-protein-mediated signaling. G-protein αo and βγ subunits were kindly prepared from bovine brain by Christian Dees. AGT cDNA was a kind gift from Kai Johnsson (Lausanne)."
https://openalex.org/W2115962469,"We evaluated the expression of the FLK1, one of the lateral mesoderm early markers where cardiogenesis occurs, to characterize and isolate cardiac stem/progenitor cells from ES cells. Dissociated cells from embryoid bodies (EBs) on day 3, 4, or 5 were collected into two subpopulations with or without FLK1 expression and coculture on OP9 stromal cells was continued to examine whether contracting colonies came out or not. FLK1+ cells from EBs at days 3 and 4 formed spontaneous contracting colonies more efficiently than FLK1- cells on the same days, but not at day 5. Most contracting cardiac colonies derived from FLK1+cells mainly on day 4 were detected on endothelial cells along with hematopoietic cells. Further characterization of cells with these capabilities into three lineages revealed the FLK1+ CD31-VE-cadherin-phenotype. Our findings indicate that FLK1+cells, especially FLK1+ CD31-VE-cadherin-cells, could act as cardiohemangioblasts to form cardiac cells as well as endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells."

Modeling this effect by replacing the targeted guanine with an abasic site increased incorporation of HIF-1 and the bi-functional DNA repair enzyme and transcriptional coactivator, Ref-1/Ape1, into the transcriptional complex and engendered more robust reporter gene expression. Oxidants generated in the context of physiological signaling thus affect nuclear DNA integrity and may facilitate gene expression by optimizing DNA-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2165997597,"The aldose reductase pathway has been demonstrated to be a key component of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. Previously, we demonstrated that increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+, is an important change that drives the metabolic cascade mediating ischemic injury. This study investigated signaling mechanisms by which the aldose reductase pathway mediates myocardial ischemic injury. Specifically, the influence of the aldose reductase pathway flux on JAK-STAT signaling was examined in perfused hearts. Induction of global ischemia in rats resulted in JAK2 activation followed by STAT5 activation. Pharmacological inhibition of aldose reductase or sorbitol dehydrogenase blocked JAK2 and STAT5 activation and was associated with lower lactate/pyruvate ratio and lower protein kinase C activity. Niacin, known to lower cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio independent of the aldose reductase pathway inhibition, also blocked JAK2 and STAT5 activation. Inhibition of protein kinase C also blocked JAK2 and STAT5 activation. Transgenic mice overexpressing human aldose reductase exhibited increased JAK2 and STAT5 activation. Pharmacological inhibition of JAK2 reduced ischemic injury and improved functional recovery similar to that observed in aldose reductase pathway inhibited mice hearts. These data, for the first time, demonstrate JAK-STAT signaling by the aldose reductase pathway in ischemic hearts and is, in part, due to changes in cytosolic redox state."

Here we show that this sensing mechanism also applies to the oligomerization of protein complexes, as the glucosyltransferase appeared to be able to glucosylate folded complex subunits lacking the full complement of oligomer components.

Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This system is composed of four main elements, the ER resident lectins calnexin and calreticulin and the enzymes glucosidase II and UDPglucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT). About 80% of proteins entering the secretory pathway are N-glycosylated cotranslationally in the consensus sequence Asn-X-(Ser/Thr). The two outermost glucoses are removed from the transferred glycan (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) by the sequential action of glucosidase I and glucosidase II. The monoglucosylated species thus generated are then recognized by calnexin and/or calreticulin, which are lectins specific for Glc1Man5-9GlcNAc2 glycans (3Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein-lectin association not only retains in the ER the species that are not properly folded but also enhances folding efficiency by preventing the aggregation of intermediates and allowing the action of other folding-enhancing proteins such as ERp57, a protein disulfide isomerase associated with calnexin and calreticulin (4Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein-lectin interaction is eventually terminated upon glucosidase II cleavage of the remaining glucose. At this stage, glycoproteins that are properly folded proceed to their final destination. Folding intermediates or irreparably misfolded glycoproteins, however, are reglucosylated by GT, an enzyme that recreates the monoglucosylated structure, and are thus retained by the lectins in the ER. GT operates as a folding sensor, because it only glucosylates glycoproteins not displaying their native structures (5Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Protein determinants triggering GT-mediated glucosylation have been identified as patches of hydrophobic amino acids that are mainly solvent-exposed in molten globule-like conformations (6Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has been observed in vivo that only fully assembled oligomeric proteins leave the ER. The above mentioned glycoprotein folding quality control mechanism has been implicated in the retention of individual subunits or partially assembled oligomers, because those species have been isolated as being associated to calnexin/calreticulin from cells unable to form the complete oligomers (7Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For instance, the lectin-glycoprotein association of T cell receptor or human class I major histocompatibility complex components has been observed to last until the complete assembly of the multimeric complexes (9Gardner T.G.

Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The work reported here shows that GT is sensitive enough to sense hydrophobic patches exposed in interfaces of not yet assembled but otherwise native-like folded subunits and that the lectin subunit or lectin incomplete complex association is not necessarily determined by GT-mediated glucosylation of incompletely folded individual subunits. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The Superdex 200 column was acquired from Amersham Biosciences. Rat liver GT was purified as described (11Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soybean agglutinin (SBA) was purified from untoasted soybean meal by affinity chromatography on acid-treated Sepharose 6B (12Allen H.J. Johnson E.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 50: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Characterization of SBA—CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter. SBA concentration was 1.8 μm in far-UV and 18 μm in near-UV CD. Intrinsic fluorescence and 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding were measured with an Aminco Bowman series 2 spectrofluorometer with 18 μm SBA. We used 50 μm ANS with the excitation wavelength set at 370 nm, and spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm. All spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 40 mm HEPES and 20 mm KCl, pH 7.4 (buffer A) with the addition of 0.2 mm EDTA Protein Denaturation—To eliminate aggregates, SBA was further purified before use by size exclusion chromatography in a Superdex 200 eluted with buffer A at a flux rate of 0.5 ml/min. SBA (18 μm) was dissolved in the same buffer at the indicated urea concentrations with the addition of 0.2 mm EDTA. SBA concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using A1%, 1cm = 12.8 and expressed in terms of monomer (Mr = 30,000). Samples were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C to ensure the achievement of equilibrium. Fluorescence spectra were measured with the excitation wavelength set at 280 nm, and spectra were recorded from 300 to 430 nm. Excitation and emission band pass values were both 5 nm. The process was followed by assessing the fluorescence spectrum center of mass. Size Exclusion Chromatography—To verify the appearance of the monomer, size exclusion chromatography of SBA was performed at 25 °C in a Superdex 200 column with buffer A with the addition of 0.2 mm EDTA and containing the same urea concentration of the sample. The flow rate employed was 0.5 ml/min, and the eluted material was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm. Activity Assays—GT assays were carried out at 37 °C in 120 μl of buffer A with the addition of 5 mm CaCl2 and 15 μm UDP-glucose (300,000 cpm UDP-[14C]glucose). Reactions were started by dilution of SBA to a final concentration of 0.9 μm in the reaction buffer containing 4 μg of rat liver GT. To allow comparison between samples, urea was added to a 140 mm final concentration in all samples. Reactions were stopped after 4 min by the addition 30 μl of cracking buffer at 100 °C containing 5% SDS. Samples were immediately treated for 10 min in a heat block at 90 °C and concentrated to ∼40 μl in a SpeedVac. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A low energy phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) was exposed to the dried gel for 2 days and revealed in a Storm 820 Phosphor-Imager. Under these conditions, a linear relationship between density and radioactivity was obtained. For renaturation experiments, 25 μl of SBA (18 μm) in 2.5 m urea was diluted in 775 μl of 40 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm MnCl2 at 20 °C. Aliquots of 75 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times and diluted to assay GT activity in a 110-μl final volume as described above. Reactions lasted for 3 min at 20 °C. Renaturation was followed in parallel at the same temperature by following tryptophan fluorescence. In this experiment the excitation and emission wavelengths were 280 and 330 nm, with a band pass of 0.5 and 16 nm, respectively. Generation of Monomeric SBA—A suitable model to study the dependence of GT activity on the substrate quaternary structure requires a high mannose-type multimeric glycoprotein, the individual subunits of which preserve their tertiary structures upon oligomer disassembly. SBA, an oligomeric protein formed by four identical glycoprotein subunits, fulfills this condition. Chemical denaturation with urea followed by the fluorescence center of mass showed the presence of an intermediate at ∼2 m concentration (Fig. 1A) (13Ghosh M. Mandal D.K. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 29: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This result was further confirmed by following ANS fluorescence (Fig. 1B). This compound is a probe sensitive to the presence of exposed hydrophobic patches. The ANS fluorescence spectrum had an increased intensity and was shifted to shorter wavelengths at 2 m urea, indicating exposition of a wider hydrophobic surface as compared with the initial state (Fig. 1C). Analysis by size exclusion chromatography confirmed the appearance of a smaller protein with a molecular weight corresponding to that of the monomer (Fig. 1D). SBA has six tryptophan residues, two of them (Trp-8 and Trp-203) located in the interface between subunits (Fig. 2A). The red shift of the protein fluorescence reflects exposition of those particular residues following the tetramer disassembly. Upon this process, SBA exposes an additional 1325 Å2 of accessible surface area per monomer, of which 873 Å2 correspond to a hydrophobic surface (Fig. 2, B and C) (14Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr., M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Exposition of this surface during the first transition (tetramer to monomer) explains the increased ANS binding. The far-UV CD spectrum remained fairly constant along the first transition (Fig. 3A), thus indicating that the individual subunits preserved the antiparallel β-sheet conformation they displayed in the tetramer. On the other hand, only a minor change was observed in the near-UV CD (Fig. 3B). At this wavelength, CD analysis mainly reflects variations in the asymmetry of the environments of the tryptophan residues located on the interfaces between subunits. Drastic changes in both far- and near-UV CD spectra were observed at urea concentrations higher than 3.5 m, thus reflecting the unfolding of the monomer, the second transition (Fig. 3, A and B). In summary, SBA dissociates at low urea concentrations into monomers that expose the hydrophobic interfaces hidden between subunits but that otherwise preserve the secondary and tertiary structures displayed in the tetramers.Fig. 2SBA structure.

Urea-treated SBA samples were diluted, and GT activity was determined. Incubation times were much shorter than those required for tetramer assembly completion (see below). The catalytic activity was constant up to 0.5 m urea and then increased linearly with urea concentration (Fig. 4A). This behavior paralleled changes in tryptophan and ANS fluorescence (Fig. 4B). Moreover, a linear correlation of GT activity with tryptophan and ANS fluorescence was observed (correlation coefficients of 0.977 and 0.985 respectively; data not shown). These results show that GT activity followed the disassembly of the tetramer. As mentioned above, in monomeric glycoproteins GT recognizes exposed hydrophobic residues. This process is more efficient for advanced folding intermediates such as molten globules, where the exposed hydrophobic residues form patches (6Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because the secondary and tertiary structures of the monomer were preserved during SBA disassembly, the observed increase in GT activity was a consequence of the exposition of the hydrophobic interface between subunits. To study how the assembly process of an oligomer in the ER affected recognition by GT, we measured the activity after dilution of monomeric SBA in a reconstituting buffer. GT activity diminished exponentially with time (Fig. 5A). This behavior mirrored the changes in tryptophan fluorescence, indicating that the loss of GT activity was coupled to SBA assembly (Fig. 5B). Again, changes in enzymatic activity appeared to be a consequence of the reduction in the exposed hydrophobic surface upon the transition of monomers to tetramer. It may be argued that GT glucosylation could be triggered not by exposure of the hydrophobic interface between subunits but by slight modifications of the subunit tertiary structures, not detected by CD spectra, that are caused by the presence of urea in the dissociation buffer. This possibility, however, seems highly unlikely because the bottleneck in tetramer formation is not the refolding of subunits but oligomer assembly. Thus, it has been determined that the transition of a fully denatured monomer into a folded monomer takes less than 10 s, whereas the oligomerization process is completed only after ∼15 min (15Chatterjee M. Mandal D.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12217-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It would be expected, therefore, that upon diluting SBA in reconstitution buffer the minimal imperfections in the subunit tertiary structure would disappear within a time period not significantly influencing GT activity. The synthesis of oligomeric proteins poses additional problems to the cell compared with their monomeric partners. The relative concentration of each subunit may be regulated according to the stoichiometry of the protein complex. However, these regulatory mechanisms would be ineffective in a deficient assembly process. Moreover, the presence of a protein subunit free from its parent complex can have serious consequences, because the exposure of the surface normally hidden in the oligomer may trigger an aggregation process (16Jones S. Manning J. Kad N.M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For instance, patients on long-term hemodialysis can develop amyloidosis generated by β2-microglobulin free from a class I major histocompatibility complex heavy chain (17Gorevic P.D. Munoz P.C. Casey T.T. DiRaimondo C.R. Stone W.J. Prelli F.C. Rodrigues M.M. Poulik M.D. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7908-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein quality control system could have evolved, among other reasons, to avoid these situations. If the definitive tertiary structure of the subunits is acquired upon oligomer assembly, individual subunits are expected to be glucosylated by GT until they form the final complex, as GT appeared to be able to glucosylate glycoprotein monomers displaying structures minimally differing from native ones (18Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. de Prat Gay G. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46280-46285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The work presented here suggests that, on the other hand, if the tertiary structure is attained before assembly, GT will recognize the subunit interface of the partially assembled species. As a result of a remarkable cellular economy when establishing quality control devices, in both scenarios an identical mechanism will retain intermediate species in the ER until folding and/or assembly processes are completed.

https://openalex.org/W1978615608,"The heterotrimeric G protein G12 has been implicated in such cellular regulatory processes as cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell-cell adhesion, and oncogenic transformation. Although the activated α-subunit of G12 has been shown to interact directly with a number of protein effectors, the roles of many of these protein-protein interactions in G12-mediated cell physiology are poorly understood. To begin dissecting the specific cellular pathways engaged upon G12 activation, we produced a series of substitution mutants in the regions of Gα12 predicted to play a role in effector binding. Here we report the identification and characterization of an altered form of Gα12 that is functionally uncoupled from signaling through the monomeric G protein Rho, a protein known to propagate several Gα12-mediated signals. This mutant of Gα12 fails to bind the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors p115RhoGEF and LARG (leukemia-associated RhoGEF), fails to stimulate Rho-dependent transcriptional activation, and fails to trigger activation of RhoA and the Rho-mediated cellular responses of cell rounding and c-jun N-terminal kinase activation. Importantly, this mutant of Gα12 retains coupling to the effector protein E-cadherin, as evidenced by its ability both to bind E-cadherin in vitro and to disrupt E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, this mutant retains the ability to trigger β-catenin release from the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin. This identification of a variant of Gα12 that is selectively uncoupled from one signaling pathway while retaining signaling capacity through a separate pathway will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms through which G12 proteins mediate diverse biological responses."
https://openalex.org/W2135258485,"Beta2-integrins are a family of dimeric adhesion molecules expressed on leukocytes. Their capacity to bind ligand is regulated by their state of activation. CD11b, an alphaMbeta2 integrin, is implicated in a number of physiological and pathological events such as inflammation, thrombosis, or atherosclerosis. The GTPase Rap1 is essential for its activation and could therefore play a strategic role in the regulation of leukocyte functioning. Because low levels of circulating TGF-beta have been linked with severe atherosclerosis, we have assessed the role of this cytokine in the regulation of Rap1 and CD11b activation in differentiated U937 cells and in human peripheral blood monocytes. TGF-beta1 caused a significant reduction in the expression of CD11b but not in the expression of other integrins tested. More importantly, TGF-beta1 greatly reduced the capacity of PMA or chemokines to activate CD11b and Rap1, a phenomenon paralleled by a loss of the Epac transcript and a reduction in 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-mediated activation of Rap1. This inhibition diminished the capacity of monocytes to migrate across a monolayer of endothelial cells. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on Rap1 activity may exert a general protective influence against aberrant transendothelial migration, thereby holding inflammatory responses in check."

With 2-aminobenzoyl-GGFLRKHGQ-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine as substrate, ATP and triphosphate increase the reaction rate of the wild type enzyme some 50–80-fold.

The mechanisms leading to the accumulation of Aβ in late onset AD is currently unknown but could be a result of either overproduction of the peptide or decreased clearance. In the case of autosomal dominant AD, it is clear that the early onset of the disease is linked to increased Aβ production and results from mutations in one of several genes: APP, PS1 (presenilin 1), or PS2 (presenilin 2) (1St. George-Hyslop P.H.

Those that have received the most attention and are supported by in vivo studies in peptidase-deficient mice include neprilysin (16Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E.

However, to date this analysis has not been refined to the point where the linkage to IDE can be unequivocally established. IDE (EC 3.4.24.56) is an ∼110-kDa zinc metallopeptidase containing an inverted form of the signature active site sequence (HXXEH) and is thus known as an inverzincin. The enzyme is primarily cytosolic, although a fraction of the enzyme is peroxisomal due to the presence of a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (26Duckworth W.C. Bennett R.G. Hamel F.G. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 608-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). IDE has also been reported as being located on the cell surface and secreted (27Seta K.A. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Primary neuronal cultures derived from these rats secrete increased levels of Aβ peptides; however, the steady-state level of brain Aβ in these animals is unaffected, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. The specificity of IDE is complex. The enzyme cleaves a variety of peptides primarily, but not exclusively, at basic or bulky hydrophobic residues (31Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar, 32Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Kurochkin (33Kurochkin I.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) has suggested that IDE cleaves peptides that have a propensity to form β-pleated sheet structures. Cleavage of Aβ by IDE results in the loss of the neurotoxic effects of the peptide and prevents the deposition of Aβ onto a synthetic amyloid deposit (34Mukherjee A. Song E.S. Kihiko M. Goodman Jr., J.P. Pyrek J.S. Estus S. Hersh L.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8745-8749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that IDE exhibits allosteric properties being activated by peptide substrates. Interestingly, peptides activated IDE toward Aβ peptide cleavage but not toward insulin cleavage (35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We further established that IDE exists as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and tetramers. During the course of our studies on the allosteric properties of IDE, we generated a number of active site mutants as control enzymes. We noted that although the activity of these mutants was significantly reduced, the residual catalytic properties were altered. We report here the results of these studies. Synthesis of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQEDDnp was as previously described (36Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Dynorphin A-9, dynorphin A-10, dynorphin A-17, dynorphin B-9, and insulin were obtained from Bachem. Amyloid β peptide 1–40 was a product of California Research Peptide Inc. β-endorphin was obtained from Multiple Peptide Systems through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Tools program. All other reagents were obtained as the best grade available commercially. Activity Assays—IDE activity was routinely measured with the fluorogenic peptide Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp. The increase in fluorescence that occurred upon cleavage of the peptide between residues R and K (36Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was followed on a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 318 nm and an emission wavelength of 419 nm. The IDE-dependent hydrolysis of insulin, β-endorphin, amyloid β-peptide 1–40, and dynorphin peptides was followed by reverse phase HPLC using a C4 column and a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% water, 5% acetonitrile to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% water, 50% acetonitrile. Peptides were followed by their absorbance at 214 nm and quantified from their peak area. Preparation and Purification of IDE Mutants—The various His112 and Glu111 rat IDE mutants were prepared in pFast Bac HTb using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. (It should be noted that a methionine located 42 residues downstream of methionine 1 of the IDE cDNA appears to represent the major translational start site (37Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, His112 would actually be His70, and Glu111 would be Glu69.

Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar), IDE is predicted to have a helical region from residues 107 to 116, which encompasses the mutated residues. None of the mutations were predicted to affect the ability of this region to form a helix. Recombinant IDE and the various mutants were expressed in Sf-9 cells as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag followed by a linker containing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Wild type and IDE mutants were purified on a His-Select HC nickel affinity gel column (Sigma). In most experiments, the enzyme was used as the His6-IDE; however, to verify the lack of an effect of the N-terminal hexahistidine and linker, tobacco etch virus protease was used to remove this region as previously described (35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 4.0 ± 0.1 °C in a Beckman XL-A centrifuge using an AN 60 Ti rotor. Scans were obtained at 280 nm with a step size of 0.001 cm. The approach to equilibrium was considered to be complete when scans made 6 h apart were indistinguishable. Typically, equilibration times equal to or greater than 20 h met this criterion. Five scans were averaged for each sample at each rotor speed. Previous results (3Levy-Lahad E. Wasco W. Poorkaj P. Romano D.M. Oshima J. Pettingell W.H. Yu C. Jondro P.D. Schmidt S.D. Wang K. Crowley A.C. Fu Y.H. Guenette S.Y. Galas D. Nemens E. Science. 1995; 269: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar) indicated that IDE self-associates in a monomer-dimer-tetramer pattern. Sedimentation equilibrium data were therefore analyzed according to Equation 1, A(r)=αm,0exp(σm(r2−ro2))+αd,0exp(2σm(r2−ro2))+αt,0exp(4σm(r2−ro2))+ε(Eq. 1) where A(r) is the absorbance at radial position r, and αm,0, αd,0, and αt,0 are the absorbances of monomer, dimer, and tetramer, respectively, at the reference radius (ro). The parameter σm is the reduced molecular weight of the monomer (σm = Mm(1– v̄ρ)ω2/(2RT)); Mm is the monomer molecular weight; v̄ is partial specific volume; ρ is the solvent density, ω is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ϵ is the base-line offset. Solvent density was measured using a Mettler density meter. The partial specific volume of IDE was calculated from its amino acid composition using the method of Cohn and Edsall (40Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). Data sets obtained for samples run at three different rotor speeds were fit simultaneously to Equation 1 using the global fitting method first described by Johnson and co-workers (41Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). IDE is a zinc metallopeptidase of the inverzincin family containing the signature active site sequence H108XXEH. The two histidines, in conjunction with a downstream glutamate (Glu189) are believed to act as ligands for the active site zinc (37Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with other zincins, glutamate 111 is believed to be directly involved in catalysis, most probably acting as a general base to facilitate removal of a proton from a water molecule as it attacks the scissile bond. The effect of mutating the active site glutamate and histidine has been reported to produce an inactive enzyme (37Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we noted varying extents of inactivation when mutating similar residues in the related zinc metallopeptidase puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (43Thompson M.W. Govindaswami M. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we quantitated the effect of mutating His112 and Glu111 of IDE. Two mutants of His112, H112Q and H112D, were generated as well as four mutants of Glu111: E111V, E111L, E111A, and E111F. We initially compared the kinetics of the various His112 and Glu111 mutants using the fluorogenic substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp. Although native IDE clearly displayed a sigmoidal substrate binding curve (Fig. 1), both of the His112 mutants and all four of the Glu111 mutants displayed classical hyperbolic substrate binding curves as illustrated for the E111F mutant in Fig. 1. Table II summarizes the kinetic parameters for each of the mutants. Both of the His112 mutants exhibited a 3–5-fold increase in Km, with kcat decreased close to 7,000-fold for the H112D mutant but less than 100-fold for the H112Q mutant. Mutation of the active site glutamate to valine, leucine, alanine, or phenylalanine produced enzyme forms in which the effects on Km were variable from essentially no change for the E111L and E111F mutants to a greater than 7-fold increase for the E111A mutant. The range of kcat values for the Glu111 mutants varied from a decrease of ∼9,000-fold (E111A) to a decrease of ∼68,000-fold (E111L).Table IIKinetic properties of IDE mutants with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrateMutant IDEKm or K0.5kcatHill coefficientμms-1Wild type28.7 ± 3.0162,580 ± 90362.26 ± 0.2H112Q158.2 ± 37.81,953 ± 330.01.10 ± 0.17H112D83.2 ± 2.923.7 ± 0.51.00 ± 0.03E111V15.6 ± 1.92.4 ± 0.10.72 ± 0.11E111L14.0 ± 0.86.5 ± 0.10.97 ± 0.07E111A204.0 ± 30.817.5 ± 2.00.89 ± 0.08E111F27.4 ± 2.911.4 ± 4.80.75 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab We also examined the effect of the Glu111 and His112 mutations on the hydrolysis of three physiological peptide substrates for IDE, insulin, β-endorphin, and amyloid β peptide 1–40. As shown in Table III, under saturating substrate conditions, β-endorphin and amyloid β peptide 1–40 hydrolysis was decreased ∼107-fold for the Glu111 mutants and ∼106-fold for the His112 mutants. With insulin as substrate, no hydrolysis could be detected with the Glu111 mutants under conditions in which a decrease of ∼107-fold could have been detected, whereas with the His112 mutants, insulin hydrolysis was decreased 3 × 106-fold (H112Q) to 107-fold (H112D).Table IIIRates of hydrolysis of physiological peptides by IDE mutantsMutant IDEβ-EndorphinAβ 1-40Insulinpmol/min/ngWild type315,000420,000594,000H112Q0.3350.2920.183H112D0.2630.1910.052E111V0.0490.074NDaND, not detectable.E111L0.0600.022NDE111A0.0250.105NDE111F0.0270.032NDa ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab IDE has been found to contain a cationic regulatory site distinct from the active site, which binds nucleotide triphosphates primarily through the triphosphate moiety (44Song E.S.

The binding of a polyanion at this site increases the rate with small peptides as substrates, but not with the larger physiological substrates insulin or amyloid β peptide. Since the active site histidine and glutamate mutations caused a loss of allosteric interactions, we tested whether the mutant enzymes could still be activated by ATP and triphosphate. As shown in Table IV, using Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp or dynorphin B-9 as substrate, the Glu111 mutants were activated by ATP to a much lesser extent compared with the wild type enzyme. A similar effect was observed with triphosphate as the activator.Table IVEffect of ATP and PPPi on mutant IDE activityRelative activityIDE formAbz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnpDynorphin B-9ATPPPPiATPPPPiWild type79.654.0aMeasured at 1 and 2.5 mm PPPi as inhibition occurred at 5 and 10 mm.2929H112Q0.20bMeasured at 10 mm ATP and PPPi as inhibition was observed at all concentrations.0.007bMeasured at 10 mm ATP and PPPi as inhibition was observed at all concentrations.0.420.41H112D0.890.210.840.27E111A2.531.452.36.2E111L1.071.152.82.1E111F2.811.75aMeasured at 1 and 2.5 mm PPPi as inhibition occurred at 5 and 10 mm.3.01.9E111V0.940.671.73.5a Measured at 1 and 2.5 mm PPPi as inhibition occurred at 5 and 10 mm.b Measured at 10 mm ATP and PPPi as inhibition was observed at all concentrations. Open table in a new tab The His112 mutants were affected differently by ATP and triphosphate, which acted as inhibitors rather than activators. With the H112Q mutant, triphosphate was an effective inhibitor of Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp hydrolysis at micromolar concentrations ( KiPPPi=2.3 μm; KiATP=2.2 μm), whereas activation of the wild type enzyme required millimolar concentrations ( KAPPPi=1.7 mm, KAATP=1.0 mm); this is illustrated in Fig. 2. We used sedimentation equilibrium to determine what if any effect the active site mutations had on IDE oligomerization (Fig. 3). We previously reported that in Tris buffer, the wild type enzyme appeared predominantly as a mixture of monomers and dimers (44Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Fried M.G. Wagner S.L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54216-54220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The monomer was the predominant species. The addition of 4 mm triphosphate maintained the monomer as the dominant species but eliminated the small amount of dimers (44Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Fried M.G. Wagner S.L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54216-54220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the H112Q mutant appeared monomeric with a trace of a higher aggregate, possibly the tetramer, present. The addition of PPPi decreased solubility but did not significantly change the distribution of oligomeric species. In contrast, the H112D mutant appeared less soluble but showed predominantly tetramers. The addition of PPPi decreased solubility but clearly showed the presence of primarily monomers with higher aggregates present. E111A, E111F, and E111L all appeared as monomers with a trace of tetramer present. E111V exhibited poor solubility and could not be analyzed. The addition of PPPi to E111L and E111A had no effect on the distribution of species but induced some aggregation with E111A and complete aggregation of E111F. Thus, there is no clear correlation between oligomeric state and enzyme activity. Perlman et al. (42Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that His112 is a zinc-coordinating residue and provided evidence that the active site zinc was lost in the H112Q mutant. We reexamined this issue with both the H112Q and H112D mutants. To accomplish this we looked at the ability of EDTA and o-phenanthroline to inhibit the residual activity of these mutants. As shown in Table V, inclusion of 0.1 mm EDTA or 0.1 mm o-phenanthroline in the assay had little effect on the activity of wild type IDE. Similarly, 0.1 mm EDTA or 0.1 mm o-phenanthroline had no effect on the rate of insulin hydrolysis by the glutamate mutants (data not shown). In contrast, both metal-chelating agents completely inhibited the activity of the histidine mutants as shown in Table V. Although not shown, significant inhibition of the wild type enzyme and glutamate mutants was observed with higher concentrations of EDTA (1 mm) and o-phenanthroline (1 mm). Thus, the His112 mutants appear to retain active site zinc, but this zinc is bound more weakly. We thus looked at the ability of zinc to increase the reaction rate of the His mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of zinc over the concentration range of 0.1–10 μm caused a maximal ∼1.8-fold increase in the activity of the H112Q mutant and a ∼1.2-fold increase in the activity of the H112D mutant. This was followed by inhibition at higher zinc concentrations. In contrast, zinc, at all concentrations tested, was slightly inhibitory of the wild type activity.Table VEffect of metal chelators on mutant IDE activityIDE formPercentage of activity remainingEDTAo-phenanthroline%%Wild type90.8 (123)73.2 (142)H112Q<0.2 (<1)<0.1 (16)H112D<2.5 (50)<2.5 (60) Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether the mutations introduced into IDE affected enzyme specificity, we looked at the cleavage pattern of three physiological peptides, β-endorphin, insulin, and amyloid β peptide 1–40 using each of the mutants listed in Table II. With insulin and amyloid β peptide 1–40 as substrate, we observed the same initial cleavage products with the various mutants and wild type enzyme. This is illustrated for insulin cleavage by the E111F mutant in Fig. 5. As previously noted (32Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), native IDE cleaved β-endorphin at the Thr17-Leu18 and Leu18-Phe19 bonds, and the two histidine mutants produced the same cleavage pattern. However, each of the glutamate 111 mutants produced, in addition to cleavage at Leu17-Phe18 and Phe18-Lys19, cleavage at Lys19-Asn20 and at Met5-Thr6. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 for the E111F mutant. Based on this result, we also compared the cleavage of small dynorphin-related peptides by native IDE and by the E111V mutant. We found that with dynorphin A-9, dynorphin A-10, dynorphin A-17, and dynorphin B-9, there was no change in cleavage site. Mutation of residues within the active site motif (HEXXHor HXXEH) of zinc metallopeptidases has been reported to lead to a loss of catalytic activity. However, in most cases, the presence of residual activity has not been quantified, generally because of the lack of availability of large amounts of mutant protein. In most cases, the active site glutamate has been mutated (45Devault A. Nault C. Zollinger M. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site glutamate (Glu111) and the active site histidine (His112) of IDE have previously been mutated (37Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The His112 mutant transiently expressed in COS cells appeared to be inactive as measured in crude extracts with insulin as substrate. However, this mutant retained the ability to bind insulin as determined by cross-linking studies (37Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that insulin cross-linking was actually increased with the mutant relative to the wild type enzyme and was attributed to a “relaxation of a rigid conformation stabilized by zinc.” Evidence for this increased flexibility at the active site came from the demonstration that treatment of the native enzyme with o-phenanthroline increased the extent of cross-linking; however, o-phenanthroline did not increase cross-linking with the H112Q mutant. Using radioactive zinc, it was concluded that the H112Q mutant did not bind zinc. Our finding that the residual activity of the two His112 mutants, but not the Glu111 mutants, can be further reduced by treatment with metal chelators indicates that these mutants do contain zinc but that the zinc is bound considerably more weakly than with the native protein. Thus, our results with both the His112 and Glu111 mutants support and extend the general conclusions of Perlman and Rosner (37Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that mutation of the active site histidine causes a change in the conformation about the active site of IDE. The results presented here suggest that this is not due to the loss of zinc binding but probably due to local conformational changes that occur within the active site. A rather surprising finding is that mutation of either the catalytic glutamate or the zinc coordinating histidine converts the substrate-velocity curves from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. Thus, the homotropic allosteric activation previously reported by us (35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is absent in the mutants. Since it has been established that IDE can exist in an oligomeric state (32Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1986; 36: 675-683Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), one possible explanation is that the active site of IDE is at the interface of two subunits and that mutation of the active site residues produces a local conformational change that affects subunit interaction. This does not appear to be the case, since both we (35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Perlman et al. (42Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that formation of oligomers containing active and inactive subunits does not abrogate activity. However, such a mixed oligomer does eliminate allosteric activation (35Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, the data is probably explained by the proposal that the active site mutations produce a local conformational change that is transmitted to the adjacent subunit. Although the end result is the same, it appears that there are differences in the local conformational changes produced by mutating the catalytic glutamate and mutating the zinc-coordinating histidine. This is most evident from the observation that the cleavage profile for β-endorphin is altered in the glutamate mutants but not the histidine mutants. In addition to the active site mutations affecting the kinetics of substrate binding, these mutations also desensitized the enzyme to activation by triphosphates in the form of ATP or triphosphate itself. The large increase in activity seen with the native enzyme was significantly reduced to either no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity with the glutamate mutants. Even more amazing was the effect seen with the active site histidine mutants, particularly H112Q. In this case, triphosphate changed from an activator to a rather potent inhibitor. This clearly indicates that the active site of these mutants is conformationally different from the wild type enzyme and is further modulated by additional conformational changes produced by the binding of the triphosphate moiety. The sedimentation equilibrium data show that, with the exception of the H112D mutant, both the native enzyme and the mutants are predominantly monomeric. Triphosphate does not affect the qualitative oligomerization mechanism of the soluble enzyme, but it increased the tendency to form insoluble aggregates in the case of the E111A and E111F mutants. Such aggregation may reflect a conformational change due to triphosphate binding. Thus, there is no obvious correlation between oligomeric state and activity, and the finding of a monomeric native enzyme is not consistent with its allosteric properties. On the other hand, gel filtration shows the native enzyme existing as dimers and tetramers, and at higher protein concentrations dynamic light scattering shows exclusively tetramers. Thus, it is clear that IDE can exist in a number of different oligomerization states. We would suggest that the allosteric kinetics observed can result from substrate induced oligomerization. In the case of mutant IDE, perhaps an altered local conformational change at the active site is transmitted through the protein such that it prevents the formation of oligomers.

https://openalex.org/W2102052199,"The transport of arginine has been characterized in human airway Calu-3 cells. As assessed with RT-PCR, Calu-3 cells express the genes for several transporters, such as the system y+-related SLC7A1, SLC7A2, and SLC7A4; the system y+L-related SLC7A6, SLC7A7, and SLC3A2; and the system B0,+-related SLC6A14. In polarized Calu-3 cell monolayers, apical arginine influx has a leucine-sensitive, sodium-dependent component and a leucine- and lysine-resistant sodium-independent fraction. At the basolateral membrane, arginine transport was fully sodium-independent and partially inhibited by leucine provided that sodium was present in the extracellular medium. Moreover, extracellular leucine trans-stimulated arginine efflux from the basolateral membrane in the presence, but not in the absence, of sodium. The transepithelial, apical to basolateral, arginine transport strictly depended on the presence of sodium and was markedly inhibited by apical leucine, but significantly trans-stimulated by the neutral amino acid added at the basolateral side. When added at the apical side, the NOS-inhibitors NMMA and NIL, CAA analogs with a free carboxyl group, markedly inhibited the apical arginine influx and the transepithelial flux of the cationic amino acid. The same compounds trans-stimulated basolateral arginine efflux. None of these effects were observed in the presence of the methyl ester analog NAME. The basolateral medium of Calu-3 cell monolayers, obtained after incubation in the presence of the three inhibitors at the apical side, inhibited the production of NO by activated murine macrophages. The inhibitory effect of the Calu-3 cell conditioned medium was time-dependent and markedly higher with NMMA and NIL than with NAME. Moreover, the NOS-inhibitory effect of the medium was significantly enhanced if NMMA and NIL, at the apical side, and basolateral leucine were simultaneously present during the conditioning procedure. These results indicate that 1) human airway epithelial cells express a functional system y+L at the basolateral membrane; 2) in this model, transepithelial arginine transport involves apical influx through system B0,+ and basolateral efflux through system y+L, and 3) the same transporters also perform an efficient transepithelial transport of amino acid-like NOS inhibitors."

Mutations associated with two human skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, disturb COMP secretion leading to intracellular accumulation of mutant COMP, especially in chondrocytes. Here we show that the manifestation of this secretory defect is dramatically influenced by the signal peptide that targets COMP for secretion. The comparison of wild type and mutant COMP secretion directed by the COMP or BM40 signal peptide in HEK-293 cells and rat chondrosarcoma cells revealed that the BM40 signal peptide substantially enhances secretion of mutant COMP that accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum-like structures when targeted by its own signal peptide.

Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the complete biological role of COMP remains to be elucidated, several specific domain functions have been identified. The amino-terminal domain is the site of pentamerization forming an α-helical coiled-coil structure stabilized by disulfide bonds (2Morgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol.

Vitamin D3 and retinoic acid have been shown to bind within the central hydrophobic pore of this structure in vitro, suggesting a role for COMP as a storage and delivery protein for these molecules that are important in bone development and metabolism (8Guo Y.

Little is known regarding the function of the epidermal growth factor-like repeats, although it is thought that they are involved in calcium binding as is the case for the type III repeats. The globular COOH-terminal domain has been shown to interact with the fibrillar collagen types I and II and the FACIT collagen type IX in the presence of divalent cations (10Rosenberg K. Olsson H.

These findings suggest a role for COMP in the assembly of the extracellular matrix, an implication that is bolstered by the fact that COMP synthesis appears to be up-regulated by joint movement in the developing embryo and upon joint loading in tendon and also that proteolytic fragments of COMP are released into joint synovial fluid upon joint degeneration (13Lohmander L.S.

Ultrastructural analysis of patient tissues has revealed massive accumulation of COMP within distended rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) of chondrocytes and, to a lesser extent, in other COMP-producing cells (19Maddox B.K.

Other matrix proteins known to interact with COMP including collagen types IX, XI, and XII, fibromodulin, and decorin have been co-localized with COMP to enlarged chondrocyte rER in patient tissues as well (25Vranka J.

These observations have led to speculation that extracellular deficiency of COMP and potentially of COMP-interacting proteins is responsible for the cartilage disease associated with COMP mutations. There is also evidence that chondrocytes undergo premature death by apoptosis in PSACH, presumably because of the adverse effects of the intracellular accumulations (26Duke J. Montufar-Solis D. Underwood S. Lalani Z. Hecht J.T. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Dinser R. Zaucke F. Kreppel F. Hultenby K. Kochanek S. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although much controversy remains over which of these potential mechanisms is most relevant to the molecular pathogenesis of PSACH and MED, there is little doubt that they reflect an underlying disturbance of COMP secretion in cells that synthesize COMP, especially chondrocytes. Investigation of defective COMP secretion in chondrocytes has been hampered by the limited availability of relevant patient and control human tissues, the lack of an informative animal model for PSACH or MED, and the tendency of chondrocytes to dedifferentiate in culture. Most efforts to delineate the disturbance have involved the expression of COMP as a recombinant protein in cultured cells. In many instances, the BM40 signal peptide derived from osteonectin has been used in place of the native COMP signal peptide to direct nascent COMP chains into the secretory pathway (12Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol.

This expression strategy has gained popularity and is widely used because of its high yield of recombinant protein (29Mayer U. Nischt R. Poschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 30Mayer U. Poschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, we have uncovered evidence that this substitution of the signal peptide may mask the secretory disturbance caused by PSACH and MED mutations. The signal peptide, a short stretch of ∼12–30 amino acids, is found at the amino terminus of all of the proteins destined for secretion from the cell (31Walter P. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1984; 38: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Its primary function has long been considered to be to target proteins to the ER and subsequently into the secretory pathway. This targeting results from a cascade of molecular interactions initiated by the emergence of the signal peptide from the translocating ribosome. Summarily, the signal peptide is recognized and bound by the cytosolic signal recognition particle, which in turn binds its receptor at the ER membrane, thus bringing the translating ribosome into contact with the translocon and facilitating insertion of the nascent chain into the translocon channel for passage through the lipid bilayer and into the lumen of the ER (32Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Although signal peptides all carry out this function, an analysis of their primary structures reveals little or no sequence homology and a remarkable diversity with regards to length, hydrophobicity, and net charge (33von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). However, a common feature of signal peptides is a tripartite domain structure composed of a highly diverse NH2-terminal region, a central region of 7–15 hydrophobic residues, and a short stretch of 2–9 small polar residues wherein lies the motif for cleavage by signal peptidase (34Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Since the initial discovery of the primary function of the signal peptide, several independent studies have uncovered further complexities of the translocation process and roles for the signal peptide (35Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 36Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, sequences in the protein domain being translocated can alter the efficiency of translocation by affecting various signal-receptor interactions. Signal peptides also appear to control gating of the protein translocation channel in a substrate-specific manner and may carry out additional biological functions following their liberation from the nascent chain and cleavage by signal peptide peptidase (37Kim S.J. Mitra D. Salerno J.R. Hegde R.S. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Martoglio B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1243-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that signal peptides initiate the pathway of maturation of the nascent chain in the ER including the addition of N-linked glycans that help to modulate oligomerization, quality control, and secretion of protein (39Rutkowski D.T.

They detected a relatively mild secretory defect using the BM40 signal peptide while we observed a severe defect utilizing the native COMP signal peptide. Our subsequent results document a substantial influence of the signal peptide on the secretion of mutant COMP. They suggest that use of the BM40 signal peptide directs nascent COMP chains into an alternative secretory pathway that may bypass one or more checkpoints that detect mutations that cause PSACH and MED. Construction of Wild Type and Mutant COMP—RNA was isolated from chondrocytes derived from the transgenic Col2-green fluorescent protein reporter mouse strain (42Cho J.Y. Grant T.D. Lunstrum G.P. Horton W.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was then synthesized from this RNA according to standard protocols using the Superscript system (Invitrogen). The cDNA coding for mouse COMP was then amplified in three segments using the following primers: 1) 1–840 KpnI F (5′-TGGGTACCGCCATGGGCCCCACTGCC-3′); 2) 1–840 HindIII R (5′-GCAGCGAAGCTTCTCGTC-3′); 3) 823-1475 Hin-dIII F (5′-GACGAGAAGCTTCGCTGC-3′); 4) 823-1475 MscI R (5′-TCCTCTTGGCCAGGGTTA-3′); 5) 1458–2268 MscI F (5′-TAACCCTGGCCAAGAGGA-3′); and 6) 1458–2268 XbaI R (5′-TCTAGAGACTCTCTGCAGCCGGTG-3′). The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1, and correct sequences were confirmed by sequencing (ABI Prism 3100-Avant, Applied Biosystems). The expression vector pcDNA™ V6His-V5 was digested with KpnI and XbaI, and each fragment of COMP was digested with the appropriate enzymes as noted in the primer name and ligated into the digested pcDNA V6His-V5. Del D mutation cDNA was generated by PCR using primer 3 and mutagenesis primer del D R (5′-GTCATCATCGTCACAGGCATCGCC-3′). A separate reaction was performed with mutagenesis primer del D F (5′-GGCGATGCCTGTGACGATGATGAC-3′) and primer 4. These PCR products were then used as a template for a final PCR with primers 3 and 4 to amplify del D cDNA. Del RG mutation cDNA was generated by PCR using primer 3 and mutagenesis primer del RG R (5′-GTCGCAGGCATCGCCATCCAGGTC-3′). A separate reaction was performed with mutagenesis primer del RG F (5′-GACCTGGATGGCGATGCCTGCGAC-3′) and primer 4. These PCR products were then used as a template for a final PCR with primers 3 and 4 to amplify del RG cDNA. To replace the COMP signal peptide with that of BM40, the 5′ end of COMP was re-amplified with primer BM40 1 (5′-CCCCGCTAGCCCAGGGCCAGATCC-3′) incorporating an NheI site at the 5′ end and primer (2Morgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the generation of the 5′ end of COMP lacking the signal peptide-coding region. The PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI and cloned into the expression vector pCEP/γ 2III4 that contains the sequence for the BM40/SPARC signal peptide (30Mayer U. Poschl E. Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Burgeson R.E. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), thus generating a plasmid containing the 5′ end of COMP bearing the BM40 signal peptide. This was then digested with KpnI and XhoI to excise the BM40 signal-COMP fragment. Existing COMP constructs were also digested with KpnI and XhoI to excise the 5′ end of COMP. The BM40 signal-COMP fragment was then ligated into these linearized vectors generating wild type and mutant COMP constructs bearing the BM40 signal peptide. To replace the COOH-terminal His6 tag with a FLAG tag, the following primers were used: BAM 1 (5′-GGAAGGATCCTCGAAACG-3′) containing a 5′-BamHI site and FLAG R AgeI (5′-CCGGTTCACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCACGCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAG-3′) incorporating a 3′-AgeI site. These primers were used in a PCR reaction with WT-COMP pcDNA V6His-V5 as a template, generating a fragment comprising the 3′ end of COMP and the 3′ end of the MCS of pcDNA V6His-V5 with a FLAG tag followed by a stop codon and an AgeI site 5′ of the His tag. Following subcloning into pCR2.1 and sequence confirmation, this fragment was then cloned into each of the preexisting COMP constructs that had been linearized by digestion with BamHI and AgeI. Expression and Analysis of Recombinant Protein—The pcDNA™ 6/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) harboring wild type or mutant COMP cDNA with the COMP or BM40 signal peptide and a COOH-terminal His tag or FLAG tag was transfected into HEK-293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection of rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells, the cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate and cultured for 4 h in culture medium containing 4 units/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma). This medium was removed, and Lipofectamine 2000 was then used for transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol but in the presence of 4 units/ml hylauronidase. For establishment of stably transfected cell lines, transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization 48 h post-transfection and re-seeded at a dilution of 1:10 into fresh medium containing blasticidin S-HCl (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. For expression analysis of transiently transfected cells, culture medium was harvested 48 h post-transfection and cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (1 Complete Mini EDTA-free tablet (Roche Applied Science)/7 ml of lysis buffer). Cells were harvested by trypsinization and then lysed by vortexing for 15 s in lysis buffer followed by incubation on ice for 20 min and centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Harvested culture medium was cleared of detached cells and debris by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,500 × g. Proteins were analyzed in the presence (reduced) or absence (non-reduced) of 100 mm dithiothreitol by SDS-PAGE using 8% Tris-glycine gels, 4–12% Novex® Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), or 3–8% Novex Tris acetate gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose by standard protocol. In most cases, the nitrocellulose was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:5000 or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:5000 or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mouse monoclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals) at a dilution of 1:1000. Detection was then performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In cases where quantification was required, the enhanced chemifluorescence system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. In these cases, the nitrocellulose was probed with anti-His mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:5000 followed by anti-mouse IgG fluorescein-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:600 and finally with anti-fluorescein alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:2500. Signal was then generated by the addition of ECF substrate to the membrane. For both ECL and ECF detection, membranes were read using the STORM system (Amersham Biosciences), and for quantification, ECF-generated bands were analyzed using ImageQuant analysis software. In pulse-chase experiments, samples were electrophoresed on 8% Tris-glycine gels under reducing conditions. The gels were then fixed in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min and washed extensively in water prior to drying onto filter paper using a vacuum gel dryer (Bio-Rad). Dried gels were exposed overnight to a low energy screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) prior to image analysis. The predominant bands present in the culture media gels were identified as COMP by Western blot. The COMP bands in the lysate gels were identified by aligning them with the bands in the culture media gels. Confocal Microscopy—Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were plated onto 18-mm glass coverslips in 12-well culture plates 48 h post-transfection. For co-localization experiments, HEK-293 cells stably expressing the ER-targeting sequence of calreticulin fused to the 5′ end of Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed2) and the ER retention sequence, KDEL (pDsRED2-ER, Clontech), were used. Following transfection, cells were allowed to adhere to the coverslips overnight and then were rinsed with PBS prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% saponin, 5% heat-denatured goat serum) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with anti-His mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:400 for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 2% heat-denatured goat serum. Cells were washed with three changes of PBS containing 0.1% saponin and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 2% heat-denatured goat serum in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed with three changes of PBS containing 0.1% saponin and finally rinsed with distilled H2O. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope system (Leica). Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cell cultures that were duplicates of those processed for confocal microscopy were pelleted and rinsed in Dulbecco's serum-free medium and fixed in medium-buffered 1.5% glutaraldehyde/1.5% paraformaldehyde for 60 min at 4 °C. Following another rinse, the pellets were post-fixed in media-buffered 1% OsO4 for 60 min at 4 °C, rinsed in media, dehydrated in a graded alcohol series to 100%, rinsed in propylene oxide, and embedded in Spurr's epoxy. Sections (70-nm thick) were mounted on Formvar-coated grids and photographed using a Philips 410LS transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operated at 80 KV. Pulse-Chase Analysis—HEK-293 cells stably transfected with COMP constructs were seeded into the wells of 6-well plates (3 × 106 cells/well) and cultured overnight. Culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Serum-free culture medium lacking cysteine and methionine (Sigma) was added, and the cells were cultured for 2 h. This medium was then removed and replaced with serum-free medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine (MP Biomedicals, Inc.), and the cells were labeled for 30 min (pulse time). This medium was then removed, the cells were washed with PBS, and serum-free complete medium was then added. At set time points, culture medium was removed and cell lysates were prepared as described earlier (chase times). Purification of His-tagged Protein—His-tagged proteins were purified from culture medium and cell lysates using His-Select HF nickel affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, for each sample, 100 μl of affinity gel slurry was washed with 1 ml of water and then equilibrated in 1 ml of equilibration buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole). Culture medium was cleared by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,500 × g, and the pH was adjusted by the addition of one-tenth volume of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Equilibrated affinity gel was then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with inversion. The gel was then recovered by centrifugation and washed in 3 × 1 ml of equilibration buffer. Bound proteins were then eluted by the addition of 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 500 mm imidazole). The Signal Peptide Affects Secretion of Wild Type and Mutant COMP—The PSACH-causing mutation del D469 and the MED-causing mutation del RG367–368 were introduced into the full-length mouse COMP cDNA by PCR-based mutagenesis. For simplicity throughout the remainder of this paper, these mutations shall be referred to as del D and del RG, respectively. The domain structure of a COMP monomer together with the approximate locations of each of the mutations is illustr"
https://openalex.org/W1973090557,"Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) is a ubiquitous mechanism by which Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum amplifies the trigger Ca2+ entry and generates propagating Ca2+ waves. To elucidate the mechanisms that control this positive feedback, we investigated the spatial and temporal kinetics and measured the gain function of CICR in small sensory neurons from mammalian dorsal root ganglions (DRGs). We found that subsurface Ca2+ release units (CRUs) are under tight local control by Ca2+ entry, whereas medullar CRUs as a “common pool” system are recruited by inwardly propagating CICR. Active CRUs often displayed repetitive Ca2+ sparks, conferring the ability to encode a “memory” of neuronal activity well beyond the duration of an action potential. Store Ca2+ reserve was able to support all CRUs each to fire ∼15 sparks, excluding use-dependent inactivation or store depletion as the major CICR termination mechanism. Importantly, CICR in DRG neurons operated in a low gain, linear regime (gain = 0.54), which conferred intrinsic stability to CICR. Combined with high Ca2+ current density (–156 pA/pF at –10 mV), such a low gain CICR system generated large intracellular Ca2+ transients without jeopardizing the stability. These findings provide the first demonstration that CICR operating in a low gain regime can be harnessed to provide a robust and graded amplification of Ca2+ signal in the absence of counteracting inhibitory mechanism.

Science. 1970; 167: 58-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) is a ubiquitous mechanism whereby Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, or sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscles) is triggered by and amplifies an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A positive feedback in nature, CICR ensures the needed sensitivity, speed, and magnitude of Ca2+ signals in diverse physiological processes, ranging from cell contraction to secretion and to neurotransmitter release (3Clapham D.E.

Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Crossref Google Scholar). Spatially regenerative CICR, in the form of propagating Ca2+ waves, is also capable of broadcasting an otherwise local signal over the entire cytoplasm as well as nucleoplasm, such as those observed during fertilization (7Gilkey J.C. Jaffe L.F. Ridgway E.B. Reynolds G.T. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 448-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Understanding the control mechanisms of CICR is thus fundamental to understanding the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In its simplest form, uncontrolled CICR with high gain amplification is expected to behave in an all-or-none fashion. Yet, CICR in various biological systems is often finely tuned to the magnitude and duration of the trigger Ca2+ signal, mainly Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ currents (ICa). In an exemplary system found in mammalian ventricular myocytes, CICR serves to amplify the trigger ICa at a gain of 10–70, depending on membrane voltage (8Wier W.G. Egan T.M. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Balke C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 463-471Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol.

Studies for more than a decade have established that cardiac CICR system comprises a discrete, rather than continuum, architecture, with ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channels assembled into discrete Ca2+ release units (CRUs) (11Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Ramesh V. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1528-1539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar); individual CRUs operate in a digital, rather than analogous, mode, generating “Ca2+ sparks” as the elementary events of CICR (12Cheng H.

During cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, spark genesis is under tight control of local Ca2+ influx, which is essential to achieving high gain amplification and stability simultaneously (8Wier W.G.

Emerging evidence from intensive recent research indicates that terminating CICR in the heart involves substantial ER Ca2+ store depletion (19Trafford A.W. Diaz M.E. Sibbring G.C. Eisner D.A. J.

Recently, we have demonstrated that Ca2+ sparks from type 3 RyR (RyR3) constitute the elementary events of CICR in small sensory neurons from rat dorsal root ganglions (DRGs). 2K. Ouyang, H. Zheng, X. Qin, C. Zhang, D. Yang, X. Wang, C. Wu, Z. Zhou, and H. Cheng, submitted for publication. DRG Ca2+ sparks, particularly those localized to surface membrane, play an important role in the regulation of vesicular secretion from the somata of these cells.2 In the present study, we used DRG neurons as a model system to investigate possible control mechanisms of CICR. We demonstrated that CICR in DRG neurons operates in the low gain, linear amplification regime in conjunction with high ICa density, which confers intrinsic stability and large Ca2+ transient amplitude in the absence of counteracting termination mechanisms. Our results were compared and contrasted with those from heart muscle cells, a well characterized model system of CICR. Cell Preparation—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were rendered unconscious by exposure to CO2 and decapitated. The DRGs (C5-L5) were harvested and treated with collagenase (1.5 mg ml–1) and tripsin (1 mg ml–1) at 37 °C, as described.2 Cells were used 2–10 h after preparation. Only the small (15–25 μm, C-type) neurons without apparent processes were used. Electrophysiology—Single cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an EPC-7 amplifier and pClamp 6.0 software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), as described previously.2 Under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions, membrane voltage was held at –70 mV with the patch pipette resistance of 2–4 MΩ. Test pulses from –55 mV to +50 mV of variable durations (400–2000 ms) were applied every 20 s. Standard external solution contained (in mm): NaCl 150, KCl 5.0, CaCl2 2.0, MgCl2 1.0, HEPES 10, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). An EGTA-free pipette solution contained (in mm): CsCl 150, MgATP 5.0, Li4GTP 0.1, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH); and a high EGTA solution contained (in mm): CsCl 150, MgATP 5.0, Li4GTP 0.1, EGTA 10, CaCl2 3.0 (free Ca2+ concentration ∼100 nm), and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH). The Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 pentapotassium salt (0.15 mm) was directly dissolved in the pipette solution. Amplitude of Ca2+ currents was measured at 20 ms into depolarization, after the Na+ current spike. The amount of Ca2+ influx (Q) was calculated as integral of Ca2+ current. For perforated patch clamp recording of action potentials, intracellular pipette solution contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 5.0 NaCl, 4.0 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.15 nystatin (pH = 7.2). Under current clamp conditions, action potentials were elicited by injecting a 3-ms depolarizing current. Ca2+ indicators were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and all other chemicals were from Sigma. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Confocal Ca2+Imaging—DRG neurons were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-4, either via dialysis through the patch pipette in the broken-in whole-cell patch clamp configuration or incubation with the acetoxymethyl ester form of the indicator (5–10 μm, 20–30 min) in the perforated patch clamp experiments. Indicator-stained DRG neurons were imaged at 488 nm excitation and >510 nm emission with a Zeiss 510 inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss), in the line scan or curve scan mode. The horizontal and axial resolutions were 0.4 and 1.5 μm, respectively, achieved with 40× oil immersion lens (NA 1.3), and the line scan rate was 3.07 ms per scan. In some experiments, 5 mm caffeine was added to nominal zero Ca2+ solution and delivered to cells by locally placed glass pipette. Acquisition of confocal Ca2+ imaging was usually synchronized to electrophysiological commands in whole-cell voltage or current clamp experiments. Image processing and data analysis were performed using custom-devised algorithms coded in Interactive Data Language (Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, CO). Measurement of the Gain of CICR—The gain of CICR was defined as the ratio between the amount of released Ca2+ for the ER and the trigger Ca2+ influx via ICa. The ICa and the subsurface Ca2+ transient were directly measured with whole-cell voltage clamping and confocal curve scan imaging, respectively. A linear relationship between Ca2+ transient and Ca2+ flux via ICa (QICa) alone was first established in cells which CICR was abrogated by ryanodine pretreatment (10 μm, 20 min) (see Fig. 3C). The total Ca2+ flux (Qtotal) from both release and influx in cells with intact ER function was then determined from this calibration curve, and the release component was determined by subtracting QICa from its corresponding Qtotal. Immunolabeling—To visualize RyR3 localization, dissociated DRG neurons were fixed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary monoclonal antibodies that recognize both RyR1 (not expressed in this type of cells; see Ref. 27Lokuta A.J. Komai H. McDowell T.S. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and RyR3 (28Yang D.M. Pan Z. Ma J. Cheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40210-40214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h in the dark. Immunofluorescence was detected by the Zeiss confocal microscope with 543 nm excitation, >560 nm emission, and 1.0 μm axial resolution. Confocal Z-stack imaging was performed at Z intervals of 0.5 μm. Zeiss LSM software (Carl Zeiss) was used for three-dimensional reconstruction and animation. Statistics—Data were given as mean ± S.E. The significance of difference between means was determined, when appropriate, using Student's t test and paired t test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Organization and Operation of Subsurface CRUs—Fig. 1A shows typical immunofluorescent staining of RyR3 in a small sensory neuron (diameter = 15–25 μm) from rat DRGs, illustrating that intensely stained spots were enriched along a ring right beneath the surface membrane. The bulk cytoplasm was diffusively stained at a reduced intensity, and the nucleus was devoid of any specific immunofluorescence. The average distance between adjacent RyR3 spots was measured to be 1.84 ± 0.10 μm(n = 113), and about 400 subsurface RyR3 spots could be identified in a typical cell. These results are in good agreement with our previous report.2 To determine whether these RyR3 spots are indeed functional CRUs, we employed the so-called Ca2+ spike measurement (9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) combined with the “curve scan” imaging technique (Fig. 1B). Specifically, the fast Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-4, along with a slow Ca2+ chelator (EGTA, 10 mm), was dialyzed into the cell through the patch pipette under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions. Because of kinetic disparity between Fluo-4 and EGTA, a fraction of released Ca2+ ions will first bind to the indicator (of fast kinetics) before being captured by the nonfluorescent EGTA at excess. As a result, this experimental setting allows for pinpointing the spatial localization and tracking the time course of Ca2+ release fluxes (9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). While holding the membrane potential at –70 mV, rapid local application of 5 mm caffeine, which sensitizes CICR, elicited transient Ca2+ releases from discrete sites. These functional release sites were, on average, separated 1.7 μm apart, similar to those between adjacent RyR3 spots (Fig. 1A). Thus, the Ca2+ spike measurement strongly suggests that RyR3 spots visualized in Fig. 1A represent CRUs in DRG neurons. Measurement of Store Ca2+Capacity—Local Ca2+ release functions at five representative sites are shown to the bottom of Fig. 1C. During the onset of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, discrete Ca2+ spikes, which reflect solitary Ca2+ sparks, were clearly discernible. However, at increasing rate of occurrence, they were quickly fused into an apparently continuous release pattern. Nearly all DRG CRUs underwent repetitive activation, indicating a large store Ca2+ reserve. To quantify the capacity of store Ca2+ reserve, we divided the total signal mass of the release function (space-time integral of ΔF/F0) with the average signal mass for individual spikes (8.3 ± 1.1 ΔF/F0·ms·μm, n = 68) (see supplemental Fig. s1A). We found that, on average, each CRU discharges about 15 Ca2+ spikes or sparks in a caffeine-elicited Ca2+ release (Fig. s1B). Since excessive EGTA should have largely “clamped” the cytosolic free Ca2+ level and thereby minimized the replenishment of the ER during an ongoing release (9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Sham J.S. Song L.S. Deng L.H. Chen-Izu Y. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Cheng H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15096-15101Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), this result suggests that the caffeine-liable Ca2+ store does not undergo substantial depletion in individual sparks. Action Potential Evoked Non-inactivating Ca2+Spark Activity—To examine the ability of neural action potentials, typically of millisecond duration, to evoke Ca2+ sparks, cells were loaded with Fluo-4 via incubation with the acetoxymethyl ester form of the indicator and were then subjected to perforated patch clamping in conjunction with confocal curve scan imaging. In response to brief action potentials (APD50 = 4.4 ± 0.1 ms, n = 10), subsurface Ca2+ rose sharply to 1.16 ± 0.13 (ΔF/F0 unit) within 21.0 ± 2.5 ms and then declined with a half-decay time of 165 ± 31 ms. The rise time of Ca2+ transients outlasted APD50 but was similar to those of Ca2+ sparks,2 consistent with a synchronous activation of sparks that evolve autonomously. Moreover, trains of Ca2+ sparks were discernible in the wake of the action potential-induced Ca2+ transient, lingering for more than 2000 ms. This is in sharp contrast to the use-dependent inactivation and refractoriness in heart muscle cells (18Wang S.Q. Song L.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Nature. 2001; 410: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 23Sham J.S. Song L.S. Deng L.H. Chen-Izu Y. Lakatta E.G. Stern M.D. Cheng H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15096-15101Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We conclude that subsurface Ca2+ sparks serve to decode membrane excitation into cytosolic Ca2+ signal and retain a “memory” of membrane activity well beyond the duration of an action potential. Recruitment of Medullar CRUs—The immunostaining in Fig. 1A suggests that medullar CRUs stand free of contact with the surface Ca2+ channels, forming a common pool system. To determine whether medullar CRUs participate in excitaion-Ca2+ release coupling in DRG neurons, and, if so, to investigate the mechanism responsible for the recruitment of medullar CRUs, we examined subsurface and medullar Ca2+ transients in response to trigger ICa under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions. At near-threshold voltages (–55 mV), Ca2+ release was exclusively restricted to discrete subsurface sites, each displaying repetitive spark activity (Fig. 2A, right). When medullar Ca2+ was elevated due to Ca2+ diffusion from the subsurface, medullar Ca2+ sparks became evident at intermediate voltages (–45 mV, Fig. 2B). During full-fledged excitation-Ca2+ release coupling at –10 mV, coordinated radial CICR took the form of inwardly propagating, unmitigated Ca2+ waves, rendering the crescent wavefront seen in the linescan image (Fig. 2C). Similar inward propagation of Ca2+ signals upon excitation has been seen previously in sympathetic ganglion cells (29Hua S.Y. Liu C. Lu F.M. Nohmi M. Kuba K. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After ryanodine pretreatment (10 μm, 20 min), inhibition of CICR halved amplitudes of local Ca2+ transients (ΔF/F0 3.89 ± 0.29 in control; 2.72 ± 0.21 in CICR-deficient cells, n = 11, p < 0.01) and prolonged the delay time (at 5 μm from the surface) by 70% (161 ± 10 in control; 275 ± 38 ms in CICR-deficient cells, n = 11, p < 0.01), without an effect on ICa density (–156 ± 24 in control; –151 ± 23 pA/pF in CICR-deficient cells, n = 11, p > 0.05). The amplitude ratio of subsurface and medullar (5 μm into the cytosol) Ca2+ transients was also decreased from 0.96 ± 0.05 to 0.76 ± 0.03 (n = 11) in the absence of CICR. Hence, while subsurface CRUs directly amplify the trigger Ca2+ entry, medullar CRUs relay subsurface Ca2+ signals and ensure a speedy and uniform broadcast of the signal over the entire cytoplasm. Gain of CICR in DRG Neurons—We reckoned that, by examining subsurface Ca2+ transient arising from a known ICa, the so-determined relationship between the Ca2+ transient amplitude and QICa could then be used to calibrate the release flux. In cells where CICR was abrogated by ryanodine pretreatment (10 μm, 20 min), ICa and the ensuing subsurface Ca2+ transient were directly measured with whole-cell voltage clamping and confocal curve-scan imaging, respectively. Two interesting results came from this experiment. First, DRG neurons displayed a very high ICa density, with the peak of –156 ± 24 pA/pF at –10 mV (n = 11) (Fig. 3B). This value is at least an order of magnitude higher than those in heart muscle cells (∼–10 pA/pF at –10 mV) (6Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Crossref Google Scholar, 8Wier W.G. Egan T.M. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Balke C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 463-471Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Wier W.G. Balke C.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subsurface Ca2+ transient amplitude (ΔF/F0) was linearly correlated with QICa over wide ranges of ΔF/F0 (0.21–3.44) and QICa (0.07–0.97 × 10–9 Coulomb) (r2 = 0.85, Fig. 3C). In cells with the ER function intact, we measured the ICa and the subsurface Ca2+ transient arising from both Ca2+ entry and release. As summarized in Fig. 3, A and B, subsurface Ca2+ transient amplitude exhibited a bell-shaped voltage dependence, mirroring the voltage-ICa relationship. This finding corroborates the notion that CICR is smoothly graded to the trigger Ca2+ entry. To quantify the release component, we first calculated the total Ca2+ flux, Qtotal, based on the calibration curve in Fig. 3C, and then the release flux by subtracting from it the ICa component, i.e. Qtotal – QICa. From this, the gain of CICR was then defined as the ratio between the release and ICa components. Surprisingly, the average value of the gain of CICR in DRG cells was merely 0.54 (n = 35 cells). This value is not only far below those in cardiac cells (10–70 depending on voltage) (6Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Crossref Google Scholar, 8Wier W.G. Egan T.M. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Balke C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 463-471Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Song L.S.

Res. 1999; 85: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) but also considerably smaller than unity, a criterion for intrinsic stability of CICR (16Stern M.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 497-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gain function was virtually constant over test voltages ranging from –30 mV to +50 mV, independently of either whole-cell ICa density or single-channel current amplitude (iCa). This is also in stark contrast to cardiac CICR, which gain function monotonically declines from ∼70 to about ∼10 between –40 and +40 mV (8Wier W.G. Egan T.M. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Balke C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 463-471Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Wier W.G. Balke C.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Uncontrolled CICR, when operating in the regime of amplification gain >1.0, is expected to be intrinsically unstable, unless it is under tight local control (16Stern M.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 497-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Even with local control, a stable, high gain CICR, such as that in heart muscle cells, still necessitates counter mechanisms that negate the positive feedback to terminate the release (30Stern M.D. Cheng H. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To this end, the present study has uncovered several important features on the control of CICR in a mammalian sensory neuron, which are summarized in Table I along with cardiac CICR as the reference system. First, neural CICR comprises a hybrid architecture; the subsurface CRUs are under tight local control by Ca2+ influx, whereas the medullar CICR is more appropriately categorized as a common-pool system (in which all RyRs sense a more-or-less uniform level of global Ca2+). In addition to regulating membrane-delimited Ca2+-dependent events (e.g. somatic secretion),2 subsurface CICR also amplifies the trigger Ca2+ for the recruitment of medullar CRUs. The medullar CICR, on the other hand, appears to be indispensable for a speedy and unmitigated relay of Ca2+ signal over the entire cell (Fig. 2). Second, virtually all CRUs manifest repetitive spark activity, indicative of lacking inactivation and refractoriness (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2, A and B). Although unexpected, this is consistent with the report that RyR3 from DRGs displays no Ca2+-depndent inactivation in planar lipid bilayer even at 10 mm Ca2+ on the cytosolic side (27Lokuta A.J. Komai H. McDowell T.S. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The large store Ca2+ reserve capacity (Fig. 1) further excludes store depletion as a major determinant for the termination of CICR. At the same time, we found that DRG Ca2+ transient amplitude is smoothly graded by the trigger ICa (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating the stability of CICR.Table IProperties of neural and cardiac CICRPropertiesDRG sensory neuronsVentricular myocytesMolecular playersCICR mediated by RyR3CICR mediated by RyR2Trigger signalICa at high density (-156 pA/pF at -10 mV)ICa (∼-10 pA/pF at -10 mV) (6Bers D.M.

Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. 2nd Ed. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Crossref Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab The central issue is then what mechanism confers the stability to CICR in the absence of counteracting termination mechanisms? Quantitative measurement of the gain function indicates that CICR in DRG neurons is a linear, low gain amplification system, whose gain value is always smaller than unity (Fig. 3D). According to the theory put forward by Stern (16Stern M.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 497-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), such a low gain CICR system is endowed with intrinsic stability, i.e. CICR is self-limiting in the absence of additional termination mechanisms other than spontaneous closure of the release channel. The intrinsic stability of CICR is also consistent with our preliminary observation that CICR in DRG neurons appears to be unconditionally stable; it is unable to support spontaneous propagating Ca2+ waves even when the cells were challenged with high extracellular Ca2+ (10 mm, data not shown). It is noteworthy that, despite the low gain amplification, neural Ca2+ transient magnitude is not compromised, because DRG cells are equipped with a compensating high ICa density (Table I). Taken together, the present study provides the first demonstration that CICR operating in a low gain regime can be harnessed to provide a robust and graded amplification of Ca2+ signal in the absence of counteracting termination mechanism. Another interesting finding is that the CICR gain function in DRG neurons is voltage-independent (Fig. 3D), rendering neural CICR a linear amplification mechanism. By contrast, the gain of cardiac CICR is a monotonic decreasing function of voltage (8Wier W.G. Egan T.M. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Balke C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 463-471Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Song L.S. Sham J.S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 677-691Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Wier W.G. Balke C.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cardiac result was initially taken as a signature feature in favor of the local control model of CICR (8Wier W.G. Egan T.M. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Balke C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 474: 463-471Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar), because the gain is not uniquely determined by whole-cell ICa but also by microscopic properties of single-channel iCa. Later it has been shown to reflect the fact that RyR activation is a nonlinear, power function of iCa with the power of 2 (31Santana L.F. Cheng H. Gomez A.M. Cannell M.B. Lederer W.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Intuitively, the linear amplification in DRG neurons may further ensure the stability of neural CICR. The present results indicate that CRUs retain a memory of membrane excitation, in the form of hyperactive sparks, well beyond the duration of an action potential. One possible explanation is that Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels results in overfilling of subsurface Ca2+ stores above normal, which, in turn, promotes elevated spontaneous spark activity (memory). However, direct measurement of store Ca2+ capacity demonstrated that this is not the case, because we failed to detect any significant change in store Ca2+ capacity prior to and 1 s after the action potential (see supplemental Fig. s2). Alternatively, the hyperactive sparks might be activated due to the elevation of background cytosolic Ca2+. This hypothesis is not tenable, either, because hyperactive sparks are restricted to only a number of CRUs, while all CRUs are amid the elevated cytosolic Ca2+. Moreover, hyperactive sparking sites are observed during small depolarization (Fig. 2, A and B), when little elevation of cytosolic or ER Ca2+ is expected. Hence we propose that the memory-encoding hyperactive Ca2+ sparks reflect an intrinsic property of CRU operation. For instance, a CRU at an excited state may undergo many open-close transitions before returning to its basal state. Using DRG sensory neurons as a model system, we have uncovered mechanisms fundamental to the control of CICR, which are distinctly different from what we have thus far learned from muscle cells. Among others, CICR in DRG neurons is characterized by the hybrid local control and common pool architecture, the apparent lack of counteracting termination mechanisms, and the low gain, linear amplification combined with the high density Ca2+ entry. In this way, the neural CICR mechanism is capable of generating large intracellular Ca2+ transients without jeopardizing stability. The striking differences as well as similarities between neural and cardiac CICR (Table I) are instructive as to how the same signaling mechanism can be adaptive and plastic in different biological systems. Since similar hybrid architecture is common to many types of cells, including sympathetic ganglion neurons (29Hua S.Y. Liu C. Lu F.M. Nohmi M. Kuba K. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), neurons of the central nervous system (4Berridge M.J.

C., and Karlish, S. J. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 3556–3566). In a study of the mechanism of inhibition, we found that Br2-TITU allows the enzyme to bind Ca2+ and undergo phosphorylation by ATP. The level of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (i.e. E1P-2Ca2+) observed in the transient state following addition of ATP is much higher in the presence than in the absence of the inhibitor. Br2-TITU does not interfere with enzyme phosphorylation by Pi in the reverse direction of the cycle (i.e. E2P) and produces only a slight inhibition of its hydrolytic cleavage. The inhibitory effect of Br2-TITU on steady state ATPase velocity is attributed to interference with the E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+ transition. In fact, experiments on conformation-dependent protection from proteolytic digestion suggest that, in the presence of Br2-TITU, the loops connecting the “A” domain to the ATPase transmembrane region undergo greater fluctuation than expected in the E2 and E2P states. Optimal stability of the gathered headpiece domains is thereby prevented. These effects are opposite to those of thapsigargin, in which the mechanism of inhibition is related to stabilization of a highly compact ATPase conformation and interference with Ca2+ binding and phosphoenzyme formation. Our experiments with Br2-TITU provide the first demonstration of a kinetic limit posed by an inhibitor on the E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+ transition in the wild-type enzyme.

The catalytic and transport cycle includes a number of sequential steps (3DeMeis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) beginning with activation of the enzyme ground state (E2) by high affinity binding of 2 Ca2+ (E1–2Ca2+) on one side of the membrane followed by utilization of ATP to form of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate (ADP-E1P-2Ca2+). The free energy derived from ATP is then utilized for isomerization of E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+, whereby the bound Ca2+ dissociates with lower affinity on the opposite side of the membrane. Finally, the cycle is completed by hydrolytic cleavage of Pi from E2P (Scheme I). Changes of protein conformation, including separation, rotation, and gathering of the three (N, P, and A) cytosolic domains as well as the displacement of transmembrane segments, occur in concomitance with the sequential steps of the ATPase cycle and play an essential role in the mechanism of energy transduction (4Toyoshima C.

In fact, SERCA inhibition can be produced by stabilization of specific conformational states. For example, thapsigargin (TG) binds to the ATPase with high affinity, yielding a dead end complex with the enzyme in ground state (9Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here a series of experiments on the characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of Br2-TITU (1Berman M.C. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and its comparative features relative to other SERCA inhibitors such as TG and 2,5-di(tert-butyl)hydroquinone (DBHQ). Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles were obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle (11Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Br2-TITU (Fig. 1) was synthesized according to Tal and Karlish (12Tal D.M. Karlish S.J. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 3823-3830Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]Pi were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Thapsigargin, ATP, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. ATPase hydrolytic activity was determined following Pi production by a colorimetric method (13Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 μm CaCl2, 3 μg of SR protein/ml, 5 μm A23187 ionophore, and 3 mm ATP. The incubation temperature was 25 °C. Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP was measured by incubating SR vesicles (40 μg/ml) in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and [45Ca]CaCl2 to yield various concentrations of free Ca2+ and 5 μm A23187 ionophore. TG (1 μm) was added to half of the samples to provide controls exhibiting no specific Ca2+ binding because it was demonstrated previously that TG prevents specific Ca2+ binding (9Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction temperature was 25 °C. Enzyme phosphorylation by ATP was measured in an ice-cold reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2, 1 mg of SR protein/ml, and 5 μm A23187 ionophore. Individual samples (0.2 ml) were started by the addition of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP and quenched at various times with 1 m perchloric acid. Enzyme phosphorylation with Pi was measured at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, various concentrations of [32P]Pi and 1 mg of SR protein/ml in a total volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was acid-quenched after 10 min of incubation by the addition of 1 m perchloric acid. For all phosphoenzyme measurements, the quenched reaction mixture was transferred into ice, and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin/mg microsomal protein was added as carrier. The samples were then washed by repeated centrifugations and resuspensions in 0.125 m perchloric acid and finally dissolved in 1% SDS for determination of radioactivity and residual protein. Limited proteolytic digestion was performed in reaction mixtures containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.6 mg of microsomal protein/ml and 0.02–0.04 mg of proteinase K/ml or 0.02 mg of trypsin/ml. CaCl2, EGTA, TG, or Br2-TITU were added as indicated in the figures. Following incubation at 25 °C for various time intervals up to 60 min, the reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid (2.5%), and the protein was solubilized with SDS (1%), MOPS (0.312 m), pH 6.8, sucrose (3.75%), β-mercaptoethanol (1.25 mm), and bromphenol blue (0.025%). The samples were then subjected to electrophoretic analysis (14Laemmly U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) on 12% gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. In some cases, Western blots were obtained with the monoclonal antibody MA3-911 (Affinity Bioreagents) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualization with an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In agreement with Berman and Karlish (1Berman M.C. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we found that steady state Ca2+ ATPase activity is inhibited by Br2-TITU within the micromolar concentration range, yielding a KI of 20 μm (Fig. 2). As opposed to the total inhibition produced by TG (9Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition by Br2-TITU is not total but reduces the steady state ATPase activity by ∼80%. Although the previous study of the mechanism of Br2-TITU was done by following the development of TNP-AMP superfluorescence upon enzyme activation (1Berman M.C. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we directly characterized the ATPase partial reactions by measurements of radioactive isotopes. To this aim, we first measured Ca2+ binding (reaction 1 in Scheme I) in the absence of ATP. We found that Ca2+ binding is not inhibited by Br2-TITU, whereas total inhibition is obtained with TG and DBHQ (Fig. 3). When ATP is added to the enzyme activated by Ca2+, a phosphoenzyme intermediate is formed rapidly and reaches a level, which is dependent on the rates of phosphoryl transfer from ATP and subsequent hydrolytic cleavage. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 were performed with leaky vesicles (because of the addition of a Ca2+ ionophore) to prevent Ca2+ accumulation in the lumen of the vesicles and consequent inhibition of phosphoenzyme cleavage. Under these conditions, we observed an early rise of the phosphoenzyme followed by reduction to a lower level as the ATP added (10 μm) to the reaction mixture was exhausted. Interestingly, we noted that in the presence of Br2-TITU the early rise of the phosphoenzyme reached a much higher level and decayed at a slower rate (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, if we added excess ADP 1 s after ATP (i.e. to the peak level of the phosphoenzyme), we observed a rapid decay of the phosphoenzyme both in the absence and in the presence of Br2-TITU (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the phosphoenzyme accumulated in the presence of Br2-TITU is ADP-sensitive and, therefore, still in the E1P-2Ca2+ state. It is noteworthy that no phosphoenzyme formation with ATP was obtained in the presence of either TG or DBHQ (Fig. 4A). We then tested the effect of Br2-TITU on enzyme phosphorylation by Pi in the absence of Ca2+, which yields equilibrium levels of phosphoenzyme through reactions 7 and 6 in the reverse direction of the cycle (Scheme I). We found no inhibition by Br2-TITU, whereas the reaction was strongly inhibited by TG and DBHQ (Fig. 5A). In fact, the phosphoenzyme levels were increased by Br2-TITU when low concentrations of Pi were used in the reaction mixture, indicating increased affinity of the enzyme for Pi in the presence of Br2-TITU. When we added excess non-radioactive phosphate to equilibrium levels of the phosphoenzyme obtained with radioactive phosphate, we found that the decay (i.e. hydrolytic cleavage) of the radioactive phosphoenzyme was only slightly inhibited by Br2-TITU (Fig. 5B). It is noteworthy that in the presence of Br2-TITU, Ca2+ binding and enzyme phosphorylation with Pi were still inhibited by TG or DBH (not shown). Therefore, Br2-TITU does not interfere with the binding of these inhibitors and their effects. Furthermore, we found that Br2-TITU had the unexpected effect of partially reversing the Ca2+ inhibition of enzyme phosphorylation with Pi. Furthermore, Ca2+ binding was reduced in proportion to the enhancement of enzyme phosphorylation (Table I), indicating that the phosphoenzyme formed is in the low Ca2+ affinity state (i.e. E2P).Table IBr2-TITU reverses the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on enzyme phosphorylation by P1EP formationControlBr2-TITUTGDBHQPi (EGTA)2.0 (0.1)2.5 (0.15)00Pi and Ca2+0.5 (0.05)1.5 (0.1)00Ca2+ bindingControlBr2-TITUTGDBHQCa2+8.0 (0.3)8.0 (0.2)00Pi and Ca2+7.5 (0.2)5.5 (0.1)00 Open table in a new tab The kinetic studies described above indicate that the ATPase steady state velocity is inhibited by Br2-TITU by interference with an isomeric transition of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate, whereby conversion of E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+ is delayed. We then performed experiments on limited ATPase protein digestion with proteinase K and trypsin to explore ligand-dependent conformational states of the enzyme. In these experiments we tested the accessibility of proteinase K (Leu-119 and Thr-242) and trypsin (Arg-198) digestion sites. These sites reside on the loops connecting the “A” domain to transmembrane segments M2 and M3 and on the outer loop of the A domain, respectively. The accessibility of these sites, or lack thereof, reflects A domain rotation in concomitance with sequential reactions of the catalytic cycle and corresponds to dissociation or gathering of the ATPase headpiece domains (15Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is shown in Fig. 6 that, in the absence of Ca2+, digestion by proteinase K occurs with a specific pattern (17Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez d.G. Denoroy L. Moller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) yielding a 95-kDa band (cleavage at Leu-119) and an 83-kDa band (cleavage at Thr-242). This pattern of rather slow digestion is attributed to the compact conformation of the ATPase headpiece in the absence of Ca2+ (E2) and the consequent protection of A domain proteolytic sites. When the digestion is performed in the presence of Br2-TITU, the 95-kDa band is hardly noted, indicating that the Thr-242 site in the A domain is not protected, and the 95-kDa fragment is rapidly cut to yield the 83-kDa product. The opposite is observed in the presence of TG, as a prominent 95-kDa band indicates very efficient protection of the Thr-242 site. The ATPase digestion with proteinase K proceeds faster in the presence of Ca2+, and the 95-kDa band is not present either in the absence or in the presence of Br2-TITU (Fig. 6). This is attributed to a Ca2+-dependent, open conformation of the ATPase headpiece (i.e. E1–2Ca2+) whereby the proteolytic sites of the A domain are exposed (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that under these conditions the digestion is slower in the presence of TG, with a prominent 95-kDa band (Fig. 6). These experiments indicate that Br2-TITU has no apparent influence on the open conformation of the ATPase headpiece, which is induced by Ca2+ (i.e. E1–2Ca2+). On the contrary, TG produces stabilization of the E2 conformation and places a strong limit on the fluctuations of the A domain loops. Protection from proteinase K is also observed in the presence of Pi and absence of Ca2+ (i.e. E2P). In this case the protection is even higher than in E2, as the ATPase band is reduced at a lower rate, and the two digestion bands are retained for a longer time (Fig. 7). A distinctive feature of the pattern obtained in the presence of Br2-TITU is the lack or low intensity of the 98-kDa band (Fig. 7), indicating that the Thr-242 site is not protected. Considering that Br2-TITU allows (and even favors, at low Pi concentrations) the phosphorylation reaction, it is apparent that considerable fluctuations of the A domain loops are still permitted when the enzyme is phosphorylated by Pi in the presence of Br2-TITU. On the other hand, the digestion pattern observed in the presence of TG (Fig. 7) is very similar to that observed in the absence of Pi, consistent with interference with the Pi reaction and stabilization of the E2 state. Further experiments on proteolytic digestion were performed with trypsin. Trypsin cleaves the ATPase at a first site (T1, Arg-505 on the N domain), yielding two fragments of nearly equal size (A and B), and then at a second site (T2, Arg-198 on the outer loop of the A domain), yielding two subfragments of quite different size (A1 and A2). Digestion at T1 is not influenced significantly by the presence of Ca2+ or Pi, whereas digestion at T2 occurs at a rapid rate in the presence of Ca2+, as revealed by appearance of the A1 band in electrophoretic gels (Fig. 8). Digestion at T2 occurs much more slowly in the absence of Ca2+ and even more slowly under conditions of enzyme phosphorylation by Pi (15Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We found that Br2-TITU does not change the patterns of digestion observed in the absence or presence of Ca2+ or Pi (Fig. 8). Therefore, Br2-TITU does not interfere with conformation-dependent protection of T2 on the outer loop of the A domain. An inhibitory effect of Br2-TITU on SERCA was first reported by Berman and Karlish (1Berman M.C. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), who performed a detailed study of fluorescence effects. They observed that Br2-TITU quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the ATPase protein but increases the fluorescence acquired by bound TNP-AMP upon enzyme phosphorylation. These effects were attributed to inhibition of phosphoenzyme hydrolytic cleavage and increased levels of the phosphoenzyme in the E2P state (1Berman M.C. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We confirmed that Br2-TITU inhibits steady state ATPase activity within the micromolar concentration range with a KI of 20 μm. To characterize the mechanism of inhibition, we then directly measured Ca2+ binding in the absence of ATP, and found that Br2-TITU had no effect on either the affinity or the stoichiometry of binding. Furthermore, phosphoenzyme formation by utilization of ATP in the presence of Ca2+ proceeds very efficiently in the presence of Br2-TITU, and much higher levels of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme are reached in the presence than in the absence of Br2-TITU. We also demonstrated by direct measurements that phosphoenzyme formation by utilization of Pi in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. E2P) is not inhibited by Br2-TITU but is in fact favored when the Pi concentration is limiting. This latter effect may be due to looser A and P domain interaction (see below) and greater accessibility of the phosphorylation site to Pi. Hydrolytic cleavage of E2P is only slightly inhibited by Br2-TITU. The inhibitory effect of Br2-TITU is quite different from that of TG and DBHQ, inasmuch as these inhibitors interfere with Ca2+ binding and enzyme phosphorylation with ATP or Pi.Itis known that TG produces a true dead-end complex, stabilizing a conformation equal or quite similar to E2 (10Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thereby, conversion to the E1–2Ca2+ conformation in the forward direction of the cycle or to the E2P conformation in the reverse direction of the cycle is precluded by TG binding. On the contrary, Br2-TITU does not produce any stabilization of E2 because we found no hindrance to conversion either to E1Ca2 when Ca2+ was added or to E2P when Pi was added in the absence of Ca2+. However, under conditions of ATP utilization in the presence of Ca2+, the inhibitory effect of Br2-TITU was realized by interference with the E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+ transition, resulting in accumulation of E1P-2Ca2+. Thereby, formation of E2P was reduced. These direct measurements contradict previous inferences based on fluorescence measurements (1Berman M.C. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3556-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which suggested that Br2-TITU inhibition results in accumulation of E2P by inhibiting its hydrolytic cleavage and is not likely related to interference with the E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+ transition. The experiments on proteinase K and trypsin digestion are indicative of A domain rotation and gathering of the ATPase cytosolic domains following removal of Ca2+ to yield E2 (15Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Further inclination of the A domain and compact gathering of the headpiece were observed upon addition of Pi to yield E2P. We show here that Br2-TITU interferes significantly with positioning of the A domain and protection of the proteinase K digestion sites as expected in the E2 and E2P states of the ATPase. It is then apparent that in the presence of Br2-TITU, considerable fluctuation of the loops connecting the A domain to the transmembrane region is allowed even when the enzyme is placed in the E2or E2P states by equilibration with EGTA or Pi. Considering the involvement of A domain positioning and interactions with the P domain in specific phosphoenzyme states (6Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 7Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we suggest that the Br2-TITU conformational interference is related to the delay of the E1P-2Ca2+ to E2P-2Ca2+ transition observed in the kinetic experiments. This interference results in accumulation of E1P-2Ca2+ and reduction of the steady state velocity of catalytic and transport activity. Therefore, the Br2-TITU inhibition mechanism is quite different from that of TG, which is based on strong stabilization of the compact headpiece conformation. We thank Professor Chikashi Toyoshima for suggesting the synthesis of Br2-TITU and for very helpful comments."
