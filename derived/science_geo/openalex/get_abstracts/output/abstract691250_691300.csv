https://openalex.org/W4221135099,"Since its emergence in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused hundreds of millions of cases and continues to circulate globally. To establish a novel SARS-CoV-2 human challenge model that enables controlled investigation of pathogenesis, correlates of protection and efficacy testing of forthcoming interventions, 36 volunteers aged 18–29 years without evidence of previous infection or vaccination were inoculated with 10 TCID50 of a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-2/human/GBR/484861/2020) intranasally in an open-label, non-randomized study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04865237 ; funder, UK Vaccine Taskforce). After inoculation, participants were housed in a high-containment quarantine unit, with 24-hour close medical monitoring and full access to higher-level clinical care. The study’s primary objective was to identify an inoculum dose that induced well-tolerated infection in more than 50% of participants, with secondary objectives to assess virus and symptom kinetics during infection. All pre-specified primary and secondary objectives were met. Two participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis owing to seroconversion between screening and inoculation, identified post hoc. Eighteen (~53%) participants became infected, with viral load (VL) rising steeply and peaking at ~5 days after inoculation. Virus was first detected in the throat but rose to significantly higher levels in the nose, peaking at ~8.87 log10 copies per milliliter (median, 95% confidence interval (8.41, 9.53)). Viable virus was recoverable from the nose up to ~10 days after inoculation, on average. There were no serious adverse events. Mild-to-moderate symptoms were reported by 16 (89%) infected participants, beginning 2–4 days after inoculation, whereas two (11%) participants remained asymptomatic (no reportable symptoms). Anosmia or dysosmia developed more slowly in 15 (83%) participants. No quantitative correlation was noted between VL and symptoms, with high VLs present even in asymptomatic infection. All infected individuals developed serum spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Results from lateral flow tests were strongly associated with viable virus, and modeling showed that twice-weekly rapid antigen tests could diagnose infection before 70–80% of viable virus had been generated. Thus, with detailed characterization and safety analysis of this first SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study in young adults, viral kinetics over the course of primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 were established, with implications for public health recommendations and strategies to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Future studies will identify the immune factors associated with protection in those participants who did not develop infection or symptoms and define the effect of prior immunity and viral variation on clinical outcome. In the first SARS-CoV-2 challenge study in humans, 36 young, healthy adult participants were intranasally inoculated with virus and monitored for productive infection, symptoms, virus kinetics, antibody response and safety in a controlled setting."

https://openalex.org/W4220957715,"Profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the bloodstream shows promise for noninvasive cancer detection. Chromatin fragmentation features have previously been explored to infer gene expression profiles from cell-free DNA (cfDNA), but current fragmentomic methods require high concentrations of tumor-derived DNA and provide limited resolution. Here we describe promoter fragmentation entropy as an epigenomic cfDNA feature that predicts RNA expression levels at individual genes. We developed 'epigenetic expression inference from cell-free DNA-sequencing' (EPIC-seq), a method that uses targeted sequencing of promoters of genes of interest. Profiling 329 blood samples from 201 patients with cancer and 87 healthy adults, we demonstrate classification of subtypes of lung carcinoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Applying EPIC-seq to serial blood samples from patients treated with PD-(L)1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors, we show that gene expression profiles inferred by EPIC-seq are correlated with clinical response. Our results indicate that EPIC-seq could enable noninvasive, high-throughput tissue-of-origin characterization with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W4221079645,"Membrane protein efflux pumps confer antibiotic resistance by extruding structurally distinct compounds and lowering their intracellular concentration. Yet, there are no clinically approved drugs to inhibit efflux pumps, which would potentiate the efficacy of existing antibiotics rendered ineffective by drug efflux. Here we identified synthetic antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) that inhibit the quinolone transporter NorA from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Structures of two NorA–Fab complexes determined using cryo-electron microscopy reveal a Fab loop deeply inserted in the substrate-binding pocket of NorA. An arginine residue on this loop interacts with two neighboring aspartate and glutamate residues essential for NorA-mediated antibiotic resistance in MRSA. Peptide mimics of the Fab loop inhibit NorA with submicromolar potency and ablate MRSA growth in combination with the antibiotic norfloxacin. These findings establish a class of peptide inhibitors that block antibiotic efflux in MRSA by targeting indispensable residues in NorA without the need for membrane permeability. Cryo-EM analysis of the quinolone transporter NorA in complex with synthetic antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) inspired peptide mimics of the Fabs that inhibit methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in combination with the antibiotic norfloxacin."
https://openalex.org/W4221093994,"Drought is one of the most serious abiotic stress factors limiting crop yields. Although sunflower is considered a moderate drought-tolerant plant, drought stress still has a negative impact on sunflower yield as cultivation expands into arid regions. The extent of drought stress is varieties and time-dependent, however, the molecular response mechanisms of drought tolerance in sunflower with different varieties are still unclear. Here, we performed comparative physiological and transcriptome analyses on two sunflower inbred lines with different drought tolerance at the seedling stage. The analysis of nine physiological and biochemical indicators showed that the leaf surface area, leaf relative water content, and cell membrane integrity of drought tolerance inbred line were higher than those of drought-sensitive inbred line under drought stress, indicating that DT had stronger drought resistance. Transcriptome analyses identified 24,234 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed the up-regulated genes were mainly enriched in gibberellin metabolism and rRNA processing, while the down-regulated genes were mainly enriched in cell-wall, photosynthesis, and terpene metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway analysis showed genes related to GABAergic synapse, ribosome biogenesis were up-regulated, while genes related with amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, photosynthesis were down-regulated. Mapman analysis revealed differences in plant hormone-signaling genes over time and between samples. A total of 1,311 unique putative transcription factors (TFs) were identified from all DEGs by iTAK, among which the high abundance of transcription factor families include bHLH, AP2/ERF, MYB, C2H2, etc. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed a total of 2,251 genes belonging to two modules(blue 4, lightslateblue), respectively, which were significantly associated with six traits. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of these genes was performed, followed by visualization with Cytoscape software, and the top 20 Hub genes were screened using the CytoHubba plugin."
https://openalex.org/W4221069135,"Nucleos(t)ide analogs are standard-of-care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and can effectively reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication but rarely leads to cure. Nucleos(t)ide analogs do not directly eliminate the viral episome, therefore treatment cessation typically leads to rapid viral rebound. While treatment is effective, HBV DNA is still detectable (although not quantifiable) in the periphery of the majority of nucleos(t)ide analog treated HBV patients, even after prolonged treatment. Addressing whether the detectable HBV DNA represents infectious virus is a key unknown and has important implications for the development of a curative treatment for HBV. The minimum HBV genome equivalents required to establish infection in human liver chimeric mice was determined by titration of HBV patient sera and the infectivity in chimeric mice of serum from patients (n = 7) suppressed to the limit of detection on nucleos(t)ide analog therapy was evaluated. A minimum of 5 HBV genome equivalents were required to establish infection in the chimeric mice, confirming this model has sufficient sensitivity to determine whether serum from virally suppressed patients contains infectious virus. Strikingly, serum from 75% (n = 3 out of 4) of nucleos(t)ide-treated HBV patients with DNA that was detectable, but below the lower limit of quantitation, also established infection in the chimeric mice. These results demonstrate that infectious virus is still present in some HBV patients on suppressive nucleos(t)ide therapy. This residual virus may support viral persistence via continuous infection and explain the ongoing risk for HBV-related complications despite long-term suppression on therapy. Thus, additional treatment intensification may facilitate HBV cure."
https://openalex.org/W4220734042,"This research article presents the magnetohydrodynamic Casson fluid flow through an extending surface embedded in a porous medium. Furthermore, the Casson fluid flow is investigated under the effects of thermal radiation, Joule heating, viscous dissipation, and chemical reaction. The analytical solution of the modeled problem is utilized with the help of homotopy analysis method (HAM). The convergence region of the applied technique is portrayed graphically. The impacts of the embedded factors on the flow profiles are exhibited with the help of figures. Furthermore, numerical values of the surface drag force, heat, and mass transfer rates are highlighted via table. The results show that the augmented Darcy number, Casson and magnetic parameters have declined the velocity profile of the Casson fluid flow. Growth in Brownian motion augments the chaotic motion amongst the particles due to which the kinetic energy of the particles transforms to heat energy which consequently augmented the thermal profile, while reduced the concentration profile. The mass and energy profiles are positively effects with the increment of thermophoresis term. And the growing values of chemical reaction and Lewis number cause a reduction in the diffusivity of mass of fluid due to which less transfer of mass takes place that weakens the concentration layer thickness and declines the concentration profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4225884742,"Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) has emerged as a viable molecular diagnostic method to expand the breadth and reach of nucleic acid testing, particularly for SARS-CoV-2 detection and surveillance. While rapidly growing in prominence, RT-LAMP remains a relatively new method compared to the standard RT-qPCR, and contribution to our body of knowledge on designing LAMP primer sets and assays can have significant impact on its utility and adoption. Here we select and evaluate 18 LAMP primer sets for SARS-CoV-2 previously identified as sensitive ones under various conditions, comparing their speed and sensitivity with two LAMP formulations each with 2 reaction temperatures. We find that both LAMP formulations have some effects on the speed and detection sensitivity and identify several primer sets with similar high sensitivity for different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. Significantly we observe a consistent sensitivity enhancement by combining primer sets for different targets, confirming and building on earlier work to create a simple, general approach to building better and more sensitive RT-LAMP assays."
https://openalex.org/W4226229595,"Background Multiple conditions are more prevalent in some minoritised ethnic groups and are associated with higher mortality rate but studies examining differential mortality once conditions are established is US-based. Our study tested whether the association between multiple conditions and mortality varies across ethnic groups in England. Methods and findings A random sample of primary care patients from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was followed from 1 st January 2015 until 31 st December 2019. Ethnicity, usually self-ascribed, was obtained from primary care records if present or from hospital records. Long-term conditions were counted from a list of 32 that have previously been associated with greater primary care, hospital admissions, or mortality risk. Cox regression models were used to estimate mortality by count of conditions, ethnicity and their interaction, with adjustment for age and sex for 532,059 patients with complete data. During five years of follow-up, 5.9% of patients died. Each additional condition at baseline was associated with increased mortality. The direction of the interaction of number of conditions with ethnicity showed a statistically higher mortality rate associated with long-term conditions in Pakistani, Black African, Black Caribbean and Other Black ethnic groups. In ethnicity-stratified models, the mortality rate per additional condition at age 50 was 1.33 (95% CI 1.31,1.35) for White ethnicity, 1.43 (95% CI 1.26,1.61) for Black Caribbean ethnicity and 1.78 (95% CI 1.41,2.24) for Other Black ethnicity. Conclusions The higher mortality rate associated with having multiple conditions is greater in minoritised compared with White ethnic groups. Research is now needed to identify factors that contribute to these inequalities. Within the health care setting, there may be opportunities to target clinical and self-management support for people with multiple conditions from minoritised ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W4229368291,"The processes of activation, extravasation, and migration of immune cells to a site are early and essential steps in the induction of an acute inflammatory response. These events are an essential part of the inflammatory cascade, which involves multiple regulatory steps. Using a murine air pouch model of inflammation with LPS as an inflammation inducer, we demonstrate that isoenzymes of the neuraminidase family (NEU1, 3, and 4) play essential roles in these processes by acting as positive or negative regulators of leukocyte infiltration. In genetically knocked-out (KO) mice for different NEU genes (Neu1 KO, Neu3 KO, Neu4 KO, and Neu3/4 double KO mice) with LPS-induced air pouch inflammation, leukocytes at the site of inflammation were counted, and the inflamed tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Our data show that leukocyte recruitment was decreased in NEU1- and NEU3-deficient mice, while it was increased in NEU4-deficient animals. Consistent with these results, systemic as well as pouch exudate levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced in Neu1 and increased in Neu4 KO mice. Pharmacological inhibitors specific for NEU1, NEU3, and NEU4 isoforms also affected leukocyte recruitment. Together our data demonstrate that NEU isoenzymes have distinct-and even opposing-effects on leukocyte recruitment, and therefore warrant further investigation to determine their mechanisms and importance as regulators of the inflammatory cascade."
https://openalex.org/W4220833004,"Despite growing knowledge, much remains unknown regarding how signaling within neural networks translate into specific behaviors. To pursue this quest, we need better understanding of the behavioral output under different experimental conditions. Zebrafish is a key model to study the relationship between network and behavior and illumination is a factor known to influence behavioral output. By only assessing behavior under dark or light conditions, one might miss behavioral phenotypes exclusive to the neglected illumination setting. Here, we identified locomotor behavior, using different rearing regimes and experimental illumination settings, to showcase the need to assess behavior under both light and dark conditions. Characterization of free-swimming zebrafish larvae, housed under continuous darkness or a day/night cycle, did not reveal behavioral differences; larvae were most active during light conditions. However, larvae housed under a day/night cycle moved a shorter distance, had lower maximum velocity and maximum acceleration during the startle response under light conditions. Next, we explored if we could assess behavior under both dark and light conditions by presenting these conditions in sequence, using the same batch of larvae. Our experiments yielded similar results as observed for naïve larvae: higher activity during light conditions, regardless of order of illumination (i.e. dark-light or light-dark). Finally, we conducted these sequenced illumination conditions in an experimental setting by characterizing behavioral phenotypes in larvae following neuromast ablation. Depending on the illumination during testing, the behavioral phenotype following ablation was characterized differently. In addition, the results indicate that the order in which the light and dark conditions are presented has to be considered, as habituation may occur. Our study adds to existing literature on illumination-related differences in zebrafish behavior and emphasize the need to explore behavioral phenotypes under both light and dark condition to maximize our understanding of how experimental permutations affect behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4221039001,"Mobile health (mHealth) applications may improve timely access to health services and improve patient-provider communication, but the upfront costs of implementation may be prohibitive, especially in resource-limited settings.We measured the costs of developing and implementing an mHealth-facilitated, home-based strategy for tuberculosis (TB) contact investigation in Kampala, Uganda, between February 2014 and July 2017. We compared routine implementation involving community health workers (CHWs) screening and referring household contacts to clinics for TB evaluation to home-based HIV testing and sputum collection and transport with test results delivered by automated short messaging services (SMS). We carried out key informant interviews with CHWs and asked them to complete time-and-motion surveys. We estimated program costs from the perspective of the Ugandan health system, using top-down and bottom-up (components-based) approaches. We estimated total costs per contact investigated and per TB-positive contact identified in 2018 US dollars, one and five years after program implementation.The total top-down cost was $472,327, including $358,504 (76%) for program development and $108,584 (24%) for program implementation. This corresponded to $320-$348 per household contact investigated and $8,873-$9,652 per contact diagnosed with active TB over a 5-year period. CHW time was spent primarily evaluating household contacts who returned to the clinic for evaluation (median 30 minutes per contact investigated, interquartile range [IQR]: 30-70), collecting sputum samples (median 29 minutes, IQR: 25-30) and offering HIV testing services (median 28 minutes, IQR: 17-43). Cost estimates were sensitive to infrastructural capacity needs, program reach, and the epidemiological yield of contact investigation.Over 75% of all costs of the mHealth-facilitated TB contact investigation strategy were dedicated to establishing mHealth infrastructure and capacity. Implementing the mHealth strategy at scale and maintaining it over a longer time horizon could help decrease development costs as a proportion of total costs."
https://openalex.org/W4220813781,"Analyses of livestock genomes have been used to detect selection signatures, which are genomic regions associated with traits under selection leading to a change in allele frequency. The objective of the present study was to characterize selection signatures in Canchim composite beef cattle using cross-population analyses with the founder Nelore and Charolais breeds. High-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were available on 395 Canchim representing the target population, along with genotypes from 809 Nelore and 897 Charolais animals representing the reference populations. Most of the selection signatures were co-located with genes whose functions agree with the expectations of the breeding programs; these genes have previously been reported to associate with meat quality, as well as reproductive traits. Identified genes were related to immunity, adaptation, morphology, as well as behavior, could give new perspectives for understanding the genetic architecture of Canchim. Some selection signatures identified genes that were recently introduced in Canchim, such as the loci related to the polled trait."
https://openalex.org/W4220917123,"Although the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Nasal Mid-Turbinate swab (NMTS) is often used due to its higher tolerance among patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of the NPS and the NMTS for the Panbio™ COVID-19 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT). Two hundred and forty-three individuals were swabbed three times by healthcare professionals: a NMTS and a NPS specimen for the Ag-RDT and an oropharyngeal swab for real time RT-PCR. Forty-nine participants were RNA-SARS-CoV-2 positive by real time RT-PCR: 45 and 40 were positive by the Ag-RDT with NPS and NMTS, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 91.8% (95% CI: 83.2-100.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 98.2-100.0) for Ag-RDT with NPS, and 81.6% (95% CI: 69.8-93.5) and 100.0% (95% CI: 99.7-100.0) for the Ag-RDT with NMTS. The Cohen's kappa index was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.98). Among asymptomatic individuals, the Ag-RDT with both sampling techniques showed a high sensitivity [100.0% (95% CI: 95.5-100.0) with NPS; 90.9% (95% CI: 69.4-100.0) with NMTS], while the performance of the test decreased in samples with Ct≥ 30 and in patients tested after the first 7 days from symptom onset. Although the NMTS yielded a lower sensitivity compared to NPS, it might be considered a reliable alternative, as it presents greater adherence among patients, enabling scaling of antigen testing strategies, particularly in countries with under-resourced health systems."
https://openalex.org/W4220674117,"Background Some latrines remain unused even under conditions of high coverage in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. Not much is known on household latrine use in the long term in the absence of an intervention. The current work assesses drivers and barriers to sustained use of a ventilated improved pit latrine (Blair VIP) design where it originated and how rural households adapt it to climate change. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted from November 2020 to May 2021 among rural households of Mbire district, Zimbabwe. A cross sectional survey of 238 households with Blair ventilated improved pit (BVIP) latrines was conducted using a questionnaire and a latrine observation checklist. Data were analysed using logistic regression. Qualitative data were collected using six focus groups among house heads and analysed by thematic analysis. Result The latrine has perceived health, non-health and hygiene benefits for its sustained use. However, there are design, environmental and social barriers. The quantitative study indicated that determinants of latrine use were contextual (individual and household levels) and technology (individual level) factors. Focus groups indicated that latrine use was influenced by social, technology and contextual factors at multiple level factors. Interplay of factors influenced the intention to adapt the BVIP latrine to climate change. Local climate change adaptation strategies for the latrine were odour and erosion control, construction of the conventional latrine design and raised structures. Conclusion The conventional BVIP latrine design is durable and relatively resilient to climate change with high local household use. High construction cost of the latrine causes households to build incomplete and poor quality designs which affect odour and fly control. These are barriers to sustained latrine use. The government should implement the new sanitation policy which considers alternative sanitation options and offer community support for adapting sanitation to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4220687272,"Even though running enjoys growing popularity, the effects of fatigue on the running kinematics of novices have rarely been studied. This is surprising, given the risk of running-related injuries when detrimental movement patterns are adopted. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of fatigue induced by a high-intensity running protocol on spatiotemporal and stiffness parameters as well as on joint kinematics and center of mass (CoM) motion in novice runners. 14 participants performed a standardized treadmill familiarization and ran at 13 km/h until voluntary exhaustion. Kinematics were captured using a 3D motion capture system. Spatiotemporal and stiffness parameters as well as the range of motion (RoM) of the joints and CoM were compared by use of paired t-tests. Time series of the joint angles and CoM motion were analyzed by the statistical parametric mapping method. The results revealed that novice runners did not change spatiotemporal or stiffness parameters, but showed adaptations in joint kinematics, e.g. decreased dorsiflexion and increased pronation in the ankle joint during the swing phase. The findings of this study underline the importance of strengthening the ankle joint to prevent excessive pronation and increase its stability in novice runners."
https://openalex.org/W4220709435,"This paper explored how the government provides low-carbon subsidies for the manufacturers, retailers, and consumers in a secondary supply chain under cap-and-trade scheme. We calculated the best prices, emissions reductions, and the demands for common and low-carbon products when subsidizing each of the abovementioned market players. In particular, a comparative analysis of their equilibrium outcomes was made thereafter. The MATLAB simulation found that the optimal emissions reductions under the three subsidy modes were even and positively correlated to low-carbon subsidies, which, however, negatively correlated to the prices of both product types. Higher subsidies drove up demand for low-carbon products and dragged down that for common goods. But the prices of these products maintained the highest levels when consumers were subsidized; demand for common products was greater when subsidies went to retailers than to manufacturers or consumers, consequently generating the largest emissions and highest profits. When the subsidies were greater than <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>18</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>48</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math> , all three subsidy modes saw a drop in total carbon emissions.

There are many software development models such as waterfall, Iterative, Rapid Application Development (RAD), Spiral, Agile, Z, and AZ model. Each development model follows a series of steps to develop a product. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses. In this study, we have investigated different software development process models using the six-pointed star framework. Six-point star is a framework of project management industry standards maintained by Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). A survey is designed to evaluate the performance of well-known software process models in the context of factors defined by the six-point star framework. The survey is conducted with experienced users of the software industry. The statistical analysis and comparison of results obtained by the survey are further used to examine the effectiveness of each model for the development of high-quality software concerning lightweight and heavyweight methodologies for small, medium and large scale projects. After exploring the results of all factors of the six-pointed star model, we conclude that lightweight methodology easily handles small-scale projects. The heavyweight methodology is suitable for medium and large-scale projects, whereas the AZ model, which is one of the latest models, works efficiently with both small-scale and large-scale categories of projects."
https://openalex.org/W4220882579,"Visual deficits are common after stroke and are powerful predictors for the chronic functional outcome. However, while basic visual field and recognition deficits are relatively easy to assess with standardized methods, selective deficits in visual primitives, such as shape or motion, are harder to identify, as they often require a symmetrical bilateral posterior lesion in order to provoke full field deficits. Therefore, we do not know how often they occur. Nevertheless, they can have severe repercussions for daily-life functioning. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and co-occurrence of hemifield ""mid-range"" visual deficits (i.e. color, shape, location, orientation, correlated motion, contrast, texture and glossiness), using a novel experimental set-up with a gaze-contingent presentation of the stimuli. To this end, a prospective cohort of 220 ischemic (sub)cortical stroke patients and a healthy control group was assessed with this set-up. When comparing performance of patients with controls, the results showed that deficits in motion-perception were most prevalent (26%), followed by color (22%), texture (22%), location (21%), orientation (18%), contrast (14%), shape (14%) and glossiness (13%). 63% of the stroke patients showed one or more mid-range visual deficits. Overlap of deficits was small; they mostly occurred in isolation or co-occurred with only one or two other deficits. To conclude, it was found that deficits in ""mid-range"" visual functions were very prevalent. These deficits are likely to affect the chronic post-stroke condition. Since we found no strong patterns of co-occurrences, we suggest that an assessment of deficits at this level of visual processing requires screening the full range of visual functions."
https://openalex.org/W4220922917,"Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are the most common pediatric solid tumors, where low grade (LGG) and high grade gliomas (HGG) represent up to 55% of CNS tumors. Current molecular classification of these tumors results in a more accurate diagnosis and risk stratification, which ultimately enables individualized treatment strategies. Identifying known alterations is a suitable approach, particularly in developing countries, where NGS approaches are not easily accessible. We sought to assess molecular alterations in BRAF and histone 3 genes.FISH, IHC and Sanger sequencing were performed in a series of 102 pediatric glial and glioneuronal tumors. We also correlated these results with clinical and histological findings to evaluate their usefulness as diagnostic and/or prognostic tools.We found that the KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusion was a relevant diagnostic tool for pilocytic astrocytoma, but not related to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). BRAFV600E mutation was associated with a decreased OS in LGG, and with decreased PFS and OS among pilocytic astrocytomas. All HGG of the midline were H3K27M mutants, while H3G34R mutant cases were located in brain hemispheres. HGG harboring the H3K27M variant were associated with a decreased PFS and OS.Assessing druggable molecular markers with prognostic value is particularly important in those cases where complete resection or further radiation therapy is not possible. These potential diagnostic/prognostic markers may be suitable as further screening tests to reduce the requirement on NGS, which is not available in all laboratories. Furthermore, these results broaden data on BRAF and Histone 3 alterations in children from geographic regions, other than USA and Europe."
https://openalex.org/W4220972540,"Since the Yellow River is a main source of water in Ningxia China, maintaining its healthy ecological environment is vital to Ningxia and the neighboring areas. Changes of land use caused by human activities such as population growth, urbanizing process, and industrial and mining construction would affect the balance and cycle of water in the Basin. Therefore, investigating hydrological responses of land use changes can provide insights into the characteristics and evolution of runoff the Yellow River Basin in the Ningxia section. This has imperative and practical significance to the rational use, allocation, and planning of water resources in a changing environment. In this paper, we analyzed the meteorological and hydrological elements of changing characteristics of the Yellow River Basin in the Ningxia section. Then we selected a distribution-based hydrology model of SWAT in combination with GIS to simulate annual and monthly runoff under different land use scenarios. Finally, we analyzed the influence caused by the changes of land use on runoff. We concluded that it is appropriate to lay a decision-making foundation to manage water resources of the Yellow River Basin in the Ningxia section."

Surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity of sternocleidomastoid (SCM), scalene (ESC), and rectus femoris (RF) were recorded during ISWT. sEMG activity was analyzed in time and frequency domains at baseline and during the test (33%, 66%, and 100% of ISWT total time) to obtain, respectively, signal amplitude and power spectrum density (EMG median frequency [MF], high- and low-frequency bands, and high/low [H/L] ratio).Asthma group walked a shorter distance than controls (p = 0.0007). sEMG amplitudes of SCM, ESC, and RF of asthma and COPD groups were higher at 33% and 66% of ISWT compared with controls groups (all p<0.05). SCM and ESC of COPD group remained higher until 100% of the test. MF of ESC and RF decreased in asthma group (p = 0.016 and p < 0.0001, respectively) versus controls, whereas MF of SCM (p < 0.0001) decreased in COPD group compared with controls. H/L ratio of RF decreased (p = 0.002) in COPD group versus controls.Reduced performance is accompanied by increased electromyographic activity of SCM and ESC and activation of RF in individuals with obstructive respiratory diseases during ISWT. These are susceptible to be more pronounced respiratory and peripheral muscle fatigue than healthy subjects during exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4220680560,"We evaluated the feasibility of the Framingham stroke risk score (FSRS) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scores for asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS). In addition, we developed novel risk prediction models for ischemic stroke and composite outcomes by combining ultrasonographic parameters and conventional cardiovascular risk scores. We retrospectively enrolled 612 patients with ACS greater than 50% over 7 years and evaluated them using transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex ultrasonography. In total, 150 patients were included in the analysis. During the mean 5-year follow-up, 6 ischemic strokes and 25 composite events were detected. Among all ultrasonographic parameters, only a higher peak-systolic velocity/end-diastolic velocity ratio was detected and significantly associated with an increased risk of relevant ischemic stroke (hazard ratio: 1.502, 95% confidence interval: 1.036-1.968). The C-statistics of the FSRS and ASCVD risk scores were 0.646 and 0.649, respectively, for relevant ischemic stroke, and 0.612 and 0.649, respectively, for composite outcomes. C-statistics of the FSRS and ASCVD risk scores combined with ultrasonographic parameters increased to 0.937 and 0.941, respectively, for ischemic stroke, and 0.856 and 0.886, respectively, for composite outcomes. The study suggests that inclusion of ultrasonographic parameters in conventional cardiovascular scores helps identify the risk of further vascular events in ACS patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220756748,"Work-related upper extremity disorders are costly to society due to resulting medical costs, presenteeism and absenteeism. Although their aetiology is likely multifactorial, physical workplace factors are known to play an important role in their development. Promising options for preventing work-related upper extremity disorders include assistive technologies such as dynamic arm supports designed to follow the movement of the arm while compensating for its weight. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a dynamic arm support on perceived exertion, muscle activity and movement patterns of the upper limb during repetitive manual tasks in healthy individuals. Thirty healthy right-handed individuals were allocated either a static or a dynamic task to perform with and without a dynamic arm support. During the task, surface electromyographic activity (anterior and middle deltoid, upper trapezius) and upper limb kinematics (elbow, shoulder, sternoclavicular) were measured using surface EMG and inertial sensors. Results showed that the dynamic arm support significantly reduced perceived exertion during the tasks and limited the development of muscular fatigue of the anterior and middle deltoid as demonstrated by EMG signal mean epoch amplitudes and median frequency of the EMG power spectrum. The dynamic arm support also prevented a decrease in shoulder elevation and an increase in total shoulder joint excursion during static and dynamic task, respectively. These results denote the potential benefits of dynamic arm supports in work environments. Further studies should focus on their efficacy, acceptability and implementability in work settings."
https://openalex.org/W4220777175,"Deer genera around the globe are threatened by anthropogenic interference. The translocation of alien species and their subsequent genetic introgression into indigenous deer populations is particularly harmful to the species of greatest conservation concern. Products derived from deer, including venison and antler velvet, are also at risk of fraudulent labeling. The current molecular markers used to genetically identify deer species were developed from genome sequences and have limited applicability for cross-species amplification. The absence of efficacious diagnostic techniques for identifying deer species has hampered conservation and wildlife crime investigation efforts. Expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers are reliable tools for individual and species identification, especially in terms of cross-species genotyping. We conducted transcriptome sequencing of sambar (Rusa unicolor) antler velvet and acquired 11,190 EST-SSRs from 65,074 newly assembled unigenes. We identified a total of 55 unambiguous amplicons in sambar (n = 45), which were selected as markers to evaluate cross-species genotyping in sika deer (Cervus nippon, n = 30) and red deer (Cervus elaphus, n = 46), resulting in cross-species amplification rates of 94.5% and 89.1%, respectively. Based on polymorphic information content (>0.25) and genotyping fidelity, we selected 16 of these EST-SSRs for species identification. This marker set revealed significant genetic differentiation based on the fixation index and genetic distance values. Principal coordinate analysis and STRUCTURE analysis revealed distinct clusters of species and clearly identified red-sika hybrids. These markers showed applicability across different genera and proved suitable for identification and phylogenetic analyses across deer species."
https://openalex.org/W4220819365,"To determine the proportion of patients undergoing hysterectomy for a benign indication who have unexpected malignancy (UM) on postoperative pathology and characterize the nature of UMs.This was a multi-center, retrospective study of patients undergoing hysterectomy for a benign indication from July 2016 to December 2019 at 7 Ontario, Canada hospitals (4 academic, 3 community). Hysterectomies for invasive placentation, malignant, and premalignant indications were excluded. Primary outcome was rate of unexpected malignancy as defined by the number of patients with malignancy on final pathology divided by the total number of hysterectomy cases. Data was extracted from health records and electronic charts. Patient, surgical, and surgeon characteristics were compared between benign and UM groups using bivariate methods. Associations between UM status and perioperative variables were assessed using bivariate logistic regression.In the study period, 2779 hysterectomies were performed. UM incidence was 1.8% (51 malignancies/2779 cases), with one patient having two malignancies (total UMs = 52). The most common UM types were endometrial (27/52, 51.9%) and sarcoma (13/52, 25%). Patients with UM were older (57.2 ± 11.4 years vs. 52.8 ± 12.5 years, p = .015), had more previous laparotomies (2 (1.25, 2.0) vs. 1 (1.0, 1.0), p < .001), and higher BMI (29.7 ± 7.2 kg/m2 vs. 28.0 ± 5.9 kg/m2, p = .049) and ASA class (p < .028). Regarding surgical factors, patients with UM had more adhesions (p = .001), transfusions (p = .020), and blood loss (p = .006) compared to those with benign pathology. Patient characteristics most strongly associated with UM were age (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.78-3.72, p < .001) and preoperative diagnosis of pelvic mass (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.20, p = .019).Incidence of UM at hysterectomy for benign indication was 1.8%. Several perioperative variables are associated with an increased chance of UM."
https://openalex.org/W4220844776,"Decellularised heart valve roots offer a promising option for heart valve replacement in young patients, having the potential to remodel and repair. Replacement heart valves have to undergo billions of opening and closing cycles throughout the patient’s lifetime. Therefore, understanding the effect of cyclic loading on decellularised heart valve roots is important prior to human implantation. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate the influence of low concentration sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) decellularisation treatment on the in vitro real time mechanical fatigue of porcine aortic heart valve roots under physiological real time cyclic loading conditions. This required a specific real time in vitro method to be developed, since previous methods relied on accelerated testing, which is non-physiological, and not appropriate for valve replacement materials that exhibit time dependent characteristics. The effects of the real time fatigue on hydrodynamic function and mechanical properties of the heart valve roots were assessed. The mechanical fatigue of decellularised porcine aortic heart valve roots (n = 6) was assessed and compared to cellular porcine aortic heart valve roots (n = 6) in a modified Real time Wear Tester (RWT) at a physiological frequency and under cyclic pressure conditions for a maximum of 1.2 million cycles. Periodically, the heart valve roots were removed from the RWT to assess the influence of cyclic loading on valve competency (static leaflet closure). At the end of testing further hydrodynamic performance parameters were ascertained, along with determination of leaflet material properties. A real time mechanical fatigue assessment method was developed and applied; with two cellular and two decellularised porcine aortic leaflets in different heart valve roots showing tears in the belly region. The decellularised aortic heart valve roots exhibited comparative functionality to the cellular heart valve roots under in vitro static and pulsatile hydrodynamic conditions. However, the material properties of the decellularised aortic leaflets were significantly altered following cyclic fatigue assessment and showed increases in elastin and collagen phase slopes and ultimate tensile strength compared to the cellular porcine aortic leaflets in the circumferential direction. This preliminary study demonstrated that low concentration SDS decellularised porcine aortic heart valve roots can withstand physiological cyclic deformations up to 1.2 million cycles in a RWT whilst maintaining their overall hydrodynamic function and leaflet mechanical properties. This is the first full report of preclinical mechanical fatigue assessment of decellularised porcine aortic heart valve roots under physiological real time conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4220876593,"Quality of life (QoL) is a key outcome in healthcare. However, whether cognitively impaired people with Parkinson's disease (PD) can reliably self-report QoL is unclear, and patients are often excluded from studies based on cognition test scores. The aim of this analysis was to assess the validity of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) in PD patients with and without cognitive impairment.In this study, 221 individuals with PD completed the PDQ-39, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The PDQ-39's internal consistency, convergent validity with BDI-II, and floor and ceiling effects were analyzed for patients with and without cognitive impairment.Ninety-four patients showed cognitive impairment (MOCA <21), whereas 127 patients had mild/no impairment. Both MOCA groups differed significantly with regards to PD severity. The PDQ-39's internal consistency was adequate for most subdomains in both MOCA groups, but floor effects were present for the subdomains Stigmatization, Social Support and Communication, regardless of impairment. For some subdomains, the PDQ-39's convergent validity with the BDI receded in the low MOCA group but remained significant for most PDQ-39 domains, especially for the PDQ total score (r = .386, p < .001) and for the subdomain emotional well-being (r = .446, p < .001).The PDQ-39 can be used to measure QoL in cognitively impaired PD patients, thus test scores indicating cognitive impairment alone should not lead to exclusion of PD patients from clinical studies. Although the correlation between BDI-II and PDQ-39 shrinks for some subdomains in cognitively impairment patients, this finding may be explained by the difference in PD severity, as factors influencing QoL may shift with increasing age and PD symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W4220892888,"There is a need for reliable serological assays to determine accurate estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence. Most single target antigen assays have shown some limitations in Africa. To assess the performance of a multi-antigen assay, we evaluated a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay for human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria.Validation of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was carried out using well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reactive positive (97) and pre-COVID-19 pandemic (86) plasma panels. Cross-reactivity was assessed using pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma specimens (213) from the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS).The overall sensitivity of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was 75.3% [95% CI: 65.8%- 82.8%] and specificity was 99.0% [95% CI: 96.8%- 99.7%]. The sensitivity estimate increased to 83.3% [95% CI: 70.4%- 91.3%] for specimens >14 days post-confirmation of diagnosis. However, using the NAIIS pre-pandemic specimens, the false positivity rate was 1.4% (3/213).Our results showed overall lower sensitivity and a comparable specificity with the manufacturer's validation. There appears to be less cross-reactivity with NAIIS pre-pandemic COVID-19 specimens using the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay. In-country SARS-CoV-2 serology assay validation can help guide the best choice of assays in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4220988588,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of serious neonatal infection but its role in maternal morbidity has received little investigation. The aim of this study was to determine whether GBS colonization at delivery is associated with increased risk of maternal peripartum infection.In this prospective cohort study, 1746 unselected women had a vaginal-rectal culture taken at the onset of labor. Diagnosis of maternal peripartum infection was based on a combination of two or more signs or symptoms including fever, breast pain, severe wound or pelvic pain, purulent discharge and abnormal laboratory tests including C-reactive protein and white blood cell count occurring from labor until 2 weeks postpartum. The main outcome measure was the proportion of women with maternal peripartum infection according to GBS colonization status.A total of 25.9% (452/1746) women were colonized with GBS. The rate of peripartum infection was almost twice as high in colonized women (49/452 [10.8%]) vs. non-colonized women (81/1294 [6.3%]); OR 1.82 [1.26-2.64], p = 0.002). This association was confirmed in a multivariable model (OR 1.99 [1.35-2.95], p = 0.001). Women diagnosed with peripartum infection had a significantly longer hospital stay compared to women without peripartum infection (4 days (median) vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). Length of hospital stay did not differ between colonized and non-colonized women. Serotype IV GBS was more frequent in colonized women with peripartum infection than in women without peripartum infection (29.3% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.003).GBS colonization at delivery is associated with increased risk of peripartum infection. Whether this increase is due directly to invasion by GBS or whether GBS colonization is associated with a more general vulnerability to infection remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W4221138160,"Altered movement patterns have been proposed as an etiological factor for the development of musculoskeletal pain. Fatigue influences upper limb kinematics and movement performance which could extend to the contralateral limb and potentially increasing risk of injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fatigue at the dominant arm on the contralateral upper limb movement.Forty participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Control or Fatigue Group. All participants completed a reaching task at the baseline and post-experimental phase, during which they reached four targets with their non-dominant arm in a virtual reality environment. Following the baseline phase, the Fatigue Group completed a shoulder fatigue protocol with their dominant arm only, while the Control Group took a 10-minute break. Thereafter, the reaching task was repeated. Upper limb and trunk kinematics (joint angles and excursions), spatiotemporal (speed and accuracy) and surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity (sEMG signal mean epoch amplitude and median frequency of the EMG power spectrum) were collected. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA were performed to determine the effects of Time, Group and of the interaction between these factors.There was a significant Time x Group interaction for sternoclavicular elevation range of motion (p = 0.040), movement speed (p = 0.043) and accuracy (p = 0.033). The Fatigue group showed higher contralateral sternoclavicular elevation and increased movement error while experiencing fatigue in the dominant arm. Moreover, the Control group increased their speed during the Post-experimental phase compared to baseline (p = 0.043), while the Fatigue group did not show any speed improvement. There was no EMG sign of fatigue in any of the muscles evaluated.This study showed that fatigue at the dominant shoulder impacts movement at the contralateral upper limb. Such changes may be a risk factor for the development of shoulder pain in both the fatigued and non-fatigued limbs."
https://openalex.org/W4225469030,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has overloaded the diagnostic capacity of laboratories by the gold standard method rRT-PCR. This disease has a high spread rate and almost a quarter of infected individuals never develop symptoms. In this scenario, active surveillance is crucial to stop the virus propagation.Between July 2020 and April 2021, 11,580 oropharyngeal swab samples collected in closed and semi-closed institutions were processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection in pools, implementing this strategy for the first time in Córdoba, Argentina. Five-sample pools were constituted before nucleic acid extraction and amplification by rRT-PCR. Comparative analysis of cycle threshold (Ct) values from positive pools and individual samples along with a cost-benefit report of the whole performance of the results was performed.From 2,314 5-sample pools tested, 158 were classified as positive (6.8%), 2,024 as negative (87.5%), and 132 were categorized as indeterminate (5.7%). The Ct value shift due to sample dilution showed an increase in Ct of 2.6±1.53 cycles for N gene and 2.6±1.78 for ORF1ab gene. Overall, 290 pools were disassembled and 1,450 swabs were analyzed individually. This strategy allowed correctly identifying 99.8% of the samples as positive (7.6%) or negative (92.2%), avoiding the execution of 7,806 rRT-PCR reactions which represents a cost saving of 67.5%.This study demonstrates the feasibility of pooling samples to increase the number of tests performed, helping to maximize molecular diagnostic resources and reducing the work overload of specialized personnel during active surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4225688097,"An infant's everyday visual environment is composed of a complex array of entities, some of which are well integrated into their surroundings. Although infants are already sensitive to some categories in their first year of life, it is not clear which visual information supports their detection of meaningful elements within naturalistic scenes. Here we investigated the impact of image characteristics on 8-month-olds' search performance using a gaze contingent eye-tracking search task. Infants had to detect a target patch on a background image. The stimuli consisted of images taken from three categories: vegetation, non-living natural elements (e.g., stones), and manmade artifacts, for which we also assessed target background differences in lower- and higher-level visual properties. Our results showed that larger target-background differences in the statistical properties scaling invariance and entropy, and also stimulus backgrounds including low pictorial depth, predicted better detection performance. Furthermore, category membership only affected search performance if supported by luminance contrast. Data from an adult comparison group also indicated that infants' search performance relied more on lower-order visual properties than adults. Taken together, these results suggest that infants use a combination of property- and category-related information to parse complex visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4225854329,"The susceptibility of Asian tiger mosquitoes to DENV-2 in different seasons was observed in simulated field environments as a reference to design dengue fever control strategies in Guangzhou. The life table experiments of mosquitoes in four seasons were carried out in the field. The susceptibility of Ae. albopictus to dengue virus was observed in both environments in Guangzhou in summer and winter. Ae. albopictus was infected with dengue virus by oral feeding. On day 7 and 14 after infection, the viral load in the head, ovary, and midgut of the mosquito was detected using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Immune-associated gene expression in infected mosquitoes was performed using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The hatching rate and pupation rate of Ae. albopictus larvae in different seasons differed significantly. The winter hatching rate of larvae was lower than that in summer, and the incubation time was longer than in summer. In the winter field environment, Ae. albopictus still underwent basic growth and development processes. Mosquitoes in the simulated field environment were more susceptible to DENV-2 than those in the simulated laboratory environment. In the midgut, viral RNA levels on day 7 in summer were higher than those on day 7 in winter (F = 14.459, P = 0.01); ovarian viral RNA levels on day 7 in summer were higher than those on day 7 in winter (F = 8.656, P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in the viral load at other time points (P > 0.05). Dicer-2 mRNA expression on day 7 in winter was 4.071 times than that on day 7 in summer: the viral load and Dicer-2 expression correlated moderately. Ae. albopictus could still develop and transmit dengue virus in winter in Guangzhou. Mosquitoes under simulated field conditions were more susceptible to DENV-2 than those under simulated laboratory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4229363729,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer characterized by global changes in metabolite levels. However, compared with the study of gene expression, profiling of metabolites in cancer samples remains relatively understudied. We obtained metabolomic profiling and gene expression data from 454 human solid cancer cell lines across 24 cancer types from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database, to evaluate the feasibility of inferring metabolite levels from gene expression data. For each metabolite, we trained multivariable LASSO regression models to identify gene sets that are most predictive of the level of each metabolite profiled. Even when accounting for cell culture conditions or cell lineage in the model, few metabolites could be accurately predicted. In some cases, the inclusion of the upstream and downstream metabolites improved prediction accuracy, suggesting that gene expression is a poor predictor of steady-state metabolite levels. Our analysis uncovered a single robust relationship between the expression of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) and 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA), however, this relationship could only be validated in cancer samples with high purity, as NNMT is not expressed in immune cells. Together, we have trained models that use gene expression profiles to predict the level of individual metabolites. Our analysis suggests that inferring metabolite levels based on the expression of genes is generally challenging in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4220698441,"Altered RGS5-associated intracellular pericyte signaling and its abnormal crosstalk with endothelial cells (ECs) result chaotic tumor-vasculature, prevent effective drug delivery, promote immune-evasion and many more to ensure ultimate tumor progression. Moreover, the frequency of lethal-RGS5high pericytes within tumor was found to increase with disease progression, which signifies the presence of altered cell death pathway within tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we checked whether and how neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP)-immunotherapy-mediated tumor growth restriction is associated with modification of pericytes' signaling, functions and its interaction with ECs. Analysis of pericytes isolated from tumors of NLGP treated mice suggested that NLGP treatment promotes apoptosis of NG2+ RGS5high -fuctionally altered pericytes by downregulating intra-tumoral TGFβ, along with maintenance of more matured RGS5neg pericytes. NLGP-mediated inhibition of TGFβ within TME rescues binding of RGS5 with Gαi and thereby termination of PI3K-AKT mediated survival signaling by downregulating Bcl2 and initiating pJNK mediated apoptosis. Limited availability of TGFβ also prevents complex-formation between RGS5 and Smad2 and rapid RGS5 nuclear translocation to mitigate alternate immunoregulatory functions of RGS5high tumor-pericytes. We also observed binding of Ang1 from pericytes with Tie2 on ECs in NLGP-treated tumor, which support re-association of pericytes with endothelium and subsequent vessel stabilization. Furthermore, NLGP-therapy- associated RGS5 deficiency relieved CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from anergy by regulating 'alternate-APC-like' immunomodulatory characters of tumor-pericytes. Taken together, present study described the mechanisms of NLGP's effectiveness in normalizing tumor-vasculature by chiefly modulating pericyte-biology and EC-pericyte interactions in tumor-host to further strengthen its translational potential as single modality treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220713482,"Generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease-specific instruments measure HRQoL from different aspects, although generic instruments often contain dimensions that reflect common symptoms. We evaluated how the change in 15D HRQoL and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) grading of angina severity correlate among coronary artery disease patients during 12-month follow-up.Altogether 1 271 patients scheduled for coronary angiography between June 2015 and February 2017 returned the 15D HRQoL and CCS questionnaires before angiography and after one-year follow-up as a part of routine clinical practice. Spearman correlations between one-year changes in the CCS and the 15D and its dimensions were evaluated. Changes in 15D were classified into 5 categories based on the reported minimal important difference (MID) for the instrument.Change in the CCS grade correlated moderately with the MID-based change in the 15D (r = 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.39). Correlations between these instruments were similar in different age groups, between sexes and treatment modalities. Of the individual 15D dimensions, changes in breathing (r = 0.40) and vitality (r = 0.30) had the strongest correlations with CCS change.The symptom-based evaluation of the change in the CCS grade may not catch the full benefit or harm of the treatment and vice versa, a generic instrument, such as 15D, likely does not fully capture change in disease-specific symptoms. Thus, generic and disease-specific instruments are complementary and should be used in conjunction."

Individuals from eighteen mutation accumulation lines over five generations were deep sequenced to count de novo mutations that were not present in a pool of F1 individuals, representing the parental genotype. We identified 12 new nucleotide mutations in 90 clonal generational passages. This resulted in an estimated single nucleotide mutation rate of 0.745 x 10 −9 (95% c.f. 0.39 x 10 −9 –1.26 x 10 −9 ), which is slightly lower than recent estimates for other Daphnia species.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of peri-procedure anxiety, status of post-procedure quality of life, and cardiovascular readmission rates in patients with CHD who undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and to analyze the influence of peri-procedure anxiety on quality of life and readmission rate after PCI.This prospective study was conducted at Changshu NO.1 People's Hospital. A total of 220 patients with CHD undergoing elective PCI were selected as study subjects. The general information, clinical data, anxiety, quality of life and readmission of patients were collected. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the effect of peri-procedure anxiety on quality of life, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the influence of peri-procedure anxiety on readmission rate.This study showed the anxiety scores at hospitalization appointment(T1), 3 days before procedure(T2), 1 day before procedure(T3), 1 day after procedure(T4) were 57(55,61),64(61,68),54(51.58), and 54(50,60), respectively. And, at 3 months and 6 months after PCI, the scores of Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) were 346.61(319.06,366.52) and 353.34(334.18,372.84) respectively. During 6 months follow-up, 54 cases were readmitted, with a readmission rate of 25.5%. Statistical analysis showed that T1 with anxiety (P = 0.002) and T2 with anxiety (P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for treatment satisfaction at 3 months after PCI. Anxiety in T4 (P = 0.005) was an independent risk factor on the angina frequency at 6 months after PCI. T2 with anxiety (B = 1.445, P = 0.010, 95%CI:1.409-12.773) and T4 without anxiety (B = -1.587, P = 0.042, 95%CI:-0.044-0.941) were risk factors affecting readmission for cardiovascular reasons within 6 months.Patient anxiety at T1 and T2 affects the treatment satisfaction dimension of the SAQ at 3 months after PCI, and anxiety at T4 affects the angina frequency dimension of the SAQ at 6 months after PCI. Anxiety at T2 and no anxiety at T4 increase short-term readmission rates. In the future, interventions should be strengthened at various time points in the peri-procedure period to improve post-procedure rehabilitation effect."
https://openalex.org/W4220897297,"A multistage pressure reducing valve is presented in this paper. The pressure reducing components are specially designed to not only control the flow rate but also effectively prevent the cavitation vibration. However, when the fluid flows through the pressure reducing components, the divergence and shedding of the vortices in the flow field seriously affect the stability of the valve and cause vortex-induced vibration. Especially, the main frequency of the vortex shedding is in the same frequency range as the modal frequency of the valve, the vortex-induced resonance of the valve occurs. It seriously affects the safety of a control system. In this paper, by monitoring the lift coefficient of the vortex cross flow in the valve, the frequency spectrum information of the lift coefficient is used as the novelty indexes to indicate vortex-induced vibration of the fluid in the valve. The main frequency and amplitude of vortex-induced vibration are obtained. The factors affecting the vortex-induced vibration of the fluid are analyzed. The results indicate that vortex-induced vibration is the most serious when the valve is opened or closed. The variation of the flow velocity and the pressure difference have obvious effects on vortex-induced vibration of the valve. The intensity of the variation affects the main frequency and amplitude of vortex-induced vibration. Using thermal-fluid-solid coupling modal analysis instead of traditional modal analysis, the modal frequency under the working state of the valve is obtained. It is compared with the main frequency of vortex shedding, and vortex-induced resonance does not occur in the multistage pressure reducing valve."

Methods We used comprehensive and integrated IHS data to compare health status, health service utilization and treatment cost of veterans (n = 12,242) to a matched sample of non-veterans (n = 12,242). We employed logistic, linear, or negative binomial regressions as appropriate, by sex and overall. Findings Compared to non-veterans, veterans had lower odds of having hypertension, renal disease, all-cause dementia, and alcohol or drug use disorders, but had similar burden of other conditions. In service utilization, veterans had lower hospital inpatient days; patterns were mixed across outpatient services. Unadjusted treatment costs for veterans and non-veterans were $3,923 and $4,145, respectively; veteran adjusted treatment costs were statistically lower. Differences in significance by sex were found for health conditions and service use. Conclusions AIAN veterans, compared to AIAN non-veterans, were not less healthy, nor did they require more intensive or more costly care under IHS. Our results indicate the viability and importance of expanding IHS-VA partnerships in community care."
https://openalex.org/W4220974933,"Burn injuries trigger a greater and more persistent inflammatory response than other trauma cases. Exercise has been shown to positively influence inflammation in healthy and diseased populations, however little is known about the latent effect of exercise on chronic inflammation in burn injured patients. The aims of the pilot study were to assess the feasibility of implementing a long duration exercise training program, in burn injured individuals including learnings associated with conducting a clinical trial in COVID-19 pandemic.Fifteen participants with a burn injury between 5-20% total body surface area acquired greater than a year ago were randomised in a within-subject designed study, into one of two conditions, exercise-control or control-exercise. The exercise condition consisted of six weeks of resistance and cardiovascular exercises, completed remotely or supervised in a hospital gym. A comprehensive outcome measurement was completed at the initial, mid and end point of each exercise and control condition. To determine the success of implementation, the feasibility indicator for the data completeness across the comprehensive outcome battery was set at 80%.Half (49%) of eligible participants in the timeframe, were recruited and commenced the study. Six participants withdrew prior to completion and a total of 15 participants completed the study. Eight participants were randomised to the exercise-control and seven to the control exercise group. Five participants trained remotely and seven did supervised training. Three participants completed a mix of both supervised and remote training initiated due to COVID restrictions. Outcome measures were completed on 97% of protocolised occasions and 100% of participants completed the exercise training.Conducting a long duration exercise training study on burn injured individuals is feasible using the described methods. The knowledge gained helps improve the methodology in larger-scale projects. Insights into the impact of COVID-19 on this clinical trial and success enhancing adaptations for the researcher, research practice and the participant, are presented."
https://openalex.org/W4220991350,"Objectives Caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) cancer patients experience high caregiver burden and carry a significant amount of responsibility. Mindfulness has the potential to lessen caregiver burden by aiding in stress management. To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of mindfulness in reducing caregiver burden in this population. Based on our pilot study demonstrating initial feasibility and acceptability of FOCUS (Focusing On mindfulness for Caregivers Under Stress), this 3-arm randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of a 6-week mindfulness-based stress management program for allogeneic HCT caregivers. Hypotheses include that the FOCUS condition will have lower post-treatment caregiver burden and that patients of these caregivers will have better patient health outcomes compared to other treatment conditions. Method Eligible caregivers will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: FOCUS, Healthy Living (HL; active control), and Enhanced Care (EC; usual care). Caregivers in FOCUS and HL will participate in 6-week weekly individual treatment sessions and will be sent brief daily momentary interventions/messages. Caregivers in all conditions will complete daily diaries over the course of treatment. Patients of enrolled caregivers will be enrolled for assessments only. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, end of treatment, 2- and 6-months post-treatment. Biomarker data will be collected via hair cortisol concentrations from caregivers at baseline and 6 months post-treatment. Results Recruitment is ongoing. Conclusions The data collected from this study will provide evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness in alleviating HCT caregiver stress and impacting patient health outcomes. Trial registration The current study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT05078229 ); see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05078229?term=christine+vinci&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 ."
https://openalex.org/W4220697416,"High utilizers (HU) are patients with an above-average use of psychiatric inpatient treatment. A precise characterization of this patient group is important when tailoring specific treatment approaches for them. While the current literature reports evidence of sociodemographic, and socio-clinical characteristics of HU, knowledge regarding their psychological characteristics is sparse. This study aimed to investigate the association between patients’ psychological characteristics and their utilization of psychiatric inpatient treatment. Patients from the University Psychiatric Clinics (UPK) Basel diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar affective disorders participated in a survey at the end of their inpatient treatment stay. The survey included assessments of psychological characteristics such as quality of life, self-esteem, self-stigma, subjective experience and meaning of psychoses, insight into the disease, and patients’ utilization of psychiatric inpatient treatment in the last 30 months. The outcome variables were two indicators of utilization of psychiatric inpatient treatment, viz. “utilization pattern” (defined as HU vs. Non-HU [NHU]) and “length of stay” (number of inpatient treatment days in the last 30 months). Statistical analyses included multiple regression models, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) method, and the random forest model. We included 112 inpatients, of which 50 were classified as HU and 62 as NHU. The low performance of all statistical models used after cross-validation suggests that none of the estimated psychological variables showed predictive accuracy and hence clinical relevance regarding these two outcomes. Results indicate no link between psychological characteristics and inpatient treatment utilization in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar affective disorders. Thus, in this study, the examined psychological variables do not seem to play an important role in patients’ use of psychiatric inpatient treatment; this highlights the need for additional research to further examine underlying mechanisms of high utilization of psychiatric inpatient treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220709453,"Background Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk of chronic health conditions. We aimed to explore future long-term sickness absence and disability pension in young adult childhood cancer survivors and matched references. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study using microdata from five Swedish nationwide registers. Among all individuals born 1976–1998 and living in Sweden, we included 3632 childhood cancer survivors and 17,468 matched references that could be followed-up for 15, 10, or 5 years, respectively. A group-based trajectory model was applied to identify trajectories of mean annual sickness absence and/or disability pension days (SADP) in each sub-cohort, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Potential risk factors for trajectory belonging were explored using χ 2 test and multinomial logistic regression. Results Most young adult childhood cancer survivors (90.2–96.5%) and references (97.4–98.8%) followed a No SADP trajectory. A larger proportion of childhood cancer survivors than references followed a Moderate (33–102 days/year) or High (115–260 days/year) SADP trajectory (15-year follow-up cohorts: Moderate 4.6% versus 1.2%; High 5.1% versus 1.5%). Childhood cancer survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors were at higher risk of the High SADP trajectory than childhood cancer survivors of hematological or non-CNS solid tumors (hematological versus CNS: odds ratio = 2.30, 95% CI 1.23–4.30; hematological versus non-CNS: odds ratio = 0.32, 95% CI 0.13–0.79). Conclusions Although most young adult childhood cancer survivors had no SADP during follow-up, 9.7% experienced moderate or high numbers of SADP days/year throughout the 15-year follow-up; compared to 2.7% among references. CNS tumor survivors were at particular risk of SADP long-term and need extra attention in their future work prospect."

https://openalex.org/W4220939322,"Family caregivers experience both negative and positive outcomes. However, most studies have mainly focused on the negative outcomes. In addition, few studies have focused on both primary and secondary caregivers. This study explored the positive experiences of primary and secondary caregivers of older persons in resource-limited urban settings in Accra, Ghana. This study used phenomenological design, and thirty-one family caregivers were interviewed in James Town and Ussher Town. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically using NVivo 10. The findings show that the primary and secondary caregivers derived tangible and intangible rewards from providing care to older persons. The tangible rewards included gifts, while the intangible include blessings, skills acquisition, enhanced personal attributes, family cohesion, and health consciousness. Positive caregiving experiences can mitigate caregivers' burden and burnout. Therefore, policymakers and social workers should design interventions that will enhance the positive experiences of family caregivers. They should also consider the gender and age of caregivers in designing these interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4220961961,"To investigate the difference in character strengths (CSs) between patients with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the association between biological (i.e., testosterone levels) and psychological factors (i.e., character strengths).A total of 99 women divided into PCOS (49) and non-PCOS (50) groups who presented to the gynecological clinics at the women's center in the American University of Beirut Medical Center in 2017 were included. Women were assessed for testosterone bioavailable levels and completed a questionnaire that included Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Values in Action Survey-72. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine the association of CSs between the two groups and its predictors.The scores of hope, judgement, perspective, and transcendence of the PCOS group were significantly higher in comparison with healthy participants. An increase in free androgen index was negatively correlated to the score of judgement only.Women with PCOS have their own profile of character strengths and virtues that constitute judgement, hope, perspective, and transcendence. This in turn can be utilized to reinforce those personality strengths and thus decrease the psychological distress and mood disorders accompanied with this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4221017300,"Background Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are involved in intercellular communication by transferring biomolecules such as mRNA, which has been shown to be as essential biomarkers for many physiological and pathological conditions such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study aimed to investigate the expression of CDH1, CDH2, MCP-1, and PAI-1 mRNAs in blood EVs of DN patients and to determine their accuracy in predicting early-stage DN. Methods We recruited 196 participants, including 35 overt DN patients, 53 incipient DN patients, 62 diabetic patients (DM), and 46 healthy individuals. Quantification of the mRNA profile of blood EVs was performed using the qRT-PCR method. The diagnostic performance of mRNA was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results The mRNA expression of CDH2 and MCP-1 was downregulated in overt DN group (0.22-fold change and 0.15-fold change, respectively) and incipient DN group (0.60-fold change and 0.43-fold change, respectively) compared to DM group (1.72-fold change and 2.77-fold change, respectively), while PAI-1 mRNA expression decreased in incipient DN group (0.70-fold change) and DM group (0.58-fold change) compared to control. However, the expression level of CDH1 mRNA was not significantly different among the four groups ( p = 0.408). Moreover, CDH2 and MCP-1 mRNAs inversely correlated with creatinine (r = -0.370 and r = -0.361, p &lt;0.001) and Alb/Cr ratio (r = -0.355 and r = -0.297, p &lt;0.001). 1/CDH2 mRNA also predicted overt DN with an accuracy of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.65–0.85) and incipient DN with an accuracy of 0.61 (95%CI: 0.50–0.71) while 1/MCP-1 mRNA had an accuracy of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.55–0.77) for overt DN prediction and an accuracy of 0.61 (95%CI: 0.51–0.71) for incipient DN prediction. Conclusion CDH2 and MCP-1 mRNAs expression in blood EVs was decreased with the development of DN, suggesting the renoprotective effect of these mRNAs in diabetic individuals. Moreover, their quantifications could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage DN."
https://openalex.org/W4221057635,"The drivers' hazard perception plays an important role in preventing and reducing the occurrence of traffic accidents. In order to explore the drivers' hazard perception and their behavioral characteristics in overt and covert hazards, hazardous events of three traffic conflict types (vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to cyclist and vehicle to pedestrian) were designed for overt and covert hazards based on the UC-win/Road driving simulation software, respectively. 35 drivers were organized to conduct the driving simulation tests. The data of driving behavior was collected when they were driving. A comparative analysis of drivers' hazard perception ability and driving behavior characteristics was carried out for hazardous scenarios and traffic conflict types. The result has shown that drivers are more likely to take slowing measures or brake earlier in overt hazard scenarios to ensure safe driving. And drivers are more likely to be involved in collisions in covert hazard scenarios. The types of traffic conflict have a significant effect on the hazard perception ability of drivers (F = 5.92, p < 0.01). Drivers have the strongest hazard perception for cyclists and the weakest hazard perception for pedestrians. Traffic conflict types has a significant effect on drivers' average braking depth (F = 32.31, p < 0.01), average speed (F = 13.78, p < 0.01), and average acceleration (F = 9.26, p < 0.01)."
