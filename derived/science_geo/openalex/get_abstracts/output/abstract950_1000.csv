https://openalex.org/W2158246711,"Late in the terminal differentiation of epidermis and cultured epidermal cells, a protein envelope located beneath the plasma membrane becomes cross-linked by cellular transglutaminase. The process of cross-linking can be initiated in cultured epidermal cells by agents affecting cell membrane permeability—nonionic detergents, high salt concentrations and ionophores. These agents initiate the cross-linking process by making calcium ions available to the transglutaminase. A soluble precursor of the cross-linked envelope has been identified in crude extracts of cultured epidermal cells by its ability to incorporate labeled amines through the action of transglutaminase. The protein has been purified to homogeneity by gel filtration and chromatography on columns of DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. Comprising an estimated 5–10% of the soluble cell protein, it has a molecular weight of about 92,000, is isoelectric at pH 4.5±0.3 and has an unusual amino acid composition (46% Glx residues). It is chemically and immunochemically unrelated to keratins. The following evidence confirms that the protein becomes incorporated into cross-linked envelopes: first, washed cross-linked envelopes bind antibody to the purified protein, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence; second, absorption of the antiserum with washed envelopes removes all detectable antibodies to the purified protein; and third, the protein cannot be extracted from keratinocytes after their envelopes have become cross-linked. Examination of sections of epidermis by immunofluorescence, using antiserum to the purified protein, reveals that in addition to the stratum corneum, the living cells of the outer half of the spinous layer react strongly. The envelope precursor is present in the cytoplasm, but becomes concentrated at the cell periphery, where it will be cross-linked later, when the cells have passed through the granular layer. The protein is also concentrated in a peripheral location in cultured epidermal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1485806421,"Liver mitochondria treated with N-ethylmaleimide can accumulate Ca2+ but cannot retain it. Ca2+ loss following uptake occurs in parallel with a proton uptake and collapse of the membrane potential. Respiration is not activated during Ca2+ release and cannot be stimulated by uncoupler. After Ca2+ release and accompanying phenomena are nearly complete, the mitochondria undergo a large amplitude swelling. Nupercaine inhibits the premature release of Ca2+, proton uptake, decline in membrane potential, inhibition of uncoupler-stimulated respiration, and large amplitude swelling. Ruthenium red also prevents these effects. Neither Sr2+ or Mn2+ will substitute for Ca2+ to induce these effects in N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide plus Ca2+ on mitochondria are not accompanied by a significant alteration in the content or composition of phospholipids but are accompanied by small increases in the mitochondrial content of free fatty acids. Free fatty acids accumulate more rapidly in response to limited Ca2+ loading in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide than they do in its presence. In the absence of N-ethylmaleimide, polyunsaturated fatty acids and saturated plus monounsaturated fatty acids accumulate at nearly equal rates. In the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate more rapidly than saturated plus monounsaturated fatty acids. Any condition or agent tested which inhibited swelling and the other effects produced by Ca2+ plus N-ethylmaleimide also prevented the more rapid accumulation of polyunsaturated, compared to saturated plus monounsaturated, fatty acids. In the light of a positional analysis of phospholipid acyl moieties, these data suggest that 1-acyllysophospholipids accumulate in swelling mitochondria but not in response to noraml Ca2+ loading or when swelling is blocked by other agents. The free fatty acid accumulation, per se, is not responsible for swelling, but levels of exogenous palmitic acid as low as 1 nmol/mg of protein dramatically alter the dependence of swelling velocity on Ca2+ concentration, producing a shift from a sigmoidal- to a hyperbolic-like relationship. This same alteration is brought about by aging the mitochondrial preparation at 0 degrees C. Either pyruvate or DL-carnitine prevents the effect of exogenous palmitate and restores the Aa2+ swelling dependence of aged N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria to that of fresh N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria. Intramitochondrial acylcoenzyme A or acylcarnitine, or both, therefore, to be the modulator of Ca2+ sensitivity rather than free fatty acid. The findings are discussed in terms of the role of intramitochondrial phospholipase and other phospholipid metabolizing enzymes in the mechanisms of N-ethylmaleimide plus Ca2+ effects on mitochondria."

Samples were frozen for EPR measurements or analyzed optically within 30 s after mixing to ensure a kinetic population of intermediates. Fractions of pentacoordinate alpha-NO heme groups were determined by fitting EPR and absorbance difference spectra in terms of linear combinations of standard signals. Equivalent results were obtained by these techniques. The fraction of alpha-NO heme exhibiting pentacoordinate character in Hb4NO increases from 0.07 to 0.73 in going from pH 9 to 6. The fraction of alpha hemes which are pentacoordinate in fully saturated nitrosyl hemoglobin, Hb4(NO), increases from 0.0 to 0.41 over the same pH range. Only in the presence of bound inositol-P6 are all 4 the alpha-NO hemes pentacoordinate. Thus, the expression of modified NO heme character is not simply a reflection of the formation of low affinity quaternary conformations. Rather, within this conformation the alpha chain iron atoms exhibit an equilibrium between hexa- and pentacoordinate structures which is perturbed markedly by both proton and phosphate binding. No intermediate coordination structure of the type suggested by Chevion et al. (Chevion, M., Stern, A., Peisach, J., Blumberg, W.E., and Simon, S. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 1745-1750) appears to occur since the observed alpha-NO heme spectra can always by represented quantitatively as a linear combination of the normal hexacoordinate and pentacoordinate signals. The formation of pentacoordinate alpha-NO causes this subunit to exhibit a higher affinity for nitric oxide. Thus on standing at low levels of saturation, there is a slow (t1/2 approximately equal to 8 min at pH 7, 25 degrees C) re-equilibration of ligand from beta to alpha subunits. The final ratio of alpha-NO to beta-NO is 2 to 1 in the absence of phosphates and greater than 10 to 1 in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1516087394,"Mannitol-containing oligosaccharides have been isolated from a rat brain proteoglycan after mild alkaline borohydride treatment under conditions which prevent peeling. Their structural properties were studied by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of disaccharides as their trimethylsilylated and permethylated derivatives, methylation, analysis, specific degradations, and CrO3 oxidation. The following components were identified: Gal(beta 1 leads to 4) [Fuc(alpha 1 leads to 3)]GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Manol,GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Manol, and Manol. Evidence was also obtained for the occurrence of a sialylated oligosaccharide and another (possibly sulfated) acidic oligosaccharide, both having the sequence GlcNAc(beta 1 leads to 3)Manol at their proximal ends. These mannitol-containing oligosaccharides constitute a novel group of alkali-labile oligosaccharides in mammalian glycoconjugates. The origin of the oligosaccharides and the possible occurrence of a carbohydrate-peptide linkage involving mannose are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1544209968,"Purification of soluble guanylate cyclase from rat liver resulted in an apparent loss of enzyme activation by nitric oxide that could be restored by dithiothreitol. methemoglobin, bovine serum albumin, or sucrose. Although hemoglobin also permitted some activation with nitric oxide, the effect of other agents to restore enzyme activation was prevented with hemoglobin. As a result of enzyme purification, there is an alteration of the dose-response relationship for nitric oxide activation. After partial enzyme purification, relatively high concentrations of nitric oxide that were stimulatory in crude enzyme preparations had no effect on enzyme activity. However, partially purified or homogeneous enzyme was activated by lower concentrations of nitric oxide. The bell-shaped dose-response curve for nitric oxide was shifted to the left with guanylate cyclase purification. The addition of dithiothreitol, methemoglobin, bovine serum albumin, or sucrose to enzyme markedly broadens the dose-response curve for nitric oxide. Thus, the apparent loss of responsiveness to nitric oxide with purification is a function of increased sensitivity of guanylate cyclase to nitric oxide. Increased sensitivity to nitric oxide with enzyme purification probably results from the removal of heme, proteins, and small molecules that can serve as scavengers or sinks for nitric oxide and prevent excessive oxidation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488933314,"The effect of the transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH) and potential gradient (delta psi) upon the rate and extent of amine accumulation was investigated in chromaffin ghosts. The chromaffin ghosts were formed by hypo-osmotic lysis of isolated bovine chromaffin granules and extensive dialysis in order to remove intragranular binding components and dissipate the endogenous electrochemical gradients. Upon ATP addition to suspensions of chromaffin ghosts, a transmembrane proton gradient alone, a transmembrane gradient alone, or both, could be established, depending upon the compositions of the media in which the ghosts were formed and resuspended. When chloride was present in the medium, addition of ATP resulted in the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient, acidic inside of 1 pH unit (measured by [14C]methylamine distribution), and no transmembrane potential (measured by [14C]-thiocyanate distribution). When ATP was added to chromaffin ghosts suspended in a medium in which chloride was substituted by isethionate, a transmembrane potential, inside positive, of 45 mV and no transmembrane proton gradient, was measured. In each medium, the addition of agents known to affect proton or potential gradients, respectively, exerted a predictable mechanism of action. Accumulation of [14C]epinephrine or [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine was over 1 order of magnitude greater in the presence of the transmembrane proton gradient or the transmembrane potential than in the absence of any gradient and, moreover, was related to the magnitude of the proton or potential gradient in a dose-dependent manner. When ghosts were added to a medium containing chloride and isethionate, both a delta pH and delta psi could be generated upon addition of ATP. In this preparation, the maximal rate of amine accumulation was observed. The results indicate that amine accumulation into chromaffin ghosts can occur in the presence of either a transmembrane proton gradient, or a transmembrane potential gradient, and that the maximal rate of accumulation may exist when both components of the protonmotive force are present."

https://openalex.org/W64788924,"A class of cell envelope vesicles (M vesicles) prepared from Halobacterium halobium Rl contain a light-driven sodium pump that serves to eject sodium ions and to create an electrical potential difference in direct proportion to the intensity of illumination. The M vesicles take up protons as an immediate consequence of this electrical potential difference. Predictably, the sodium efflux rate and extent are not inhibited by proton ionophores, whereas the proton uptake is enhanced. In the presence of valinomycin and K+, the electrical potential difference and the proton uptake are abolished, but the light-driven sodium extrusion is only slightly decreased. M vesicles are essentially free (>95%) from contamination by a light-driven proton pump. The participation of a reversed bacteriorhodopsin pump is unlikely since absolutely no internally positive electrical potential difference is detectable. The ejection of sodium by M vesicles is independent of protonmotive force and the rate of the Na+ efflux does not show a gating effect in response to membrane potential. In sharp contrast, another class of cell envelope vesicles (L vesicles) accomplish sodium extrusion via an electrogenic H’/Na’ antiporter that is driven by protonmotive force and activated by membrane potential (Lanyi, J. K., and MacDonald, R. E. (1976) Biochemistry, 15, 4608-4614). We conclude that at least two mechanisms exist in H. halobium to create electrical and chemical potential energy by the transduction of light energy: the bacteriorhodopsin proton pump and a light-driven sodium pump. The consequences of this second pump to the circulation of ions and to Na’/ amino acid symport are considerable and cannot be neglected."

https://openalex.org/W322578321,"The regulation of asparagine synthetase in wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells and in several mutant strains containing defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases has been studied. When wild type cells are transferred from complete medium to medium lacking asparagine, the extent of aminoacylation of tRNA*“” decreases and asparagine synthetase activity increases. Similar results are observed when a mutant containing a temperature-sensitive asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase is transferred from permissive to restrictive conditions. Upon readdition of asparagine to wild type cells or transfer of mutant cells to permissive conditions, the extent of aminoacylation of tRNA*“” is rapidly increased and the activity of asparagine synthetase slowly decreases. An inverse correlation between the extent of tRNA*“” aminoacylation and the level of asparagine synthetase activity is observed when the mutant containing a defective asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase is grown in media containing a range of asparagine concentrations. Mutants with altered leucyl-, methionyl-, and lysyltRNA synthetases alr,o have elevated asparagine synthetase activity when grown under conditions that lead to decreased aminoacylation of their cognate tRNA species. Under these conditions tRNA*“” is fully aminoacylated. The kinetics of asparagine synthetase activity regulation is very similar under conditions of asparagine deprivation or restricted charging of tRNA’““. Experiments with cycloheximide and emetine suggest that the increased asparagine synthetase activity in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutants is not due to a decreased rate of protein synthesis in these cells. Therefore, elevated asparagine synthetase activity is correlated with decreased aminoacylation of several, if not all, tRNAs. This result seems to rule out a specific and direct mechanism based solely on the extent of aminoacylation of tRNA*“” in the regulation of asparagine synthetase levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1545894867,"Abstract Protease activity has been demonstrated in culture supernatants of Clostridium tetani at various stages of fermentation. Gel chromatography of the concentrated filtrates revealed the presence of three enzymatically active fractions eluting at separate positions off the column. The smallest protease was found to nick the single chain intracellular tetanus toxin, producing the extracellular, two-chain structure of the molecule. As little as 3 ng of active protease were sufficient to cleave 50 microgram of intracellular tetanus toxin, suggesting that this enzyme is responsible for the observed structural change of the toxin molecule during its release into the culture medium. By comparison, the second protease, eluting at an intermediate position, exhibited only marginal activity towards intracellular toxin. The third, largest, enzyme was not active under the conditions of the assay. However, the latter protease effectively hydrolyzed low molecular weight histidyl peptides, and it is concluded that this enzyme is similar to the one described by Miller, P.A. Gray, C.T., and Eaton, M.D. (1960) J. Bacteriol. 79, 95-102. The properties of the partially purified enzymes, including their differential behavior towards a number of protease inhibitors, are reported."

In the presence of valinomycin, 2 K+ ions were taken up by the vesicles per electron transferred from cytochrome c to oxygen. The charge stoichiometry of 2 was obtained from simultaneous measurement of changes of K+, H+, and oxygen in the medium after addition of the reductant ascorbate/TMPD (N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine). The changes in oxygen concentration were measured with a fast responding oxygen electrode (90% response time, 0.4 s). The existence of a proton pump in cytochrome c oxidase could thus be confirmed, and its charge stoichiometry measured, in a reconstituted system uncomplicated by other respiratory chain components."
https://openalex.org/W1607616091,"Because of previous data suggesting that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases make a transient Michael adduct with a specific uridine residue in the tRNA structure, (Schoemaker, H.J.P., and Schimmel, P.R. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 5454-5460) attempts were made to find simple model systems in which this reaction might be studied in more detail. In the course of these investigations, it was found that Escherichia coli Ile-tRNA synthetase catalyzes cleavage of the glycosidic bond of 5-bromouridine. At pH 7.5, ambient temperatures, the turnover number is roughly 5/h. 5-Fluoro-, 5-chloro-, and 5-iodouridine are also cleaved in an analogous way by Ile-tRNA synthetase. In the case of uridine, conversion of uridine to uracil and ribose was also detected, but with a smaller turnover number. Three other E. coli and one mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were also examined and all were found to catalyze glycosidic bond cleavage of 5-bromouridine. The data indicate that, in general, synthetases have a catalytic center that shows an unusual reactivity for uridine."
https://openalex.org/W1984001243,"We describe some flatworms (some in the genus Mesostoma) that kill mosquito larvae and may account for the variability in the population densities of Culex tarsalis and Anopheles freeborni in rice fields. When mosquito larvae brush against these worms, the larvae immediately become paralyzed and die. When C. tarsalis larvae are placed inside floating cages that exclude flatworms (50-micromter mesh), there is a fourfold increase in the their survival. Rice fields that have abundant mosquito populations lack flatworms. Most such fields have only recently been turned over to rice production, suggesting that the flatworms have difficulty dispersing to new fields but, once established, are able to overwinter and control mosquitoes for the subsequent years of rice production."

https://openalex.org/W28349223,"NMR was used to study the quaternary structure of nitrosyl- and methemoglobin, the kinetics and equilibrium behavior of nitric oxide binding, and the oxidation of hemoglobin. The -9.6 ppm (from H2O) resonance was used as a measure of nitrosylhemoglobin molecules in the T quaternary structure. We found that stripped nitrosylhemoglobin is 70% in the T state below pH 6.4, and is in the R state above. Inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) raises this transition point to pH 7.5. For stripped aquomethemoglobin, the T marker at -10 ppm is absent. In IHP, at pH 6.5 all of the molecules are in the T state. At both higher and lower pH they shift to the R state. The intensity decreases to half of its maximum at pH 5.5 and 7.4. The relative affinity of nitric oxide binding to the alpha and beta subunits was inferred from the intensities of the resonances at -12 and -18 ppm. Under conditions in which nitrosylhemoglobin exists in the T state, NO binds to the alpha subunit 10 times more strongly than it does to the beta subunit. The kinetic experiments reveal that it binds to the two subunits at the same rate and that it dissociates at 5 x 10(-3) s-1 from the beta subunit and at 5 x 10(-4) s-1 from alpha subunit. At high pH, the two subunits are ligated at the same rate. Potassium ferricyanide oxidation, at pH 6.0 in the absence of IHP, is about 3 times more favorable for the alpha than the beta subunit. Addition of IHP raises this preferential oxidation slightly. At pH 8.44, both alpha and beta subunits were oxidized at the same rate."
https://openalex.org/W1563584589,"Natural-abundance 13C NMR spectra (at 15.04 MHz) of the polypeptide cardiac stimulant Anthopleurin-A are presented. The spectra contain many resolved one- and two-carbon resonances from carbonyl and aromatic carbons and a few resolved resonances from aliphatic carbons. Most of these have been assigned to individual carbons in the protein. The effect of pH on the 13C spectrum has been investigated. In conjunction with the resonance assignments, this yields estimates for the pK alpha values of the COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal residues, the side chain carboxylate of 1 of the 2 aspartic acid residues, and the imidazolium groups of the 2 histidine residues. The effects of the lanthanides La3+ and Gd3+ on the spectrum have also been studied. The results suggest that there are at least two binding sites, and further studies will be required to characterize these before they can be utilized as an aid in structural mapping. Finally, the results are discussed in relation to a postulated model for the mode of action of Anthopleurin-A."

https://openalex.org/W1488122313,"Resonance Raman and electronic absorption spectra were used to show that the state of an amphiphilic cation, relative to dilute aqueous solution, changes when it is accumulated by cells of Streptococcus faecalis when they are energized. The general characteristics of the cation employed, quinaldine red, closely paralleled those of other amphiphilic cations which have been used to measure membrane potential. A major aspect of the change is that in sodium-loaded cells, essentially all of the quinaldine red accumulated as the result of energization forms a strong bond with an anionic group. This binding is similar to that which occurs for the basal level of quinaldine red taken up in nonenergized cells. Ionic binding was detected using resonance Raman spectroscopy through shifts associated with a N+ parallel C--C parallel C stretching vibration to lower frequency on uptake. Another aspect of the change in state is that the cell-localized probe cation can aggregate while ionically bonded in a card pack fashion, the transition dipoles being parallel. A combination of resonance Raman and electronic absorption spectroscopy was used to characterize this aggregation. The aggregates were estimated to contain at least five quinaldine red cations at or near van der Waals contact, and the presence of other molecules, such as phospholipids, could not be excluded. Aggregation effects are complex depending on the ratio of cells to probe cation, and on energization. The site of binding is suggested to be the lipid bilayer region of the plasma membrane on the basis of experiments with liposomes and other model systems. In addition, some quinaldine red may be present in the cytoplasm in an aggregated, ionically bound form. The change in state on uptake following energization seems to be associated with a membrane potential, similar spectral and uptake effects being produced by an artificially generated membrane potential in cells and liposomes. The results show that membrane potential cannot be computed in a simple manner from the distribution of quinaldine red between cells and medium, assuming that the thermodynamic activity coefficient of cell-localized material is identical with that in dilute aqueous solution. However, uptake as well as subsequent ionic binding of quinaldine red seems to be related to potential in an as yet undefined manner."
https://openalex.org/W94070242,"Aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli (EC 2.1.3.2) has four cysteines on each regulatory chain and one cysteine on each catalytic chain. The catalytic chain (C chain) thiol of aspartate transcarbamylase is resistant to most sulfhydryl reagents, but reacts rapidly and specifically with 2-chloromercuri-li-nitropheno1 (Evans, D. R., McMurray, C. H., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1972) Proc. NatZ. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 3638-3642). Here we show that the specific modification of the catalytic chain sulfhydryl residues depends on the structure of the mercurial and the pH and chloride ion concentration. A comparison of the specificity of the reaction of 14 aryl mercurials with aspartate transcarbamylase indicated that all of the reactive compounds have an ionized phenolic hydroxyl group positioned ortho to the mercury atom. The pH rate profile for 2-chloromercuri-4nitrophenol is bell shaped, exhibiting a maximum at pH 7.5. Below pH 6 and above pH 9, the mercurial reacts exclusively with the thiol groups on the regulatory chain. The rate enhancement with increasing pH on the acidic side of the optimum is probably associated with the ionization of the phenolic hydroxyl group (pK = 6.5) on the mercurial. The second order rate constant for the reaction of 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol increases with chloride ion concentration to a maximum at 20 mM, but begks to decrease at chloride concentrations above 50 IXIM. The hyperreactivity of 2-chloromercuri-4-nitropheno1 is probably due to a specific binding and orientation interaction between the phenolate ion of the mercurial and either the thiol itself or a nearby positive charged residue on the enzyme. The inhibition of enzymatic activity in aspartate transcarbamylase derivatives prepared by reacting only a fraction of the catalytic chain sulfhydryl groups with nitromercurials is complex. Sites to which the mercurial is covalently bound are completely inactivated, but there is also an indirect inhibition of activity at unmodified neighboring sites. The latter type of inhibition is reversed at high concentrations of aspartate."
