Affected individuals, predominantly children and adolescents, exhibit photosensitivity with hydroa æstivale, marked porphyrinuria and hepatomegaly, but no abdominal or neurological symptoms. Epidemiological studies suggested the possibility that the disease might be related to the ingestion of wheat treated with a fungicide containing hexachlorobenzene1,2. Since direct verification of this possibility by field investigation has not been obtained1, and since the available toxicological information on hexachlorobenzene is conflicting3, an attempt was made to produce hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rats."

https://openalex.org/W2150184625,"SINCE the activity of ‘factor 3’ in liver necrosis in rats and exudative diathesis in chicks was shown to be dependent on selenium1, compounds of this element have been shown to prevent other diseases induced by tocopherol-deficient diets. Sodium selenite (0.2 p.p.m.) as well as tocopherol acetate inhibit muscular degeneration in pigs fed grain, which causes field outbreaks2. Muscular degeneration in pigs is associated with a rise in plasma glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, but normal ornithine-carbamyl transferase3. When the disease is manifested, high glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels rapidly return to normal after subcutaneous administration of 0.02 mgm. selenium (as Na2SeO3) per kgm. body-weight daily for three days (Orstadius et al., unpublished work)."

All scalesadhere to the form of a power law for brightness, and scales obtained underthe differing psychophysical procedures agree."

https://openalex.org/W2019792345,"A Beltsville Small White turkey poult of parthenogenetic origin hatched in the spring of 1958, matured, and produced semen containing viable spermatozoa. Semen from this male was used in January 1959 to inseminate seven virgin and seven previously mated Beltsville Small White turkey hens. Three hundred and twenty eggs were incubated, of which 175 or 54.7 percent were infertile. One hundred and twenty-two poults, about equally divided as to sex, hatched unaided from 145 fertile eggs."
https://openalex.org/W2034121445,Sex chromatin counts of subcultured cells of both female human mammary tumor and female rabbit kidney show a considerable drop from an initial high level. Cultures in which sex chromatin persists also retain the viral insensitivity of their source material.

https://openalex.org/W2065146147,"IT has been, pointed out that mammalian sperm represents an ideal tissue for exploring, under well-defined conditions in vitro, the intricate biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying the viability and senescence of living cells1. Efforts to move in this direction have been restricted by the necessity of having to maintain mammalian sperm in complex, undefined media and at temperatures which suppress metabolic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2079989208,THE partition of inulin between buffer and solutions containing hyaluronic acid has been observed by dialysing inulin to equilibrium between the two solutions. ‘Millipore HA’ membranes were used which are readily permeable to inulin but impermeable to hyaluronic acid. The hyaluronic acid was prepared from ox synovial fluid by the method of Ogston and Stanier1; inulin was Kerfoot biochemical reagent twice ‘recrystallized’ from dilute ammonia.

https://openalex.org/W2001742755,"BARKER et al. 1,2 recently isolated a number of vitamin B12 derivatives from bacteria and demonstrated that they act as coenzymes in the conversion of glutamate to β-methylaspartate. Since the 5,6-dimethylbenziminazolyl cobamide coenzyrne (DCC) was found to occur in rabbit liver2, and to act as a co-factor in a rat enzyme system3, it is reasonable to assume that the coenzymes are the forms in which vitamin B12 exists in the tissues and that the ‘extrinsic factor’ may largely consist of DCC and similar compounds. Since we have previously been engaged in research on the turnover of vitamin B12 (refs. 4 and 5), we thought it of interest to perform similar work on the turnover of radioactive DCC in man."
