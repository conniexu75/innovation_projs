https://openalex.org/W2123645680,"Recent studies identified cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) as a metazoan second messenger triggering an interferon response. cGAMP is generated from GTP and ATP by cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS). We combined structural, chemical, biochemical, and cellular assays to demonstrate that this second messenger contains G(2′,5′)pA and A(3′,5′)pG phosphodiester linkages, designated c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p]. We show that, upon dsDNA binding, cGAS is activated through conformational transitions, resulting in formation of a catalytically competent and accessible nucleotide-binding pocket for generation of c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p]. We demonstrate that cyclization occurs in a stepwise manner through initial generation of 5′-pppG(2′,5′)pA prior to cyclization to c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p], with the latter positioned precisely in the catalytic pocket. Mutants of cGAS dsDNA-binding or catalytic pocket residues exhibit reduced or abrogated activity. Our studies have identified c[G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p] as a founding member of a family of metazoan 2′,5′-containing cyclic heterodinucleotide second messengers distinct from bacterial 3′,5′ cyclic dinucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2090915174,"Imidacloprid is one of the most widely used insecticides in the world. Its concentration in surface water exceeds the water quality norms in many parts of the Netherlands. Several studies have demonstrated harmful effects of this neonicotinoid to a wide range of non-target species. Therefore we expected that surface water pollution with imidacloprid would negatively impact aquatic ecosystems. Availability of extensive monitoring data on the abundance of aquatic macro-invertebrate species, and on imidacloprid concentrations in surface water in the Netherlands enabled us to test this hypothesis. Our regression analysis showed a significant negative relationship (P<0.001) between macro-invertebrate abundance and imidacloprid concentration for all species pooled. A significant negative relationship was also found for the orders Amphipoda, Basommatophora, Diptera, Ephemeroptera and Isopoda, and for several species separately. The order Odonata had a negative relationship very close to the significance threshold of 0.05 (P = 0.051). However, in accordance with previous research, a positive relationship was found for the order Actinedida. We used the monitoring field data to test whether the existing three water quality norms for imidacloprid in the Netherlands are protective in real conditions. Our data show that macrofauna abundance drops sharply between 13 and 67 ng l−1. For aquatic ecosystem protection, two of the norms are not protective at all while the strictest norm of 13 ng l−1 (MTR) seems somewhat protective. In addition to the existing experimental evidence on the negative effects of imidacloprid on invertebrate life, our study, based on data from large-scale field monitoring during multiple years, shows that serious concern about the far-reaching consequences of the abundant use of imidacloprid for aquatic ecosystems is justified."
https://openalex.org/W1981318174,"Background Age-related cognitive decline is common and may lead to substantial difficulties and disabilities in everyday life. We hypothesized that 10 hours of visual speed of processing training would prevent age-related declines and potentially improve cognitive processing speed. Methods Within two age bands (50–64 and≥65) 681 patients were randomized to (a) three computerized visual speed of processing training arms (10 hours on-site, 14 hours on-site, or 10 hours at-home) or (b) an on-site attention control group using computerized crossword puzzles for 10 hours. The primary outcome was the Useful Field of View (UFOV) test, and the secondary outcomes were the Trail Making (Trails) A and B Tests, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Stroop Color and Word Tests, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Digit Vigilance Test (DVT), which were assessed at baseline and at one year. 620 participants (91%) completed the study and were included in the analyses. Linear mixed models were used with Blom rank transformations within age bands. Results All intervention groups had (p<0.05) small to medium standardized effect size improvements on UFOV (Cohen's d = −0.322 to −0.579, depending on intervention arm), Trails A (d = −0.204 to −0.265), Trails B (d = −0.225 to −0.320), SDMT (d = 0.263 to 0.351), and Stroop Word (d = 0.240 to 0.271). Converted to years of protection against age-related cognitive declines, these effects reflect 3.0 to 4.1 years on UFOV, 2.2 to 3.5 years on Trails A, 1.5 to 2.0 years on Trails B, 5.4 to 6.6 years on SDMT, and 2.3 to 2.7 years on Stroop Word. Conclusion Visual speed of processing training delivered on-site or at-home to middle-aged or older adults using standard home computers resulted in stabilization or improvement in several cognitive function tests. Widespread implementation of this intervention is feasible. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT-01165463"
https://openalex.org/W1984000435,"Emerging evidence indicates that the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster may possess a causal role in mammary tumorigenesis and function as a novel class of oncogenes. However, the regulatory mechanism of the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster in mammary carcinoma cell invasion and migration is still largely unknown. We observed that the expression levels of miR-23a, miR-24-2 and miR-27a were significantly higher in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis, compared with that from patients without lymph node metastasis or normal tissue. Forced expression of the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster promoted mammary carcinoma cell migration, invasion, and hepatic metastasis, through targeting Sprouty2 (SPRY2) and consequent activation of p44/42 MAPK. Epidermal growth factor induced the expression of the transcription factor c-MYC, which promoted the expression of mature miR-23a, miR-24-2, and miR-27a and subsequently decreased expression of SPRY2 and activated p44/42 MAPK to promote mammary carcinoma cell migration and invasion. We therefore suggest a novel link between epidermal growth factor and the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster via the regulation of c-MYC, providing the potential for the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster to be used as biomarker in the diagnosis and/or treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2103478816,"Correctly identifying associations of genes with diseases has long been a goal in biology. With the emergence of large-scale gene-phenotype association datasets in biology, we can leverage statistical and machine learning methods to help us achieve this goal. In this paper, we present two methods for predicting gene-disease associations based on functional gene associations and gene-phenotype associations in model organisms. The first method, the Katz measure, is motivated from its success in social network link prediction, and is very closely related to some of the recent methods proposed for gene-disease association inference. The second method, called Catapult (Combining dATa Across species using Positive-Unlabeled Learning Techniques), is a supervised machine learning method that uses a biased support vector machine where the features are derived from walks in a heterogeneous gene-trait network. We study the performance of the proposed methods and related state-of-the-art methods using two different evaluation strategies, on two distinct data sets, namely OMIM phenotypes and drug-target interactions. Finally, by measuring the performance of the methods using two different evaluation strategies, we show that even though both methods perform very well, the Katz measure is better at identifying associations between traits and poorly studied genes, whereas Catapult is better suited to correctly identifying gene-trait associations overall. The authors want to thank Jon Laurent and Kris McGary for some of the data used, and Li and Patra for making their code available. Most of Ambuj Tewari's contribution to this work happened while he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin."

The highly related group C Sox genes Sox4 and Sox11 are widely expressed in the development of mouse retina and share a similar expression pattern with each other in this process. Here, to investigate the roles of Sox4 and Sox11 in the retinal development, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox4/Sox11 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice with deletion of Sox4, Sox11, and Sox4/Sox11 in retinas were generated. Our studies demonstrated that targeted disruption of Sox4 or Sox11 in retinas caused a moderate reduction of generation of RGCs. However, a complete loss of RGCs was observed in Sox4/Sox11-null retinas, suggesting the two genes play similar roles in the development of RGCs. Our further analysis confirms that Sox4 and Sox11 function redundantly to regulate the generation of RGCs at early embryonic stages as well as the survival of RGCs at late embryonic stages. In addition, we demonstrated that loss of Math5 impairs the expression of Sox4 and Sox11 in the ganglion cell layer while deletion of Brn3b has no effect on the expression of Sox4 and Sox11.

https://openalex.org/W2056922374,"The current generation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Cervarix® and Gardasil®, exhibit a high degree of efficacy in clinical trials against the two high-risk (HR) genotypes represented in the vaccines (HPV16 and HPV18). High levels of neutralizing antibodies are elicited against the vaccine types, consistent with preclinical data showing that neutralizing antibodies can mediate type-specific protection in the absence of other immune effectors. The vaccines also confer protection against some closely related non-vaccine HR HPV types, although the vaccines appear to differ in their degree of cross-protection. The mechanism of vaccine-induced cross-protection is unknown. This study sought to compare the breadth and magnitudes of neutralizing antibodies against non-vaccine types elicited by both vaccines and establish whether such antibodies could be detected in the genital secretions of vaccinated individuals.Serum and genital samples were collected from 12-15 year old girls following vaccination with either Cervarix® (n = 96) or Gardasil® (n = 102) HPV vaccine. Serum-neutralizing antibody responses against non-vaccine HPV types were broader and of higher magnitude in the Cervarix®, compared to the Gardasil®, vaccinated individuals. Levels of neutralizing and binding antibodies in genital secretions were closely associated with those found in the serum (r = 0.869), with Cervarix® having a median 2.5 (inter-quartile range, 1.7-3.5) fold higher geometric mean HPV-specific IgG ratio in serum and genital samples than Gardasil® (p = 0.0047). There was a strong positive association between cross-neutralizing antibody seropositivity and available HPV vaccine trial efficacy data against non-vaccine types.These data demonstrate for the first time that cross-neutralizing antibodies can be detected at the genital site of infection and support the possibility that cross-neutralizing antibodies play a role in the cross-protection against HPV infection and disease that has been reported for the current HPV vaccines.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00956553."
https://openalex.org/W2082834676,"Reoviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses that infect the mammalian respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Reovirus infection elicits production of type I interferons (IFNs), which trigger antiviral pathways through the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified, the functions of many of these genes are unknown. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are one class of ISGs that restrict the cell entry of some enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus. One family member, IFITM3, localizes to late endosomes, where reoviruses undergo proteolytic disassembly; therefore, we sought to determine whether IFITM3 also restricts reovirus entry. IFITM3-expressing cell lines were less susceptible to infection by reovirus, as they exhibited significantly lower percentages of infected cells in comparison to control cells. Reovirus replication was also significantly reduced in IFITM3-expressing cells. Additionally, cells expressing an shRNA targeting IFITM3 exhibited a smaller decrease in infection after IFN treatment than the control cells, indicating that endogenous IFITM3 restricts reovirus infection. However, IFITM3 did not restrict entry of reovirus infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), which do not require endosomal proteolysis, indicating that restriction occurs in the endocytic pathway. Proteolysis of outer capsid protein μ1 was delayed in IFITM3-expressing cells in comparison to control cells, suggesting that IFITM3 modulates the function of late endosomal compartments either by reducing the activity of endosomal proteases or delaying the proteolytic processing of virions. These data provide the first evidence that IFITM3 restricts infection by a nonenveloped virus and suggest that IFITM3 targets an increasing number of viruses through a shared requirement for endosomes during cell entry.Background: The interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) IFITM3 restricts endosomal entry of enveloped viruses.Results: IFITM3 also restricts entry of reovirus, a nonenveloped virus.Conclusion: IFITM3 alters endosomal function, either by delaying acidification or modulating proteolytic activity.Significance: IFITM3 may restrict other clinically relevant nonenveloped viruses that require endosomes for entry.

Conclusion: IFITM3 alters endosomal function, either by delaying acidification or modulating proteolytic activity. Significance: IFITM3 may restrict other clinically relevant nonenveloped viruses that require endosomes for entry. The innate immune system must recognize signatures of pathogen infection (such as the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for RNA viruses) and then initiate mechanisms that hinder the ability of the pathogen to replicate (1Mogensen T.H. Pathogen recognition and inflammatory signaling in innate immune defenses.Clin. Micro. Rev. 2009; 22: 240-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Innate detection mechanisms must, practically, be nonspecific. However, after initial detection, the restriction mechanisms, exemplified by the type I interferon (IFN) system, need not be general. Initiating a wide variety of anti-pathogen responses may give an organism the greatest chance to contain an infection whether or not each individual mechanism is effective against the specific pathogen. Type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) are major antiviral cytokines and can be induced by several different pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic RIG-I-like helicases (2Jensen S. Thomsen A.R. Sensing of RNA viruses. A review of innate immune receptors involved in recognizing RNA virus invasion.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). After induction, type I IFNs signal through the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) to induce a number of ISGs. 2The abbreviations used are: ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; IFITM, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein; shIFITM3, short hairpin RNA targeting IFITM3; T1L, reovirus type 1 Lang; T3D, reovirus type 3 Dearing; rsT3D, T3D reovirus strain; ISVP, infectious subvirion particle; EGFP, enhanced GFP; RILP, Rab-interacting lysosomal protein; m.o.i., multiplicity(s) of infection; pfu, plaque forming units; qPCR, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR; A546, Alexa Fluor 546; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011; 31: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Some induce broad antiviral responses, such as inhibition of cellular protein synthesis or degradation of RNA (4Farrell P.J. Balkow K. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Trachsel H.

However, other ISGs, such as TRIM79α, target specific viruses (6Taylor R.T. Lubick K.J. Robertson S.J. Broughton J.P. Bloom M.E. Bresnahan W.A. Best S.M.

Understanding how individual ISGs restrict virus infection is of broad interest for designing antiviral therapeutics that can be targeted to specific or more general classes of pathogens. One family of ISGs that is known to restrict specific classes of virus is the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM), which are conserved across numerous vertebrate species. In humans, the IFITM1, -2, -3, and -5 genes are located on chromosome 11 and have previously been shown to function in cell signaling, adhesion, and bone mineralization (7Evans S.S. Collea R.P.

Virol. 2004; 78: 8732-8745Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cleavages of μ1 into the particle-associated fragments δ and φ and the dissociated fragment μ1N allow for conformational changes and subsequent membrane association of the viral capsid that mediates penetration of the viral core into the cytoplasm (23Chandran K. Parker J.S. Ehrlich M. Kirchhausen T. Nibert M.L. The delta region of outer-capsid protein m1 undergoes conformational change and release from reovirus particles during cell entry.J.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although reovirus particles traverse a number of endocytic compartments, correct targeting to late endosomes containing Rab7 and Rab9 is crucial for establishing a productive infection (27Mainou B.A. Dermody T.S. Transport to late endosomes is required for efficient reovirus infection.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 8346-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because IFITM3 also localizes to late endosomes, we sought to test whether IFITM3 restricts reovirus infection. In this study we found that IFITM3 expression significantly restricts infection and replication by reovirus. IFITM3-mediated restriction occurs at the level of endosomal penetration, as neither receptor binding nor RNA synthesis was affected. Targeting of reovirus particles to Rab7-containing late endosomes occurred with similar kinetics in the presence or absence of IFITM3. However, the kinetics of acidification and subsequent proteolysis of the reovirus capsid were delayed in IFITM3-expressing cells. Thus, IFITM3 likely alters the dynamics of endosomal uncoating, either leading to inefficient membrane penetration or lysosomal degradation of viral particles. This represents the first evidence that IFITM3 can restrict the infection of non-enveloped viruses that utilize endosome-dependent cell entry mechanisms and provides further mechanistic evidence for how IFITM3 restricts an increasing number of viruses by targeting a shared requirement for endosomes for cell entry. HeLa, U2OS, and A549 vector control and IFITM3- and shIFITM3-expressing cells were characterized previously (11Brass A.L. Huang I.-C. Benita Y. John S.P. Krishnan M.N. Feeley E.M. Ryan B.J.

The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed to a fresh tube and frozen at −20 °C. Extracts (10 μg of total protein) were resolved by electrophoresis in 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at room temperature in PBS + 1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% milk and incubated with a rabbit anti-T3D antiserum (1:500) in PBS-T plus milk at room temperature for 3 h. The membranes were washed 3× for 10 min with PBS-T and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 for 3 h.

https://openalex.org/W2106824663,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a key risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent work suggests a functional link between HCC and microRNA expression, but the mechanism underlying the functional interaction between microRNA and HBV infection has remained largely elusive. Here we present evidence that the microRNA machinery serves as a defense system against HBV infection, which, in turn, reprograms the expression of specific microRNAs. We demonstrate a critical role of miR-15a/miR-16-1 in this functional interplay between microRNA and HBV infection, but in contrast to various indirect mechanisms mediated by viral proteins, we unexpectedly found that the HBx transcript directly triggers the down-regulation of miR-15a/miR-16-1 via the microRNA targeting sequences in the viral RNA. Because miR-15a and miR-16-1 are well known tumor suppressor microRNAs in multiple human cancers, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that viral RNA-mediated down-regulation of specific tumor suppressor microRNAs may contribute to HCC development in HBV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000781581,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15), a 114-amino acid cytokine related to IL-2, regulates immune homeostasis and the fate of many lymphocyte subsets. We reported that, in the blood of mice and humans, IL-15 is present as a heterodimer associated with soluble IL-15 receptor α (sIL-15Rα). Here, we show efficient production of this noncovalently linked but stable heterodimer in clonal human HEK293 cells and release of the processed IL-15·sIL-15Rα heterodimer in the medium. Purification of the IL-15 and sIL-15Rα polypeptides allowed identification of the proteolytic cleavage site of IL-15Rα and characterization of multiple glycosylation sites. Administration of the IL-15·sIL-15Rα heterodimer reconstituted from purified subunits resulted in sustained plasma IL-15 levels and in robust expansion of NK and T cells in mice, demonstrating pharmacokinetics and in vivo bioactivity superior to single chain IL-15. These identified properties of heterodimeric IL-15 provide a strong rationale for the evaluation of this molecule for clinical applications."

However, the different contributions of these two Smads to primed pluripotency and the downstream events that they may regulate remain poorly understood. We addressed the individual roles of Smad2 and Smad3 in the maintenance of primed pluripotency. We found that Smad2, but not Smad3, is required to maintain the undifferentiated pluripotent state. We defined a Smad2 regulatory circuit in human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells, in which Smad2 acts through binding to regulatory promoter sequences to activate Nanog expression while in parallel repressing autocrine bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Increased autocrine bone morphogenetic protein signaling caused by Smad2 down-regulation leads to cell differentiation toward the trophectoderm, mesoderm, and germ cell lineages. Additionally, induction of Cdx2 expression, as a result of decreased Smad2 expression, leads to repression of Oct4 expression, which, together with the decreased Nanog expression, accelerates the loss of pluripotency.

We compared pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) with non-liposomal doxorubicin (NonL-doxo) in an intracranial model of BC.Athymic mice were inoculated intracerebrally with MDA-MB-231-BR-luciferase-expressing cells. Tumor-bearing mice were administered PLD or NonL-doxo at 6 mg/kg IV × 1 and were euthanized prior to and 0.083, 1, 3, 6, 24, 72 and 96 h post-treatment. Samples were processed to measure sum total doxorubicin via HPLC. PLD and NonL-doxo were administered IV weekly as single agents (6 mg/kg) or in combination (4.5 mg/kg) with the PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, PO 25 mg/kg/day. Efficacy was assessed by survival and bioluminescence.Treatment with PLD resulted in approximately 1,500-fold higher plasma and 20-fold higher intracranial tumor sum total doxorubicin AUC compared with NonL-doxo. PLD was detected at 96 h; NonL-doxo was undetectable after 24 h in plasma and tumor. Median survival of PLD-treated animals was 32 days (d, [CI] 31-38), which was significantly longer than controls (26d [CI 25-28]; p = 0.0012) or NonL-doxo treatment (23.5d [CI 18-28], p = 0.0002).

Patients 50 years of age or older and without conditions affecting ocular adnexal anatomy underwent glaucoma medication use history, external digital photography and systematic external adnexal exam. Two masked readers assessed the digital photos for upper lid dermatochalasis and lower lid steatoblepharon using a validated grading scheme. Another masked clinical examiner also assessed upper lid ptosis, levator muscle function, and inferior scleral show. We performed ordinal logistic regression analysis accounting for multiple covariates to assess the relation between prostaglandin analogue use and adnexal features. Multivariable analyses indicated there was a 230-fold increased risk of incremental involution of dermatochalasis (odds ratio (OR) = 2.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43–3.69; p = 5.44E-04) and a 249-fold increased risk of incremental loss of lower lid steatoblepharon (OR = 2.49; 95% CI, 1.54–4.03; p = 1.98E-04) associated with current prostaglandin analogue use (bimatoprost 0.03%, travoprost 0.005%, or latanoprost 0.004%) versus prostaglandin analogue never or past users. Upper lid ptosis (OR = 4.04; 95% CI, 2.43–6.72; p = 7.37E-08), levator dysfunction (OR = 7.51; 95% CI, 3.39–16.65; p = 6.74E-07) and lower lid retraction (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.58–4.28; p = 1.72E-04) were highly associated with current prostaglandin analogue use versus prostaglandin analogue never or past users. The associations between prostaglandin analogue use and deepening of the upper lid sulci and between prostaglandin analogue use and loss of inferior periorbital fat are confirmed in this multivariable analysis. The associations between prostaglandin analogue use and levator muscle dysfunction and between prostaglandin analogue use and upper lid ptosis represent significant side effects that could impact visual function in glaucoma patients."

We synthesized phospho-valproic acid, a novel valproic acid derivative, (P-V; MDC-1112) and evaluated its efficacy in the control of pancreatic cancer. P-V inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice by 60%-97%, and 100% when combined with cimetidine. The dominant molecular target of P-V was STAT3. P-V inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 and Src, and the Hsp90-STAT3 association, suppressing the activating phosphorylation of STAT3, which in turn reduced the expression of STAT3-dependent proteins Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and survivin. P-V also reduced STAT3 levels in the mitochondria by preventing its translocation from the cytosol, and enhanced the mitochondrial levels of reactive oxygen species, which triggered apoptosis. Inhibition of mitochondrial STAT3 by P-V was required for its anticancer effect; mitochondrial STAT3 overexpression rescued animals from the tumor growth inhibition by P-V. Our results indicate that P-V is a promising candidate drug against pancreatic cancer and establish mitochondrial STAT3 as its key molecular target."
https://openalex.org/W2060476375,"Whether development of autism impacts the interactive process between an infant and his/her parents remains an unexplored issue.Using computational analysis taking into account synchronic behaviors and emotional prosody (parentese), we assessed the course of infants' responses to parents' type of speech in home movies from typically developing (TD) infants and infants who will subsequently develop autism aged less than 18 months. Our findings indicate: that parentese was significantly associated with infant responses to parental vocalizations involving orientation towards other people and with infant receptive behaviours; that parents of infants developing autism displayed more intense solicitations that were rich in parentese; that fathers of infants developing autism spoke to their infants more than fathers of TD infants; and that fathers' vocalizations were significantly associated with intersubjective responses and active behaviours in infants who subsequently developed autism.The parents of infants who will later develop autism change their interactive pattern of behaviour by both increasing parentese and father's involvement in interacting with infants; both are significantly associated with infant's social responses. We stress the possible therapeutic implications of these findings and its implication for Dean Falk's theory regarding pre-linguistic evolution in early hominins."

AKAPs 3The abbreviations used are: AKAP, A kinase anchor protein; AC, adenylyl cyclase; β1- and β2-AR, β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor, respectively; LTD, long term depression; LTP, long term potentiation; IP, immunoprecipitation; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential; prolonged ISO, isoproterenol; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PTT-LTP, prolonged θ-tetanus-LTP; KI, knock-in. link PKA to several of its key substrates for fast, efficient, and selective phosphorylation of those targets (1Wong W.

The speed, potency, and selectivity of signaling from the cAMP-producing ACs to the cAMP-activated PKA could be further enhanced if ACs were to be part of the same signaling complexes as PKA. In fact, we showed previously that the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 as well as the L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 form complexes with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and PKA that also contain one or more AC isoforms along with the AC-stimulating trimeric Gs protein (3Davare M.A. Avdonin V.

Whereas structural and functional aspects of PKA anchoring by AKAPs are well established, how ACs are linked to these and other signaling complexes is largely unknown. Initial work showed that AC5 and AC6 can associate with the AKAP5-PKA and the AKAP6 (mAKAP)-PKA complexes for down-regulation of AC activity upon stimulation of phosphorylation of the AC by PKA within these complexes, establishing an important negative feedback mechanism for AC-PKA signaling (7Bauman A.L.

Similarly, the AKAP yotiao can interact with several ACs, and this interaction per se results in inhibition of AC2 and AC3 but not AC1 and AC9 catalytic activity (9Piggott L.A. Bauman A.L. Scott J.D.

This issue is important because, on one hand, association with AKAP5-PKA inhibits the activity of AC2, AC5, and AC6 (but not AC1, AC8, and AC9) (10Efendiev R. Samelson B.K. Nguyen B.T.

They are tetramers that are formed by one or more types of the subunits GluA1 to -4; GluA1/2 heteromers account for the majority of AMPA receptors in the hippocampus, with GluA1 homomers and GluA2/3 heteromers contributing a significantly lower portion (13Hollmann M.

We found that basal Ser-845 phosphorylation and its up-regulation by β-adrenergic stimulation is much more drastically impaired in AKAP5 KO than in D36 mice. The increase in basal glutamatergic synaptic transmission upon β-adrenergic stimulation is compromised in forebrain slices from AKAP5 D36 and KO mice. However, LTP induced by a 5-Hz/180-s tetanus, which requires β-adrenergic stimulation in addition to the electric stimulus train, is only modestly reduced in D36 but completely abrogated in KO mice. We conclude that anchoring of AC by AKAP5 is important for positive regulation of postsynaptic functions that include AMPA receptor activity by cAMP-PKA signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2025362591,"The estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is the apex-predator in waterways and coastlines throughout south-east Asia and Australasia. C. porosus pose a potential risk to humans, and management strategies are implemented to control their movement and distribution. Here we used GPS-based telemetry to accurately record geographical location of adult C. porosus during the breeding and nesting season. The purpose of the study was to assess how C. porosus movement and distribution may be influenced by localised social conditions. During breeding, the females (2.92 ± 0.013 metres total length (TL), mean ± S.E., n = 4) occupied an area<1 km length of river, but to nest they travelled up to 54 km away from the breeding area. All tagged male C. porosus sustained high rates of movement (6.49 ± 0.9 km d(-1); n = 8) during the breeding and nesting period. The orientation of the daily movements differed between individuals revealing two discontinuous behavioural strategies. Five tagged male C. porosus (4.17 ± 0.14 m TL) exhibited a 'site-fidelic' strategy and moved within well-defined zones around the female home range areas. In contrast, three males (3.81 ± 0.08 m TL) exhibited 'nomadic' behaviour where they travelled continually throughout hundreds of kilometres of waterway. We argue that the 'site-fidelic' males patrolled territories around the female home ranges to maximise reproductive success, whilst the 'nomadic' males were subordinate animals that were forced to range over a far greater area in search of unguarded females. We conclude that C. porosus are highly mobile animals existing within a complex social system, and mate/con-specific interactions are likely to have a profound effect upon population density and distribution, and an individual's travel potential. We recommend that impacts on socio-spatial behaviour are considered prior to the implementation of management interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2151969214,"Genotype-to-phenotype maps and the related fitness landscapes that include epistatic interactions are difficult to measure because of their high dimensional structure. Here we construct such a map using the recently collected corpora of high-throughput sequence data from the 75 base pairs long mutagenized E. coli lac promoter region, where each sequence is associated with its phenotype, the induced transcriptional activity measured by a fluorescent reporter. We find that the additive (non-epistatic) contributions of individual mutations account for about two-thirds of the explainable phenotype variance, while pairwise epistasis explains about 7% of the variance for the full mutagenized sequence and about 15% for the subsequence associated with protein binding sites. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for third order epistatic contributions, and our inferred fitness landscape is essentially single peaked, with a small amount of antagonistic epistasis. There is a significant selective pressure on the wild type, which we deduce to be multi-objective optimal for gene expression in environments with different nutrient sources. We identify transcription factor (CRP) and RNA polymerase binding sites in the promotor region and their interactions without difficult optimization steps. In particular, we observe evidence for previously unexplored genetic regulatory mechanisms, possibly kinetic in nature. We conclude with a cautionary note that inferred properties of fitness landscapes may be severely influenced by biases in the sequence data."

In Estonia we found statistically significant differences in the TBEV prevalence between I. persulcatus and I. ricinus ticks (4.23% and 0.42%, respectively). In Latvia, the difference in TBEV prevalence between the two species was not statistically significant (1.02% for I. persulcatus and 1.51% for I. ricinus, respectively). In Lithuania and Poland TBEV was detected in 0.24% and 0.11% of I. ricinus ticks, respectively. Genetic characterization of the partial E and NS3 sequences demonstrated that the TBEV strains belonged to the European subtype in all countries, as well as to the Siberian subtype in Estonia. We also found that in areas where ranges of two tick species overlap, the TBEV subtypes may be detected not only in their natural vector, but also in sympatric tick species."
https://openalex.org/W2039988546,"Purpose This study investigated the supraspinal processes of fatigue of the quadriceps muscle in response to repeated cycling sprints. Methods Twelve active individuals performed 10 × 6-s “all-out” sprints on a cycle ergometer (recovery = 30 s), followed 6 min later by 5 × 6-s sprints (recovery = 30 s). Transcranial magnetic and electrical femoral nerve stimulations during brief (5-s) and sustained (30-s) isometric contractions of the knee extensors were performed before and 3 min post-exercise. Results Maximal strength of the knee extensors decreased during brief and sustained contractions (∼11% and 9%, respectively; P<0.001). Peripheral and cortical voluntary activation, motor evoked potential amplitude and silent period duration responses measured during briefs contractions were unaltered (P>0.05). While cortical voluntary activation declined (P<0.01) during the sustained maximal contraction in both test sessions, larger reductions occurred (P<0.05) after exercise. Lastly, resting twitch amplitude in response to both femoral nerve and cortical stimulations was largely (> 40%) reduced (P<0.001) following exercise. Conclusion The capacity of the motor cortex to optimally drive the knee extensors following a repeated-sprint test was shown in sustained, but not brief, maximal isometric contractions. Additionally, peripheral factors were largely involved in the exercise-induced impairment in neuromuscular function, while corticospinal excitability was well-preserved."
https://openalex.org/W1983641328,"Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is heterogeneous at the clinical, pathological, genetic, and epigenetic levels. Exome sequencing has identified ARID1A as a novel tumor suppressor gene coding for a chromatin remodeling protein that is mutated in UBC. Here, we assess ARID1A alterations in two series of patients with UBC. In the first tumor series, we analyze exons 2-20 in 52 primary UBC and find that all mutant tumors belong to the aggressive UBC phenotype (high grade non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive tumors) (P = 0.05). In a second series (n = 84), we assess ARID1A expression using immunohistochemistry, a surrogate for mutation analysis, and find that loss of expression increases with higher stage/grade, it is inversely associated with FGFR3 overexpression (P = 0.03) but it is not correlated with p53 overexpression (P = 0.30). We also analyzed the expression of cytokeratins in the same set of tumor and find, using unsupervised clustering, that tumors with ARID1A loss of expression are generally KRT5/6-low. In this patient series, loss of ARID1A expression is also associated with worse prognosis, likely reflecting the higher prevalence of losses found in tumors of higher stage and grade. The independent findings in these two sets of patients strongly support the notion that ARID1A inactivation is a key player in bladder carcinogenesis occurring predominantly in FGFR3 wild type tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2090203346,"Genomic instability is a known precursor to cancer and aging. The RecQ helicases are a highly conserved family of DNA-unwinding enzymes that play key roles in maintaining genome stability in all living organisms. Human RecQ homologs include RECQ1, BLM, WRN, RECQ4, and RECQ5β, three of which have been linked to diseases with elevated risk of cancer and growth defects (Bloom Syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome) or premature aging (Werner Syndrome). RECQ1, the first RecQ helicase discovered and the most abundant in human cells, is the least well understood of the five human RecQ homologs. We have previously described that knockout of RECQ1 in mice or knockdown of its expression in human cells results in elevated frequency of spontaneous sister chromatid exchanges, chromosomal instability, increased load of DNA damage and heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We have now obtained evidence implicating RECQ1 in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. We show that RECQ1 interacts directly with the Ku70/80 subunit of the DNA-PK complex, and depletion of RECQ1 results in reduced end-joining in cell free extracts. In vitro, RECQ1 binds and unwinds the Ku70/80-bound partial duplex DNA substrate efficiently. Linear DNA is co-bound by RECQ1 and Ku70/80, and DNA binding by Ku70/80 is modulated by RECQ1. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence for an interaction of RECQ1 with Ku70/80 and a role of the human RecQ helicase in double-strand break repair through nonhomologous end-joining."
https://openalex.org/W2134833646,"The contribution of distant and/or bone marrow-derived endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to skin wounds is controversial. Bone marrow transplantation experiments employed to address this have been largely confounded by radiation-resistant host-derived MSC populations. Gestationally-acquired fetal MSC are known to engraft in maternal bone marrow in all pregnancies and persist for decades. These fetal cells home to damaged maternal tissues, mirroring endogenous stem cell behavior. We used fetal microchimerism as a tool to investigate the natural homing and engraftment of distant MSC to skin wounds. Post-partum wild-type mothers that had delivered transgenic pups expressing luciferase under the collagen type I-promoter were wounded. In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was then used to track recruitment of fetal cells expressing this mesenchymal marker over 14 days of healing. Fetal cells were detected in 9/43 animals using BLI (Fisher exact p = 0.01 versus 1/43 controls). These collagen type I-expressing fetal cells were specifically recruited to maternal wounds in the initial phases of healing, peaking on day 1 (n = 43, p<0.01). This was confirmed by detection of Y-chromosome+ve fetal cells that displayed fibroblast-like morphology. Histological analyses of day 7 wounds revealed vimentin-expressing fetal cells in dermal tissue. Our results demonstrate the participation of distant mesenchymal cells in skin wounds. These data imply that endogenous MSC populations are likely recruited from bone marrow to wounds to participate in healing."
https://openalex.org/W2128165971,"The role of conformational ensembles in enzymatic reactions remains unclear. Discussion concerning ""induced fit"" versus ""conformational selection"" has, however, ignored detoxication enzymes, which exhibit catalytic promiscuity. These enzymes dominate drug metabolism and determine drug-drug interactions. The detoxication enzyme glutathione transferase A1-1 (GSTA1-1), exploits a molten globule-like active site to achieve remarkable catalytic promiscuity wherein the substrate-free conformational ensemble is broad with barrierless transitions between states. A quantitative index of catalytic promiscuity is used to compare engineered variants of GSTA1-1 and the catalytic promiscuity correlates strongly with characteristics of the thermodynamic partition function, for the substrate-free enzymes. Access to chemically disparate transition states is encoded by the substrate-free conformational ensemble. Pre-steady state catalytic data confirm an extension of the conformational selection model, wherein different substrates select different starting conformations. The kinetic liability of the conformational breadth is minimized by a smooth landscape. We propose that ""local"" molten globule behavior optimizes detoxication enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2070201099,"In Catharanthus roseus, the monoterpene moiety exerts a strong flux control for monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) formation. Monoterpene synthesis depends on the methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here, we have explored the regulation of this pathway in response to developmental and environmental cues and in response to specific enzyme inhibitors. For the MEP pathway entry enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), a new (type I) DXS isoform, CrDXS1, has been cloned, which, in contrast to previous reports on type II CrDXS, was not transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor ORCA3. Regulation of the MEP pathway in response to metabolic perturbations has been explored using the enzyme inhibitors clomazone (precursor of 5-ketochlomazone, inhibitor of DXS) and fosmidomycin (inhibitor of deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR)), respectively. Young leaves of non-flowering plants were exposed to both inhibitors, adopting a non-invasive in vivo technique. Transcripts and proteins of DXS (3 isoforms), DXR, and hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (HDS) were monitored, and protein stability was followed in isolated chloroplasts. Transcripts for DXS1 were repressed by both inhibitors, whereas transcripts for DXS2A&B, DXR and HDS increased after clomazone treatment but were barely affected by fosmidomycin treatment. DXS protein accumulated in response to both inhibitors, whereas DXR and HDS proteins were less affected. Fosmidomycin-induced accumulation of DXS protein indicated substantial posttranscriptional regulation. Furthermore, fosmidomycin effectively protected DXR against degradation in planta and in isolated chloroplasts. Thus our results suggest that DXR protein stability may be affected by substrate binding. In summary, the present results provide novel insight into the regulation of DXS expression in C. roseus in response to MEP-pathway perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2155066186,"Spiders are the most important terrestrial predators among arthropods. Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further. Hypotheses about the origin of the adhesive setae and their diversification throughout evolution are provided."

However, this distance range poses a significant challenge because it is too large for fluorescence resonance energy transfer and contains distances too small for all other techniques capable of high-resolution in cells. Here we have adapted the technique of fluorophore localisation imaging with photobleaching to measure inter-receptor separations in the cellular environment. Using the epidermal growth factor receptor, a key cancer target molecule, we demonstrate ~10 nm resolution while continuously covering the range of ~10-80 nm. By labelling the receptor on cells expressing low receptor numbers with a fluorescent antagonist we have found inter-receptor separations all the way up from 8 nm to 59 nm. Our data are consistent with epidermal growth factor receptors being able to form homo-polymers of at least 10 receptors in the absence of activating ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2074872733,"Uncontrolled, excessive inflammation contributes to the secondary tissue damage of traumatic spinal cord, and HMGB1 is highlighted for initiation of a vicious self-propagating inflammatory circle by release from necrotic cells or immune cells. Several regenerative-competent vertebrates have evolved to circumvent the second damages during the spontaneous spinal cord regeneration with an unknown HMGB1 regulatory mechanism. By genomic surveys, we have revealed that two paralogs of HMGB1 are broadly retained from fish in the phylogeny. However, their spatial-temporal expression and effects, as shown in lowest amniote gecko, were tightly controlled in order that limited inflammation was produced in spontaneous regeneration. Two paralogs from gecko HMGB1 (gHMGB1) yielded distinct injury and infectious responses, with gHMGB1b significantly up-regulated in the injured cord. The intracellular gHMGB1b induced less release of inflammatory cytokines than gHMGB1a in macrophages, and the effects could be shifted by exchanging one amino acid in the inflammatory domain. Both intracellular proteins were able to mediate neuronal programmed apoptosis, which has been indicated to produce negligible inflammatory responses. In vivo studies demonstrated that the extracellular proteins could not trigger a cascade of the inflammatory cytokines in the injured spinal cord. Signal transduction analysis found that gHMGB1 proteins could not bind with cell surface receptors TLR2 and TLR4 to activate inflammatory signaling pathway. However, they were able to interact with the receptor for advanced glycation end products to potentiate oligodendrocyte migration by activation of both NFκB and Rac1/Cdc42 signaling. Our results reveal that HMGB1 does not mediate the inflammatory response in spontaneous spinal cord regeneration, but it promotes CNS regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2124475426,"Androgen signaling via the androgen receptor is a key pathway that contributes to development, cell fate decisions, and differentiation, including that of myogenic progenitors. Androgens and synthetic steroids have well established anabolic actions on skeletal muscle. Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are also essential to myogenic cell fate decisions during development and tissue repair. However, the interactions among these pathways are largely unknown. Androgenic regulation of Wnt signaling has been reported. Nandrolone, an anabolic steroid, has been shown to inhibit Notch signaling and up-regulate Numb, a Notch inhibitor. To elucidate the mechanisms of interaction between nandrolone and Wnt/Notch signaling, we investigated the effects of nandrolone on Numb expression and Wnt signaling and determined the roles of Wnt signaling in nandrolone-induced Numb expression in C2C12 myoblasts. Nandrolone increased Numb mRNA and protein levels and T cell factor (Tcf) transcriptional activity via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Up-regulation of Numb expression by nandrolone was blocked by the Wnt inhibitors, sFRP1 and DKK1, whereas Wnt3a increased Numb mRNA and protein expression. In addition, we observed that the proximal promoter of the Numb gene had functional Tcf binding elements to which β-catenin was recruited in a manner enhanced by both nandrolone and Wnt3a. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the Tcf binding sites in the Numb promoter are required for the nandrolone-induced Numb transcriptional activation in this cell line. These results reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying up-regulation of Numb transcription with a critical role for increased canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, the data identify Numb as a novel target gene of the Wnt signaling pathway by which Wnts would be able to inhibit Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2076327239,"The Na+/I– symporter (NIS) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that mediates active I– transport in the thyroid, the first step in the biosynthesis of the iodine-containing thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Several NIS mutants have been identified as a cause of congenital I– transport defect (ITD), and their investigation has yielded valuable mechanistic information on NIS. Here we report a thorough characterization of the ITD-causing NIS mutation in which the sixth intracellular loop residues 439-443 are missing. This mutant protein was intracellularly retained, incompletely glycosylated, and intrinsically inactive. Engineering 5 Ala at positions 439-443 partially recovered cell surface targeting and activity (~15%). Strikingly, NIS with the sequence 439-AANAA-443, in which Asn was restored at position 441, was targeted to the plasma membrane and exhibited ~95% the transport activity of WT NIS. Based on our NIS homology model, we propose that the side chain of N441, a residue conserved throughout most of the SLC5 family, interacts with the main chain amino group of G444, capping the α-helix of transmembrane segment XII and thus stabilizing the structure of the molecule.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (outcomes), PA and SB, both independently and combined, and potential confounders were analyzed. Associations were examined by multilevel linear regression.Performing the recommended amount of PA (≥ 60 min/d) attenuated the effect of SB on DBP in BRACAH study girls and in boys from both studies. In contrast, PA did not attenuate the effects of SB on the SBP of girls in the HELENA study. The combination of less than recommended levels of PA with 2-4 h/d of sedentary behavior was found to be associated with increased SBP in boys from both studies.Meeting current PA recommendations could mediate the association between SB and DBP in both sexes. In boys, the joint effect of low levels of PA and excessive sedentary activity increases SBP levels. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2141770319,"Human aging into senescence diminishes the capacity of the postural control system to adapt to the stressors of everyday life. Diminished adaptive capacity may be reflected by a loss of the fractal-like, multiscale complexity within the dynamics of standing postural sway (i.e., center-of-pressure, COP). We therefore studied the relationship between COP complexity and adaptive capacity in 22 older and 22 younger healthy adults. COP magnitude dynamics were assessed from raw data during quiet standing with eyes open and closed, and complexity was quantified with a new technique termed empirical mode decomposition embedded detrended fluctuation analysis (EMD-DFA). Adaptive capacity of the postural control system was assessed with the sharpened Romberg test. As compared to traditional DFA, EMD-DFA more accurately identified trends in COP data with intrinsic scales and produced short and long-term scaling exponents (i.e., α(Short), α(Long)) with greater reliability. The fractal-like properties of COP fluctuations were time-scale dependent and highly complex (i.e., α(Short) values were close to one) over relatively short time scales. As compared to younger adults, older adults demonstrated lower short-term COP complexity (i.e., greater α(Short) values) in both visual conditions (p>0.001). Closing the eyes decreased short-term COP complexity, yet this decrease was greater in older compared to younger adults (p<0.001). In older adults, those with higher short-term COP complexity exhibited better adaptive capacity as quantified by Romberg test performance (r(2) = 0.38, p<0.001). These results indicate that an age-related loss of COP complexity of magnitude series may reflect a clinically important reduction in postural control system functionality as a new biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2142216509,"Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is a master regulator for steroidogenesis. In this study, we identified novel SF-1 target genes using a genome-wide promoter tiling array and a DNA microarray. SF-1 was found to regulate human glutathione S-transferase A (GSTA) family genes (hGSTA1-hGSTA4), a superfamily of detoxification enzymes clustered on chromosome 6p12. All hGSTA genes were up-regulated by transduction of SF-1 into human mesenchymal stem cells, while knockdown of endogenous SF-1 in H295R cells down-regulated all hGSTA genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, however, revealed that SF-1 bound directly to the promoters of hGSTA3 and weakly of hGSTA4. Chromosome conformation capture assays revealed that the coordinated expression of the genes was based on changes in higher-order chromatin structure triggered by SF-1, which enables the formation of long-range interactions, at least between hGSTA1 and hGSTA3 gene promoters. In steroidogenesis, dehydrogenation of the 3-hydroxy group and subsequent Δ(5)-Δ(4) isomerization are thought to be enzymatic properties of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). Here, we demonstrated that, in steroidogenic cells, the hGSTA1 and hGSTA3 gene products catalyze Δ(5)-Δ(4) isomerization in a coordinated fashion with 3β-HSD II to produce progesterone or Δ(4)-androstenedione from their Δ(5)-precursors. Thus, hGSTA1 and hGSTA3 gene products are new members of steroidogenesis working as Δ(5)-Δ(4) isomerases."

However, although the behavioral studies of dogs are beginning to be common in the field of animal cognition, the neural events underlying cognition remain unknown. Here, we employed a non-invasive electroencephalography, with adhesive electrodes attached to the top of the skin, to measure brain activity of from 8 domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) while they stayed still to observe photos of dog and human faces. Spontaneous oscillatory activity of the dogs, peaking in the sensors over the parieto-occipital cortex, was suppressed statistically significantly during visual task compared with resting activity at the frequency of 15-30 Hz. Moreover, a stimulus-induced low-frequency (~2-6 Hz) suppression locked to the stimulus onset was evident at the frontal sensors, possibly reflecting a motor rhythm guiding the exploratory eye movements. The results suggest task-related reactivity of the macroscopic oscillatory activity in the dog brain. To our knowledge, the study is the first to reveal non-invasively measured reactivity of brain electrophysiological oscillations in healthy dogs, and it has been based purely on positive operant conditional training, without the need for movement restriction or medication."
https://openalex.org/W2002826770,"Administration of recombinant factor VIII (FVIII), an important co-factor in blood clotting cascade, elicits unwanted anti-FVIII antibodies in hemophilia A (HA) patients. Previously, FVIII associated with phosphatidylserine (PS) showed significant reduction in the anti-FVIII antibody response in HA mice. The reduction in the immune response to FVIII-PS could be due either to a failure of the immune system to recognize the antigen (i.e. immunological ignorance) or to an active induction of an antigen-specific nonresponsiveness (i.e. immunological tolerance). If it were a result of tolerance, one would predict that pre-exposure to FVIII-PS would render the mice hypo-responsive to a subsequent FVIII challenge. Here, we have demonstrated that naive HA mice that were pretreated with FVIII-PS showed a significantly reduced FVIII immune response to further challenge with native FVIII and that this decreased responsiveness could be adoptively transferred to other mice. An increase in number of FoxP3-expressing CD4+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) was observed for the FVIII-PS-immunized group as compared with animals that received FVIII alone, suggesting the involvement of Treg in PS-mediated hypo-responsiveness. The PS-mediated reduction in antibody response was reversed by the co-administration of function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibody with FVIII-PS. The decreased response to FVIII induced by FVIII-PS was determined to be antigen-specific because the immune response to another non-cross-reactive antigen (ovalbumin) was not altered. These results are consistent with the notion that FVIII-PS is tolerogenic and suggest that immunization with this tolerogenic form of the protein could be a useful treatment option to minimize immunogenicity of FVIII and other protein-based therapeutics.Background: Phosphatidylserine (PS) reduces immunogenicity of FVIII by possibly inducing tolerance.Results: FVIII-PS exposure leads to hypo-responsiveness in hemophilia A mice to FVIII challenge but responds normally to ovalbumin.Conclusion: Exposure of FVIII in the presence of PS leads to hypo-responsiveness/tolerance.Significance: An innovative reverse/inverse vaccination could desensitize the patients to antigen. Administration of recombinant factor VIII (FVIII), an important co-factor in blood clotting cascade, elicits unwanted anti-FVIII antibodies in hemophilia A (HA) patients. Previously, FVIII associated with phosphatidylserine (PS) showed significant reduction in the anti-FVIII antibody response in HA mice. The reduction in the immune response to FVIII-PS could be due either to a failure of the immune system to recognize the antigen (i.e. immunological ignorance) or to an active induction of an antigen-specific nonresponsiveness (i.e. immunological tolerance). If it were a result of tolerance, one would predict that pre-exposure to FVIII-PS would render the mice hypo-responsive to a subsequent FVIII challenge. Here, we have demonstrated that naive HA mice that were pretreated with FVIII-PS showed a significantly reduced FVIII immune response to further challenge with native FVIII and that this decreased responsiveness could be adoptively transferred to other mice. An increase in number of FoxP3-expressing CD4+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) was observed for the FVIII-PS-immunized group as compared with animals that received FVIII alone, suggesting the involvement of Treg in PS-mediated hypo-responsiveness. The PS-mediated reduction in antibody response was reversed by the co-administration of function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibody with FVIII-PS. The decreased response to FVIII induced by FVIII-PS was determined to be antigen-specific because the immune response to another non-cross-reactive antigen (ovalbumin) was not altered. These results are consistent with the notion that FVIII-PS is tolerogenic and suggest that immunization with this tolerogenic form of the protein could be a useful treatment option to minimize immunogenicity of FVIII and other protein-based therapeutics. Background: Phosphatidylserine (PS) reduces immunogenicity of FVIII by possibly inducing tolerance. Results: FVIII-PS exposure leads to hypo-responsiveness in hemophilia A mice to FVIII challenge but responds normally to ovalbumin. Conclusion: Exposure of FVIII in the presence of PS leads to hypo-responsiveness/tolerance. Significance: An innovative reverse/inverse vaccination could desensitize the patients to antigen. The advent of recombinant technology is a boon to the development of recombinant therapeutic proteins including the blood clotting factor, factor VIII. Currently, recombinant factor FVIII (FVIII) 3The abbreviations used are: FVIII, factor VIII; HA, hemophilia A; PS, brain phosphatidylserine; PC, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine; PG, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol; Dex, dexamethasone; Ova, ovalbumin; Nab, neutralizing antibody; Treg, regulatory T-cell; DC, dendritic cell; PE, phycoerythrin. is the first line of therapy for hemophilia A (HA) patients. Unfortunately, a major drawback of the therapy is the generation of anti-protein neutralizing (Nabs) and binding antibodies, which are observed in about 15–30% of the patient population (1Lollar P. Healey J.F. Barrow R.T. Parker E.T. Factor VIII inhibitors.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 489: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nabs abrogate the activity of the protein, rendering it less efficacious, whereas other binding antibodies negatively affect the pharmacokinetics of the protein. Any approach to reduce immunogenicity and reverse the inhibitor development would address an unmet medical need. Our previous studies showed that FVIII complexed with phosphatidylserine (PS) significantly reduced the development of antibody response against FVIII in HA mice (2Ramani K. Miclea R.D. Purohit V.S.

The studies aimed at understanding the mechanism of this reduction showed that FVIII-PS down-regulated the expression of CD40 upon exposure to bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) (4Gaitonde P.

Further, T-cell activation studies wherein the incubation of FVIII-PS exposed DC with FVIII-primed splenic CD4+ T-cells resulted in significant reduction in T-cell proliferation. This was also accompanied by an increase in the secretion of key immunoregulatory TGF-β and IL-10 cytokines and a simultaneous decrease in pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-17 cytokines levels in the co-culture. These observations are consistent with the notion that PS could present FVIII to DC in a tolerogenic manner (5Waters B. Lillicrap D.

Thus, one would expect that pre-exposure to FVIII-PS complex will render a state of immunological hypo-responsiveness toward rechallenge with FVIII. The results presented here demonstrate that pre-exposure to FVIII-PS using a novel reverse/inverse vaccination strategy does induce hypo-responsiveness in the animals. Excipient-free, recombinant human full-length factor VIII was a generous gift from Western New York Hemophilia Foundation, Buffalo, NY. Brain phosphatidylserine, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibody was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). High purity dexamethasone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sterile syringes, needles, and isoflurane were purchased from Butler Schein (Dublin, OH). Endosafe® endotoxin kit was purchased from Charles River Laboratories International Inc. (Wilmington, MA). EndoGrade ovalbumin was purchased from Hyglos GmbH. Exon 16-deleted, transgenic, factor VIII knock-out mice were used for all the studies, unless mentioned otherwise. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FoxP3 knock-in FVIII−/− mice were exclusively used for regulatory T-cell (Treg) study. The animals were handled and surgical procedures were performed as per the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University at Buffalo. Liposomes were prepared, sized, and associated with FVIII as per the method described by Ramani et al. (2Ramani K. Miclea R.D. Purohit V.S. Mager D.E. Straubinger R.M. Balu-Iyer S.V. Phosphatidylserine containing liposomes reduce immunogenicity of recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) in a murine model of hemophilia A.J. Pharm. Sci. 2008; 97: 1386-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The complexes were tested for endotoxin level by using the Endosafe Endochrome-K endotoxin assay kit (Charles River Laboratories International), and endotoxin negative samples were used for in vivo studies. A total of 39 naive hemophilic mice were divided into five groups with each group containing 7–8 animals. The animals were administered with once-a-week subcutaneous injections of 1 μg (∼5 IU) of free FVIII or FVIII-PS or FVIII-PC or FVIII-PG or FVIII + dexamethasone (Dex) (henceforth, the FVIII-lipid or FVIII+Dex preparations are abbreviated as FVIII-PS/PC/PG/Dex) for 4 consecutive weeks. Frequent administration of a low dose of Dex (200 ng/injection) was preferred to avoid severe immunosuppression of lymphocyte activity. On the 6th week, all animals were rechallenged aggressively with four weekly subcutaneous administrations of 1 μg of free FVIII. On the 11th week, the animals were sacrificed, and blood was collected in 10% acid citrate dextrose, centrifuged, and plasma was isolated. The base-line anti-FVIII titer values before the start of FVIII rechallenge were determined by immunizing animals with four weekly injections of 1 μg of free FVIII or FVIII-PS/PC/PG/Dex. Twenty naive hemophilic mice were equally divided into four groups and administered with 1 μg of free FVIII or FVIII-PS/PC complexes once a week for 4 consecutive weeks via the subcutaneous route. The fourth group received four weekly immunizations of 1 μg of ovalbumin (Ova) only and served as a control group. The FVIII- or FVIII-PS/PC-immunized animals were also co-administered with four weekly injections of 1 μg of Ova at a different anatomical site than the FVIII- or FVIII-lipid-administered site. On the 6th week, all animals were sacrificed, and plasma was collected as described. Naive hemophilic mice were equally divided into four groups. Each group received four weekly injections of 10 IU of free FVIII (ADVATE®, Baxter, Deerfield, IL; 1,500 IU/vial; activity 1 μg = ∼7 IU of FVIII) or FVIII-PS/PG via the subcutaneous route. The fourth group was kept untreated and served as the naive control group. Two weeks after the last injection, all animals were sacrificed, and their spleens were collected and homogenized. Total lymphocyte count for each spleen cell suspension was determined by using the BC 2800 Vet auto hematology analyzer (Mindray, Mahwah, NJ) instrument and subjected to CD4+CD25+ T-cell isolation using a CD4+CD25+ T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Approximately 0.1 × 106 CD4+CD25+ T-cells were adoptively transferred into corresponding individual naive HA mice. After a 48-h wait period, all the recipient animals were immunized aggressively with four weekly subcutaneous injections of 1 μg of free FVIII/injection. Two weeks after the last injection, all animals were sacrificed, and plasma samples were collected as described. Immunization studies were conducted in hemophilia A mice model. The animals (n = 3/treatment group) received subcutaneous injections of either free FVIII or FVIII-PS (2 μg of FVIII) every week for 12 weeks. Two weeks after the last injection, the CD4+ T-cells were isolated from spleen of the immunized animal and were stained with FITC conjugated to CD4 antibody and PE-conjugated to anti-FoxP3 antibody. The double positive cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. To account for the spectral overlap of FITC and PE, compensation using singly labeled FITC and PE controls were acquired, and compensation was carried out using FlowJo software. The role of Treg cells and the regulatory cytokine TGF-β in PS-mediated tolerance was also confirmed using immunogenicity studies conducted in GFP-FoxP3 knock-in FVIII−/− mice, and GFP expression was used as a read-out for population of Tregs. FoxP3-GFP-FVIII−/− mice received four weekly subcutaneous injections of either free FVIII (n = 12) or FVIII-PS (1 μg FVIII/injection) in the presence (n = 10) and in the absence (n = 12) of function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibody. The TGF-β antibody (20 μg/injection; subcutaneous) was administered along with FVIII-PS. Animals were sacrificed on the 6th week, and lymph nodes were isolated and prepared for analysis using flow cytometry. The dot plots generated were analyzed either by Cell Quest software provided by the manufacturer or by FlowJo® software. Further, total lymphocytes were gated based on side scatter versus forward scatter criteria, and the gated regions that contained total lymphocyte count of at least 10% of total lymph node cell count were analyzed for GFP expression. The data were expressed as the percentage of GFP-FoxP3+ cells in the gated total lymphocytes region. The B-cell responses were followed by measuring total anti-FVIII antibody titers in Treg mice. All plasma samples were analyzed for anti-FVIII Nab titers by activated partial Thromboplastin time assay following Nijmegen's modified Bethesda assay (9Verbruggen B. Novakova I. Wessels H. Boezeman J. van den Berg M. Mauser-Bunschoten E. The Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay for factor VIII:C inhibitors: improved specificity and reliability.Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and expressed in Bethesda units/ml. Total anti-FVIII antibody titers were determined by ELISA as described previously (3Purohit V.S. Ramani K. Sarkar R. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Balasubramanian S.V. Lower inhibitor development in hemophilia A mice following administration of recombinant factor VIII-O-phospho-l-serine complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17593-17600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Naive hemophilic mice (n = 4 per group) received four weekly injections of 10 IU of free FVIII (ADVATE®, Baxter) or FVIII-PS via the subcutaneous route. One group of animals (n = 4) was left untreated. Two weeks after the last injection, all animals were sacrificed, and their plasma samples were analyzed for clotting time and efficacy. The plasma samples from the above animals were mixed (1:24) with FVIII-deficient human plasma. This mixture was then mixed (1:1) with normal human plasma and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the residual biological activity of FVIII was measured as clotting time using a Coag-A-Mate coagulation analyzer (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). Total anti-Ova antibody levels in the plasma samples (see “Effect of PS on Other Concomitantly Administered Foreign Antigens”) were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Alpha Diagnostics International Inc., San Antonio, TX) and expressed as antibody activity units (titer)/ml (units/ml) as determined from the standard curve. Kilounits/ml represent 1,000 × units/ml. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's or Dunnett's post hoc analyses was performed using the GraphPad Prism statistical software unless otherwise specified. p < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference. For the Treg study, statistical analysis was carried out using one-tailed paired Student's t test using the Minitab software. If PS presents FVIII in a tolerogenic manner to DC, pre-exposure should lead to immunological hypo-responsiveness to FVIII rechallenge. Thus, the experimental design involved pre-exposure of HA mice to FVIII-lipid complex, and the antibody response was measured following rechallenge with FVIII. Levels of anti-FVIII Nabs in animals preimmunized with either free FVIII (567 ± 72) or FVIII-PC (570 ± 55 S.E.), FVIII-PG (677 ± 88 S.E.), or FVIII + Dex (539 ± 34 S.E.) showed comparable levels of anti-FVIII Nabs (Fig. 1A). In contrast, animals pretreated with FVIII-PS showed significantly reduced FVIII Nab levels (298 ± 40 S.E.). Further, to determine the rate of progression of immune response after rechallenge, a correlation of the mean anti-FVIII Nab titers measured on the 6th and 11th week for each group was performed (supplemental Table 1). After administration/priming of FVIII or FVIII PS/PC/PG/Dex, the Nab titer levels were measured at the end of the 6th week. Naive HA mice that received free FVIII alone showed high levels of anti-FVIII Nab titers (282 ± 39 S.E.). In comparison, significant reduction in base-line anti-FVIII Nab titers on the 6th week was observed in animals that were immunized with FVIII-PS (93 ± 19 S.E.) or FVIII-PC (111 ± 18 S.E.). This is consistent with our previously observed results where PS significantly reduced FVIII immune response in naive HA mice (2Ramani K. Miclea R.D. Purohit V.S. Mager D.E. Straubinger R.M. Balu-Iyer S.V. Phosphatidylserine containing liposomes reduce immunogenicity of recombinant human factor VIII (rFVIII) in a murine model of hemophilia A.J. Pharm. Sci. 2008; 97: 1386-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). FVIII complexed with anionic PG liposomes produced Nab levels (195 ± 55 S.E.) statistically comparable with the levels observed in free FVIII-immunized animals. Further, animals that were immunized with FVIII in the presence of low doses of Dex (immunosuppressant) developed relatively minimal levels of anti-FVIII antibodies (39 ± 9 S.E.). However, the Nab-lowering beneficial effect observed with Dex and PC pretreatment on the 6th week did not extend after their administration was stopped (after the 6th week). The data clearly demonstrate that only PS was able to significantly delay the progress of FVIII immune response even after the PS exposure was stopped on the 6th week. Thus, the results indicate that pre-exposure of FVIII-PS leads to hypo-responsiveness toward FVIII rechallenge. As the pre-exposure of FVIII in the presence of PS induces hypo-responsiveness, we propose a novel clinical approach, a reverse/inverse vaccination to reduce unwanted immunogenic response against therapeutic proteins. Unlike conventional vaccination approaches, this approach desensitizes the patient to an antigen, and thus, these patients will be unable to immunologically respond to the protein. During the reverse vaccination strategy, it is desirable that the immunization should not interfere with the ability of the immune system to mount immune responses against other antigens and pathogens. To investigate the antigen specificity and effect of immunization on the systemic immune suppression, another foreign antigen, Ova, was concomitantly administered with either FVIII or FVIII-PS/PC complexes, but at a distant anatomical site. Anti-FVIII Nab titers in animals that were administered with FVIII-PS (100 ± 17 S.E.) were significantly lower than the free FVIII (375 ± 60 S.E.)-immunized group (Fig. 1B). Mice that were immunized with only Ova had no anti-FVIII Nabs. However, all animals showed statistically comparable anti-Ova titers irrespective of the treatment group (Fig. 1C). As the animals responded to Ova by developing comparable titers, the data suggest that FVIII-PS does not render systemic immunosuppressive effects and that the antigen-specific hypo-responsiveness could be achieved by presenting antigen of interest with PS lipid. The generation of peripherally induced Tregs can regulate immune response by suppressing effector cells. The involvement of induced Tregs in inducing hypo-responsiveness toward FVIII is supported by our adoptive cell transfer studies. Upon adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ T-cells from FVIII- or FVIII-PS/PG-immunized or naive donor mice, recipient mice were challenged with free FVIII, and anti-FVIII Nab titers were measured (Fig. 2A). Mice that received CD4+CD25+ T-cells from FVIII-treated or T-cells from naive (unimmunized) mice elicited robust FVIII immune response (Nab titers of 503 ± 90 S.E. and 519 ± 29 S.E., respectively). In comparison, mice that received CD4+CD25+ T-cells from FVIII-PS-treated donor mice exhibited significantly reduced anti-FVIII Nab titers (177 ± 11 S.E.). However, CD4+CD25+ T-cells transferred from mice treated with FVIII associated with another negative charge PG lipid (FVIII-PG) failed to significantly reduce Nab titers (331 ± 32 S.E.). These results indicate that the FVIII-PS-induced hypo-responsiveness is transferrable and that CD4+CD25+ T-cells may be involved in the generation of this hypo-responsiveness. To further investigate whether induced Tregs are generated upon pre-exposure of FVIII in the presence of PS, the splenocytes derived from immunized animal were analyzed for FoxP3 expression, a biomarker for Treg. An increase in CD4+ FoxP3+ double positive cells was observed for the FVIII-PS treatment group as compared with the FVIII alone treatment group (Fig. 2B). This observation was further confirmed using a Treg hemophilia A tolerance model. GFP-FoxP3 knock-in FVIII−/− mice were immunized with FVIII or FVIII-PS, and GFP expression was used as a read-out for FoxP3 expression and Treg (10Zhang A.H. Skupsky J. Scott D.W.

The mean GFP-FoxP3+ cells for the FVIII-PS group as measured by fluorescence was higher than that observed for the free FVIII group, which was comparable with the base-line GFP-FoxP3+ level observed in naive, untreated mice, confirming that exposure of FVIII in the presence of PS increases Treg. Our previous studies using co-culture of DCs (which were exposed either to FVIII or to FVIII-lipid complexes) with FVIII-primed splenic CD4+ T-cells showed that PS down-regulated the expression of CD40 (4Gaitonde P. Peng A. Straubinger R.M. Bankert R.B. Balu-Iyer S.V. Phosphatidylserine reduces immune response against human recombinant factor VIII in hemophilia A mice by regulation of dendritic cell function.Clin. Immunol. 2011; 138: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further, PS significantly reduced T-cell activation. This was accompanied by an increase in the secretion of immune regulatory TGF-β and IL-10 cytokines. At the molecular level, the regulatory cytokine TGF-β is secreted by tolerogenic DC and regulatory T-cells (12Maldonado R.A. von Andrian U.H. How tolerogenic dendritic cells induce regulatory T cells.Adv. Immunol. 2010; 108: 111-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 13Steinman R.M. Hawiger D. Nussenzweig M.C.

Flavell R.A. TGF-β and regulatory T cell in immunity and autoimmunity.J. Clin. Immunol. 2008; 28: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Blockade of either TGF-β or its receptors has been shown to lead to lethal inflammation and autoimmunity in mice (16Li M.O. Sanjabi S. Flavell R.A. Transforming growth factor-β controls development, homeostasis, and tolerance of T cells by regulatory T cell-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Immunity. 2006; 25: 455-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the context of FVIII immunity, it has been reported that TGF-β1- and IL-10-conditioned tolerogenic DCs are able to inhibit anti-FVIII antibody response in FVIII−/− mice (17Sule G. Suzuki M. Guse K. Cela R. Rodgers J.R. Lee B. Cytokine-conditioned dendritic cells induce humoral tolerance to protein therapy in mice.Hum. Gene Ther. 2012; 23: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hence, to gain an understanding of the molecular mechanism, at least in part, we investigated the role of TGF-β in PS-mediated hypo-responsiveness by immunizing Treg hemophilia A (FVIII−/−) mice with FVIII and FVIII-PS in the presence and in the absence of function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibody. The total anti-FVIII antibody levels in these immunized animals were measured to determine the role of TGF-β on B-cell responses in Treg hemophilia A mice (Fig. 2D). The titer levels for the FVIII-PS-treated group in the absence of anti-TGF-β antibody showed lower titer levels as compared with animals that received FVIII alone, but this reduction in titer levels observed for FVIII-PS is reversed upon administration with anti-TGF-β antibody. In the presence of anti-TGF-β antibody, the titer levels are significantly higher than the FVIII-PS treatment group and are comparable with the FVIII alone treatment group. The administration of function-blocking anti-TGF-β antibody reversed the PS-mediated reduction in antibody titers, confirming the role of regulatory cytokine TGF-β in PS-mediated hypo-responsiveness. In culturing conditions, we found that function-blocking anti-TGF-β and anti-TGF-β receptors reversed the PS-mediated suppression of the T-cell response to FVIII but had no significant effect upon the PS-dependent decrease in IL-6 or IL-17 cytokine levels (data not shown). As TGF-β is a regulatory cytokine acting on multiple cells including FoxP3-expressing Treg and also acts on multifaceted cellular functions, it is very complex to delineate the effects of TGF-β on Treg and its impact on PS-mediated hypo-responsiveness (15Wan Y.Y. Flavell R.A. TGF-β and regulatory T cell in immunity and autoimmunity.J. Clin. Immunol. 2008; 28: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, panel d). Tolerance induction is an active process that leads to an antigen-specific nonresponsiveness. The data presented here demonstrate an antigen-specific hypo-responsiveness, but not a complete nonresponsiveness to FVIII. This is possibly due to several reasons including the following. (i) The duration and dose of pre-exposure are not sufficient to induce a complete tolerance; (ii) a complete tolerance is established to some epitopes such as C2 domain, which is associated with PS, but tolerance is not induced to all of the possible FVIII epitopes; and (iii) the induction of tolerance is initially complete, but is partially broken by aggressive rechallenge with FVIII. Thus, optimization of several treatment parameters such as dose, duration, and systematic alteration of biophysical properties of protein-lipid complex could lead to the induction of a complete and durable tolerance. It is also important to mention here that residual in vivo FVIII activity was retained, although a delayed progression of anti-FVIII titers was observed from week 6 to week 11 in the FVIII-PS pretreated group. The plasma derived from animals that received multiple injections of FVIII-PS preserved the clotting activity of normal human plasma (36.6 ± 2.98 S.E.) at significantly higher levels as compared with plasma obtained from the FVIII alone treatment group (53.16 ± 3.1 S.E.). Under this experimental condition, inhibitor-free plasma derived from naive animals showed a clotting time of 30.88 ± 0.44 S.E. However, further studies are required to fully capture the effect of PS-induced tolerance on FVIII pharmacodynamics, especially in the presence of anti-FVIII Nabs. In general, regardless of the possible reasons for the partial hypo-responsiveness, pre-exposure of HA mice to FVIII-PS leading to hypo-responsiveness (even after stoppage of PS therapy) is significant and represents a potential for improving upon the therapeutic efficacy of FVIII. Many strategies have been developed or are currently under active research to improve efficacy of FVIII replacement therapy in patients who have developed inhibitory titers following FVIII treatment. The currently utilized immune tolerance induction strategy in the clinic is to administer very high and frequent doses of FVIII to overload the immune response. Although patients have been shown to benefit from this therapy, immune tolerance induction takes anywhere from months to years to show beneficial effects. Further, the use of high doses of the protein makes the therapy prohibitively expensive, and patients have been shown to relapse even after treatment with this therapy. One approach is the use of immunosuppressive agents, but such strategies have the potentially significant negative effect of compromising the entire immune system. An alternative approach is the use of monoclonal antibodies (18Wiestner A. Cho H.J. Asch A.S. Michelis M.A. Zeller J.A. Peerschke E.I. Weksler B.B. Schechter G.P. Rituximab in the treatment of acquired factor VIII inhibitors.Blood. 2002; 100: 3426-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) to eliminate T- and B-cells. However, both these strategies lack and fail to induce lasting FVIII immune tolerance. Newer approaches currently tested at the preclinical stage with successful outcome utilize FVIII gene therapy or delivery of FVIII antigen via administration of apoptotic cells (19Su R.J. Epp A. Feng J. Roy J. Latchman Y. Wu X. Bolgiano D. Josephson N.C. Suppression of the immune response to FVIII in hemophilia A mice by transgene modified tolerogenic dendritic cells.Mol. Ther. 2011; 19: 1896-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Skupsky J. Saltis M. Song C. Rossi R. Nelson D. Scott D.W. Gene therapy for tolerance and vice versa: a case for hemophilia.Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2010; 12: 509-518PubMed Google Scholar). However, the advantage of using reverse vaccination strategy is that a selective and durable reduction in the generation of Nabs to FVIII is achieved rapidly and requires relatively low amounts of the protein in naive recipients. Further, the commercial use of PS as a supplement and the ease of manufacturing to comply with regulatory requirements make it an attractive clinical option to mitigate immunogenicity of FVIII. It is not clear whether PS-mediated hypo-responsiveness is strong enough to reverse an established immune response and restore efficacy in inhibitor patients already treated with FVIII. In conclusion, a novel reverse vaccination therapy utilizing immunoregulatory effects of PS has the potential to desensitize patients toward therapeutic proteins by inducing tolerance.

https://openalex.org/W2067580246,"Major bottlenecks in the expansion of human β-cell mass are limited proliferation, loss of β-cell phenotype, and increased apoptosis. In our previous studies, activation of Wnt and mTOR signaling significantly enhanced human β-cell proliferation. However, isolated human islets displayed insulin signaling pathway resistance, due in part to chronic activation of mTOR/S6K1 signaling that results in negative feedback of the insulin signaling pathway and a loss of Akt phosphorylation and insulin content. We evaluated the effects of a new generation insulin sensitizer, MSDC-0160, on restoring insulin/IGF-1 sensitivity and insulin content in human β-cells. This novel TZD has low affinity for binding and activation of PPARγ and has insulin-sensitizing effects in mouse models of diabetes and ability to lower glucose in Phase 2 clinical trials. MSDC-0160 treatment of human islets increased AMPK activity and reduced mTOR activity. This was associated with the restoration of IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt, GSK-3, and increased protein expression of Pdx1. Furthermore, MSDC-0160 in combination with IGF-1 and 8 mM glucose increased β-cell specific gene expression of insulin, pdx1, nkx6.1, and nkx2.2, and maintained insulin content without altering glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Human islets were unable to simultaneously promote DNA synthesis and maintain the β-cell phenotype. Lithium-induced GSK-3 inhibition that promotes DNA synthesis blocked the ability of MSDC-0160 to maintain the β-cell phenotype. Conversely, MSDC-0160 prevented an increase in DNA synthesis by blocking β-catenin nuclear translocation. Due to the counteracting pathways involved in these processes, we employed a sequential ex vivo strategy to first induce human islet DNA synthesis, followed by MSDC-0160 to promote the β-cell phenotype and insulin content. This new generation PPARγ sparing insulin sensitizer may provide an initial tool for relieving inherent human islet insulin signaling pathway resistance that is necessary to preserve the β-cell phenotype during β-cell expansion for the treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2046948724,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients have both working memory (WM) and attention problems. Good attention skills are important for WM performance; individuals have higher WM capacity when being able to prevent storage of irrelevant information through efficient filtering. Since it is unknown how filtering ability is associated with WM performance in ADHD, this was investigated in the present study. A visuospatial working memory (VSWM) change detection task with distracting stimuli was administered to adolescents (12–16 years old) and adults (20–46 years old) with and without ADHD matched on education/IQ. Besides performance, contralateral delay activity (CDA) was measured; a neural correlate of the number of targets and distracters encoded and maintained in WM during the retention interval. Performance data showed similar WM-load, WM-distracter interference and developmental effects in ADHD and control groups. Adolescents’ performance on the WM task deteriorated more than that of adults in the presence of distracters and with higher WM-load, irrespective of Diagnosis. The CDA data suggested that initially all groups encoded/maintained distracting information, but only adults were able to bounce this information from memory later in the retention interval, leading to better WM performance. The only effect of Diagnosis was a smaller CDA in adolescents and adults with ADHD than in age/IQ-matched controls when maintaining a low 1-item load, which was possibly related to an inability to keep attention focused at cued stimuli with low task demands. Overall, the development of filtering efficiency and VSWM storage capacity in adolescents with ADHD was not different from that in typically developing peers."
https://openalex.org/W1981269893,"The syndrome of high-altitude de-acclimatization commonly takes place after long-term exposure to high altitudes upon return to low altitudes. The syndrome severely affects the returnee's quality of life. However, little attention has been paid to careful characterization of the syndrome and their underlying mechanisms. Male subjects from Chongqing (n = 67, 180 m) and Kunming (n = 70, 1800 m) visited a high-altitude area (3650 m) about 6 months and then returned to low-altitude. After they came back, all subjects were evaluated for high-altitude de-acclimatization syndrome on the 3rd, 50th, and 100th. Symptom scores, routine blood and blood gas tests, and myocardial zymograms assay were used for observation their syndrome. The results showed that the incidence and severity of symptoms had decreased markedly on the 50th and 100th days, compared with the 3rd day. The symptom scores and incidence of different symptoms were lower among subjects returning to Kunming than among those returning to Chongqing. On the 3rd day, RBC, Hb, Hct, CK, CK-MB, and LDH values were significantly lower than values recorded at high altitudes, but they were higher than baseline values. On the 50th day, these values were not different from baseline values, but LDH levels did not return to baseline until the 100th day. These data show that, subjects who suffered high-altitude de-acclimatization syndrome, the recovery fully processes takes a long time (≥100th days). The appearance of the syndrome is found to be related to the changes in RBC, Hb, Hct, CK, CK-MB, and LDH levels, which should be caused by reoxygenation after hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2012495035,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection has been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of erythema nodosum (EN) and nodular vasculitis (NV), the classic forms of panniculitis. However, there is little evidence to demonstrate the presence of MTB in the skin lesions. This study is aimed at evaluating the association between MTB infection and the development of EN and NV in a Chinese population.A total of 107 patients (36 EN, 27 NV, and 44 others) with vasculitis and 40 control cases with other skin diseases were recruited and their skin lesion samples were subjected to real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the IS6110 and mpt64 gene fragments of MTB. Their blood mononuclear cells were tested for MTB antigen-specific IFN-γ responses by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (IT) assays.PCR analysis revealed that 7/23 (30.4%) and 7/18 (38.9%) of the EN and NV samples were positive for the IS6110 DNA, respectively, which were significantly higher than 3/34 (8.8%) of other vasculitis (OV) and 3/40 (7.5%) of the control samples (p<0.05). The nested Real-Time PCR assay indicated that 6/7 (86%) of the IS6110-positive EN samples, all of the IS6110-positive NV and control samples, but only 1/3 of the IS6110-positive OV samples, were positive for the mpt64 gene. Similarly, 19/32 (59.4%) of the EN patients, 20/26 (76.9%) of the NV patients, and 17/36 (47.2%) of the OV patients were positive for MTB antigen-specific IFN-γ responses, which were significantly higher than 6/40 (15%) of the controls (p<0.05).Our data strongly suggest that MTB infection and active TB are associated with the development of NV and EN in Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2035723061,"TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) serves as a key convergence point in multiple innate immune signaling pathways. In response to receptor-mediated pathogen detection, TBK1 phosphorylation promotes production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. Increasingly, TBK1 dysregulation has been linked to autoimmune disorders and cancers, heightening the need to understand the regulatory controls of TBK1 activity. Here, we describe the mechanism by which suppressor of IKKε (SIKE) inhibits TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which is essential to type I interferon production. Kinetic analyses showed that SIKE not only inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation but is also a high affinity TBK1 substrate. With respect to IRF3 phosphorylation, SIKE functioned as a mixed-type inhibitor (K(i, app) = 350 nM) rather than, given its status as a TBK1 substrate, as a competitive inhibitor. TBK1 phosphorylation of IRF3 and SIKE displayed negative cooperativity. Both substrates shared a similar Km value at low substrate concentrations (∼50 nM) but deviated >8-fold at higher substrate concentrations (IRF3 = 3.5 μM; SIKE = 0.4 μM). TBK1-SIKE interactions were modulated by SIKE phosphorylation, clustered in the C-terminal portion of SIKE (Ser-133, -185, -187, -188, -190, and -198). These sites exhibited striking homology to the phosphorylation motif of IRF3. Mutagenic probing revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-185 controlled TBK1-SIKE interactions. Taken together, our studies demonstrate for the first time that SIKE functions as a TBK1 substrate and inhibits TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation by forming a high affinity TBK1-SIKE complex. These findings provide key insights into the endogenous control of a critical catalytic hub that is achieved not by direct repression of activity but by redirection of catalysis through substrate affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2130531693,"Background The alleged efficacy of pharmaceutical industry self-regulation has been used to repudiate increased government oversight over promotional activity. European politicians and industry have cited Sweden as an excellent example of self-regulation based on an ethical code. This paper considers antidepressant advertising in Sweden to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of self-regulation. Methodology We analyzed all antidepressant advertisements in the Swedish Medical Journal, 1994–2003. The regulation of these advertisements was analyzed using case reports from self-regulatory bodies. The authors independently reviewed this material to investigate: (1) extent of violative advertising; (2) pattern of code breaches; (3) rate at which the system reacted to violative advertising; (4) prevalence of and oversight over claims regarding antidepressant efficacy and disease causality, and (5) costs for manufactures associated with violative advertising. Principal Findings Self-regulatory bodies identified numerous code breaches. Nonetheless, they failed to protect doctors from unreliable information on antidepressants, since as many as 247 of 722 (34%) advertisements breached the industry code. Self-regulatory bodies repeatedly failed to challenge inflated claims of antidepressant efficacy, lending evidence of lax oversight. On average, 15 weeks elapsed between printing and censure of a wrongful claim, and in 25% of cases 47 weeks or more elapsed. Industry paid roughly €108000 in fines for violative advertising, adding an estimated additional average cost of 11% to each purchased violative advertisement, or amounting to as little as 0.009% of total antidepressant sales of around €1.2 billion. Conclusions Lax oversight, combined with lags in the system and low fines for violations, may explain the Swedish system’s failure to pressure companies into providing reliable antidepressants information. If these shortcomings prove to be consistent across self-regulatory settings, and if appropriate measures are not taken to amend shortcomings, many countries may want to reconsider the current balance between self-regulation, and legislative control with government oversight."
https://openalex.org/W1994505288,"Protein complexes are of great importance in understanding the principles of cellular organization and function. The increase in available protein-protein interaction data, gene ontology and other resources make it possible to develop computational methods for protein complex prediction. Most existing methods focus mainly on the topological structure of protein-protein interaction networks, and largely ignore the gene ontology annotation information. In this article, we constructed ontology augmented networks with protein-protein interaction data and gene ontology, which effectively unified the topological structure of protein-protein interaction networks and the similarity of gene ontology annotations into unified distance measures. After constructing ontology augmented networks, a novel method (clustering based on ontology augmented networks) was proposed to predict protein complexes, which was capable of taking into account the topological structure of the protein-protein interaction network, as well as the similarity of gene ontology annotations. Our method was applied to two different yeast protein-protein interaction datasets and predicted many well-known complexes. The experimental results showed that (i) ontology augmented networks and the unified distance measure can effectively combine the structure closeness and gene ontology annotation similarity; (ii) our method is valuable in predicting protein complexes and has higher F1 and accuracy compared to other competing methods."
https://openalex.org/W1991517254,"The recent nucleic acid sequencing revolution driven by shotgun and high-throughput technologies has led to a rapid increase in the number of sequences for microbial communities. The availability of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences from a multitude of natural environments now offers a unique opportunity to study microbial diversity and community structure. The large volume of sequencing data however makes it time consuming to assign individual sequences to phylotypes by searching them against public databases. Since ribosomal sequences have diverged across prokaryotic species, they can be grouped into clusters that represent operational taxonomic units. However, available clustering programs suffer from overlap of sequence spaces in adjacent clusters. In natural environments, gene sequences are homogenous within species but divergent between species. This evolutionary constraint results in an uneven distribution of genetic distances of genes in sequence space. To cluster 16S rRNA sequences more accurately, it is therefore essential to select core sequences that are located at the centers of the distributions represented by the genetic distance of sequences in taxonomic units. Based on this idea, we here describe a novel sequence clustering algorithm named CLUSTOM that minimizes the overlaps between adjacent clusters. The performance of this algorithm was evaluated in a comparative exercise with existing programs, using the reference sequences of the SILVA database as well as published pyrosequencing datasets. The test revealed that our algorithm achieves higher accuracy than ESPRIT-Tree and mothur, few of the best clustering algorithms. Results indicate that the concept of an uneven distribution of sequence distances can effectively and successfully cluster 16S rRNA gene sequences. The algorithm of CLUSTOM has been implemented both as a web and as a standalone command line application, which are available at http://clustom.kribb.re.kr."
https://openalex.org/W2001016904,"In nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, hydrogen evolution is associated with hydrogenases and nitrogenase, making these enzymes interesting targets for genetic engineering aimed at increased hydrogen production. Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 is a filamentous cyanobacterium that expresses the uptake hydrogenase HupSL in heterocysts under nitrogen-fixing conditions. Little is known about the structural and biophysical properties of HupSL. The small subunit, HupS, has been postulated to contain three iron-sulfur clusters, but the details regarding their nature have been unclear due to unusual cluster binding motifs in the amino acid sequence. We now report the cloning and heterologous expression of Nostoc punctiforme HupS as a fusion protein, f-HupS. We have characterized the anaerobically purified protein by UV-visible and EPR spectroscopies. Our results show that f-HupS contains three iron-sulfur clusters. UV-visible absorption of f-HupS has bands ∼340 and 420 nm, typical for iron-sulfur clusters. The EPR spectrum of the oxidized f-HupS shows a narrow g = 2.023 resonance, characteristic of a low-spin (S = &frac12;) [3Fe-4S] cluster. The reduced f-HupS presents complex EPR spectra with overlapping resonances centered on g = 1.94, g = 1.91, and g = 1.88, typical of low-spin (S = &frac12;) [4Fe-4S] clusters. Analysis of the spectroscopic data allowed us to distinguish between two species attributable to two distinct [4Fe-4S] clusters, in addition to the [3Fe-4S] cluster. This indicates that f-HupS binds [4Fe-4S] clusters despite the presence of unusual coordinating amino acids. Furthermore, our expression and purification of what seems to be an intact HupS protein allows future studies on the significance of ligand nature on redox properties of the iron-sulfur clusters of HupS."
https://openalex.org/W2089143304,"It is known that cyanobacteria negatively affect herbivores due to their production of toxins such as protease inhibitors. In the present study we investigated potential interspecific differences between two major herbivores, Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex, in terms of their tolerance to cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors. Seven clones each of D. magna and of D. pulex were isolated from different habitats in Europe and North America. To test for interspecific differences in the daphnids' tolerance to cyanobacteria, their somatic and population growth rates were determined for each D. magna and D. pulex clone after exposure to varying concentrations of two Microcystis aeruginosa strains. The M. aeruginosa strains NIVA and PCC(-) contained either chymotrypsin or trypsin inhibitors, but no microcystins. Mean somatic and population growth rates on a diet with 20% NIVA were significantly more reduced in D. pulex than in D. magna. On a diet with 10% PCC(-), the population growth of D. pulex was significantly more reduced than that of D. magna. This indicates that D. magna is more tolerant to cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors than D. pulex. The reduction of growth rates was possibly caused by an interference of cyanobacterial inhibitors with proteases in the gut of Daphnia, as many other conceivable factors, which might have been able to explain the reduced growth, could be excluded as causal factors. Protease assays revealed that the sensitivities of chymotrypsins and trypsins to cyanobacterial protease inhibitors did not differ between D. magna and D. pulex. However, D. magna exhibited a 2.3-fold higher specific chymotrypsin activity than D. pulex, which explains the observed higher tolerance to cyanobacterial protease inhibitors of D. magna. The present study suggests that D. magna may control the development of cyanobacterial blooms more efficiently than D. pulex due to differences in their tolerance to cyanobacteria with protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1991291166,"Mutations in apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) have been associated with hypertriglyceridemia in humans and mice. This has been attributed to a stimulating role for APOA5 in lipoprotein lipase-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis and hepatic clearance of lipoprotein remnant particles. However, because of the low APOA5 plasma abundance, we investigated an additional signaling role for APOA5 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Wild-type (WT) and Apoa5–/– mice fed a chow diet showed no difference in body weight or 24-h food intake (Apoa5–/–, 4.5±0.6 g; WT, 4.2±0.5 g), while Apoa5–/– mice fed an HFD ate more in 24 h (Apoa5–/–, 2.8±0.4 g; WT, 2.5±0.3 g, P<0.05) and became more obese than WT mice. Also, intravenous injection of APOA5-loaded VLDL-like particles lowered food intake (VLDL control, 0.26±0.04 g; VLDL+APOA5, 0.11±0.07 g, P<0.01). In addition, the HFD-induced hyperphagia of Apoa5–/– mice was prevented by adenovirus-mediated hepatic overexpression of APOA5. Finally, intracerebroventricular injection of APOA5 reduced food intake compared to injection of the same mouse with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (0.40±0.11 g; APOA5, 0.23±0.08 g, P<0.01). These data indicate that the increased HFD-induced obesity of Apoa5–/– mice as compared to WT mice is at least partly explained by hyperphagia and that APOA5 plays a role in the central regulation of food intake.—Van den Berg, S.

https://openalex.org/W2114783118,"Early life events can modulate brain development to produce persistent physiological and behavioural phenotypes that are transmissible across generations. However, whether neural precursor cells are altered by early life events, to produce persistent and transmissible behavioural changes, is unknown. Here, we show that bi-parental care, in early life, increases neural cell genesis in the adult rodent brain in a sexually dimorphic manner. Bi-parentally raised male mice display enhanced adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis, which improves hippocampal neurogenesis-dependent learning and memory. Female mice display enhanced adult white matter oligodendrocyte production, which increases proficiency in bilateral motor coordination and preference for social investigation. Surprisingly, single parent-raised male and female offspring, whose fathers and mothers received bi-parental care, respectively, display a similar enhancement in adult neural cell genesis and phenotypic behaviour. Therefore, neural plasticity and behavioural effects due to bi-parental care persist throughout life and are transmitted to the next generation."
https://openalex.org/W2064906110,"The human B cell-specific protein, CD79b (also known as Igβ and B29) constitutes an essential signal transduction component of the B cell receptor. Although its function is central to the triggering of B cell terminal differentiation in response to antigen stimulation, the transcriptional determinants that control CD79b gene expression remain poorly defined. In the present study, we explored these determinants using a series of hCD79b transgenic mouse models. Remarkably, we observed that the previously described hCD79b promoter along with its associated enhancer elements and first exon could be deleted without appreciable loss of hCD79b transcriptional activity or tissue specificity. In this deletion setting, a secondary promoter located within exon 2 maintained full levels and specificity of hCD79b transcription. Of note, this secondary promoter was also active, albeit at lower levels, in the wild-type hCD79b locus. The activity of the secondary promoter was dependent on the action(s) of a conserved sequence element mapping to a chromatin DNase I hypersensitive site located within intron 1. mRNA generated from this secondary promoter is predicted to encode an Igβ protein lacking a signal sequence and thus unable to serve normal B cell receptor function. Although the physiologic role of the hCD79b secondary promoter and its encoded protein remain unclear, the current data suggest that it has the capacity to play a role in normal as well as pathologic states in B cell proliferation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2076688635,"Endemic Hawaiian Drosophilidae, a radiation of nearly 1000 species including 13 federally listed as endangered, occur mostly in intact native forest, 500–1500 m above sea level. But their persistence in disturbed forest and agricultural areas has not been documented. Thus, control efforts for agricultural pests may impact endemic species if previously undocumented refugia in agricultural areas may play a role in their conservation. To quantify whether invasive plants and agriculture habitats may harbor endemic Drosophilidae, we established standardized trapping arrays, with traps typically designed to control invasive fruit flies (Tephritidae), with 81 sites across native, disturbed and agricultural land use gradients on the islands of Hawai’i and Maui. We collected and identified, to species level, over 22,000 specimens. We found 121 of the possible 292 species expected to occur in the sampled areas, and the majority (91%) of the captured specimens belonged to 24 common species. Species diversity and numbers were greatest in the native forest, but 55% of the species occurred in the invasive strawberry guava belt and plantation forest, adjacent to and almost 500 m from native forest, and 22 species were collected in orchards and nonnative forest as far as 10 km from native habitats. Their persistence outside of native forest suggests that more careful management of disturbed forest and a reassessment of its conservation value are in order. Conservation efforts and assessments of native forest integrity should include the subset of species restricted to intact native forest, since these species are highly localized and particularly sensitive. Additionally, future efforts to control invasive pest fruit flies should consider the nontarget impacts of maintaining traps in and near native forest. This survey project demonstrates the utility of thorough biotic surveys and taxonomic expertise in developing both sensitive species lists and baseline diversity indices for future conservation and monitoring efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2060737672,"The motor domain of myosin is the core element performing mechanochemical energy transduction. This domain contains the actin and ATP binding sites and the base of the force-transducing lever. Coordinated subdomain movements within the motor are essential in linking the ATPase chemical cycle to translocation along actin filaments. A dynamic subdomain interface located at the base of the lever was previously shown to exert an allosteric influence on ATP hydrolysis in the non-processive myosin 2 motor. By solution kinetic, spectroscopic and ensemble and single-molecule motility experiments, we determined the role of a class-specific adaptation of this interface in the mechanochemical mechanism of myosin 5a, a processive intracellular transporter. We found that the introduction of a myosin 2-specific repulsive interaction into myosin 5a via the I67K mutation perturbs the strong-binding interaction of myosin 5a with actin, influences the mechanism of ATP binding and facilitates ATP hydrolysis. At the same time, the mutation abolishes the actin-induced activation of ADP release and, in turn, slows down processive motility, especially when myosin experiences mechanical drag exerted by the action of multiple motor molecules bound to the same actin filament. The results highlight that subtle structural adaptations of the common structural scaffold of the myosin motor enable specific allosteric tuning of motor activity shaped by widely differing physiological demands."
