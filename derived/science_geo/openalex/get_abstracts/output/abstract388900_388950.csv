https://openalex.org/W2045978632,"Sub-Saharan Africa is facing rapidly increasing prevalences of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Previous and ongoing undernutrition among pregnant women may contribute to this development as suggested by epidemiological studies from high income countries linking undernutrition in fetal life with increased burden of non-communicable diseases in later life. We undertook to study the risks for hypertension, glucose intolerance and overweight forty years after fetal exposure to famine afflicted Biafra during the Nigerian civil war (1967-1970).Cohort study performed in June 27-July 31, 2009 in Enugu, Nigeria. Adults (n = 1,339) born before (1965-67), during (1968-January 1970), or after (1971-73) the years of famine were included. Blood pressure (BP), random plasma glucose (p-glucose) and anthropometrics, as well as prevalence of hypertension (BP>140/90 mmHg), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; p-glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/l), diabetes (DM; p-glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l), or overweight (BMI>25 kg/m(2)) were compared between the three groups. Fetal-infant exposure to famine was associated with elevated systolic (+7 mmHg; p<0.001) and diastolic (+5 mmHg; p<0.001) BP, increased p-glucose (+0.3 mmol/L; p<0.05) and waist circumference (+3 cm, p<0.001), increased risk of systolic hypertension (adjusted OR 2.87; 95% CI 1.90-4.34), IGT (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.02-2.69) and overweight (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.03-1.93) as compared to people born after the famine. Limitations of this study include the lack of birth weight data and the inability to separate effects of fetal and infant famine.Fetal and infant undernutrition is associated with significantly increased risk of hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance in 40-year-old Nigerians. Prevention of undernutrition during pregnancy and in infancy should therefore be given high priority in health, education, and economic agendas."
https://openalex.org/W2034660710,"Many DNA variants have been identified on more than 300 diseases and traits using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs). Some have been validated using deep sequencing, but many fewer have been validated functionally, primarily focused on non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs). It is an open question whether synonymous coding SNPs (sSNPs) and other non-coding SNPs can lead to as high odds ratios as nsSNPs. We conducted a broad survey across 21,429 disease-SNP associations curated from 2,113 publications studying human genetic association, and found that nsSNPs and sSNPs shared similar likelihood and effect size for disease association. The enrichment of disease-associated SNPs around the 80(th) base in the first introns might provide an effective way to prioritize intronic SNPs for functional studies. We further found that the likelihood of disease association was positively associated with the effect size across different types of SNPs, and SNPs in the 3' untranslated regions, such as the microRNA binding sites, might be under-investigated. Our results suggest that sSNPs are just as likely to be involved in disease mechanisms, so we recommend that sSNPs discovered from GWAS should also be examined with functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2064560680,"Bcl-2 family proteins regulate a critical step in apoptosis referred to as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Members of a subgroup of the Bcl-2 family, known as the BH3-only proteins, activate pro-apoptotic effectors (Bax and Bak) to initiate MOMP. They do so by neutralizing pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins and/or directly activating Bax/Bak. Bim and Bid are reported to be direct activators; however, here we show that BH3 peptides other than Bim and Bid exhibited various degrees of direct activation of the effector Bax or Bak, including Bmf and Noxa BH3s. In the absence of potent direct activators, such as Bim and Bid, we unmasked novel direct activator BH3 ligands capable of inducing effector-mediated cytochrome c release and liposome permeabilization, even when both Bcl-xL- and Mcl-1-type anti-apoptotic proteins were inhibited. The ability of these weaker direct activator BH3 peptides to cause MOMP correlated with that of the corresponding full-length proteins to induce apoptosis in the absence of Bim and Bid. We propose that, in certain contexts, direct activation by BH3-only proteins other than Bim and Bid may significantly contribute to MOMP and apoptosis.

The Bcl-2 family comprises both pro- and anti-apoptotic members. The pro-apoptotic members are divided into multidomain (Bax, Bak, and perhaps Bok in a limited number of tissues) and BH3 domain-only members (Bim, Bid, Bad, Bik, Bmf, Hrk, Puma, Noxa etc.) (5Youle R.J.

As a consequence of this activation, the membrane is permeabilized and apoptogenic molecules are released from the intermembrane space. mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast. The neutralization model postulates that Bax and Bak are activated, when they are liberated from anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins by BH3-only proteins (17Uren R.T. Dewson G. Chen L. Coyne S.C.

Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), whereas the direct activation model posits that, in addition to inhibiting pro-survival proteins, select BH3-only proteins must directly activate Bax/Bak (19Certo M.

It has also been shown that certain BH3-only proteins displace activator BH3-only proteins (Bim, cleaved Bid or Puma in some instances) from anti-apoptotic proteins, which will then directly activate Bax/Bak. We investigated the membrane permeabilization by Bcl-2 family proteins in a defined liposome system, using BH3 peptides (13Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 22Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R.

It is reasonable to assume that the BH3 peptides mimic the corresponding full-length proteins, for the BH3 domain acts as a ligand (14Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this assumption, by NMR spectroscopy, the Bid BH3 region was identified as the sole contributor to Mcl-1 binding by the cleaved full-length Bid (23Liu Q. Moldoveanu T. Sprules T. Matta-Camacho E. Mansur-Azzam N. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19615-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further, when Bid BH3 is made α-helical by chemical stapling, as in the full-length protein, it becomes more potent in Bax activation (24Walensky L.D. Pitter K. Morash J. Oh K.J. Barbuto S. Fisher J. Smith E. Verdine G.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We found that Bim and Bid BH3 peptides are the most effective direct activators, promoting Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization, and that all BH3 peptides acted as de-repressors, or sensitizers, contributing to MOMP by stably binding to and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic members (22Kuwana T.

These findings were consistent with the direct activation model. However, they did not explain why Bid and Bim double knock-out (Bim/Bid DKO) mice do not have a phenotype similar to that of Bax/Bak DKO mice, or how some BH3 peptides other than Bim and Bid BH3 induce MOMP in the absence of Bid and Bim proteins (17Uren R.T. Dewson G. Chen L. Coyne S.C. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Kluck R.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Willis S.N. Fletcher J.I. Kaufmann T. van Delft M.F.

A number of BH3 peptides other than Bim and Bid BH3s showed weak direct activation above the background level (22Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), so we postulated that redundancy is at work to mask the apoptotic defect in Bim/Bid DKO mice. We set out to re-examine direct activation by these BH3 peptides of Bax or Bak, for which we used a truncated version of Bak (25Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), cBak, that mimicked native Bak. We report that 1) BH3 peptides other than Bim and Bid BH3 exhibited varying degrees of direct activation in the liposome system on both Bax and cBak and 2) neutralization was found necessary to cause liposome permeabilization and cytochrome c release, but not sufficient. MEFs were grown in DMEM, harvested, and washed with PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Cells were then permeabilized by resuspension into a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 μg/ml digitonin at 3.5 × 107 cells/ml. After incubation on ice for 5 min, 1% BSA was added to remove digitonin, and the cells were pelleted and resuspended in the same volume of buffer without digitonin. This suspension of permeabilized cells was incubated with N/C-Bid or BH3 peptides at 30 °C for 1 h and was spun down at 1000 × g for 5 min to separate the supernatant and the pellet. Equivalent amounts of the supernatant and the pellet were loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE gels for cytochrome c immunoblotting, using an anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen, 556433). We used mouse BH3 peptides for Bid and Bmf, and the rest were human BH3s in this experiment. Following incubation with BH3 peptides, an aliquot of the pellet of digitonin-permeabilized cells was dissolved in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, or 0.5–1% Nonidet P-40) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, 11873580001) and 1 mm PMSF. After incubation for 30 min on ice, cells were spun down at 13,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant was collected. Antibodies (0.5–1 μg) (anti-Bcl-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-23960, anti-Mcl-1; Rockland, 600-401-394, anti-Bcl-xL; Cell Signaling, 2762) and 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to this cell lysate (450 μg of protein) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed in lysis buffer and added directly to the loading buffer for SDS-PAGE, together with the depleted lysate. Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bak were detected by immunoblotting. 293T cells were transfected with pMSCV-IRES-GFP with/without the gene of interest together with an equal amount of AdVAntageTM Vector (Promega, Part TB207) and ectopic helper virus DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-019) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium containing retroviral pseudotypes were collected at 16, 24, 40, and 48 h post-tansfection individually and added to growing MEFs in 6-well plates after each viral harvest in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma, H9268). Separately prepared viruses containing Bad or Noxa genes were used for simultaneous overexpression of both genes. MEFs were infected with the first virus for 2–3 h and then with the second virus overnight. For both single and double gene overexpression, MEFs were harvested after 50 h post-transfection, and cell death was measured by FACS-based analysis of Annexin V staining, using the AnnexinV-Cy5 apoptosis detection kit (Biovision Inc. K103-100). Transfection efficiency was determined as FACS-based measurement of GFP expression, and was >80% in all transfectants. Recombinant full-length human Bax, N/C-Bid (cleaved Bid), Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and cBak were produced in Escherichia coli according to the published procedures (13Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G.

All these proteins showed more than 90% purity, as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining. BH3 peptides were obtained from AnaSpec at >95% purity. We used human sequences for the BH3 peptides. We did not detect significant difference in activity between mouse and human Bid or Bmf in terms of cytochrome c release and liposome permeabilization. Liposomes containing 7% cardiolipin were generated by extrusion, and the end-point assay was performed at room temperature for 2.5 h, as previously reported (13Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G.

The release was normalized to Bax and N/C-Bid induced release as 100%. We adjusted the concentrations of Bax, cBak, and N/C-Bid in order to achieve ∼20% release by the effector alone and ∼70%, the effector plus N/C-Bid between different liposome and protein preparations. The concentrations of Bcl-xL or Mcl-1used in Fig. 4 were expected to interact with Bax or cBak (see Fig. 5A). We averaged 3–5 independent experiments for each graph, or chose representative of 4–6 independent experiments.FIGURE 5BH3 ligands overcome effector inhibition by anti-apoptotics in liposomes. A, high levels of Bax (left panel) or cBak (right panel) led to significant permeabilization of liposomes, and this permeabilization was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Bcl-xL or Mcl-1. B, both Bad BH3 and its mimetic, ABT 737, were capable of interfering with the inhibition of Bax or cBak by Bcl-xL or Mcl-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time course assay measured the released fluorescein-dextrans through the quenching by anti-fluorescein antibodies (Invitrogen A889) added to the external solution (26Sharpe J.C.

The fluorescence measurement was taken every 30 s in a 96-well plate by a microplate fluorescence reader, FL600 (Bio-Tek). The experiments were performed more than 5 times to ensure the reproducibility. cBak (5 μm), N/C-Bid (190 nm), and Bcl-xL (4.6 μm) were incubated with the liposomes (∼4 times more than the regular liposome assay) at room temperature for 2.5 h. At the end of the incubation, the sample was divided to into two aliquots to measure dextran release and to carry out the association assay as described previously (22Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L.

Each fraction was concentrated using a microcon filter and loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel. cBak was detected by immunoblotting. Mouse liver mitochondria were prepared and the cytochrome c release assay was performed as described previously (27Chipuk J.E. Fisher J.C. Dillon C.P. Kriwacki R.W. Kuwana T. Green D.R. Proc. Natl.

MEFs or digitonin-permeabilized cell pellets (25 μg protein) were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting using antibodies against Bcl-2 family members; anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-23960 and BD, 554087), anti-Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8392), anti-Bcl-w (Calbiochem, 197209), anti-Mcl-1 (Rockland, 600-401-394), anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-493), anti-Bak (Upstate, 06–536), anti-Bid (R & D, AF860), anti-Bmf (Lifespan, LS-C4126), and anti-Bim (Sigma, B7929 or Stressgen, AAP330). An anti-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma (ac-40). Secondary antibodies used were; anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad, 170-6516), anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad, 170-6515), anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2006) and anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2350). All the BH3 peptides except for BikBH3 were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25 μm. Bik BH3 was dissolved at 15 μm in buffer containing 0.1% DMSO. CD spectra were obtained at 25 °C on an AVIV model 202-01 spectropolarimeter; four scans were averaged using 1 nm bandwidth and 1 mm path length quartz cell (Hellma). Molar ellipticity was calculated as CD/[number of amino acids × concentration (mol/liters) × path length (0.1 cm) × 10 (conversion factor to decimoles)]. We first examined the abilities of various BH3 peptides (Fig. 1A) to induce cytochrome c release in the absence of the known direct activators, Bim and Bid. In digitonin-permeabilized Bim/Bid DKO MEFs, not only Bim and Bid BH3 peptides, but also Puma and Bmf BH3 peptides triggered the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 1B). The peptides alone at 50 μm did not cause mitochondrial permeabilization in digitonin-permeabilized Bax/Bak DKO MEFs, confirming that cytochrome c release at the concentration range tested was Bax/Bak dependent (Fig. 1C). MOMP in Bim/Bid DKO cells may be induced by 1) the liberation of Bax/Bak from anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins by these peptides as the neutralization model predicts, 2) displacement of yet unknown direct activators, and/or 3) BH3 peptides themselves acted as direct activators as well as de-repressors.FIGURE 1Cytochrome c release by BH3 ligands from Bim/Bid DKO MEFs. A, amino acid sequences of BH3 peptides (human) used in this study. B, Bim/Bid DKO MEFs were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated with cleaved Bid protein (N/C-Bid) or the BH3 peptides. The Bim BH3 peptide had the most potent cytochrome c releasing activity; the Bid, Bmf, and Puma BH3 peptides also had some activity at higher concentrations. Blots are representative of three independent experiments. C, BH3 peptides at 50 μm did not release cytochrome c in digitonin-permeabilized Bax/Bak DKO MEFs, therefore even at a relatively high concentration of 50 μm, cytochrome c release by BH3 peptides shown in B was Bax/Bak-dependent. Digitonin permeabilization was confirmed by cytochrome c release observed in the control in which Bax (480 nm) and N/C-Bid (45 nm) were added. D, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were immunoprecipitated from CHAPS or Nonidet P-40-solubilized Bim/Bid DKO MEFs and probed for Bax or Bak. L, lysate or supernatant; B, beads. Bax and Bak were found not associated with Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 in these cells with either detergent. Bax was not associated with Mcl-1, whereas ∼10–15% of Bak was bound to Mcl-1, estimated from the fact that 7.5% lysate and 50% beads samples were loaded on the gel (see also Fig. 6, B and C). E, Bcl-2 proteins detected in WT MEFs and Bim/Bid DKO MEFs. Protein was loaded at 50 μg per lane, and was detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting for actin (bottom panels). Puma is not detectable in either WT MEFs or DKO MEFs (data not shown) (27Chipuk J.E. Fisher J.C. Dillon C.P. Kriwacki R.W. Kuwana T. Green D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20327-20332Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Bmf was barely detectable in the DKOs. There are no antibodies suitable for detection of mouse Noxa. Bad was not detectable in these cells by a few different antibodies (data not shown). The mRNA of A1, another anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, is not present in MEFs (29Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). WT MEFs express similar levels of Bax and Bak, as estimated based on standards using recombinant Bax and cBak, respectively. The Bak and Bcl-2 levels in Bim/Bid DKO MEFs were found to be lower than those in the WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The neutralization model hypothesizes that Bax and Bak are sequestered by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins until BH3-only proteins liberate them. We immunoprecipitated Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 from non-apoptotic Bim/Bid DKO MEFs to the extent that the amount left in the cytosol was minimal. The immunoprecipitation was performed in CHAPS, a detergent known not to induce effector conformational changes associated with activation and oligomerization, although the results using NP-40 turned out identical. We found that Bax was not co-immunoprecipitated with any of the anti-apoptotic proteins and only ∼10–15% Bak was found associated with Mcl-1, but not at all with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (Fig. 1D). It appears that most Bax and Bak molecules were not sequestered by binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. These cells do not express A1 (29Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) and only trace amounts of Bcl-w (Fig. 1E), making it unlikely that the rest of the effectors are bound to these anti-apoptotic proteins. We conclude that the majority of Bax and Bak are not bound to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and, yet, not inducing MOMP in healthy cells. We were also interested to know whether Bak is activated by a different or the same set of BH3-only proteins as with Bax. To investigate the activation of Bak by BH3 peptides in the liposome system, we used recombinant cBak. cBak was generated by calpain cleavage from a C-terminally truncated species, and lacks 15 amino acids at the N terminus and 21 at the C terminus (Fig. 2A) (25Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). cBak was soluble and monomeric in solution, became associated with the liposome membrane and formed oligomers in the membrane in the presence of cleaved Bid (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, it was capable of synergizing with BH3 peptides to promote the release of cytochrome c from mouse liver mitochondria devoid of Bax and Bak. The mitochondrial permeabilization correlated with cBak oligomer formation (Fig. 2D). Cytochrome c release in the presence of BH3 peptides was also tested in mitochondria isolated from wild-type mouse livers that are known to contain Bak only. The release profile with native Bak and that with cBak were in good agreement (Fig. 2, E and D, upper panel). We conclude that cBak mimics native Bak, although ∼10 times more cBak than Bax was required to produce the same level of membrane permeabilization. Liposome permeabilization is influenced by differences in recombinant protein and liposome preparations. To remedy this problem and obtain representative data, we selected and averaged the experiments in which we saw that the release by Bax alone was 20–30% that of Bax plus N/C-Bid (that typically gives the maximum release in our system). BH3 peptides alone did not permeabilize liposomes at 25 μm (Fig. 3A). We examined direct activation of Bax or cBak by each BH3 peptide and found that the direct activation profile of cBak in response to various BH3 peptides was similar to that for Bax; Bim BH3 exhibited the highest degree of activation, Bid, Bmf, and Noxa BH3 constituted the next highest group, then, the group of Bik, Hrk and Puma BH3, and Bad BH3 showed the lowest activation (Fig. 3, B and C). Most peptides exhibited some degrees of direct activation. Particularly, the previously unrecognized Bmf and Noxa BH3 peptides were notable. We confirmed that there was no significant false direct activation over a range of Bax-alone release by Bad BH3 (Fig. 3D). To characterize direct activation by BH3 peptides other than Bim and Bid BH3, we performed a time course assay. In this assay, as the membrane permeabilizes and the dextrans are released, anti-fluorescein antibodies in the external milieu quench the fluorescence instantaneously (26Sharpe J.C. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 171: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two representative data are shown in Fig. 3E. The permeabilization induced by the weak direct activator BH3 peptides was slower than the strong direct activators. We also performed circular dichroism on our peptides to test whether the peptide's helicity determines the potency of direct activation. The spectra show that all the peptides were equally unstructured (Fig. 3F), therefore, eliminating the possibility of the helical propensity of free peptides exclusively correlating with the observed degree of direct activation. To confirm direct activation by BH3 peptides other than Bim and Bid, we performed the liposome assay in the presence of anti-apoptotic proteins. In our previous work, de-repression was examined in the presence of a cleaved form of Bid protein (N/C-Bid) that was ready to activate Bax. This obscured the BH3 peptides' ability to directly activate Bax. Therefore we performed the assay without N/C-Bid. BH3 peptides were consistently used at 25 μm, except for titrations. As shown in Fig. 4A, Bim, Bid, Bmf, Hrk, and Puma BH3 were capable of removing Bcl-xL inhibition as well as directly activating Bax. Hrk and Puma BH3 peptides appear to have more pronounced Bax activation in the presence of Bcl-xL (compare with Fig. 3B). Bcl-xL might somehow change the conformation of the peptides, which enhanced their activities, as discussed below in the context of Mcl-1. Noxa BH3 can activate Bax directly (Fig. 4A), but in the presence of Bcl-xL, it could not do so. We hypothesized that there was direct inhibition of Bax by Bcl-xL, which Noxa BH3 could not remove.

https://openalex.org/W1966522221,"Background Accurate predictions of species distributions are essential for climate change impact assessments. However the standard practice of using long-term climate averages to train species distribution models might mute important temporal patterns of species distribution. The benefit of using temporally explicit weather and distribution data has not been assessed. We hypothesized that short-term weather associated with the time a species was recorded should be superior to long-term climate measures for predicting distributions of mobile species. Methodology We tested our hypothesis by generating distribution models for 157 bird species found in Australian tropical savannas (ATS) using modelling algorithm Maxent. The variable weather of the ATS supports a bird assemblage with variable movement patterns and a high incidence of nomadism. We developed “weather” models by relating climatic variables (mean temperature, rainfall, rainfall seasonality and temperature seasonality) from the three month, six month and one year period preceding each bird record over a 58 year period (1950–2008). These weather models were compared against models built using long-term (30 year) averages of the same climatic variables. Conclusions Weather models consistently achieved higher model scores than climate models, particularly for wide-ranging, nomadic and desert species. Climate models predicted larger range areas for species, whereas weather models quantified fluctuations in habitat suitability across months, seasons and years. Models based on long-term climate averages over-estimate availability of suitable habitat and species' climatic tolerances, masking species potential vulnerability to climate change. Our results demonstrate that dynamic approaches to distribution modelling, such as incorporating organism-appropriate temporal scales, improves understanding of species distributions."
https://openalex.org/W1973912835,"Laboratory diagnosis of acute infection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is commonly based on the detection of HEV RNA, IgM and/or rising IgG levels. However, the profile of these markers when the patients present have not been well determined. To clarify the extent of misdiagnosed sporadic hepatitis E in the initial laboratory detection, serial sera of 271 sporadic acute hepatitis cases were collected, detected and the dynamics of each acute marker during the illness course were analyzed. 91 confirmed cases of hepatitis E were identified based on the presentation of HEV RNA, IgM or at least 4 fold rising of IgG levels. 21 (23.1%) hepatitis E cases were false negative for the viral RNA and 40 (44.0%) for rising IgG, because occurrence of these markers were confined to acute phase of infection and viremia had already subsided and antibody level peaked when these patients presented. IgM was detected in 82 (90.1%) cases. It is the most prevalent of the three markers, because the antibody persisted until early convalescence. Nine cases negative for IgM were positive for rising IgG and one was also positive for the viral RNA; all of these nine cases showed high avid IgG in their acute phase sera, which indicated re-infection. In summary, it is not practicable to determine the true occurrence of sporadic hepatitis E. Nevertheless, it could be closely approximated by approach using a combination of all three acute markers."
https://openalex.org/W2039337032,"Many colonic mucosal genes that are highly regulated by microbial signals are differentially expressed along the rostral-caudal axis. This would suggest that differences in regional microbiota exist, particularly mucosa-associated microbes that are less likely to be transient. We therefore explored this possibility by examining the bacterial populations associated with the normal proximal and distal colonic mucosa in context of host Toll-like receptors (TLR) expression in C57BL/6J mice housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) environments. 16S rRNA gene-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analysis revealed significant differences in the community structure and diversity of the mucosa-associated microbiota located in the distal colon compared to proximal colon and stool, the latter two clustering closely. Differential expression of colonic TLR2 and TLR4 along the proximal-distal axis was also found in SPF mice, but not in GF mice, suggesting that enteric microbes are essential in maintaining the regional expression of these TLRs. TLR2 is more highly expressed in proximal colon and decreases in a gradient to distal while TLR4 expression is highest in distal colon and a gradient of decreased expression to proximal colon is observed. After transfaunation in GF mice, both regional colonization of mucosa-associated microbes and expression of TLRs in the mouse colon were reestablished. In addition, exposure of the distal colon to cecal (proximal) microbiota induced TLR2 expression. These results demonstrate that regional colonic mucosa-associated microbiota determine the region-specific expression of TLR2 and TLR4. Conversely, region-specific host assembly rules are essential in determining the structure and function of mucosa-associated microbial populations. We believe this type of host-microbial mutualism is pivotal to the maintenance of intestinal and immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2048725298,"Background In honey bee colony, the brood is able to manipulate and chemically control the workers in order to sustain their own development. A brood ester pheromone produced primarily by old larvae (4 and 5 days old larvae) was first identified as acting as a contact pheromone with specific effects on nurses in the colony. More recently a new volatile brood pheromone has been identified: E-β-ocimene, which partially inhibits ovary development in workers. Methodology and Principal Finding Our analysis of E-β-ocimene production revealed that young brood (newly hatched to 3 days old) produce the highest quantity of E-β-ocimene relative to their body weight. By testing the potential action of this molecule as a non-specific larval signal, due to its high volatility in the colony, we demonstrated that in the presence of E-β-ocimene nest workers start to forage earlier in life, as seen in the presence of real brood. Conclusions/Significance In this way, young larvae are able to assign precedence to the task of foraging by workers in order to increase food stores for their own development. Thus, in the complexity of honey bee chemical communication, E-β-ocimene, a pheromone of young larvae, provides the brood with the means to express their nutritional needs to the workers."
https://openalex.org/W2020352306,"Mitochondrial dynamics have been extensively studied in the context of classical cell death models involving Bax-mediated cytochrome c release. Excitotoxic neuronal loss is a non-classical death signaling pathway that occurs following overactivation of glutamate receptors independent of Bax activation. Presently, the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of excitotoxicity remains largely unknown. Here, we report that NMDA-induced excitotoxicity results in defects in mitochondrial morphology as evident by the presence of excessive fragmented mitochondria, cessation of mitochondrial fusion, and cristae dilation. Up-regulation of the mitochondrial inner membrane GTPase, Opa1, is able to restore mitochondrial morphology and protect neurons against excitotoxic injury. Opa1 functions downstream of the calcium-dependent protease, calpain. Inhibition of calpain activity by calpastatin, an endogenous calpain inhibitor, significantly rescued mitochondrial defects and maintained neuronal survival. Opa1 was required for calpastatin-mediated neuroprotection because the enhanced survival found following NMDA-induced toxicity was significantly reduced upon loss of Opa1. Our results define a mechanism whereby breakdown of the mitochondrial network mediated through loss of Opa1 function contributes to neuronal death following excitotoxic neuronal injury. These studies suggest Opa1 as a potential therapeutic target to promote neuronal survival following acute brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2083874179,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are known to trigger an innate immune response against microbial infection. Although studies suggest that activation of TLRs modulate the function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), little is known about the role of NLRs on the MSC function. In this study, we investigated whether NOD1 and NOD2 regulate the functions of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs). The genes of TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, and NOD2 were expressed in hUCB-MSCs. Stimulation with each agonist (Pam3CSK4 for TLR2, LPS for TLR4, Tri-DAP for NOD1, and MDP for NOD2) led to IL-8 production in hUCB-MSC, suggesting the expressed receptors are functional in hUCB-MSC. CCK-8 assay revealed that none of agonist influenced proliferation of hUCB-MSCs. We next examined whether TLR and NLR agonists affect osteogenic-, adipogenic-, and chondrogenic differentiation of hUCB-MSCs. Pam3CSK4 and Tri-DAP strongly enhanced osteogenic differentiation and ERK phosphorylation in hUCB-MSCs, and LPS and MDP also slightly did. Treatment of U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) restored osteogenic differentiation enhanced by Pam3CSK4. Tri-DAP and MDP inhibited adipogenic differentiation of hUCB-MSCs, but Pam3CSK4 and LPS did not. On chondrogenic differentiation, all TLR and NLR agonists could promote chondrogenesis of hUCB-MSCs with difference in the ability. Our findings suggest that NOD1 and NOD2 as well as TLRs are involved in regulating the differentiation of MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1989220634,"The Neuregulins and their receptors, the ErbB/HER subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, have critical roles in animal physiology, and their deregulation is frequent in cancer. Here we report the identification of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1), as a novel mediator in signalling by ErbB/HER receptors. P-Rex1 was formerly described as a phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Gβγ activated protein that regulates Rac function. We define how ErbB/HER receptors regulate P-Rex1 function, which involves dephosphorylation of inhibitory residues, and phosphorylation of activating residues of P-Rex. The net balance resulting from activation of this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of P-Rex1 favours Rac activation. Molecular and biological studies indicated that P-Rex1 phosphorylation regulated the proliferation of breast cancer cells, and P-Rex1 knockdown affected their migration or invasiveness, as well as their in vivo tumourigenic potential. Moreover, as we found correlation between high P-Rex1 expression and poor patient outcome in breast cancer, P-Rex1 targeting may be therapeutically relevant in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2018475001,"Diurnal behavior in humans is governed by the period length of a circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the brain hypothalamus. Nevertheless, the cell-intrinsic mechanism of this clock is present in most cells of the body. We have shown previously that for individuals of extreme chronotype (""larks"" and ""owls""), clock properties measured in human fibroblasts correlated with extreme diurnal behavior.In this study, we have measured circadian period in human primary fibroblasts taken from normal individuals and, for the first time, compared it directly with physiological period measured in vivo in the same subjects. Human physiological period length was estimated via the secretion pattern of the hormone melatonin in two different groups of sighted subjects and one group of totally blind subjects, each using different methods. Fibroblast period length was measured via cyclical expression of a lentivirally delivered circadian reporter. Within each group, a positive linear correlation was observed between circadian period length in physiology and in fibroblast gene expression. Interestingly, although blind individuals showed on average the same fibroblast clock properties as sighted ones, their physiological periods were significantly longer.We conclude that the period of human circadian behaviour is mostly driven by cellular clock properties in normal individuals and can be approximated by measurement in peripheral cells such as fibroblasts. Based upon differences among sighted and blind subjects, we also speculate that period can be modified by prolonged unusual conditions such as the total light deprivation of blindness."
https://openalex.org/W1964789471,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and controls the expression of several genes that have been implicated in tumor growth and progression. Activity of HIF-1α in cancer cells is regulated at the transcriptional, translational and posttranslational level by multiple inter- and coacting molecular pathways. In this report, we reveal for the first time that tumor-associated CpG demethylation facilitates positive autoregulation of HIF-1α, resulting in amplification of hypoxia-induced transactivation of HIF-1α target genes. The HIF-1α promoter harbors a hypoxia response element that is normally repressed by methylation of a CpG dinucleotide located in the core element. In colon cancer cell lines and in primary colon cancer specimens, however, we found frequent aberrant demethylation of this element, enabling binding of HIF-1α to its own promoter resulting in autotransactivation of HIF-1α expression. Our results provide novel and highly unexpected insights into the complexity of HIF-1α regulation in cancer cells and implicate that tumor-associated CpG demethylation augments HIF-1α-mediated effects on malignant cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2155083905,"Integrating single-cell manipulation techniques in traditional and emerging biological culture systems is challenging. Microfabricated devices for single cell studies in particular often require cells to be spatially positioned at specific culture sites on the device surface. This paper presents a robotic micromanipulation system for pick-and-place positioning of single cells. By integrating computer vision and motion control algorithms, the system visually tracks a cell in real time and controls multiple positioning devices simultaneously to accurately pick up a single cell, transfer it to a desired substrate, and deposit it at a specified location. A traditional glass micropipette is used, and whole- and partial-cell aspiration techniques are investigated to manipulate single cells. Partially aspirating cells resulted in an operation speed of 15 seconds per cell and a 95% success rate. In contrast, the whole-cell aspiration method required 30 seconds per cell and achieved a success rate of 80%. The broad applicability of this robotic manipulation technique is demonstrated using multiple cell types on traditional substrates and on open-top microfabricated devices, without requiring modifications to device designs. Furthermore, we used this serial deposition process in conjunction with an established parallel cell manipulation technique to improve the efficiency of single cell capture from ∼80% to 100%. Using a robotic micromanipulation system to position single cells on a substrate is demonstrated as an effective stand-alone or bolstering technology for single-cell studies, eliminating some of the drawbacks associated with standard single-cell handling and manipulation techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2063009041,"A close interconnection between nutrient metabolism and virulence factor expression contributes to the pathophysiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a successful pathogen. P. aeruginosa fatty acid (FA) degradation is complicated with multiple acyl-CoA synthetase homologs (FadDs) expressed in vivo in lung tissue during cystic fibrosis infections. The promoters of two genetically linked P. aeruginosa fadD genes (fadD1 and fadD2) were mapped and northern blot analysis indicated they could exist on two different transcripts. These FadDs contain ATP/AMP signature and FA-binding motifs highly homologous to those of the Escherichia coli FadD. Upon introduction into an E. coli fadD-/fadR- double mutant, both P. aeruginosa fadDs functionally complemented the E. coli fadD-/fadR- mutant, allowing degradation of different chain-length FAs. Chromosomal mutagenesis, growth analysis, induction studies, and determination of kinetic parameters suggested that FadD1 has a substrate preference for long-chain FAs while FadD2 prefers shorter-chain FAs. When compared to the wild type strain, the fadD2 mutant exhibited decreased production of lipase, protease, rhamnolipid and phospholipase, and retardation of both swimming and swarming motilities. Interestingly, fadD1 mutant showed only increased swarming motility. Growth analysis of the fadD mutants showed noticeable deficiencies in utilizing FAs and phosphatidylcholine (major components of lung surfactant) as the sole carbon source. This defect translated into decreased in vivo fitness of P. aeruginosa in a BALB/c mouse lung infection model, supporting the role of lipids as a significant nutrient source for this bacterium in vivo."

However, little is known about this association in midlife. As this information will inform policy for early preventative healthcare initiatives, we investigated non-periventricular frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in relation to cognitive function in 428 (232 women) community-dwelling adults aged 44 to 48 years.Frontal white matter lesions were significantly associated with greater intraindividual RT variability in women, while temporal WMH were associated with face recognition deficits in men. Parietal and occipital lobe lesions were unrelated to cognitive performance. These findings did not differ when education and a range of health variables, including vascular risk factors, were taken into account.Gender differences in WMH-cognition associations are discussed, and we conclude that small vessel disease is present in midlife and has functional consequences which are generally not recognized. Preventative strategies should, therefore, begin early in life."
https://openalex.org/W2001661545,"CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the major HIV coreceptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in cell activation and migration in response to chemokines. Blockade of CCR5 is an effective anti-HIV strategy, and potent anti-HIV chemokine analogs such as PSC-RANTES have been developed. These inhibitors act by interfering with receptor trafficking, thereby inducing prolonged intracellular sequestration of CCR5. Like many GPCRs, CCR5 is desensitized following agonist activation. The initial steps in this process are well understood, but later stages, including where CCR5 is sequestered during desensitization, and how anti-HIV chemokine analogs intervene to achieve prolonged sequestration, have yet to be elucidated in detail. In this study we demonstrate that CCR5 cycles to and from the cell surface via the endosome recycling compartment and the trans-Golgi network during desensitization, accumulating in the trans-Golgi network following internalization by both PSC-RANTES and CCL5, the native ligand from which it was derived. In addition, we show that unlike CCR5 sequestered by CCL5, CCR5 sequestered by PSC-RANTES cannot be induced to return to the cell surface by addition of the small molecule CCR5 inhibitor, TAK-779, and that association of PSC-RANTES with CCR5 is more durable than that of native CCL5 during desensitization. Our findings reconcile the previously conflicting descriptions of the location of sequestered CCR5 during desensitization, as well as providing more general insights into potential trafficking routes for endocytosed GPCRs and further elucidation of the unusual inhibitory mechanism of chemokine analogs with potent anti-HIV activity."

https://openalex.org/W2002015314,"The V617F activating mutation of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a kinase essential for cytokine signalling, characterizes Polycythemia vera (PV), one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, not all MPNs carry mutations of JAK2, and in JAK2-mutated patients, expression of JAK2V617F does not always result in clone expansion. In the present study, we provide evidence that inflammation-linked cytokines are required for the growth of JAK2V617F-mutated erythroid progenitors. In a first series of experiments, we searched for cytokines over-expressed in PV using cytokine antibody (Ab) arrays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for analyses of serum and bone marrow (BM) plasma, and quantitative reverse transcription–PCRs for analyses of cells purified from PV patients and controls. We found that PV patients over-expressed anti-inflammatory hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin-11 (IL-11), BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) and erythroblasts being the main producers. In a second series of experiments, autocrine/paracrine cytokine stimulation of erythroblasts was blocked using neutralizing Abs specific for IL-11 or c-MET, the HGF receptor. The growth of JAK2V617F-mutated HEL cells and PV erythroblasts was inhibited, indicating that JAK2-mutated cells depend on HGF and IL-11 for their growth. Additional experiments showed that transient expression of JAK2V617F in BaF-3/erythropoietin receptor cells, and invalidation of JAK2V617F in HEL cells using anti-JAK2 small interfering RNA, did not affect HGF and IL-11 expression. Thus, anti-inflammatory HGF and IL-11 are upregulated in PV and their overproduction is not a consequence of JAK2V617F. As both cytokines contribute to the proliferation of PV erythroblasts, blocking the c-MET/HGF/IL-11 pathways could be of interest as an additional therapeutic option in PV."
https://openalex.org/W2048692117,"Although skeletal muscle metabolism is a well-studied physiological process, little is known about how it is regulated at the transcriptional level. The myogenic transcription factor myogenin is required for skeletal muscle development during embryonic and fetal life, but myogenin's role in adult skeletal muscle is unclear. We sought to determine myogenin's function in adult muscle metabolism. A Myog conditional allele and Cre-ER transgene were used to delete Myog in adult mice. Mice were analyzed for exercise capacity by involuntary treadmill running. To assess oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, we performed indirect calorimetry, monitored blood glucose and lactate levels, and performed histochemical analyses on muscle fibers. Surprisingly, we found that Myog-deleted mice performed significantly better than controls in high- and low-intensity treadmill running. This enhanced exercise capacity was due to more efficient oxidative metabolism during low- and high-intensity exercise and more efficient glycolytic metabolism during high-intensity exercise. Furthermore, Myog-deleted mice had an enhanced response to long-term voluntary exercise training on running wheels. We identified several candidate genes whose expression was altered in exercise-stressed muscle of mice lacking myogenin. The results suggest that myogenin plays a critical role as a high-level transcriptional regulator to control the energy balance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in adult skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2082354784,"Primary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040) is a rare hereditary disease that causes a generalized partial insensitivity to glucocorticoid action, due to genetic alterations of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Investigation of adrenal incidentalomas led to the discovery of a family (eight affected individuals spanning three generations), prone to cortisol resistance, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, arterial hypertension and hypokalemia. This phenotype exacerbated over time, cosegregates with the first heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] reported to date for the GR, replacing an arginine (CGA) by a stop (TGA) at amino-acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. In vitro, this mutation leads to a truncated 50-kDa GR lacking hormone and DNA binding capacity, devoid of hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and transactivation properties. In the proband's fibroblasts, we provided evidence for the lack of expression of the defective allele in vivo. The absence of detectable mutated GR mRNA was accompanied by a 50% reduction in wild type GR transcript and protein. This reduced GR expression leads to a significantly below-normal induction of glucocorticoid-induced target genes, FKBP5 in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction involved GR haploinsufficiency due to the selective degradation of the mutated GR transcript through a nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay that was experimentally validated on emetine-treated propositus' fibroblasts. GR haploinsufficiency leads to hypertension due to illicit occupation of renal mineralocorticoid receptor by elevated cortisol rather than to increased mineralocorticoid production reported in primary glucocorticoid resistance. Indeed, apparent mineralocorticoid excess was demonstrated by a decrease in urinary tetrahydrocortisone-tetrahydrocortisol ratio in affected patients, revealing reduced glucocorticoid degradation by renal activity of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, a GR regulated gene. We propose thus that GR haploinsufficiency compromises glucocorticoid sensitivity and may represent a novel genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, incidentally revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and mineralocorticoid-independent hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2166045387,"MicroRNAs play important roles in various biological processes involving fairly complex mechanism. Analysis of genome-wide miRNA microarray demonstrate that a single miRNA can regulate hundreds of genes, but the regulative extent on most individual genes is surprisingly mild so that it is difficult to understand how a miRNA provokes detectable functional changes with such mild regulation.To explore the internal mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation, we re-analyzed the data collected from genome-wide miRNA microarray with bioinformatics assay, and found that the transfection of miR-181b and miR-34a in Hela and HCT-116 tumor cells regulated large numbers of genes, among which, the genes related to cell growth and cell death demonstrated high Enrichment scores, suggesting that these miRNAs may be important in cell growth and cell death. MiR-181b induced changes in protein expression of most genes that were seemingly related to enhancing cell growth and decreasing cell death, while miR-34a mediated contrary changes of gene expression. Cell growth assays further confirmed this finding. In further study on miR-20b-mediated osteogenesis in hMSCs, miR-20b was found to enhance osteogenesis by activating BMPs/Runx2 signaling pathway in several stages by co-repressing of PPARγ, Bambi and Crim1.With its multi-target characteristics, miR-181b, miR-34a and miR-20b provoked detectable functional changes by co-regulating functionally-related gene groups or several genes in the same signaling pathway, and thus mild regulation from individual miRNA targeting genes could have contributed to an additive effect. This might also be one of the modes of miRNA-mediated gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1979241738,"The activity of PI3K is necessary for polarized cell motility. To guide extending axons, environmental cues polarize the growth cone via asymmetric generation of Ca2+ signals and subsequent intracellular mechanical events, including membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal reorganization. However, it remains unclear how PI3K is involved in such events for axon guidance. Here, we demonstrate that PI3K plays a permissive role in growth cone turning by facilitating microtubule (MT)-dependent membrane transport. Using embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture, attractive axon turning was induced by Ca2+ elevations on one side of the growth cone by photolyzing caged Ca2+ or caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. We show that PI3K activity was required downstream of Ca2+ signals for growth cone turning. Attractive Ca2+ signals, generated with caged Ca2+ or caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, triggered asymmetric transport of membrane vesicles from the center to the periphery of growth cones in a MT-dependent manner. This centrifugal vesicle transport was abolished by PI3K inhibitors, suggesting that PI3K is involved in growth cone attraction at the level of membrane trafficking. Consistent with this observation, immunocytochemistry showed that PI3K inhibitors reduced MTs in the growth cone peripheral domain. Time-lapse imaging of EB1 on the plus-end of MTs revealed that MT advance into the growth cone peripheral domain was dependent on PI3K activity: inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway attenuated MT advance, whereas exogenous phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, the product of PI3K-catalyzed reactions, promoted MT advance. This study demonstrates the importance of PI3K-dependent membrane trafficking in chemotactic cell migration. The activity of PI3K is necessary for polarized cell motility. To guide extending axons, environmental cues polarize the growth cone via asymmetric generation of Ca2+ signals and subsequent intracellular mechanical events, including membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal reorganization. However, it remains unclear how PI3K is involved in such events for axon guidance. Here, we demonstrate that PI3K plays a permissive role in growth cone turning by facilitating microtubule (MT)-dependent membrane transport.

https://openalex.org/W2033733802,"Background In spite of leukemia therapy improvements obtained over the last decades, therapy is not yet effective in all cases. Current approaches in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) research focus on identifying new molecular targets to improve outcome for patients with a dismal prognosis. In this light phosphoproteomics seems to hold great promise for the identification of proteins suitable for targeted therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings We employed Reverse Phase Protein Microarrays to identify aberrantly activated proteins in 118 pediatric B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL patients. Signal transduction pathways were assayed for activation/expression status of 92 key signalling proteins. We observed an increased activation/expression of several pathways involved in cell proliferation in poor clinical prognosis patients. MLL-rearranged tumours revealed BCL-2 hyperphosphorylation through AMPK activation, which indicates that AMPK could provide a functional role in inhibiting apoptosis in MLL-rearranged patients, and could be considered as a new potential therapeutic target. Second, in patients with poor clinical response to prednisone we observed the up-modulation of LCK activity with respect to patients with good response. This tyrosine-kinase can be down-modulated with clinically used inhibitors, thus modulating LCK activity could be considered for further studies as a new additional therapy for prednisone-resistant patients. Further we also found an association between high levels of CYCLIN E and relapse incidence. Moreover, CYCLIN E is more expressed in early relapsed patients, who usually show an unfavourable prognosis. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that functional protein pathway activation mapping revealed specific deranged signalling networks in BCP-ALL that could be potentially modulated to produce a better clinical outcome for patients resistant to standard-of-care therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2036594879,"The replication of Tropheryma whipplei (the agent of Whipple's disease) within human macrophages is associated with the expression of IL-16, a cytokine known for its chemotactic and inflammatory properties. In this study, we asked whether IL-16 acts on T. whipplei replication by interfering with the endocytic pathway. We observed that in macrophages, T. whipplei was located within late phagosomes that were unable to fuse with lysosomes; in monocytes, T. whipplei was eliminated in phagolysosomes. Moreover, adding IL-16 to monocytes induced bacterial replication and inhibited phagolysosome formation. On the other hand, blocking IL-16 activity, either with anti-IL-16 antibodies in human macrophages or by using murine IL-16(-/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages, inhibited T. whipplei replication and rescued phagolysosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we propose that IL-16-mediated interference with the endocytic pathway is likely related to macrophage activation. First, IFNγ induced T. whipplei elimination and phagolysosome formation and inhibited IL-16 production by macrophages. Second, the full transcriptional response of murine macrophages to T. whipplei showed that T. whipplei specifically modulated the expression of 231 probes in IL-16(-/-) macrophages. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that 10 of 13 over-represented terms were linked to immune responses, including proinflammatory transcriptional factors of the NF-κB family. Our results demonstrated a previously unreported function for IL-16 in promoting bacterial replication through inhibited phagolysosome biogenesis and modulated macrophage activation program."
https://openalex.org/W2055793689,"Introduction Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumors show different expression patterns of latency genes. Since in breast carcinoma this pattern is not yet fully described, our aim was to characterize EBV latency pattern in our EBV positive breast carcinoma series. Methods The study was conducted on 71 biopsies of breast carcinoma and in 48 non-neoplastic breast controls. EBNA1, LMP2A and LMP1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies, while viral genomic DNA and EBERs RNA transcripts expression was performed by in situ hybridization. EBV presence was confirmed by PCR. Results EBV genomic DNA and EBNA1 expression were detected in 31% (22/71) of patients specifically restricted to tumor epithelial cells in breast carcinoma while all breast control samples were negative for both viral DNA and EBNA1 protein. LMP2A was detected in 73% of EBNA1 positive cases, none of which expressed either LMP1 protein or EBERs transcripts. Conclusions These findings suggest that EBV expression pattern in the studied biopsies could be different from those previously observed in breast carcinoma cell lines and lead us to suggest a new, EBNA1, LMP2A positive and LMP1 and EBERs negative latency profile in breast carcinoma in our population."
https://openalex.org/W2079493726,"Background Experimental infection of malaria-naïve volunteers by the bite of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes is a preferred means to test the protective effect of malaria vaccines and drugs. The standard model relies on the bite of five infected mosquitoes to induce malaria. We examined the efficacy of malaria transmission using mosquitoes raised aseptically in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). Methods and Findings Eighteen adults aged 18–40 years were randomized to receive 1, 3 or 5 bites of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 strain of P. falciparum. Seventeen participants developed malaria; fourteen occurring on Day 11. The mean prepatent period was 10.9 days (9–12 days). The geometric mean parasitemia was 15.7 parasites/µL (range: 4–70) by microscopy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected parasites 3.1 (range: 0–4) days prior to microscopy. The geometric mean sporozoite load was 16,753 sporozoites per infected mosquito (range: 1,000–57,500). A 1-bite participant withdrew from the study on Day 13 post-challenge and was PCR and smear negative. Conclusions The use of aseptic, cGMP-compliant P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes is safe, is associated with a precise prepatent period compared to the standard model and appears more efficient than the standard approach, as it led to infection in 100% (6/6) of volunteers exposed to three mosquito bites and 83% (5/6) of volunteers exposed to one mosquito bite.

https://openalex.org/W1968492907,"Hip dysplasia is an important and complex genetic disease in dogs with both genetic and environmental influences. Since the osteoarthritis that develops is irreversible the only way to improve welfare, through reducing the prevalence, is through genetic selection. This study aimed to evaluate the progress of selection against hip dysplasia, to quantify potential improvements in the response to selection via use of genetic information and increases in selection intensity, and to prepare for public provision of estimated breeding values (EBV) for hip dysplasia in the UK. Data consisted of 25,243 single records of hip scores of Labrador Retrievers between one and four years old, from radiographs evaluated between 2000 and 2007 as part of the British Veterinary Association (BVA) hip score scheme. A natural logarithm transformation was applied to improve normality and linear mixed models were evaluated using ASREML. Genetic correlations between left and right scores, and total hip scores at one, two and three years of age were found to be close to one, endorsing analysis of total hip score in dogs aged one to three as an appropriate approach. A heritability of 0.35±0.016 and small but significant litter effect (0.07±0.009) were estimated. The observed trends in both mean hip score and mean EBV over year of birth indicate that a small genetic improvement has been taking place, approximately equivalent to avoiding those dogs with the worst 15% of scores. Deterministic analysis supported by simulations showed that a 19% greater response could be achieved using EBV compared to phenotype through increases in accuracy alone. This study establishes that consistent but slow genetic improvement in the hip score of UK Labrador Retrievers has been achieved over the previous decade, and demonstrates that progress may be easily enhanced through the use of EBVs and more intense selection."
https://openalex.org/W2126452989,"Background In populations of most social insects, gene flow is maintained through mating between reproductive individuals from different colonies in periodic nuptial flights followed by dispersal of the fertilized foundresses. Some ant species, however, form large polygynous supercolonies, in which mating takes place within the maternal nest (intranidal mating) and fertilized queens disperse within or along the boundary of the supercolony, leading to supercolony growth (colony budding). As a consequence, gene flow is largely confined within supercolonies. Over time, such supercolonies may diverge genetically and, thus, also in recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHC's) by a combination of genetic drift and accumulation of colony-specific, neutral mutations. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested this hypothesis for six supercolonies of the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes in north-east Borneo. Within supercolonies, workers from different nests tolerated each other, were closely related and showed highly similar CHC profiles. Between supercolonies, aggression ranged from tolerance to mortal encounters and was negatively correlated with relatedness and CHC profile similarity. Supercolonies were genetically and chemically distinct, with mutually aggressive supercolony pairs sharing only 33.1%±17.5% (mean ± SD) of their alleles across six microsatellite loci and 73.8%±11.6% of the compounds in their CHC profile. Moreover, the proportion of alleles that differed between supercolony pairs was positively correlated to the proportion of qualitatively different CHC compounds. These qualitatively differing CHC compounds were found across various substance classes including alkanes, alkenes and mono-, di- and trimethyl-branched alkanes. Conclusions We conclude that positive feedback between genetic, chemical and behavioural traits may further enhance supercolony differentiation through genetic drift and neutral evolution, and may drive colonies towards different evolutionary pathways, possibly including speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2080021190,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation involves ligand-induced receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)-induced CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination were studied in mouse macrophages. Phosphorylation of CSF-1R Tyr-559, required for the binding of Src family kinases (SFKs), was both necessary and sufficient for these responses and for c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and all three responses were inhibited by SFK inhibitors. In c-Cbl-deficient macrophages, CSF-1R ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation were substantially inhibited. Reconstitution with wild-type, but not ubiquitin ligase-defective C381A c-Cbl rescued these responses, while expression of C381A c-Cbl in wild-type macrophages suppressed them. Analysis of site-directed mutations in the CSF-1R further suggests that activated c-Cbl-mediated CSF-1R ubiquitination is required for a conformational change in the major kinase domain that allows amplification of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and full receptor activation. Thus the results indicate that CSF-1-mediated receptor dimerization leads to a Tyr-559/SFK/c-Cbl pathway resulting in receptor ubiquitination that permits full receptor tyrosine phosphorylation of this class III RTK in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2075133756,"Background The mosquito Anopheles funestus is one of the major malaria vector species in sub-Saharan Africa. Olfaction is essential in guiding mosquito behaviors. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception. An improved understanding of the function of malaria mosquito OBPs may contribute to identifying new attractants/repellents and assist in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly mosquito controlling strategies. Methodology In this study, a large screening of over 50 ecologically significant odorant compounds led to the identification of 12 ligands that elicit significant electroantennographic (EAG) responses from An. funestus female antennae. To compare the absolute efficiency/potency of these chemicals, corrections were made for differences in volatility by determining the exact amount in a stimulus puff. Fourteen AfunOBP genes were cloned and their expression patterns were analyzed. AfunOBP1, 3, 7, 20 and 66 showed olfactory tissue specificity by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that among olfactory-specific OBPs, AfunOBP1 and 3 are the most enriched OBPs in female antennae. Binding assay experiments showed that at pH 7, AfunOBP1 significantly binds to 2-undecanone, nonyl acetate, octyl acetate and 1-octen-3-ol but AfunOBP3, which shares 68% identify with AfunOBP1 at amino acid level, showed nearly no binding activity to the selected 12 EAG-active odorant compounds. Conclusion This work presents for the first time a study on the odorants and OBPs of the malaria vector mosquito An. funestus, which may provide insight into the An. funestus olfactory research, assist in a comparative study between major malaria mosquitoes An. gambiae and An. funestus olfactory system, and help developing new mosquito control strategies to reduce malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2121552276,"Background The Ras and Notch signaling pathways are frequently activated during development to control many diverse cellular processes and are often dysregulated during tumorigenesis. To study the role of Notch and oncogenic Kras signaling in a progenitor cell population, Pdx1-Cre mice were utilized to generate conditional oncogenic KrasG12D mice with ablation of Notch1 and/or Notch2. Methodology/Principal Findings Surprisingly, mice with activated KrasG12D and Notch1 but not Notch2 ablation developed skin papillomas progressing to squamous cell carcinoma providing evidence for Pdx1 expression in the skin. Immunostaining and lineage tracing experiments indicate that PDX1 is present predominantly in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and rarely in the basal layer. Further analysis of keratinocytes in vitro revealed differentiation-dependent expression of PDX1 in terminally differentiated keratinocytes. PDX1 expression was also increased during wound healing. Further analysis revealed that loss of Notch1 but not Notch2 is critical for skin tumor development. Reasons for this include distinct Notch expression with Notch1 in all layers and Notch2 in the suprabasal layer as well as distinctive p21 and β-catenin signaling inhibition capabilities. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide strong evidence for epidermal expression of Pdx1 as of yet not identified function. In addition, this finding may be relevant for research using Pdx1-Cre transgenic strains. Additionally, our study confirms distinctive expression and functions of Notch1 and Notch2 in the skin supporting the importance of careful dissection of the contribution of individual Notch receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2018597086,"Background The intestinal epithelium undergoes constant self-renewal throughout adult life across vertebrates. This is accomplished through the proliferation and subsequent differentiation of the adult stem cells. This self-renewal system is established in the so-called postembryonic developmental period in mammals when endogenous thyroid hormone (T3) levels are high. Methodology/Principal Findings The T3-dependent metamorphosis in anurans like Xenopus laevis resembles the mammalian postembryonic development and offers a unique opportunity to study how the adult stem cells are developed. The tadpole intestine is predominantly a monolayer of larval epithelial cells. During metamorphosis, the larval epithelial cells undergo apoptosis and, concurrently, adult epithelial stem/progenitor cells develop de novo, rapidly proliferate, and then differentiate to establish a trough-crest axis of the epithelial fold, resembling the crypt-villus axis in the adult mammalian intestine. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) is a well-established stem cell marker in the adult mouse intestinal crypt. Here we have cloned and analyzed the spatiotemporal expression profile of LGR5 gene during frog metamorphosis. We show that the two duplicated LGR5 genes in Xenopus laevis and the LGR5 gene in Xenopus tropicalis are highly homologous to the LGR5 in other vertebrates. The expression of LGR5 is induced in the limb, tail, and intestine by T3 during metamorphosis. More importantly, LGR5 mRNA is localized to the developing adult epithelial stem cells of the intestine. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that LGR5-expressing cells are the stem/progenitor cells of the adult intestine and that LGR5 plays a role in the development and/or maintenance of the adult intestinal stem cells during postembryonic development in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2033029606,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling regulates cell proliferation during vertebrate development via induction of cell-cycle regulator gene expression or activation of other signalling pathways, prevents cell death by an as yet unclear mechanism and is required for differentiation of retinal cell types. Thus, an unsolved question is how the same signalling molecule can regulate such distinct cell processes as proliferation, cell survival and differentiation.Analysis of the zebrafish shh(-/-) mutant revealed that in this context p53 mediates elevated apoptosis during nervous system and retina development and interferes with retinal proliferation and differentiation. While in shh(-/-) mutants there is activation of p53 target genes and p53-mediated apoptosis, an increase in Hedgehog (Hh) signalling by over-expression of dominant-negative Protein Kinase A strongly decreased p53 target gene expression and apoptosis levels in shh(-/-) mutants. Using a novel p53 reporter transgene, I confirm that p53 is active in tissues that require Shh for cell survival. Proliferation assays revealed that loss of p53 can rescue normal cell-cycle exit and the mitotic indices in the shh(-/-) mutant retina at 24, 36 and 48 hpf. Moreover, generation of amacrine cells and photoreceptors was strongly enhanced in the double p53(-/-)shh(-/-) mutant retina suggesting the effect of p53 on retinal differentiation.Loss of Shh signalling leads to the p53-dependent apoptosis in the developing nervous system and retina. Moreover, Shh-mediated control of p53 activity is required for proliferation and cell cycle exit of retinal cells as well as differentiation of amacrine cells and photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2044597012,"Background Imprinted genes are expressed from only one allele in a parent-of-origin dependent manner. Loss of imprinted (LOI) expression can result in a variety of human disorders and is frequently reported in cancer. Biallelic expression of imprinted genes in adult blood has been suggested as a useful biomarker and is currently being investigated in colorectal cancer. In general, the expression profiles of imprinted genes are well characterised during human and mouse fetal development, but not in human adults. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated quantitative expression of 36 imprinted genes in adult human peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from healthy individuals. Allelic expression was also investigated in B and T lymphocytes and myeloid cells. We found that 21 genes were essentially undetectable in adult blood. Only six genes were demonstrably monoallelic, and most importantly, we found that nine genes were either biallelic or showed variable expression in different individuals. Separated leukocyte populations showed the same expression patterns as whole blood. Differential methylation at each of the imprinting control loci analysed was maintained, including regions that contained biallelically expressed genes. This suggests in some cases methylation has become uncoupled from its role in regulating gene expression. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that only a limited set of imprinted genes, including IGF2 and SNRPN, may be useful for LOI cancer biomarker studies. In addition, blood is not a good tissue to use for the discovery of new imprinted genes. Finally, lymphocyte DNA methylation status in the adult may not always be a reliable indicator of monoallelic gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1984983496,"Background Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that evolves from the interaction of activated endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes and modified lipoproteins (LDLs). In the last years many molecules with crucial metabolic functions have been shown to prevent important steps in the progression of atherogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) and the class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT1. The PPARγ coactivator 1 alpha (Ppargc1a or PGC-1α) was identified as an important transcriptional cofactor of PPARγ and is activated by SIRT1. The aim of this study was to analyze total PGC-1α deficiency in an atherosclerotic mouse model. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate if total PGC-1α deficiency affects atherosclerosis, we compared ApoE−/− PGC-1α−/− and ApoE−/− PGC-1α+/+ mice kept on a high cholesterol diet. Despite having more macrophages and a higher ICAM-1 expression in plaques, ApoE−/− PGC-1α−/− did not display more or larger atherosclerotic plaques than their ApoE−/− PGC-1α+/+ littermates. In line with the previously published phenotype of PGC-1α−/− mice, ApoE−/− PGC-1α−/− mice had marked reduced body, liver and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) weight. VLDL/LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride contents were also reduced. Aortic expression of PPARα and PPARγ, two crucial regulators for adipocyte differentitation and glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as the expression of some PPAR target genes was significantly reduced in ApoE−/− PGC-1α−/− mice. Importantly, the epididymal WAT and aortic expression of IL-18 and IL-18 plasma levels, a pro-atherosclerotic cytokine, was markedly reduced in ApoE−/− PGC-1α−/− mice. Conclusions/Significance ApoE−/− PGC-1α−/− mice, similar as PGC-1α−/− mice exhibit markedly reduced total body and visceral fat weight. Since inflammation of visceral fat is a crucial trigger of atherogenesis, decreased visceral fat in PGC-1α-deficient mice may explain why these mice do not develop enhanced atherosclerosis."

Methods We defined confirmed Nipah cases by the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies against Nipah virus in serum. Case-patients, who resided in the same village during the outbreak period but died before serum could be collected, were classified as probable cases. Results We identified three confirmed and five probable Nipah cases. There was a single index case. Five of the secondary cases came in close physical contact to the index case when she was ill. Case-patients were more likely to have physical contact with the index case (71% cases versus 0% controls, p = <0.001). The index case, on her third day of illness, and all the subsequent cases attended the same religious gathering. For three probable cases including the index case, we could not identify any known risk factors for Nipah infection such as physical contact with Nipah case-patients, consumption of raw date palm juice, or contact with sick animals or fruit bats. Conclusion Though person-to-person transmission remains an important mode of transmission for Nipah infection, we could not confirm the source of infection for three of the probable Nipah case-patients. Continued surveillance and outbreak investigations will help better understand the transmission of Nipah virus and develop preventive strategies."

We describe a new tool for dissecting ERα action in breast cancer, p-fluoro-4-(1,2,3,6,-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxo-6-thionpurin-8-ylthio) (TPSF), a potent small-molecule inhibitor of estrogen receptor α that does not compete with estrogen for binding to ERα.

In response to high affinity estrogen binding, ERα dimerizes, binds to ERE DNAs, and undergoes a conformational change in the ligand binding domain that facilitates the recruitment of coactivators (8.Shiau A.K.

Treatment strategies that inhibit estrogen-dependent breast cancer include selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen, which binds in the ERα ligand binding pocket, and aromatase inhibitors, which block estrogen production. Nearly half of patients treated with aromatase inhibitors develop resistance (17.Anderson H. Bulun S. Smith I. Dowsett M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 106: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The long-term effectiveness of tamoxifen is limited by the development of resistance in nearly all patients with metastatic breast cancer and in ∼40% of patients with primary breast cancers (18.Jordan V.C. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 949: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The development of resistance to current therapies underscores the need to develop new small molecule antagonists that act outside the ligand binding pocket of ERα. We recently described an in vitro high throughput screening strategy to identify small molecule inhibitors of ERα binding to DNA. We identified 8-benzylsulfanylmethyl-1,3-dimethyl-3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione (TPBM) as a small molecule inhibitor of ERα binding to ERE DNA (19.Mao C. Patterson N.M. Cherian M.T. Aninye I.O. Zhang C. Montoya J.B. Cheng J. Putt K.S. Hergenrother P.J. Wilson E.M. Nardulli A.M. Nordeen S.K. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12819-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using a cell-based screen, we evaluated ∼200 small molecules structurally related to TPBM and identified butyrophenone, p-fluoro-4-(1,2,3,6, -tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxo-6-thionpurin-8-ylthio) (TPSF) as a novel inhibitor of ERα >15-fold more potent than TPBM. Although structurally related to TPBM, TPSF exhibits an entirely different mode of action. Although TPBM inhibits in vitro binding of E2-ERα to a labeled ERE, TPSF does not. TPSF strongly reduces ERα levels in breast cancer cells, whereas TPBM has little or no effect on the level of ERα. Here we demonstrate the selectivity of TPSF and its ability to inhibit expression of an endogenous ERα-regulated gene that contains EREs and a gene regulated by tethering of ERα through other proteins. We show that TPSF inhibits anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant ERα-containing breast cancer cells and demonstrate that TPSF enhances proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in growth medium containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin and fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biological, Atlanta, GA) or calf serum and transferred to phenol red-free medium containing charcoal-dextran (CD)-stripped serum at least 2 days before treatment with E2, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), or TPSF. ERα-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231, human breast cancer cells, were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and switched to MEM containing 5% CD-treated calf serum 3 or 4 days before the experiment. The medium was changed on day 2. Tet-inducible MCF7ERαHA cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 μg/ml puromycin, and 10% FBS. Four days before the experiment, MCF7ERαHA cells were switched to the above medium without phenol red containing 10% 6× stripped CD-treated FBS without puromycin (20.Fowler A.M. Solodin N.

Four days before the experiment the cells were transferred to the above phenol red-free medium (phenol red-free) containing 10% 2× CD-CS. HeLa-AR1C-PSA-Luc-A6 cells that stably express androgen receptor (AR) and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-Luc reporter were maintained in phenol-red free MEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS under selection with 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Four days before the experiment, cells were transferred to medium containing 10% 2× CD-CS.

The relative binding affinity of TPSF for ERα and ERβ was determined in competitive radioligand binding assays using 2 nm [3H]E2 and a range of TPSF concentrations as described (26.Carlson K.E.

Bobseine K. Gray Jr., L.E. Toxicol Sci. 2004; 81: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The ability of TPSF to inhibit AR and GR transcriptional activity was assayed in HeLa AR1C-PSA-Luc-A6 cells that stably express human AR and a PSA-Luc reporter and in T47D/A1–2 cells that stably express GR and MMTV-Luc. Four days before each experiment, cells were switched to medium containing CD-treated serum as described above. HeLa AR-PSA-Luc cells (100,000 cells/well) and T47DA/1-2 and T47D-KBluc cells (200,000 cells/well) were plated in 1 ml of media in 24-well plates. After 24 h the indicated concentrations of E2, dihydrotestosterone, or dexamethasone in DMSO or DMSO vehicle alone with or without TPSF were added to each well. After 24 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison WI). Luciferase activity was determined using BrightGlo firefly luciferase reagent from Promega. MCF-7 cells and MCF7ERαHA cells were maintained for 4 days in medium containing 5% 1× CD-CS (MCF-7 cells) or 10% 6× stripped CD FBS (MCF7ERαHA cells). For assays of TPSF inhibition of PI-9 induction in MCF-7 cells, cells were preincubated for 24 h with TPSF and then maintained for 4 h with and without E2 and TPSF or with vehicle alone. To induce ERα expression, MCF7ERαHA cells were maintained in medium containing 0.5 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 24 h. E2 or OHT was added with or without TPSF and maintained for 24 h. For the induction of cyclin D1, 24 h after plating the cells, E2 with and without TPSF was added, and cells were maintained for 24 h. RNA was extracted, and mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR as described (19.Mao C. Patterson N.M. Cherian M.T. Aninye I.O. Zhang C. Montoya J.B. Cheng J. Putt K.S. Hergenrother P.J.

Primers used in qRT-PCR were: ERα, forward (5′-GGAGACGGACCAAAGCCACT) and reverse (5′-TTCCCAACAGAAGACAGAAGATG); cyclin D1, forward (5′-TCATGGCTGAAGTCACCTCTTGGT) and reverse (5′-TCCACTGGATGGTTTGTCACTGGA); PI-9, forward (5′-TGGAATGAACCGTTTGACGAA) and reverse (5′-CATCTGCACTGGCCTTTGCT); IL-8 forward (5′-GAGGGTTGTGGAGAAGTTTTTG) and reverse (5′-CTGGCATCTTCACTGATTCTTG); β-actin forward (5′-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA) and reverse (5′-AATGCTATCACCTCCCCTGTGT). Cells were maintained in CD-treated serum for at least 4 days before each experiment. To minimize cell aggregation, MCF-7 cells were harvested in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Other cell lines were harvested in trypsin-EDTA. To assay anchorage-dependent cell growth, 1000 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate. For slow-growing ZR-75 cells, 2000 cells were plated/well. Cells were maintained in medium containing CD-treated serum for 24 h, and the medium was then changed, and E2 and DMSO vehicle or TPSF in DMSO was added. The medium was replaced after 2 days, except for BT474 cells, whose medium was not changed. After 4 days, cell viability was determined using Promega CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega). To assay anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar, 1%, and 0.7% Select Agar (Invitrogen) was prepared in water and warmed at 40 °C before use. 1.5 ml of 0.5% bottom agar diluted in medium was added to each well of a 6-well cell culture plate and allowed to solidify at room temperature. Top agar was prepared by dilution in warm medium containing the various treatments. MCF-7 cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 0.35% top agar at 5000 cells/well and plated in 3 wells for each condition. The plate was kept at room temperature for 30 min until the top agar solidified, then 0.5 ml of medium containing the respective treatments was added on top of the agar. Culture medium on top of the agar was changed every 3–4 days. Colonies were visible by 1 week and counted at day 16 using a dissecting microscope. Photographs of colonies were taken using a Zeiss AxioImager2 imaging system at 6× magnification. MCF-7 cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well in 6-well plates in MEM containing 5% 1× CD FBS. The medium was changed at day 2, and at day 4 the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the indicated treatments. Whole cell extracts were prepared after 24 h in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Millipore, CA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Extract (20 μg of protein/lane) was run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. ER was detected using a 1:4000 dilution of ERα antibody ER6F11 (Bio Care Medical). The blot was stripped for 25 min and reprobed using a 1:10,000 dilution of β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Student's t test was used for comparison of the means between two groups. Significance was established when p < 0.05. The comparisons are described in the figure legends and are not shown in the body of the figures. We evaluated the ability of ∼200 compounds structurally related to TPBM (Fig. 1A), a first generation ERα inhibitor (19.Mao C. Patterson N.M. Cherian M.T. Aninye I.O. Zhang C. Montoya J.B. Cheng J. Putt K.S. Hergenrother P.J. Wilson E.M. Nardulli A.M. Nordeen S.K. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12819-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), to inhibit E2-ERα-mediated gene expression in ERα-positive T47D-KBluc human breast cancer cells containing (ERE)3-Luc (24.Wilson V.S. Bobseine K. Gray Jr., L.E. Toxicol Sci. 2004; 81: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Of the compounds tested, TPSF (Fig. 1A) was ∼16-fold more potent than TPBM in inhibiting ERα-mediated gene expression (Fig. 1B). To test whether TPSF is a structure-specific inhibitor, we compared the ability of TPSF to inhibit ERα-mediated gene expression to the structurally similar small molecule 99676. TPSF differs from NSC 99676 by having hydrophilic CO and fluorine substitutions at the phenyl ring (Fig. 1A). The similar, but more hydrophobic, 99676 had an IC50 of 9 μm and was ∼13-fold less potent than TPSF (Fig. 1B). The results suggest that TPSF is a structure-specific inhibitor of ERα and is not simply acting by promiscuous inhibition due to micelle formation. If TPSF inhibited ERα by competing with E2 for binding in the ligand binding pocket of the receptor, increasing the E2 concentration should reduce the ability of TPSF to bind ERα and block its action. To test this, we varied the E2 concentration by 500-fold and tested the ability of TPSF to inhibit (ERE)3-Luc in T47D cells. Increasing the concentration of E2 from 0.2 to 100 nm only slightly increased the IC50 for inhibiting E2-ERα-mediated transcription from 0.4 μm (Fig. 1B, filled triangles) to 0.7 μm (Fig. 1B, open triangles), suggesting TPSF acts outside the ERα ligand binding pocket. If TPSF is a highly potent ERα ligand, it might retain the ability to inhibit ERα at 100 nm E2. To test whether TPSF binds in the ligand binding pocket of ERα, the ability of TPSF to compete with radiolabeled E2 for binding to ERα was evaluated. In competitive radiometric binding assays performed across a broad range of concentrations (26.Carlson K.E. Choi I. Gee A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 27.Katzenellenbogen J.A. Johnson Jr., H.J. Myers H.N. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), TPSF had virtually no ability to compete with E2 for binding to ERα. With E2 set at 100%, TPSF had a relative binding affinity for ERα of ∼0.001%, indicating that it is not a classical ligand that competes with E2 for binding in the ERα ligand binding pocket. The ERα binding cleft for p160 coactivator LXXLL motifs has been a major target for development of peptide and small molecule inhibitors (29.Chang C. Norris J.D. Gr⊘n H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T.

Although these inhibitors are effective in reporter gene assays in transfected cells, in general they have not been shown to effectively inhibit expression of endogenous ER-regulated genes in breast cancer cells. We, therefore, tested the ability of TPSF to inhibit the expression of the endogenous E2-inducible PI-9 gene in MCF-7 cells. The serpin PI-9 is a tumor lethality factor (34.ten Berge R.L. de Bruin P.C. Oudejans J.J. Ossenkoppele G.J. van der Valk P. Meijer C.J.

TPSF (IC50 = 0.2 μm) potently inhibited E2-ERα-stimulated induction of PI-9 mRNA (Fig. 2A). To examine the ability of TPSF to inhibit E2-ERα induction of a gene regulated by tethering of E2-ERα through DNA-bound transcriptional regulators, we tested the effect of TPSF on induction of cyclin D1 mRNA. Cyclin D1 is thought to contribute to the growth of MCF-7 and other breast cancer cells (42.Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S. Buckley M.F. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The data demonstrate that TPSF inhibits E2-dependent gene expression through mechanisms that include direct binding of ERα to EREs and through tethering of ERα to DNA-associated transcription regulators. Specificity of TPSF inhibition of E2-ERα-mediated gene expression was evaluated by comparing the ability of TPSF to inhibit gene expression mediated by NF-κB (Fig. 2C) and by other steroid receptors (Fig. 2D). The NF-κB-regulated IL-8 gene was used to test specificity because many regulators and pathways including IκB and other kinases, the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, and nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling all influence NF-κB activity (47.Chen Lf. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Analyzing the effect of TPSF on NF-κB is a good way to test whether TPSF acts as a promiscuous inhibitor targeting diverse cell proteins and pathways. 30 μm TPSF had no effect on the NF-κB-mediated induction of IL-8 mRNA by TNF-α (Fig. 2C). In the same breast cancer cells where TPSF inhibited E2-ERα induction of PI-9 mRNA (Fig. 2A, IC50 = 0.2 μm), a >100-fold higher concentration of TPSF had no effect on NF-κB-mediated induction of IL-8 mRNA by TNF-α (Fig. 2C). To further evaluate the specificity of TPSF, we compared the ability of TPSF to inhibit ERα to its effect on the AR- and GR-mediated activation of stably transfected reporter genes. AR was assayed in HeLa cells stably transfected to express AR and a PSA-luciferase reporter. TPSF only very weakly inhibited dihydrotestosterone-AR-mediated induction of the PSA-Luc reporter (IC50 = 33 μm, Fig. 2D). GR was assayed in T47D cells stably transfected to express GR and an MMTV-Luc reporter (25.Nordeen S.K. Kühnel B. Lawler-Heavner J. Barber D.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TPSF weakly inhibited GR activation of the MMTV-luc reporter in T47D cells (IC50 = 10 μm). Although T47D cells contain substantial levels of the proges"
https://openalex.org/W2092654372,"Operative mortality risk in cardiac surgery is usually assessed using preoperative risk models. However, intraoperative factors may change the risk profile of the patients, and parameters at the admission in the intensive care unit may be relevant in determining the operative mortality. This study investigates the association between a number of parameters at the admission in the intensive care unit and the operative mortality, and verifies the hypothesis that including these parameters into the preoperative risk models may increase the accuracy of prediction of the operative mortality.929 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery were admitted to the study. The preoperative risk profile was assessed using the logistic EuroSCORE and the ACEF score. A number of parameters recorded at the admission in the intensive care unit were explored for univariate and multivariable association with the operative mortality.A heart rate higher than 120 beats per minute and a blood lactate value higher than 4 mmol/L at the admission in the intensive care unit were independent predictors of operative mortality, with odds ratio of 6.7 and 13.4 respectively. Including these parameters into the logistic EuroSCORE and the ACEF score increased their accuracy (area under the curve 0.85 to 0.88 for the logistic EuroSCORE and 0.81 to 0.86 for the ACEF score).A double-stage assessment of operative mortality risk provides a higher accuracy of the prediction. Elevated blood lactates and tachycardia reflect a condition of inadequate cardiac output. Their inclusion in the assessment of the severity of the clinical conditions after cardiac surgery may offer a useful tool to introduce more sophisticated hemodynamic monitoring techniques. Comparison between the predicted operative mortality risk before and after the operation may offer an assessment of the operative performance."
https://openalex.org/W2026666636,"As first shown more than 100 years ago, fertilization of an aged (overripe) egg increases the rate of malformations and embryonic loss in several vertebrates, including possibly humans as well. Since the molecular events in aging eggs may be similar in these species, we established in the frog Xenopus tropicalis a defined protocol for delayed fertilization of eggs. A three-hour delayed fertilization led to a dramatic increase in malformation and mortality. Gene expression profiling revealed that 14% of the polyadenylated maternal transcripts were downregulated upon aging. These transcripts were not degraded, but rather deadenylated as shown for specific maternal mRNAs. The affected transcripts are characterized by a relatively short 3'UTR and a paucity of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE) and polyadenylation signals (PAS). Furthermore, maternal mRNAs known to be deadenylated during egg maturation as well as after fertilization were preferentially deadenylated in aged eggs. Taken together our analysis of aging eggs reveals that unfertilized eggs are in a dynamic state that was previously not realized. On the one hand deadenylation of transcripts that are typically deadenylated during egg maturation continues and this implies overripeness of the aged egg in the truest sense of the word. On the other hand transcripts that normally are deadenylated after fertilization loose their poly(A) in the aged egg and this implies that the egg awaiting fertilization starts processes that are normally only observed after fertilization. Based on our novel finding we postulate that the imbalance of the polyadenylated maternal transcripts upon egg aging contributes to the loss of developmental potential. Based on this hypothesis the developmental consequences of downregulation of specific transcripts can be analyzed in future."
https://openalex.org/W1998873310,"Background The Prion protein (PRNP/Prp) plays a crucial role in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), scrapie and mad cow disease. Notwithstanding the importance in human and animal disease, fundamental aspects of PRNP/Prp function and transmission remains unaccounted for. Methodology/Principal Findings The zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome contains three Prp encoding genes assigned prp1, prp2 and prp3. Currently, the second paralogue is believed to be the most similar to the mammalian PRNP gene in structure and function. Functional studies of the PRNP gene ortholog was addressed by prp2 morpholino (MO) knockdown experiments. Investigation of Prp2 depleted embryos revealed high mortality and apoptosis at 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) as well as impaired brain and neuronal development. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, a genome-wide transcriptome analysis was carried out in viable 24 hpf morphants. The resulting changes in gene expression profiles revealed 249 differently expressed genes linked to biological processes like cell death, neurogenesis and embryonic development. Conclusions/Significance The current study contributes to the understanding of basic Prp functions and demonstrates that the zebrafish is an excellent model to address the role of Prp in vertebrates. The gene knockdown of prp2 indicates an essential biological function for the zebrafish ortholog with a morphant phenotype that suggests a neurodegenerative action and gene expression effects which are apoptosis related and effects gene networks controlling neurogenesis and embryo development."
https://openalex.org/W2041533003,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most effective treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, a failure in the initial response or relapse within the first five years of treatment has been observed in 20% of patients. We have previously observed that in vivo administration of an inhibitor of nitric oxide improved the response to BCG of bladder tumor bearing mice. It was described that this effect was due to a replacement of tumor tissue by collagen depots. The aim of the present work was to clarify the mechanism involved in this process.We demonstrated that BCG induces NIH-3T3 fibroblast proliferation by activating the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways and also differentiation determined by alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression. In vivo, intratumoral inoculation of BCG also increased alpha-SMA and collagen expression. Oral administration of L-NAME enhanced the pro-fibrotic effect of BCG. Peritoneal macrophages obtained from MB49 tumor-bearing mice treated in vivo with combined treatment of BCG with L-NAME also enhanced fibroblast proliferation. We observed that FGF-2 is one of the factors released by BCG-activated macrophages that is able to induce fibroblast proliferation. The involvement of FGF-2 was evidenced using an anti-FGF2 antibody. At the same time, this macrophage population improved wound healing rate in normal mice and FGF-2 expression was also increased in these wounds.Our findings suggest that fibroblasts are targeted by BCG both directly and through activated macrophages in an immunotherapy context of a bladder murine model. We also described, for the first time, that FGF-2 is involved in a dialog between fibroblasts and macrophages induced after BCG treatment. The fact that L-NAME administration improves the BCG effect on fibroblasts, NO inhibition, might represent a new approach to add to the conventional BCG therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1990923693,"Human gastric carcinomas are among the most treatment-refractory epithelial malignancies. Increased understanding of the underlying molecular aberrations in such tumors could provide insights leading to improved therapeutic approaches. In this study, we characterized diverse genetic aberrations leading to constitutive Wnt signaling activation in a series of human gastric carcinoma cell lines. Downregulation of TCF signaling by stable transduction of dominant negative TCF4 (DNTCF4) resulted in inhibition of proliferation in Wnt-activated AGS tumor cells. c-Myc downregulation and the associated upregulation of its repression target, p21 observed in these tumor cells, as well as the profound growth inhibition induced by c-Myc small hairpin RNA (shRNA) implied their c-Myc addiction. In striking contrast, Wnt-activated MKN-28 and MKN-74 tumor cells appeared refractory to DNTCF4 inhibition of proliferation despite comparably decreased c-Myc expression levels. The resistance of these same tumor cells to growth inhibition by c-Myc shRNA established that their refractoriness to DNTCF was because of their independence from c-Myc for proliferation. There was no correlation between this resistance phenotype and the presence or absence of constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or AKT pathway activation, commonly observed in gastrointestinal tumors. However, in both DNTCF-sensitive and -resistant tumor cells with MAPK and/or AKT pathway activation, the ability of small molecule antagonists directed against either pathway to inhibit tumor cell growth was enhanced by Wnt pathway inhibition. These findings support the concept that although certain Wnt-activated tumors may escape c-Myc dependence for proliferation, disruption of other oncogenic pathways can unmask cooperative antiproliferative effects for Wnt pathway downregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2114614359,"Ser172 of β tubulin is an important residue that is mutated in a human brain disease and phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 in mammalian cells. To examine the role of this residue, we used the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model and produced two different mutations (S172A and S172E) of the conserved Ser172 in the yeast β tubulin Tub2p. The two mutants showed impaired cell growth on benomyl-containing medium and at cold temperatures, altered microtubule (MT) dynamics, and altered nucleus positioning and segregation. When cytoplasmic MT effectors Dyn1p or Kar9p were deleted in S172A and S172E mutants, cells were viable but presented increased ploidy. Furthermore, the two β tubulin mutations exhibited synthetic lethal interactions with Bik1p, Bim1p or Kar3p, which are effectors of cytoplasmic and spindle MTs. In the absence of Mad2p-dependent spindle checkpoint, both mutations are deleterious. These findings show the importance of Ser172 for the correct function of both cytoplasmic and spindle MTs and for normal cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2049431601,"Maturation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) occurs upon activation of HIV-1 protease embedded within GagProPol precursors and cleavage of Gag and GagProPol polyproteins. Although reversible oxidation can regulate mature protease activity as well as retrovirus maturation, it is possible that the effects of oxidation on viral maturation are mediated in whole, or part, through effects on the initial intramolecular cleavage event of GagProPol. In order assess the effect of reversible oxidation on this event, we developed a system to isolate the first step in protease activation involving GagProPol.To determine if oxidation influences this step, we created a GagProPol plasmid construct (pGPfs-1C) that encoded mutations at all cleavage sites except p2/NC, the initial cleavage site in GagProPol. pGPfs-1C was used in an in vitro translation assay to observe the behavior of this initial step without interference from subsequent processing events. Diamide, a sulfhydral oxidizing agent, inhibited processing at p2/NC by >60% for pGPfs-1C and was readily reversed with the reductant, dithiothreitol. The ability to regulate processing by reversible oxidation was lost when the cysteines of the embedded protease were mutated to alanine. Unlike mature protease, which requires only oxidation of cys95 for inhibition, both cysteines of the embedded protease contributed to this inhibition.We developed a system that can be used to study the first step in the cascade of HIV-1 GagProPol processing and show that reversible oxidation of cysteines of HIV-1 protease embedded in GagProPol can block this initial GagProPol autoprocessing. This type of regulation may be broadly applied to the majority of retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2155294817,"5-androstene-3β,7β,17β-triol (β-AET), an active metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), reversed glucocorticoid (GC)-induced suppression of IL-6, IL-8 and osteoprotegerin production by human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells and promoted osteoblast differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In a murine thermal injury model that includes glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia, β-AET significantly (p<0.05) preserved bone mineral content, restored whole body bone mineral content and endochondral growth, suggesting reversal of GC-mediated decreases in chondrocyte proliferation, maturation and osteogenesis in the growth plate. In men and women, levels of β-AET decline with age, consistent with a role for β-AET relevant to diseases associated with aging. β-AET, related compounds or synthetic derivatives may be part of effective therapeutic strategies to accelerate tissue regeneration and prevent or treat diseases associated with aging such as osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W1987355175,"Background JAMA introduced a requirement for independent statistical analysis for industry-funded trials in July 2005. We wanted to see whether this policy affected the number of industry-funded trials published by JAMA. Methods and Findings We undertook a retrospective, before-and-after study of published papers. Two investigators independently extracted data from all issues of JAMA published between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2008 (i.e., three years before and after the policy). They were not blinded to publication date. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were classified as industry funded (IF), joint industry/non-commercial funding (J), industry supported (IS) (when manufacturers provided materials only), non-commercial (N) or funding not stated (NS). Findings were compared and discrepancies resolved by discussion or further analysis of the reports. RCTs published in The Lancet and NEJM over the same period were used as a control group. Between July 2002 and July 2008, JAMA published 1,314 papers, of which 311 were RCTs. The number of industry studies (IF, J or IS) fell significantly after the policy (p = 0.02) especially for categories J and IS. However, over the same period, the number of industry studies rose in both The Lancet and NEJM. Conclusions After the requirement for independent statistical analysis for industry-funded studies, JAMA published significantly fewer RCTs and significantly fewer industry-funded RCTs. This pattern was not seen in the control journals. This suggests the JAMA policy affected the number of submissions, the acceptance rate, or both. Without analysing the submissions, we cannot check these hypotheses but, assuming the number of published papers is related to the number submitted, our findings suggest that JAMA's policy may have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of industry-sponsored trials it received and published."
https://openalex.org/W1978219156,"Background We have been investigating how interruption of differentiation contributes to the oncogenic process and the possibility to reverse the transformed phenotype by restoring differentiation. In a previous report, we correlated the capacity of intracellular Notch (ICN) to suppress v-Src-mediated transformation of quail neuroretina (QNR/v-srcts) cells with the acquisition by these undifferentiated cells of glial differentiation markers. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work, we have identified autocrine TGF-β3 signaling activation as a major effector of Notch-induced phenotypic changes, sufficient to induce transition in differentiation markers expression, suppress morphological transformation and significantly inhibit anchorage-independent growth. We also show that this signaling is constitutive of and contributes to ex-vivo autonomous QNR cell differentiation and that its down-regulation is essential to achieve v-Src-induced transformation. Conclusions/Significance These results support the possibility that Notch signaling induces differentiation and suppresses transformation by a novel mechanism, involving secreted proteins. They also underline the importance of extracellular signals in controlling the balance between normal and transformed phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2036177564,"A major computational challenge in the genomic era is annotating structure/function to the vast quantities of sequence information that is now available. This problem is illustrated by the fact that most proteins lack comprehensive annotations, even when experimental evidence exists. We previously theorized that embedded-alignment profiles (simply ""alignment profiles"" hereafter) provide a quantitative method that is capable of relating the structural and functional properties of proteins, as well as their evolutionary relationships. A key feature of alignment profiles lies in the interoperability of data format (e.g., alignment information, physio-chemical information, genomic information, etc.). Indeed, we have demonstrated that the Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) are an informative M-dimension that is scored by quantitatively measuring the embedded or unmodified sequence alignments. Moreover, the information obtained from these alignments is informative, and remains so even in the ""twilight zone"" of sequence similarity (<25% identity). Although our previous embedding strategy was powerful, it suffered from contaminating alignments (embedded AND unmodified) and high computational costs. Herein, we describe the logic and algorithmic process for a heuristic embedding strategy named ""Adaptive GDDA-BLAST."" Adaptive GDDA-BLAST is, on average, up to 19 times faster than, but has similar sensitivity to our previous method. Further, data are provided to demonstrate the benefits of embedded-alignment measurements in terms of detecting structural homology in highly divergent protein sequences and isolating secondary structural elements of transmembrane and ankyrin-repeat domains. Together, these advances allow further exploration of the embedded alignment data space within sufficiently large data sets to eventually induce relevant statistical inferences. We show that sequence embedding could serve as one of the vehicles for measurement of low-identity alignments and for incorporation thereof into high-performance PSSM-based alignment profiles."
