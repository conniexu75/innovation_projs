https://openalex.org/W1967261754,"Naive T helper cells differentiate into two subsets, Th1 and Th2, each with distinct functions and cytokine profiles. Here, we report the isolation of T-bet, a Th1-specific T box transcription factor that controls the expression of the hallmark Th1 cytokine, IFNgamma. T-bet expression correlates with IFNgamma expression in Th1 and NK cells. Ectopic expression of T-bet both transactivates the IFNgamma gene and induces endogenous IFNgamma production. Remarkably, retroviral gene transduction of T-bet into polarized Th2 and Tc2 primary T cells redirects them into Th1 and Tc1 cells, respectively, as evidenced by the simultaneous induction of IFNgamma and repression of IL-4 and IL-5. Thus, T-bet initiates Th1 lineage development from naive Thp cells both by activating Th1 genetic programs and by repressing the opposing Th2 programs."
https://openalex.org/W2050781058,"The capsaicin (vanilloid) receptor VR1 is a cation channel expressed by primary sensory neurons of the ""pain"" pathway. Heterologously expressed VR1 can be activated by vanilloid compounds, protons, or heat (>43 degrees C), but whether this channel contributes to chemical or thermal sensitivity in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that sensory neurons from mice lacking VR1 are severely deficient in their responses to each of these noxious stimuli. VR1-/- mice showed normal responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but exhibited no vanilloid-evoked pain behavior, were impaired in the detection of painful heat, and showed little thermal hypersensitivity in the setting of inflammation. Thus, VR1 is essential for selective modalities of pain sensation and for tissue injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2030552522,"We report the specific transduction, via surface stress changes, of DNA hybridization and receptor-ligand binding into a direct nanomechanical response of microfabricated cantilevers. Cantilevers in an array were functionalized with a selection of biomolecules. The differential deflection of the cantilevers was found to provide a true molecular recognition signal despite large nonspecific responses of individual cantilevers. Hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides shows that a single base mismatch between two 12-mer oligonucleotides is clearly detectable. Similar experiments on protein A–immunoglobulin interactions demonstrate the wide-ranging applicability of nanomechanical transduction to detect biomolecular recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2161060432,"The higher-plant shoot meristem is a dynamic structure whose maintenance depends on the coordination of two antagonistic processes, organ initiation and self-renewal of the stem cell population. In Arabidopsis shoot and floral meristems, the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene is required for stem cell identity, whereas the CLAVATA1, 2, and 3 (CLV) genes promote organ initiation. Our analysis of the interactions between these key regulators indicates that (1) the CLV genes repress WUS at the transcript level and that (2) WUS expression is sufficient to induce meristem cell identity and the expression of the stem cell marker CLV3. Our data suggest that the shoot meristem has properties of a self-regulatory system in which WUS/CLV interactions establish a feedback loop between the stem cells and the underlying organizing center."
https://openalex.org/W2169702025,"Bitter taste perception provides animals with critical protection against ingestion of poisonous compounds. In the accompanying paper, we report the characterization of a large family of putative mammalian taste receptors (T2Rs). Here we use a heterologous expression system to show that specific T2Rs function as bitter taste receptors. A mouse T2R (mT2R-5) responds to the bitter tastant cycloheximide, and a human and a mouse receptor (hT2R-4 and mT2R-8) responded to denatonium and 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil. Mice strains deficient in their ability to detect cycloheximide have amino acid substitutions in the mT2R-5 gene; these changes render the receptor significantly less responsive to cycloheximide. We also expressed mT2R-5 in insect cells and demonstrate specific tastant-dependent activation of gustducin, a G protein implicated in bitter signaling. Since a single taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of T2Rs, these findings provide a plausible explanation for the uniform bitter taste that is evoked by many structurally unrelated toxic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2089885047,"In mammals, taste perception is a major mode of sensory input. We have identified a novel family of 40–80 human and rodent G protein–coupled receptors expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. These candidate taste receptors (T2Rs) are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. Notably, a single taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of recognizing multiple tastants. T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the G protein α subunit gustducin, implying that they function as gustducin-linked receptors. In the accompanying paper, we demonstrate that T2Rs couple to gustducin in vitro, and respond to bitter tastants in a functional expression assay."

https://openalex.org/W2083407560,"A combination of experimental, molecular dynamics, and kinetics modeling studies is applied to a system of concentrated aqueous sodium chloride particles suspended in air at room temperature with ozone, irradiated at 254 nanometers to generate hydroxyl radicals. Measurements of the observed gaseous molecular chlorine product are explainable only if reactions at the air-water interface are dominant. Molecular dynamics simulations show the availability of substantial amounts of chloride ions for reaction at the interface, and quantum chemical calculations predict that in the gas phase chloride ions will strongly attract hydroxl radicals. Model extrapolation to the marine boundary layer yields daytime chlorine atom concentrations that are in good agreement with estimates based on field measurements of the decay of selected organics over the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic. Thus, ion-enhanced interactions with gases at aqueous interfaces may play a more generalized and important role in the chemistry of concentrated inorganic salt solutions than was previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2080152855,"Cancer susceptibility genes have been classified into two groups: gatekeepers and caretakers. Gatekeepers are genes that control cell proliferation and death, whereas caretakers are DNA repair genes whose inactivation leads to genetic instability. Abrogation of both caretaker and gatekeeper function markedly increases cancer susceptibility. Although the importance of Ku80 in DNA double-strand break repair is well established, neither Ku80 nor other components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway are known to have a caretaker role in maintaining genomic stability. Here we show that mouse cells deficient for Ku80 display a marked increase in chromosomal aberrations, including breakage, translocations and aneuploidy. Despite the observed chromosome instabilities, Ku80-/- mice have only a slightly earlier onset of cancer. Loss of p53 synergizes with Ku80 to promote tumorigenesis such that all Ku80-/- p53-/- mice succumb to disseminated pro-B-cell lymphoma before three months of age. Tumours result from a specific set of chromosomal translocations and gene amplifications involving IgH and c-Myc, reminiscent of Burkitt's lymphoma. We conclude that Ku80 is a caretaker gene that maintains the integrity of the genome by a mechanism involving the suppression of chromosomal rearrangements."

https://openalex.org/W1965368032,"A chemical approach to atomic layer deposition (ALD) of oxide thin films is reported here. Instead of using water or other compounds for an oxygen source, oxygen is obtained from a metal alkoxide, which serves as both an oxygen and a metal source when it reacts with another metal compound such as a metal chloride or a metal alkyl. These reactions generally enable deposition of oxides of many metals. With this approach, an alumina film has been deposited on silicon without creating an interfacial silicon oxide layer that otherwise forms easily. This finding adds to the other benefits of the ALD method, especially the atomic-level thickness control and excellent uniformity, and takes a major step toward the scientifically challenging and technologically important task of replacing silica as the gate dielectric in the future generations of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors."
https://openalex.org/W1990214042,"One of the main mechanisms of messenger RNA degradation in eukaryotes occurs by deadenylation-dependent decapping which leads to 5'-to-3' decay. A family of Sm-like (Lsm) proteins has been identified, members of which contain the 'Sm' sequence motif, form a complex with U6 small nuclear RNA and are required for pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that mutations in seven yeast Lsm proteins (Lsm1-Lsm7) also lead to inhibition of mRNA decapping. In addition, the Lsm1-Lsm7 proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the mRNA decapping enzyme (Dcp1), a decapping activator (Pat1/Mrt1) and with mRNA. This indicates that the Lsm proteins may promote decapping by interactions with the mRNA and the decapping machinery. In addition, the Lsm complex that functions in mRNA decay appears to be distinct from the U6-associated Lsm complex, indicating that Lsm proteins form specific complexes that affect different aspects of mRNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2053488603,"The origin of the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray background has been a mystery for over 35 years. Most of the soft X-ray background has been resolved into individual sources (mainly quasars), but these sources do not have the spectral energy distribution required to match the spectrum of the X-ray background as a whole. Here we report the results of a deep survey, using the Chandra satellite, in which the detected hard X-ray sources account for at least 75 per cent of the hard X-ray background. The mean X-ray spectral energy distribution of these sources is in good agreement with that of the background. Moreover, most of those hard X-ray sources are associated unambiguously with either the nuclei of otherwise normal bright galaxies, or with optically faint sources. The latter could be active nuclei in dust-enshrouded galaxies or a population of quasars at extremely high redshift."
https://openalex.org/W2067026447,"Green coloration in the animal kingdom, as seen in birds' feathers and reptile integument, is often an additive mixture of structurally effected blue and pigmentary yellow1. Here we investigate the origin of the bright green coloration of the wing scales of the Indonesian male Papilio palinurus butterfly, the microstructure of which generates an extraordinary combination of both yellow and blue iridescence. The dual colour arises from a modulation imposed on the multilayer, producing the blue component as a result of a previously undiscovered retro-reflection process."

https://openalex.org/W1985894701,"Sister kinetochores are bioriented toward the spindle poles in higher eukaryotic prometaphase before chromosome segregation. We show that, in budding yeast, the sister kinetochores are separated in the very early spindle, while the sister arms remain associated. Biorientation of the separated kinetochores is achieved already after replication. Mtw1p, a homolog of fission yeast Mis12 required for biorientation, locates at the centromeres in an Ndc10p-dependent manner. Mtw1p and the sequences 1.8 and 3.8 kb from CEN3 and CEN15, respectively, behave like the precociously separated kinetochores, whereas the sequences 23 and 35 kb distant from CEN3 and CEN5 previously used as the centromere markers behave like a part of the arm. Mtw1p and Ndc10p are identically located except for additional spindle localization of Ndc10p. A model explaining small centromeres and early spindle formation in budding yeast is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2087577070,"A paradigm for control of insulin secretion is that glucose metabolism elevates cytoplasmic [ATP]/[ADP] in β cells, closing KATP channels and causing depolarization, Ca2+ entry, and insulin release. Decreased responsiveness of KATP channels to elevated [ATP]/[ADP] should therefore lead to decreased insulin secretion and diabetes. To test this critical prediction, we generated transgenic mice expressing β cell KATP channels with reduced ATP sensitivity. Animals develop severe hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and ketoacidosis within 2 days and typically die within 5. Nevertheless, islet morphology, insulin localization, and α and β cell distributions were normal (before day 3), pointing to reduced insulin secretion as causal. The data indicate that normal KATP channel activity is critical for maintenance of euglycemia and that overactivity can cause diabetes by inhibiting insulin secretion."

The 1.7 Å resolution crystal structures of the human Chk1 kinase domain and its binary complex with an ATP analog has revealed an identical open kinase conformation. The secondary structure and side chain interactions stabilize the activation loop of Chk1 and enable kinase activity without phosphorylation of the catalytic domain. Molecular modeling of the interaction of a Cdc25C peptide with Chk1 has uncovered several conserved residues that are important for substrate selectivity. In addition, we found that the less conserved C-terminal region negatively impacts Chk1 kinase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2047161147,"A high-pressure phase of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) with an α-PbO 2 –type structure has been identified in garnet of diamondiferous quartzofeldspathic rocks from the Saxonian Erzgebirge, Germany. Analytical electron microscopy indicates that this α-PbO 2 –type TiO 2 occurred as an epitaxial nanometer-thick slab between twinned rutile bicrystals. Given a V-shaped curve for the equilibrium phase boundary of α-PbO 2 –type TiO 2 to rutile, the stabilization pressure of α-PbO 2 –type TiO 2 should be 4 to 5 gigapascals at 900° to 1000°C. This suggests a burial of continental crustal rocks to depths of at least 130 kilometers. The α-PbO 2 –type TiO 2 may be a useful pressure and temperature indicator in the diamond stability field."
https://openalex.org/W2328470294,"The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in a variety of human tumours. In order to understand the mechanism by which ErbB2 mediates tumour proliferation we have functionally inactivated the receptor using an intracellularly expressed, ER-targeted single-chain antibody (scFV-5R). Inducible expression of scFv-5R in the ErbB2-overexpressing SKBr3 breast tumour cell line leads to loss of plasma membrane localized ErbB2. Simultaneously, the activity of ErbB3, MAP kinase and PKB/Akt decreased dramatically, suggesting that active ErbB2/ErbB3 dimers are necessary for sustained activity of these kinases. Loss of functional ErbB2 caused the SKBr3 tumour cells to accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This was a result of reduction in CDK2 activity, which was mediated by a re-distribution of p27Kip1 from sequestering complexes to cyclin E/CDK2 complexes. The level of c-Myc and D-cyclins, proteins involved in p27KiP1 sequestration, decreased in the absence of functional ErbB2. Ectopic expression of c-Myc led to an increase in D cyclin levels, CDK2 activity and resulted in a partial G1 rescue. We propose that c-Myc is a primary effector of ErbB2-mediated oncogenicity and functions to prevent normal p27Kip1 control of cyclinE/CDK2."
https://openalex.org/W2086620317,"Sorting signals on cargo proteins are recognized by coatomer for selective uptake into COPI (coatomer)-coated vesicles. This study shows that coatomer couples sorting signal recognition to the GTP hydrolysis reaction on ARF1. Coatomer responds differently to different signals. The cytoplasmic signal sequence of hp24a inhibits coatomer-dependent GTP hydrolysis. By contrast, the dilysine retrieval signal, which competes for the same binding site on coatomer, has no effect on GTPase activity. It is inferred that, in vivo, sorting signal selection is under kinetic control, with coatomer governing a GTPase discard pathway that excludes dilysine-tagged proteins from one class of COPI-coated vesicles. The concept of competing sets of sorting signals that act positively and negatively during vesicle budding through a GTPase switch in the COPI coat complex suggests mechanisms for cargo segregation in which specificity is conferred by GTP hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2322441397,"Centrosome hyperamplification and the consequential mitotic defects contribute to chromosome instability in cancers. Loss or mutational inactivation of p53 has been shown to induce chromosome instability through centrosome hyperamplification. It has recently been found that Cdk2-cyclin E is involved in the initiation of centrosome duplication, and that constitutive activation of Cdk2-cyclin E results in the uncoupling of the centrosome duplication cycle and the DNA replication cycle. Cyclin E overexpression and p53 mutations occur frequently in tumors. Here, we show that cyclin E overexpression and loss of p53 synergistically increase the frequency of centrosome hyperamplification in cultured cells as well as in tumors developed in p53-null, heterozygous, and wild-type mice. Through examination of cells derived from Waf1-null mice, we further found that Waf1, a potent inhibitor of Cdk2-cyclin E and a major target of p53's transactivation function, is involved in coordinating the initiation of centrosome duplication and DNA replication, suggesting that Waf1 may act as a molecular link between p53 and Cdk2-cyclin E in the control of the centrosome duplication cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1576935382,"Meteorites contain micrometer-sized graphite grains with embedded titanium carbide grains. Although isotopic analysis identifies asymptotic giant branch stars as the birth sites of these grains, there is no direct observational identification of these grains in astronomical sources. We report that infrared wavelength spectra of gas-phase titanium carbide nanocrystals derived in the laboratory show a prominent feature at a wavelength of 20.1 micrometers, which compares well to a similar feature in observed spectra of postasymptotic giant branch stars. It is concluded that titanium carbide forms during a short (approximately 100 years) phase of catastrophic mass loss (>0.001 solar masses per year) in dying, low-mass stars."
https://openalex.org/W2088306576,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene product is negatively regulated by the product of its downstream target, mdm2. The deletion of mdm2 in the mouse results in embryonic lethality at 5.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.) which can be overcome by simultaneous loss of the p53 tumor suppressor, substantiating the importance of the negative regulatory function of MDM2 on p53 function in vivo. Hence, the loss of MDM2 allowed the unregulated p53 protein to continuously exert its growth-suppressing activity, which either led to a complete G1 arrest or induced the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway, resulting in the death of the mdm2−/− embryos. To determine which of these possibilities is occurring, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from p53 null and p53/mdm2 double null embryos were transfected with a retroviral vector carrying a temperature-sensitive p53 (tsp53) cDNA. Shifting of single-cell clonal populations to the permissive temperature caused the p53−/−mdm2−/− fibroblasts expressing tsp53 to undergo apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. This phenotype was not observed in the tsp53 expressing p53−/− clones nor the parental cell lines. Thus, our data indicate that the simple loss of mdm2 can induce the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2332440185,"We have previously shown that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on human chromosome (hchr) 7 at q31.1 is common in a variety of tumors of epithelial origin. Frequent LOH of a specific chromosomal marker is indicative of a closely linked tumor suppressor gene (TSG). However, recent reports have also indicated that such a high frequency of LOH could be due to the presence in this region of the second most common aphidicolin-inducible fragile site in the human genome (Fra7G). To address this controversy, we introduced single copies of hchr7 or hchr12 into a highly aggressive human prostate carcinoma cell line (PC3) by microcell-mediated transfer. The tumorigenicity of six clones of PC3/hchr7 hybrids and three clones of PCRhchr12 hybrids, obtained in four separate fusion experiments, were studied in BALB/c nude mice. All but one of the PC3/hchr7 hybrids increased tumor latency by at least twofold, whereas none of the PC3/hchr12 hybrids delayed tumor onset. No differences in the in vitro growth rate were observed among any of the cell lines assayed (parental and hybrids) suggesting that the observed tumor suppression was due to factors other than cell cycle regulation. Deletion mapping of the PC3/hchr7 tumors obtained after reversion to the malignant phenotype revealed a common region of loss centred around 7q31.1, supporting the TSG hypothesis. The smallest commonly deleted region was ∼1.5 Mb in size and flanked by the markers D7S486 and D7S655."

Here, the underlying mechanism behind the synthesis of the two species has been studied. By expressing cDNAs truncated at their 5’ end, we found that the synthesis of the more slowly migrating form, called p15.5INK4B, is dependent on a sequence upstream of the first AUG codon thought to initiate translation of p15INK4B. Two potential, in frame, alternative upstream initiation codons, ACG and GUG, were individually changed to GCA encoding alanine. Analysis by in vitro translation, or immunoblotting of lysates from transfected 293 cells, showed that translation of p15.5INK4B is initiated at the GUG located 13 codons upstream of the first AUG. When this AUG was mutated, p15INK4B was no longer made. Instead, a shorter form, initiated at an in frame AUG located seven codons downstream, was synthesized. Finally, when both these AUGs were mutated, only p15.5INK4B was generated. Both p15INK4B and p15.5INK4B bound to CDK4 and CDK6, inhibited DNA synthesis, and caused replicative senescence of a human glioma cell line. We thus conclude that p15INK4B and p15.5INK4B, encoded by the CDKN2B gene, are functionally indistinguishable as based on these assays."
