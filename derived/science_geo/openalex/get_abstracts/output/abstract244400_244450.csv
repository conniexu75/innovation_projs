https://openalex.org/W2032011840,"MODERN surface sediments containing H2S are often coloured black by fine grained, iron monosulphide minerals such as mackinawite, Fe1+xS, and greigite, Fe3S4. The black monosulphides are thermodynamically unstable, under H2S-rich sedimentary conditions, relative to the disulphide pyrite, FeS21,2, which is not a black pigmenting agent. As a result, the black colour normally disappears with depth during diagenetic transformation to pyrite2,3. In some situations, however, such as in older buried layers of the deep water sediments of the Black Sea, the black monosulphides persist."

https://openalex.org/W2049140077,"WE have prepared in this laboratory carbon composites reinforced with carbon fibres which have flexural strengths of 120,000 to 140,000 pounds per square inch at room temperature and 125,000 to 150,000 pounds per square inch at 1,500° C (in helium). The composites are reinforced unidirectionally with carbon fibres which make up 75–80 per cent of the total by weight. Densities range from 1.4 to 1.64 g/ml."

https://openalex.org/W2051543847,"THE recent report by Girdler et al.1 on the rift system of East Africa is of great interest because it presents a crustal model, based on new gravity observations, which suggests an intrusion of low velocity mantle material rising to the base of the sialic crust which underlies the eastern and western rift valleys of East Africa between 3° N and 9° S over an east–west width of about 1,000 km. The crustal model proposed is thus in a general way comparable with the postulated to underlie the worldwide mid-ocean ridge2 and the Upper Rhinegraben3. Studies of seismicity, age of faulting, age of volcanoes and short and long wavelength gravity anomalies are interpreted by the authors as indicating attenuation of the African crustal plate and the early stages of its breakup. The structural behaviour of East Africa is compared with the conveyor belt mechanism of sea floor spreading from mid-ocean ridges as recently reviewed by Vine4 and rates of movement away from the rift axis of 0.5–2.0 cm yr−1 are said to be indicated."

https://openalex.org/W2075645252,"SEVERAL observers have reported essentially continuous radiation from Jupiter at low frequencies. Dulk and Clark1 believe Jupiter to be continuously emitting weak radiation at and below 10 MHz. They found the minimum flux at 10 MHz to be 5 × 10−23 W m−2 Hz−1 on all but one occasion. McCulloch and Ellis2 measured a mean flux of 10−21 w m−2 Hz−1 at 4.7 MHz although it was frequently below this level. They remark that at low frequencies weak radiation from Jupiter is nearly always present. Slysh3 proposed that the intense, constant radiation observed at 200 kHz from several spacecraft was chiefly of Jovian origin. He suggested that a spectral index of 2.5 may hold from 0.20 to 20 MHz. If this were correct it should be possible to detect the Jovian continuum with the Radio Astronomy Explorer satellite (RAE–I)."

https://openalex.org/W1975461193,"FOR several years, in publications dealing with Alaskan biostratigraphy, an Early Albian age has been attributed to the Gaudryina tailleuri faunal zone1–3 of Alaska. The zone has, in fact, been equated with the whole of the Early Albian and the zone fossil G. tailleuri considered to be an Early Albian index form with restricted range."
