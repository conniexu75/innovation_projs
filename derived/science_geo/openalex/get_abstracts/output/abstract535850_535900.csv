https://openalex.org/W1019830208,"Knowing the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins is essential for developing models of the regulatory processes in biological systems and for identifying causal disease variants. Here we show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental data with 'deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1563180177,"The use of human pluripotent stem cells for in vitro disease modelling and clinical applications requires protocols that convert these cells into relevant adult cell types. Here, we report the rapid and efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. We found that GSK3 inhibition and BMP4 treatment rapidly committed pluripotent cells to a mesodermal fate and subsequent exposure to VEGF-A or PDGF-BB resulted in the differentiation of either endothelial or vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. Both protocols produced mature cells with efficiencies exceeding 80% within six days. On purification to 99% via surface markers, endothelial cells maintained their identity, as assessed by marker gene expression, and showed relevant in vitro and in vivo functionality. Global transcriptional and metabolomic analyses confirmed that the cells closely resembled their in vivo counterparts. Our results suggest that these cells could be used to faithfully model human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2173939482,"It is widely accepted that D1 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal neurons convey their information directly to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, whereas D2-expressing neurons do so indirectly via pallidal neurons. Combining optogenetics and electrophysiology, we found that this architecture does not apply to mouse nucleus accumbens projections to the ventral pallidum. Thus, current thinking attributing D1 and D2 selectivity to accumbens projections akin to dorsal striatal pathways needs to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2203677081,"We report on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 213 melanomas. Our analysis established NF1, encoding a negative regulator of RAS, as the third most frequently mutated gene in melanoma, after BRAF and NRAS. Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs. We conclude that NF1 is a key tumor suppressor lost in melanomas, and that concurrent RASopathy gene mutations may enhance its role in melanomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2237341482,"Sharp-wave ripples represent a prominent synchronous activity pattern in the mammalian hippocampus during sleep and immobility. GABAergic interneuronal types are silenced or fire during these events, but the mechanism of pyramidal cell (PC) participation remains elusive. We found opposite membrane polarization of deep (closer to stratum oriens) and superficial (closer to stratum radiatum) rat CA1 PCs during sharp-wave ripples. Using sharp and multi-site recordings in combination with neurochemical profiling, we observed a predominant inhibitory drive of deep calbindin (CB)-immunonegative PCs that contrasts with a prominent depolarization of superficial CB-immunopositive PCs. Biased contribution of perisomatic GABAergic inputs, together with suppression of CA2 PCs, may explain the selection of CA1 PCs during sharp-wave ripples. A deep-superficial gradient interacted with behavioral and spatial effects to determine cell participation during sleep and awake sharp-wave ripples in freely moving rats. Thus, the firing dynamics of hippocampal PCs are exquisitely controlled at subcellular and microcircuit levels in a cell type-selective manner."
https://openalex.org/W2215798291,"Jean-Pierre Bourquin, Martin Stanulla and colleagues report whole genome, whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of TCF3-HLF fusion–positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drug response profiling in patient-derived xenografts identified sensitivity to the BCL2-specific inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax) as a new option for treating this fatal disease. TCF3-HLF−positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is currently incurable. Using an integrated approach, we uncovered distinct mutation, gene expression and drug response profiles in TCF3-HLF−positive and treatment-responsive TCF3-PBX1−positive ALL. We identified recurrent intragenic deletions of PAX5 or VPREB1 in constellation with the fusion of TCF3 and HLF. Moreover somatic mutations in the non-translocated allele of TCF3 and a reduction of PAX5 gene dosage in TCF3-HLF ALL suggest cooperation within a restricted genetic context. The enrichment for stem cell and myeloid features in the TCF3-HLF signature may reflect reprogramming by TCF3-HLF of a lymphoid-committed cell of origin toward a hybrid, drug-resistant hematopoietic state. Drug response profiling of matched patient-derived xenografts revealed a distinct profile for TCF3-HLF ALL with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics but sensitivity to glucocorticoids, anthracyclines and agents in clinical development. Striking on-target sensitivity was achieved with the BCL2-specific inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199). This integrated approach thus provides alternative treatment options for this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W1719320297,"Humans have a capacity for hierarchical cognitive control—the ability to simultaneously control immediate actions while holding more abstract goals in mind. The authors show that neural oscillations establish dynamic communication networks within the frontal cortex and that these oscillations coordinate local neural activity with increasing cognitive control. Humans have a capacity for hierarchical cognitive control—the ability to simultaneously control immediate actions while holding more abstract goals in mind. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence suggests that hierarchical cognitive control emerges from a frontal architecture whereby prefrontal cortex coordinates neural activity in the motor cortices when abstract rules are needed to govern motor outcomes. We utilized the improved temporal resolution of human intracranial electrocorticography to investigate the mechanisms by which frontal cortical oscillatory networks communicate in support of hierarchical cognitive control. Responding according to progressively more abstract rules resulted in greater frontal network theta phase encoding (4–8 Hz) and increased prefrontal local neuronal population activity (high gamma amplitude, 80–150 Hz), which predicts trial-by-trial response times. Theta phase encoding coupled with high gamma amplitude during inter-regional information encoding, suggesting that inter-regional phase encoding is a mechanism for the dynamic instantiation of complex cognitive functions by frontal cortical subnetworks."
https://openalex.org/W1043004949,"An effective method for direct chemical control over the production of specific proteins would be widely useful. We describe small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh), a technique in which proteins are fused to a degron that removes itself in the absence of drug, resulting in the production of an untagged protein. Clinically tested HCV protease inhibitors can then block degron removal, inducing rapid degradation of subsequently synthesized copies of the protein. SMASh allows reversible and dose-dependent shutoff of various proteins in multiple mammalian cell types and in yeast. We also used SMASh to confer drug responsiveness onto an RNA virus for which no licensed inhibitors exist. As SMASh does not require the permanent fusion of a large domain, it should be useful when control over protein production with minimal structural modification is desired. Furthermore, as SMASh involves only a single genetic modification and does not rely on modulating protein-protein interactions, it should be easy to generalize to multiple biological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2259344468,"Deciphering the ways in which somatic mutations and germline susceptibility variants cooperate to promote cancer is challenging. Ewing sarcoma is characterized by fusions between EWSR1 and members of the ETS gene family, usually EWSR1-FLI1, leading to the generation of oncogenic transcription factors that bind DNA at GGAA motifs. A recent genome-wide association study identified susceptibility variants near EGR2. Here we found that EGR2 knockdown inhibited proliferation, clonogenicity and spheroidal growth in vitro and induced regression of Ewing sarcoma xenografts. Targeted germline deep sequencing of the EGR2 locus in affected subjects and controls identified 291 Ewing-associated SNPs. At rs79965208, the A risk allele connected adjacent GGAA repeats by converting an interspaced GGAT motif into a GGAA motif, thereby increasing the number of consecutive GGAA motifs and thus the EWSR1-FLI1-dependent enhancer activity of this sequence, with epigenetic characteristics of an active regulatory element. EWSR1-FLI1 preferentially bound to the A risk allele, which increased global and allele-specific EGR2 expression. Collectively, our findings establish cooperation between a dominant oncogene and a susceptibility variant that regulates a major driver of Ewing sarcomagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2214711630,"The function of the majority of genes in the mouse and human genomes remains unknown. The mouse embryonic stem cell knockout resource provides a basis for the characterization of relationships between genes and phenotypes. The EUMODIC consortium developed and validated robust methodologies for the broad-based phenotyping of knockouts through a pipeline comprising 20 disease-oriented platforms. We developed new statistical methods for pipeline design and data analysis aimed at detecting reproducible phenotypes with high power. We acquired phenotype data from 449 mutant alleles, representing 320 unique genes, of which half had no previous functional annotation. We captured data from over 27,000 mice, finding that 83% of the mutant lines are phenodeviant, with 65% demonstrating pleiotropy. Surprisingly, we found significant differences in phenotype annotation according to zygosity. New phenotypes were uncovered for many genes with previously unknown function, providing a powerful basis for hypothesis generation and further investigation in diverse systems."
https://openalex.org/W1017678247,"The authors show that the neuron-specific LSD1 variant (LSD1n) promotes transcription initiation and elongation in response to neuronal activity. LSD1n is essential for spatial learning and long-term memory formation. LSD1n exhibits novel substrate specificity for histone H4 K20 methylation. We found that a neuron-specific isoform of LSD1, LSD1n, which results from an alternative splicing event, acquires a new substrate specificity, targeting histone H4 Lys20 methylation, both in vitro and in vivo. Selective genetic ablation of LSD1n led to deficits in spatial learning and memory, revealing the functional importance of LSD1n in neuronal activity–regulated transcription that is necessary for long-term memory formation. LSD1n occupied neuronal gene enhancers, promoters and transcribed coding regions, and was required for transcription initiation and elongation steps in response to neuronal activity, indicating the crucial role of H4K20 methylation in coordinating gene transcription with neuronal function. Our results indicate that this alternative splicing of LSD1 in neurons, which was associated with altered substrate specificity, serves as a mechanism acquired by neurons to achieve more precise control of gene expression in the complex processes underlying learning and memory."

Synaptic cell-adhesion molecules play critical roles in establishing and restructuring synaptic connections throughout life. Neurexins are evolutionarily conserved presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that engage in trans-synaptic interactions with multifarious postsynaptic ligands, including neuroligins (NLs), cerebellins, and LRRTMs (Krueger et al., 2012Krueger D.D.

In mammals, neurexins are encoded by three genes, each of which contains independent promoters for longer α- and shorter β-neurexins (Rowen et al., 2002Rowen L. Young J. Birditt B. Kaur A. Madan A.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992PubMed Google Scholar). β-neurexins are N-terminally truncated versions of α-neurexins that contain only a short (∼40 residues) β-specific N-terminal sequence that then splices into the middle of the α-neurexin sequences (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A.

Südhof T.C. α-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.Nature. 2003; 423: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, only a limited understanding of α-neurexin functions is available, and little is known about β-neurexins. The lack of information on β-neurexin functions is particularly striking because nearly all biochemical studies on neurexins were performed with β-neurexins. Elucidating the synaptic actions of neurexins is a major technical challenge given their diversity and complexity. This challenge has taken on added importance given that hundreds of neurexin mutations were associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders (Südhof, 2008Südhof T.C. Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, Bang and Owczarek, 2013Bang M.L. Owczarek S.

Balance within the neurexin trans-synaptic connexus stabilizes behavioral control.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To specifically assess the function of β-neurexins, we generated mutant mice carrying conditional KO (cKO) alleles of all three β-neurexins. Despite a low abundance of β-neurexin transcripts, we found that KO of β-neurexins in cultured neurons in vitro and in hippocampus in vivo impaired neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses. Surprisingly, this decrease was due, at least in part, to enhanced tonic activation of presynaptic CB1-receptors (CB1Rs), caused by increased postsynaptic synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Moreover, synapses of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells onto pyramidal neurons in the subiculum—the major output pathway of the hippocampus—were differentially regulated by endocannabinoids, and deletion of β-neurexins selectively impaired the function of the more strongly endocannabinoid-regulated synapses in the subiculum. The importance of this circuit-specific synaptic alteration emerged from behavioral studies, showing that the β-neurexin KO in the adult CA1 region produced an impairment of contextual fear memory. Thus, β-neurexins are produced as minor transcripts of neurexin genes that nevertheless are essential for the regulation of mammalian synaptic circuits due to modulation of endocannabinoid signaling via an unanticipated trans-synaptic mechanism. Using qRT-PCR, we found that throughout the brain, all three β-neurexins were expressed at levels 10- to 100-fold lower than are corresponding α-neurexins (Figures 1A and S1). Despite their low abundance, however, β-neurexins are highly conserved and might still perform essential functions. To test this hypothesis, we generated conditional and constitutive KO mice of all β-neurexin genes (Figures 1B and S2A–S2C ). In these mice, the 5′ exon that encodes the N-terminal β-neurexin-specific sequences was flanked by loxP sites, and epitope tags were inserted into the β-neurexin-specific sequences (EGFP for neurexin-1β and -3β; a hemagglutinin [HA] tag for neurexin-2β). We generated single-, double-, and triple-conditional and constitutive β-neurexin KO mice (see the Experimental Procedures for details) and focused our analyses on triple-mutant mice, targeting all β-neurexins to brace for potential redundancies among β-neurexins.Figure S1Expression Levels of α- and β-Neurexin mRNAs in Different Brain Regions Displayed as a Percentage of GAPDH Expression Levels, Related to Figure 1Show full captionmRNA levels were quantified in various brain regions of P30 mice using qRT-PCR.

For the summary graphs, statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001). Conditional triple KO (cKO) mice were viable and fertile. The EGFP and HA tags did not alter expression of either α- or β-neurexin mRNAs (Figures S2D and S2E). Probably because of their low expression levels, tagged β-neurexins could not be detected in total brain extracts, but were readily observed after immunoprecipitations of β-neurexins with EGFP antibodies (Figure 1C). Constitutive triple-β-neurexin KO mice were also viable but were significantly smaller than wild-type mice and unable to reproduce (Figure S2F). Even single-neurexin-2β and -3β KO mice exhibited a significantly reduced body weight. Thus, β-neurexins—despite low abundance and in contrast to α-neurexins (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K. Südhof T.C. α-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.Nature. 2003; 423: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar)—are important for animal health but are not essential for animal survival. We cultured cortical neurons from triple-β-neurexin cKO mice and infected them with lentiviruses expressing active (Cre; to delete all β-neurexins) or inactive, truncated Cre-recombinase (ΔCre; as a control). β-neurexin KO neurons exhibited no change in dendritic arborization or synaptic morphology, suggesting normal neuronal development (Figures 1D, 1E, S3, and S4A–S4E). We evoked action potential-induced excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively; Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+ channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144: 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and separately monitored pharmacologically isolated AMPA-receptor (AMPAR)- and NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs and GABA-receptor (GABAR)-mediated IPSCs. Strikingly, the β-neurexin KO decreased both AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs by ∼50%, but had no effect on GABAR-mediated IPSCs (Figures 1F–1H). These results suggest that the β-neurexin KO caused a decrease in the probability of glutamate release at excitatory synapses. To directly test this hypothesis, we measured presynaptic release probability using the progressive use-dependent block of evoked NMDAR EPSCs by MK-801 (Hessler et al., 1993Hessler N.A. Shirke A.M. Malinow R. The probability of transmitter release at a mammalian central synapse.Nature. 1993; 366: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, Rosenmund et al., 1993Rosenmund C. Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nonuniform probability of glutamate release at a hippocampal synapse.Science. 1993; 262: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We observed in triple-β-neurexin KO neurons a robust, ∼2-fold decrease in the rate of synaptic NMDAR inactivation in the presence of MK-801, suggesting an ∼2-fold decrease in release probability (Figure 1I). This decrease was not due to a change in the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles because the β-neurexin deletion had no effect on hypertonic sucrose-evoked EPSCs (Figure 1J). The electrophysiological data suggest that β-neurexins are required for normal coupling at excitatory synapses of an action potential to Ca2+-triggered release, possibly because voltage-gated Ca2+ influx is impaired. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a chimeric protein (GCaMP5G-Syb2) containing an N-terminal GCaMP5G Ca2+ indicator fused to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin-2 (Figure 2A). After lentiviral expression in neurons, GCaMP5G-Syb2 was efficiently targeted to presynaptic terminals (Figure 2B). To restrict analyses of presynaptic Ca2+ transients to excitatory synapses, we sparsely transfected neurons with mCherry and monitored action potential-elicited Ca2+ transients only in presynaptic boutons contacting postsynaptic dendritic spines (Figure 2B). Electrical-field stimulation (1–100 stimuli at 50 Hz) elicited robust Ca2+-induced fluorescence signals in these boutons that saturated after ∼20 stimuli, consistent with accumulation of residual Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals during stimulus trains (Figures 2B and 2C). Ca2+ signals were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX), confirming that they were induced by action potential-stimulated Ca2+ influx. For analyses, we normalized the Ca2+-induced fluorescence signals to the maximal fluorescence change induced by 100 stimuli (ΔFsat), which saturates the GCaMP5G-Syb2 Ca2+ sensor. We then used GCaMP5G-Syb2 to analyze Ca2+ transients in β-neurexin KO and control neurons. Ca2+ influx was induced by 1–10 action potential stimuli in the linear range of our Ca2+ sensor (Figure 2C). We found that KO of β-neurexins significantly attenuated action potential-induced Ca2+-transients, with an overall ∼2-fold decrease (Figures 2D and 2E). KO of β-neurexins had no effect on presynaptic levels of voltage-gated N- or P/Q-type Ca2+-channels, suggesting a functional impairment (Figures 2F and S4F–S4H ). Viewed together, these data show that the β-neurexin KO causes a ∼2-fold decrease in three excitatory synapse parameters: EPSC amplitude, release probability, and action-potential-induced Ca2+ influx. This suggests that β-neurexins, despite their low abundance compared to α-neurexins, are selectively essential for normal action-potential gated Ca2+ influx during neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses. Neurotransmitter release occurs at synapses not only in response to action potentials but also as spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) or miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) that are largely dependent on intracellular Ca2+ (Xu et al., 2009Xu J. Pang Z.P. Shin O.H. Südhof T.C. Synaptotagmin-1 functions as a Ca2+ sensor for spontaneous release.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The β-neurexin KO substantially depressed the mEPSC frequency (∼2-fold), slightly decreased the mEPSC amplitude, and lowered the surface levels of GluA1 AMPARs (Figures 3A, 3B, S4I, and S4J). However, β-neurexin KO had no effect on mIPSC frequency and amplitude (Figures 3C and 3D), consistent with the selective suppression of the presynaptic release probability by the β-neurexin KO in excitatory, but not in inhibitory, synapses. To validate the specificity of the β-neurexin KO effects on neurotransmitter release, we used “mini” release as a measure of release probability and tested the ability of neurexin-1β containing or lacking an insert in splice site #4 (SS4) and of neurexin-1α lacking an insert in SS4 to rescue the phenotype. Only neurexin-1β lacking an insert in SS4 rescued the decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission in β-neurexin KO neurons (Figures 3E and 3F). Neurexin-1β lacking an insert in SS4 also enhanced mEPSC amplitude, probably because this neurexin splice variant stabilizes postsynaptic AMPARs (Aoto et al., 2013Aoto J. Martinelli D.C. Malenka R.C.

Presynaptic neurexin-3 alternative splicing trans-synaptically controls postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafficking.Cell. 2013; 154: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The SS4-dependent rescue of the triple-β-neurexin KO phenotype not only validates its overall specificity but also suggests that β-neurexins control synaptic strength via a specific interaction with postsynaptic ligands that do not bind to α-neurexins. Alternative splicing at SS4 dramatically influences neurexin binding to postsynaptic ligands (Boucard et al., 2005Boucard A.A. Chubykin A.A. Comoletti D. Taylor P. Südhof T.C.

Indeed, we observed that at least some neuroligin-1 splice variants specifically bind only to β-neurexins, but not to α-neurexins lacking an insert in SS4 (Figure S5I). How might deletion of β-neurexins influence presynaptic Ca2+ influx? A hint derives from the synaptic dysfunction caused by the neuroligin-3 KO, a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule that binds to presynaptic neurexins (Südhof, 2008Südhof T.C. Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar).

Regulatory network analysis of translatome libraries from dopaminergic neurons under degenerative stress facilitated the identification of intrinsic upstream regulators that oppose degeneration. This strategy can be generalized to investigate degeneration of other classes of neurons. For degenerative disorders of the CNS, the main obstacle to therapeutic advancement has been the challenge of identifying the key molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal loss. We developed a combinatorial approach including translational profiling and brain regulatory network analysis to search for key determinants of neuronal survival or death. Following the generation of transgenic mice for cell type–specific profiling of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, we established and compared translatome libraries reflecting the molecular signature of these cells at baseline or under degenerative stress. Analysis of these libraries by interrogating a context-specific brain regulatory network led to the identification of a repertoire of intrinsic upstream regulators that drive the dopaminergic stress response. The altered activity of these regulators was not associated with changes in their expression levels. This strategy can be generalized for the identification of molecular determinants involved in the degeneration of other classes of neurons."

In Europe, the Puumala virus (PUUV) causes nephropathia epidemica in humans. In this study we investigated complex interrelations within the epidemic system of PUUV and its rodent host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). We suggest that beech fructification and bank vole abundance are both decisive factors affecting human PUUV infections. While rodent host dynamics are expected to be directly linked to human PUUV infections, beech fructification is a rather indirect predictor by serving as food source for PUUV rodent hosts. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of bank vole abundance on beech fructification. We analysed a 12-year (2001-2012) time series of the parameters: beech fructification (as food resource for the PUUV host), bank vole abundance and human incidences from 7 Federal States of Germany. For the first time, we could show the direct interrelation between these three parameters involved in human PUUV epidemics and we were able to demonstrate on a large scale that human PUUV infections are highly correlated with bank vole abundance in the present year, as well as beech fructification in the previous year. By using beech fructification and bank vole abundance as predictors in one model we significantly improved the degree of explanation of human PUUV incidence. Federal State was included as random factor because human PUUV incidence varies considerably among states. Surprisingly, the effect of rodent abundance on human PUUV infections is less strong compared to the indirect effect of beech fructification. Our findings are useful to facilitate the development of predictive models for host population dynamics and the related PUUV infection risk for humans and can be used for plant protection and human health protection purposes."

This study investigated the clinical characteristics and change of renal function to identify the risk factors for development of AKI in UTI patients. This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center. From January 2006 to January 2013, a total of 790 UTI patients necessitating hospital admission were included for final analysis. Their demographic and clinical characteristics and comorbidities were collected and compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors for AKI in UTI patients. There were 97 (12.3%) patients developing AKI during hospitalization.

https://openalex.org/W1543070703,"Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite that can cause severe diarrhea in a wide range of vertebrates including humans, is increasingly recognized as a parasite of a diverse range of wildlife species. However, little data are available regarding the identification of Cryptosporidium species and genotypes in wild aquatic environments, and more particularly in edible freshwater fish. To evaluate the prevalence of Cryptosporidiumspp. in fish from Lake Geneva (Lac Léman) in France, 41 entire fish and 100 fillets (cuts of fish flesh) were collected from fishery suppliers around the lake. Nested PCR using degenerate primers followed by sequence analysis was used. Five fish species were identified as potential hosts of Cryptosporidium: Salvelinus alpinus, Esox lucius, Coregonus lavaretus, Perca fluviatilis, and Rutilus rutilus. The presence of Cryptosporidium spp. was found in 15 out of 41 fish (37%), distributed as follows: 13 (87%) C. parvum, 1 (7%) C. molnari, and 1 (7%) mixed infection (C. parvum and C. molnari). C. molnari was identified in the stomach, while C. parvum was found in the stomach and intestine. C. molnari was also detected in 1 out of 100 analyzed fillets. In order to identify Cryptosporidium subtypes, sequencing of the highly polymorphic 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) was performed. Among the C. parvum positive samples, three gp60 subtypes were identified: IIaA15G2R1, IIaA16G2R1, and IIaA17G2R1. Histological examination confirmed the presence of potential developmental stages of C. parvum within digestive epithelial cells. These observations suggest that C. parvum is infecting fish, rather than being passively carried. Since C. parvum is a zoonotic species, fish potentially contaminated by the same subtypes found in terrestrial mammals would be an additional source of infection for humans and animals, and may also contribute to the contamination of the environment with this parasite. Moreover, the risk of human transmission is strengthened by the observation of edible fillet contamination."

The aims of the current study were to calibrate the parameters of these items using an item response theory (IRT) model, to evaluate the cross-cultural validity of the Dutch-Flemish translations compared to the original English items, and to evaluate their reliability and construct validity. The 40 items in the bank were completed by 1085 Dutch chronic pain patients. Before calibrating the items, IRT model assumptions were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Items were calibrated using the graded response model (GRM), an IRT model appropriate for items with more than two response options. To evaluate cross-cultural validity, differential item functioning (DIF) for language (Dutch vs. English) was examined. Reliability was evaluated based on standard errors and Cronbach’s alpha. To evaluate construct validity correlations with scores on legacy instruments (e.g., the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire) were calculated. Unidimensionality of the Dutch-Flemish PROMIS Pain Interference item bank was supported by CFA tests of model fit (CFI = 0.986, TLI = 0.986). Furthermore, the data fit the GRM and showed good coverage across the pain interference continuum (threshold-parameters range: -3.04 to 3.44). The Dutch-Flemish PROMIS Pain Interference item bank has good cross-cultural validity (only two out of 40 items showing DIF), good reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.98), and good construct validity (Pearson correlations between 0.62 and 0.75).

https://openalex.org/W1538881391,"The activation of astrocytes and microglia is often associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Understanding how activation alters the transcriptome of these cells may offer valuable insight regarding how activation of these cells mediate neurological damage. Furthermore, identifying common and unique pathways of gene expression during activation may provide new insight into the distinct roles these cells have in the CNS during infection and inflammation. Since recent studies indicate that TLR7 recognizes not only viral RNA but also microRNAs that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases, we first examined the response of glial cells to TLR7 stimulation using microarray analysis. Microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to TLR7 activation than astrocytes, both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction. Although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses, microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation, while astrocytes did not. Targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mRNA, including Ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the CNS. In addition, other genes including Birc3 and Gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences AW112010 and BC023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the CNS following virus infection.

https://openalex.org/W1715353993,"Although it is known that the centrioles play instructive roles in pericentriolar material (PCM) assembly and that the PCM is essential for proper centriole formation, the mechanism that governs centriole-PCM interaction is poorly understood. Here, we show that ATF5 forms a characteristic 9-fold symmetrical ring structure in the inner layer of the PCM outfitting the proximal end of the mother centriole. ATF5 controls the centriole-PCM interaction in a cell-cycle- and centriole-age-dependent manner. Interaction of ATF5 with polyglutamylated tubulin (PGT) on the mother centriole and with PCNT in the PCM renders ATF5 as a required molecule in mother centriole-directed PCM accumulation and in PCM-dependent centriole formation. ATF5 depletion blocks PCM accumulation at the centrosome and causes fragmentation of centrioles, leading to the formation of multi-polar mitotic spindles and genomic instability. These data show that ATF5 is an essential structural protein that is required for the interaction between the mother centriole and the PCM."

Methods Patients undergoing Total Hip and Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA and TKA) (Total N = 361; 182 THA; 179 TKA), completed the Life Orientation Test-Revised for optimism and pessimism, the Hope Scale, the Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire for treatment credibility and treatment expectancy. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine whether the instruments measure distinct constructs. Four theory-driven models with one, two, four and five latent factors were evaluated using multiple fit indices and Δχ2 tests, followed by some posthoc models. Results The results of the theory driven confirmatory factor analysis showed that a five factor model in which all constructs loaded on separate factors yielded the most optimal and satisfactory fit. Posthoc, a bifactor model in which (besides the 5 separate factors) a general factor is hypothesized accounting for the commonality of the items showed a significantly better fit than the five factor model. All specific factors, except for the hope factor, showed to explain a substantial amount of variance beyond the general factor. Conclusion Based on our primary analyses we conclude that optimism, pessimism, hope, treatment credibility and treatment expectancy are distinguishable in THA and TKA patients. Postdoc, we determined that all constructs, except hope, showed substantial specific variance, while also sharing some general variance."
https://openalex.org/W1914071738,"This study examines whether non-tone language listeners can acquire lexical tone categories distributionally and whether attention in the training phase modulates the effect of distributional learning. Native Australian English listeners were trained on a Thai lexical tone minimal pair and their performance was assessed using a discrimination task before and after training. During Training, participants either heard a Unimodal distribution that would induce a single central category, which should hinder their discrimination of that minimal pair, or a Bimodal distribution that would induce two separate categories that should facilitate their discrimination. The participants either heard the distribution passively (Experiments 1A and 1B) or performed a cover task during training designed to encourage auditory attention to the entire distribution (Experiment 2). In passive listening (Experiments 1A and 1B), results indicated no effect of distributional learning: the Bimodal group did not outperform the Unimodal group in discriminating the Thai tone minimal pairs. Moreover, both Unimodal and Bimodal groups improved above chance on most test aspects from Pretest to Posttest. However, when participants' auditory attention was encouraged using the cover task (Experiment 2), distributional learning was found: the Bimodal group outperformed the Unimodal group on a novel test syllable minimal pair at Posttest relative to at Pretest. Furthermore, the Bimodal group showed above-chance improvement from Pretest to Posttest on three test aspects, while the Unimodal group only showed above-chance improvement on one test aspect. These results suggest that non-tone language listeners are able to learn lexical tones distributionally but only when auditory attention is encouraged in the acquisition phase. This implies that distributional learning of lexical tones is more readily induced when participants attend carefully during training, presumably because they are better able to compute the relevant statistics of the distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2137428009,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive disease accounting for more than 260,000 cancer cases diagnosed and 128,000 deaths worldwide. A large majority of cancer deaths result from cancers that have metastasized beyond the primary tumor. The relationship between genetic changes and clinical outcome can reflect the biological events that promote cancer’s aggressive behavior, and these can serve as molecular markers for improved patient management and survival. To this end, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major process that promotes tumor invasion and metastasis, making EMT-related proteins attractive diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to study the expression of a panel of transcription factors (TWIST1, SNAI1/2, ZEB1 and ZEB2) and other genes intimately related to EMT (CDH1 and LAMC2) at the invasive tumor front of OSCC tissues. The association between the expression of these proteins and clinico-pathological parameters were examined with Pearson Chi-square and correlation with survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meier analysis. Our results demonstrate that there was a significant differential expression of CDH1, LAMC2, SNAI1/2 and TWIST1 between OSCC and normal oral mucosa (NOM). Specifically, CDH1 loss was significantly associated with Broder’s grading, while diffused LAMC2 was similarly associated with non-cohesive pattern of invasion. Notably, co-expression of TWIST1 and ZEB2 in OSCC was significantly associated with poorer overall survival, particularly in patients without detectable lymph node metastasis. This study demonstrates that EMT-related proteins are differentially expressed in OSCC and that the co-expression of TWIST1 and ZEB2 could be of clinical value in identifying patients with poor survival for appropriate patient management."

By employing retroviral (RV)-transduced overexpression of MCPIP1, we investigated the impact of MCPIP1 on viability, apoptosis, proliferation, metabolic activity, proteome, secretome and differentiation capacity of murine bone marrow (BM) - derived MSCs. MCPIP1 overexpression enhanced angiogenic and cardiac differentiation of MSCs compared with controls as indicated by elevated expression of genes accompanying angiogenesis and cardiomyogenesis in vitro. The proangiogenic activity of MCPIP1-overexpressing MSCs (MCPIP1-MSCs) was also confirmed by increased capillary-like structure formation under several culture conditions. This increase in differentiation capacity was associated with decreased proliferation of MCPIP1-MSCs when compared with controls. MCPIP1-MSCs also expressed increased levels of proteins involved in angiogenesis, autophagy, and induction of differentiation, but not adverse inflammatory agents. We conclude that MCPIP1 enhances endothelial and cardiac differentiation of MSCs. Thus, modulating MCPIP1 expression may be a novel approach useful for enhancing the immune-regulatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and regenerative capacity of BM-derived MSCs for myocardial repair and regeneration of ischemic tissues."

In both comparisons, there were significant increases in all 3 indices with the increase of liver fibrosis grade as assessed in liver biopsy specimens. All 3 indices at the time of second biopsy were able to predict moderate to advanced (METAVIR score F2-4) and advanced (F3-4) fibrosis on liver biopsy, with the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve >0.8 and the accuracy >70%.

Knock-down of TRMT112 expression decreased the WBSCR22 protein level in mammalian cells, suggesting that the stability of WBSCR22 is regulated through the interaction with TRMT112. The localization of the TRMT112 protein is determined by WBSCR22, and the WBSCR22-TRMT112 complex is localized in the cell nucleus. We provide evidence that the interaction between WBSCR22/Bud23 and TRMT112/Trm112 is conserved between mammals and yeast, suggesting that the function of TRMT112 as a co-activator of methyltransferases is evolutionarily conserved. Finally, we show that the transiently expressed WBSCR22 protein is ubiquitinated and degraded through the proteasome pathway, revealing the tight control of the WBSCR22 protein level in the cells."

The increased protein level of PDIA3 was detected via immunoblotting analysis in the fat loaded cell models of NAFLD. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDIA3 in L02 cells not only increased the cellular lipid accumulation, but also exacerbated hepatocytes apoptosis induced by sodium palmitate. Further investigation revealed that knockdown of PDIA3 up-regulated protein expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a key enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis. PDIA3 knockdown also up-regulated key molecules of ERS pathway, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), phospho-PKR-like ER kinase (p-PERK), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Our results suggested that ER chaperone PDIA3 plays a pivotal role in FFA-induced hepatocyte steatosis and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W963833263,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment modality in which a photosensitizing dye is administered and exposed to light to kill tumor cells via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A fundamental obstacle for PDT is the low specificity for staining solid tumors with dyes. Recently, a tumor targeting system guided by anaerobic bacteria was proposed for tumor imaging and treatment. Here, we explore the feasibility of the genetically encoded photosensitizer KillerRed, which is expressed in Escherichia coli, to treat tumors. Using nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), we detected a lengthy ROS diffusion from the bodies of KillerRed-expressing bacteria in vitro, which demonstrated the feasibility of using bacteria to eradicate cells in their surroundings. In nude mice, Escherichia coli (E. coli) expressing KillerRed (KR-E. coli) were subcutaneously injected into xenografts comprising CNE2 cells, a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, and HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma cell line. KR-E. coli seemed to proliferate rapidly in the tumors as observed under an imaging system. When the intensity of fluorescence increased and the fluorescent area became as large as the tumor one day after KR-E. coli injection, the KR-E. coli-bearing tumor was irradiated with an orange light (λ = 540-580 nm). In all cases, the tumors became necrotic the next day and were completely eliminated in a few days. No necrosis was observed after the irradiation of tumors injected with a vehicle solution or a vehicle carrying the E. coli without KillerRed. In successfully treated mice, no tumor recurrence was observed for more than two months. E. coli genetically engineered for KillerRed expression are highly promising for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors when the use of bacteria in patients is cleared for infection safety."
https://openalex.org/W1889399788,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, as a common form of PE, the etiology of late-onset PE is elusive. We analyzed 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels in the placentas of late-onset severe PE patients (n = 4) and normal controls (n = 4) using a (hydroxy)methylated DNA immunoprecipitation approach combined with deep sequencing ([h]MeDIP-seq), and the results were verified by (h)MeDIP-qPCR. The most significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were verified by MassARRAY EppiTYPER in an enlarged sample size (n = 20). Bioinformatics analysis identified 714 peaks of 5mC that were associated with 403 genes and 119 peaks of 5hmC that were associated with 61 genes, thus showing significant differences between the PE patients and the controls (>2-fold, p<0.05). Further, only one gene, PTPRN2, had both 5mC and 5hmC changes in patients. The ErbB signaling pathway was enriched in those 403 genes that had significantly different5mC level between the groups. This genome-wide mapping of 5mC and 5hmC in late-onset severe PE and normal controls demonstrates that both 5mC and 5hmC play epigenetic roles in the regulation of the disease, but work independently. We reveal the genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation in late-onset PE placentas for the first time, and the identified ErbB signaling pathway and the gene PTPRN2 may be relevant to the epigenetic pathogenesis of late-onset PE."
https://openalex.org/W2120134743,"Background People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are encouraged to engage in exercise programs but an increased experience of fatigue may impede sustained participation in training sessions. A high number of movements is, however, needed for obtaining optimal improvements after rehabilitation. Methods This cross-sectional study investigated whether people with MS show abnormal fatigability during a robot-mediated upper limb movement trial. Sixteen people with MS and sixteen healthy controls performed five times three minutes of repetitive shoulder anteflexion movements. Movement performance, maximal strength, subjective upper limb fatigue and surface electromyography (median frequency and root mean square of the amplitude of the electromyography (EMG) signal of the anterior deltoid) were recorded during or in-between these exercises. After fifteen minutes of rest, one extra movement bout was performed to investigate how rest influences performance. Results A fifteen minutes upper limb movement protocol increased the perceived upper limb fatigue and induced muscle fatigue, given a decline in maximal anteflexion strength and changes of both the amplitude and the median frequency of EMG the anterior deltoid. In contrast, performance during the 3 minutes of anteflexion movements did not decline. There was no relation between changes in subjective fatigue and the changes in the amplitude and the median frequency of the anterior deltoid muscle, however, there was a correlation between the changes in subjective fatigue and changes in strength in people with MS. People with MS with upper limb weakness report more fatigue due to the repetitive movements, than people with MS with normal upper limb strength, who are comparable to healthy controls. The weak group could, however, keep up performance during the 15 minutes of repetitive movements. Discussion and Conclusion Albeit a protocol of repetitive shoulder anteflexion movements did not elicit a performance decline, fatigue feelings clearly increased in both healthy controls and people with MS, with the largest increase in people with MS with upper limb weakness. Objective fatigability was present in both groups with a decline in the muscle strength and increase of muscle fatigue, shown by changes in the EMG parameters. However, although weak people with multiple sclerosis experienced more fatigue, the objective signs of fatigability were less obvious in weak people with MS, perhaps because this subgroup has central limiting factors, which influence performance from the start of the movements."
https://openalex.org/W1504768987,"Understanding contributors to mortality during the initial phase of tuberculosis (TB) treatment in patients co-infected with HIV would guide targeted interventions to improve survival. The aim of this study was to ascertain the incidence of death during the initial 2 months (new cases) and 3 months (retreatment cases) of TB treatment and to assess correlates of mortality in HIV co-infected patients.We conducted a hospital-based retrospective cohort study from January 2006 to December 2013 at Yaoundé Central Hospital, Cameroon. We reviewed medical records to identify co-infected TB/HIV inpatients aged 15 years and older who died during TB treatment. Death was defined as any death occurring during TB treatment, as per World Health Organization recommendations. We collected socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory data. We conducted multivariable logistic binary regression analysis to identify factors associated with death during the intensive phase of TB treatment. Magnitudes of associations were expressed by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The 99 patients enrolled had a mean age of 39.5 (standard deviation 10.9) years and 53% were male. Patients were followed for 276.3 person-months of observation (PMO). Forty nine patients were died during intensive phase of TB treatment. Death incidence during the intensive phase of TB treatment was 32.2 per 100 PMO. Having a non-AIDS comorbidity (aOR 2.47, 95%CI 1.22-5.02, p = 0.012), having extra-pulmonary TB (aOR 1.89, 95%CI 1.05-3.43, p = 0.035), and one year increase in duration of known HIV infection (aOR 1.23, 95%CI 1.004-1.49) were independently associated with death during the intensive phase of TB treatment.Mortality incidence during intensive phase of TB treatment was high among TB/HIV co-infected patients during TB treatment; and strongly associated with extra pulmonary TB suggesting advanced stage of immunosuppression and non-AIDS comorbidities. Early HIV diagnosis and care and good management of non-comorbidities can reduce this incidence."
https://openalex.org/W977756494,"Several aspects of the human nervous system and associated motor and cognitive processes have been reported to be modulated by extremely low-frequency (ELF, < 300 Hz) time-varying Magnetic Fields (MF). Due do their worldwide prevalence; power-line frequencies (60 Hz in North America) are of particular interest. Despite intense research efforts over the last few decades, the potential effects of 60 Hz MF still need to be elucidated, and the underlying mechanisms to be understood. In this study, we have used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize potential changes in functional brain activation following human exposure to a 60 Hz MF through motor and cognitive tasks. First, pilot results acquired in a first set of subjects (N=9) were used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using fMRI to detect subtle changes in functional brain activation with 60 Hz MF exposure at 1800 μT. Second, a full study involving a larger cohort of subjects tested brain activation during 1) a finger tapping task (N=20), and 2) a mental rotation task (N=21); before and after a one-hour, 60 Hz, 3000 μT MF exposure. The results indicate significant changes in task-induced functional brain activation as a consequence of MF exposure. However, no impact on task performance was found. These results illustrate the potential of using fMRI to identify MF-induced changes in functional brain activation, suggesting that a one-hour 60 Hz, 3000 μT MF exposure can modulate activity in specific brain regions after the end of the exposure period (i.e., residual effects). We discuss the possibility that MF exposure at 60 Hz, 3000 μT may be capable of modulating cortical excitability via a modulation of synaptic plasticity processes."
https://openalex.org/W1893826083,"Unlike the well-established association between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and chronic heart failure, the relationship between SDB and severe aortic stenosis (AS) is not well investigated. Given the increasing prevalence of AS, and the improving prognosis of high risk AS patients attributable to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), the prevalence and impact of SDB needs to be better understood.In this study, 140 patients with severe AS underwent polygraphy prior to TAVI. Clinical and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Patients were followed for 573±405 days. We found that 99/140 patients (71%) had SDB with a mean apnoea-hypopnoea-index of 24±17/h. SDB was mild in 27%, moderate in 23% and severe in 21% of patients. In addition, 35 patients (25%) had obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), whereas 64 patients (46%) had central sleep apnoea (CSA). Patients with OSA had predominantly mild SDB (20/38 pts.), and patients with CSA mostly had severe SDB (24/29 pts.). The prevalence and distribution of OSA and CSA were independent of left ventricular function. Overall, 1 and 2 year survival rates (74% and 71%, resp.) did not differ significantly between patients without SDB or those with OSA and CSA (p=0.81).SDB, with a preponderance of CSA, was found to be highly prevalent in patients with high-grade AS scheduled for TAVI. SDB prevalence was independent of left ventricular function. Mortality after TAVI was not influenced by the type or severity of SDB."
https://openalex.org/W942264992,"In the Laurentian Great Lakes region, the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) has seen a thousand-fold population increase in recent decades. These large colonies of birds now often conflict with socioeconomic interests, particularly due to perceived competition with fisheries and the destruction of terrestrial vegetation in nesting habitats. Here we use dated sediment cores from ponds on islands in eastern Lake Ontario that receive waste inputs from dense colonies of cormorants and ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) to chronicle the population rise of these species and assess their long-term ecological impacts. Modern water chemistry sampling from these sites reveals drastically elevated nutrient and major ion concentrations compared to reference ponds not influenced by waterbirds. Geochemical tracers in dated sediment cores, particularly δ15N and chlorophyll-a concentrations, track waterbird influences over time. Fossil diatom assemblages were dominated by species tolerant of hyper-eutrophic and polluted systems, which is in marked contrast to assemblages in reference sites. In addition to establishing long-term ecological impacts, this multi-proxy paleoecological approach can be used to determine whether islands of concern have been long-term nesting sites or were only recently colonized by cormorant or ring-billed gull populations across the Great Lakes, facilitating informed management decisions about controversial culling programs."
https://openalex.org/W1492987316,"Background Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) has been implicated in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) but the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the involvement of epigenetic alteration of miRNA genes in GISTs. Methods GIST-T1 cells were treated with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), after which miRNA expression profiles were analyzed using TaqMan miRNA arrays. DNA methylation was then analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing. The functions of miRNAs were examined using MTT assays, wound-healing assays, Boyden chamber assays and Matrigel invasion assays. Gene expression microarrays were analyzed to assess effect of ectopic miRNA expression in GIST-T1 cells. Results Of the 754 miRNAs analyzed, 61 were significantly upregulated in GIST-T1 cells treated with 5-aza-dC plus PBA. Among those, 21 miRNA genes were associated with an upstream CpG island (CGI), and the CGIs of miR-34a and miR-335 were frequently methylated in GIST-T1 cells and primary GIST specimens. Transfection of miR-34a or miR-335 mimic molecules into GIST-T1 cells suppressed cell proliferation, and miR-34a also inhibited migration and invasion by GIST-T1 cells. Moreover, miR-34a downregulated a number of predicted target genes, including PDGFRA. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of PDGFRA in GIST-T1 cells suppressed cell proliferation, suggesting the tumor suppressive effect of miR-34a is mediated, at least in part, through targeting PDGFRA. Conclusions Our results suggest that miR-34a and miR-335 are candidate tumor suppressive miRNAs in GISTs, and that they are frequent targets of epigenetic silencing in GISTs."

To determine the effective arrangement of bus-only lanes, a bi-level programming model for urban bus lane layout is developed in this study that considers accessibility and budget constraints. The goal of the upper-level model is to minimize the total travel time, and the lower-level model is a capacity-constrained traffic assignment model that describes the passenger flow assignment on bus lines, in which the priority sequence of the transfer times is reflected in the passengers' route-choice behaviors. Using the proposed bi-level programming model, optimal bus lines are selected from a set of candidate bus lines; thus, the corresponding bus lane network on which the selected bus lines run is determined. The solution method using a genetic algorithm in the bi-level programming model is developed, and two numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W1767042538,"Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) and BHMT2 convert homocysteine to methionine using betaine and S-methylmethionine, respectively, as methyl donor substrates. Increased levels of homocysteine in blood are associated with cardiovascular disease. Given their role in human health and nutrition, we identified BHMT and BHMT2 genes and proteins from 38 species of deuterostomes including human and non-human primates. We aligned the genes to look for signatures of selection, to infer evolutionary rates and events across lineages, and to identify the evolutionary timing of a gene duplication event that gave rise to two genes, BHMT and BHMT2. We found that BHMT was present in the genomes of the sea urchin, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals; BHMT2 was present only across mammals. BHMT and BHMT2 were present in tandem in the genomes of all monotreme, marsupial and placental species examined. Evolutionary rates were accelerated for BHMT2 relative to BHMT. Selective pressure varied across lineages, with the highest dN/dS ratios for BHMT and BHMT2 occurring immediately following the gene duplication event, as determined using GA Branch analysis. Nine codons were found to display signatures suggestive of positive selection; these contribute to the enzymatic or oligomerization domains, suggesting involvement in enzyme function. Gene duplication likely occurred after the divergence of mammals from other vertebrates but prior to the divergence of extant mammalian subclasses, followed by two deletions in BHMT2 that affect oligomerization and methyl donor specificity. The faster evolutionary rate of BHMT2 overall suggests that selective constraints were reduced relative to BHMT. The dN/dS ratios in both BHMT and BHMT2 was highest following the gene duplication, suggesting that purifying selection played a lesser role as the two paralogs diverged in function."
https://openalex.org/W1863236859,"Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. It is generally accepted that inflammation that occurs in response to hepatocyte infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the main mechanism that triggers myofibroblast differentiation and stimulation in chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to determine if HCV might infect human liver myofibroblasts (HLMF) and directly stimulate their fibrogenic activities.We evaluated the expression of the viral entry receptors, levels of HCV-RNA and HCV-protein and the expression of fibrosis markers in HLMF by using quantitative PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Pseudoparticles (HCVpp) and cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) were used to study the ability of HLMF to support viral entry, replication and fibrosis induction.We showed that HLMF expressed all known molecules of the HCV receptor complex, i.e. CD81, LDL-R, scavenger receptor-BI, claudin-1 and occludin. These cells were also permissive to HCVpp entry. Inoculation with HCVcc caused short-term infection of these cells, as shown by their content in positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA, in core and NS3 viral proteins, and by their release of core protein levels in the culture supernatants. HCV infection stimulated myofibroblastic differentiation, proliferation and collagen production in these cells. In addition, evidence of in vivo infection was provided by the detection of positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA in preparations of HLMF obtained from HCV-infected patients.These findings indicate that HCV infection of HLMF can occur and trigger extracellular matrix overproduction, thereby contributing to the development of HCV-related liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1836559704,"To identify whether myopia was associated with the visual field (VF) progression of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).A total of 270 eyes of 270 POAG followed up for more than 3 years with ≥9 reliable VFs by Octopus perimetry were retrospectively reviewed. Myopia was divided into: mild myopia (-2.99 diopter [D], 0), moderate myopia (-5.99, 3.00 D), marked myopia (-9.00, -6.00 D) and non-myopia (0 D or more). An annual change in the mean defect (MD) slope >0.22 dB/y and 0.30 dB/y was defined as fast progression, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to determine prognostic factors for VF progression.For the cutoff threshold at 0.22 dB/y, logistic regression showed that vertical cup-to-disk ratio (VCDR; p = 0.004) and the extent of myopia (p = 0.002) were statistically significant. When logistic regression was repeated after excluding the extent of myopia, axial length (AL; p = 0.008, odds ratio [OR] = 0.796) reached significance, as did VCDR (p = 0.001). Compared to eyes with AL≤23 mm, the OR values were 0.334 (p = 0.059), 0.309 (p = 0.044), 0.266 (p = 0.019), 0.260 (p = 0.018), respectively, for 23 <AL≤24 mm, 24 <AL≤25 mm, 25 <AL ≤26 mm, and AL>26 mm. The significance of vertical cup-to-disk ratio of (p = 0.004) and the extent of myopia (p = 0.008) did not change for the cutoff threshold at 0.30dB/y.VCDR and myopia were associated with VF prognosis of POAG. Axial myopia may be a protective factor against VF progression."
https://openalex.org/W968535857,"The key pathogenic steps leading to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disease characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration, are not fully clarified. The full-length SMN protein (FL-SMN), the main protein product of the disease gene SMN1, plays an established role in the cytoplasm in snRNP biogenesis ultimately leading to mRNA splicing within the nucleus. It is also involved in the mRNA axonal transport. However, to what extent the impairment of these two SMN functions contributes to SMA pathogenesis remains unknown. A shorter SMN isoform, axonal-SMN or a-SMN, with more specific axonal localization, has been discovered, but whether it might act in concert with FL-SMN in SMA pathogenesis is not known. As a first step in defining common or divergent intracellular roles of FL-SMN vs a-SMN proteins, we here characterized the turn-over of both proteins and investigated which pathway contributed to a-SMN degradation. We performed real time western blot and confocal immunofluorescence analysis in easily controllable in vitro settings. We analyzed co-transfected NSC34 and HeLa cells and cell clones stably expressing both a-SMN and FL-SMN proteins after specific blocking of transcript or protein synthesis and inhibition of known intracellular degradation pathways. Our data indicated that whereas the stability of both FL-SMN and a-SMN transcripts was comparable, the a-SMN protein was characterized by a much shorter half-life than FL-SMN. In addition, as already demonstrated for FL-SMN, the Ub/proteasome pathway played a major role in the a-SMN protein degradation. We hypothesize that the faster degradation rate of a-SMN vs FL-SMN is related to the protection provided by the protein complex in which FL-SMN is assembled. The diverse a-SMN vs FL-SMN C-terminus may dictate different protein interactions and complex formation explaining the different localization and role in the neuronal compartment, and the lower expression and stability of a-SMN."
https://openalex.org/W1934251452,"Continuity of care is an important quality outcome of patient care. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between personal continuity and blood pressure (BP) control among the patients with hypertension in an academic primary care centre. Between January and May 2012, we conducted a retrospective review of medical records of patients with hypertension who had been followed up for at least 1 year in the Primary Care Clinic, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia. In this setting, doctors who provided care for hypertension included postgraduate family medicine trainees, non-trainee doctors and academic staff. Systematic random sampling (1:4) was used for patient selection. BP control was defined as less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes mellitus, proteinuria and chronic kidney disease and less than 140/90 mm Hg for all other patients. Continuity of care was assessed using the usual provider continuity index (UPCI), which is the ratio of patient visits to the usual provider to the total number of visits to all providers in 1 year. A UPC index of zero denotes no continuity while an index of one reflects perfect continuity with only the usual provider. We reviewed a total of 1060 medical records. The patients’ mean age was 62.0 years (SD 10.4). The majority was women (59.2%) and married (85.7%). The mean number of visits in a year was 3.85 (SD 1.36). A total of 72 doctors had provided consultations (55 postgraduate family medicine trainees, 8 non-trainee doctors and 9 academic staff). The mean UPCI was 0.43 (SD 0.34). Target BP was achieved in 42% of the patients. There was no significant relationship between BP control and personal continuity after adjustment for total number of visits. Continuity of care was not associated with BP control in our centre. Further studies are needed to explore the reasons for this."

Although the pathophysiology of preeclampsia has not been established, placental growth factor (PlGF) is believed to be a key factor. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of maternal smoking on the PlGF expression in invasive trophoblasts at early gestation. We collected villous tissues from women requesting surgical termination due to non-medical reasons at 7-8 weeks of gestation. The maternal smoking status was evaluated by measuring the serum cotinine level and patients were divided into two groups: active smokers and non-smokers. After separating invasive trophoblasts from villous tissues cultured initially under 2% O2 for 24 hours, the separated invasive trophoblasts were cultured under 2% or 8% O2 for 48 hours. The expression levels of the PlGF gene in villous tissue specimens and in invasive trophoblasts cultured after the conditions were quantified using qRT-PCR. The levels of PlGF protein in the medium were quantified using an ELISA. The gene expression level of PlGF in the villi in the active-smokers was significantly higher than that of the non-smokers. In comparison of the invasive trophoblasts under normoxia and oxygenated conditions, the ratio of PlGF gene expression and protein expression under oxygenation (2% O2+8% O2 / 2% O2+2% O2) in the active-smokers were both significantly higher than in the non-smokers. Maternal smoking history appears to stimulate PlGF expression in invasive trophoblasts under oxygenated conditions. This may be one of several causes leading to the protective effect of maternal smoking on preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W1592864114,"Mutations in the GBA1 gene are associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease, and the protein produced by the gene, glucocerebrosidase, interacts with α-synuclein, the protein at the center of the disease etiology. One possibility is that the mutations disrupt a beneficial interaction between the proteins, and a beneficial interaction would imply that the proteins have coevolved. To explore this possibility, a correlated mutation analysis has been performed for all 72 vertebrate species where complete sequences of α-synuclein and glucocerebrosidase are known. The most highly correlated pair of residue variations is α-synuclein A53T and glucocerebrosidase G115E. Intriguingly, the A53T mutation is a Parkinson's disease risk factor in humans, suggesting the pathology associated with this mutation and interaction with glucocerebrosidase might be connected. Correlations with β-synuclein are also evaluated. To assess the impact of lowered species number on accuracy, intra and inter-chain correlations are also calculated for hemoglobin, using mutual information Z-value and direct coupling analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1619530926,"Pneumonia leads to high mortality in children under the age of five years worldwide, resulting in close to 20 percent of all deaths in this age group. Therefore, investigations into host-pathogen interactions during Streptococcus pneumoniae infection are key in devising strategies towards the development of better vaccines and drugs. To that end, in this study we investigated the role of S. pneumoniae and its surface antigen Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) in modulating the expression of co-stimulatory molecule Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on dendritic cells (DCs) and the subsequent effects of increased PD-L1 on key defence responses. Our data indicate that stimulation of DCs with PspA increases the surface expression of PD-L1 in a time and dose dependent manner. Characterization of mechanisms involved in PspA induced expression of PD-L1 indicate the involvement of Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2) and calcium homeostasis. While calcium release from intracellular stores positively regulated PD-L1 expression, calcium influx from external milieu negatively regulated PD-L1 expression. Increase in PD-L1 expression, when costimulated with PspA and through TLR2 was higher than when stimulated with PspA or through TLR2. Further, knockdown of TLR2 and the intermediates in the TLR signaling machinery pointed towards the involvement of a MyD88 dependent pathway in PspA induced PD-L1 expression. Incubation of DCs with S. pneumoniae resulted in the up-regulation of PD-L1 expression, while infection with a strain lacking surface PspA failed to do so. Our data also suggests the role of PspA in ROS generation. These results suggest a novel and specific role for PspA in modulating immune responses against S. pneumoniae by regulating PD-L1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1865244049,"Bioconjugate preparation is a fundamental step for antibody generation and immunoassay development to small chemical compounds. For analytical targets holding in their structure an aryl halogen atom, cross-coupling reactions may be a simple and efficient way to obtain functionalized derivatives; thus offering great potential to elicit robust and selective immune responses after being coupled to immunogenic carrier proteins. However, substitution of the halogen atom by an aliphatic chain might eventually compromise the affinity and specificity of the resulting antibodies. In order to address this issue, proquinazid, a new-generation fungicide with outstanding performance, was chosen as model analyte. Two functionalized derivatives differing in spacer arm rigidity were synthesized by Sonogashira cross-coupling chemistry. These haptens were covalently coupled to bovine serum albumin and the resulting immunoconjugates were employed for rabbit vaccination. Antibodies were tested for proquinazid recognition by direct and indirect competitive immunoassay, and IC50 values in the low nanomolar range were found, thus demonstrating the suitability of this straightforward synthetic strategy for the generation of immunoreagents to compounds bearing an aryl halide. Following antibody characterization, competitive immunoassays were developed and employed to determine proquinazid residues in grape musts, and their analytical performance was satisfactorily validated by comparison with GC–MS. Besides having described the development of the first immunochemical method for proquinazid analysis, an efficient functionalization approach for analytes comprising aryl halides is reported."

Two follow up studies in Swedish and Chinese replicated 15 associations. In these studies individuals were selected based on the self-reported AR, or AR/AS diagnosed using blood IgE test or skin prick test (SPT), which were performed often without restriction to specific allergens. Here we performed third replication study in Lithuanians. We used SPT and carefully selected set of allergens prevalent in Lithuania, as well as Illumina Core Exome chip for SNP detection. We genotyped 270 SPT-positive individuals (137 Betulaceae -, 174 Poaceae-, 199 Artemisia-, 70 Helianthus-, 22 Alternaria-, 22 Cladosporium-, 140 mites-, 95 cat- and 97 dog dander-sensitive cases) and 162 SPT-negative controls. We found altogether 13 known SNPs associated with AS (p ≤0.05). Three SNPs were found in Lithuanians sensitive to several allergens, and 10 SNPs were found in Lithuanians sensitive to a certain allergen. For the first time, SNP rs7775228:C was associated with patient sensitivity to dog allergens (F_A=0,269, F_U=0.180, P=0.008). Thus, careful assessment of AS allowed us to detect known genetic variants associated with AS/AR in relatively small cohort of Lithuanians."

We assessed BCG vaccine-induced cellular immune responses and determined for how long they could be detected during childhood in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Methods We assessed BCG vaccine-induced cellular immune responses by TST and IGRA (in-house ELISPOT assay) using BCG and PPD as stimulation antigen, and compared results between vaccinated and non-vaccinated schoolchildren of two age groups, 6-7 and 13-14 years old. Results Three hundred and sixty-three healthy schoolchildren were enrolled. TST was performed on 351 children and IGRA on 142. A high proportion (66%; 229/343) of the children had no TST reactivity (induration size 0 mm). TST-positive responses (≥15 mm) were more prevalent among 13-14 year-old (31.7%) than 6-7 year old (16.5%) children, both in the non-vaccinated (43% vs. 9%, p<0.001) and vaccinated (29% vs. 13%, p=0.002) subgroups. There were no significant differences in TST responses between vaccinated and non-vaccinated children in either of the age groups. The IGRA response to BCG and to PPD stimulation was not significantly different according to BCG vaccination record or to age group. A high rate (15.5%; 22/142) of indeterminate IGRA responses was observed. There was very poor agreement between TST and IGRA-PPD findings (k= 0.08) and between TST and IGRA-BCG findings (k= 0.02) Conclusion Analysis of TST and IGRA response to stimulation with BCG and PPD revealed no difference in immune response between BCG-vaccinated and non-vaccinated children; also no decrease of the BCG vaccine-induced cellular immune response over time was observed. We conclude that TST and IGRA have limitations in assessing a role of BCG or tuberculosis-related immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2260644874,"The relationship between muscle anatomy and physiology and its corresponding electromyography activity (EMGA) is complex and not well understood. EMGA models may be broadly divided in stochastic and motor-unit-based models. For example, these models have successfully described many muscle physiological variables such as the value of the muscle fiber velocity and the linear relationship between median frequency and muscle fiber velocity. However they cannot explain the behavior of many of these variables with changes in intramuscular temperature, or muscle PH acidity, for instance. Here, we propose that the motor unit action potential can be treated as an electromagnetic resonant mode confined at thermal equilibrium inside the muscle. The motor units comprising the muscle form a system of standing waves or modes, where the energy of each mode is proportional to its frequency. Therefore, the power spectral density of the EMGA is well described and fit by Planck's law and from its distribution we developed theoretical relationships that explain the behavior of known physiological variables with changes in intramuscular temperature or muscle PH acidity, for instance.EMGA of the calf muscle was recorded during posture maintenance in seven participants and during controlled isometric contractions in two participants. The power spectral density of the EMGA was then fit with the Planckian distribution. Then, we inferred nine theoretical relationships from the distribution and compared the theoretically derived values with experimentally obtained values.The power spectral density of EMGA was fit by Planckian distributions and all the theoretical relationships were validated by experimental results.Only by considering the motor unit action potentials as electromagnetic resonant modes confined at thermal equilibrium inside the muscle suffices to predict known or new theoretical relationships for muscle physiological variables that other models have failed to do."
