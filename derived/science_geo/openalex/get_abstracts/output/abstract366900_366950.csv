https://openalex.org/W2060204808,"Necrosis can be induced by stimulating death receptors with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or other agonists; however, the underlying mechanism differentiating necrosis from apoptosis is largely unknown. We identified the protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) as a molecular switch between TNF-induced apoptosis and necrosis in NIH 3T3 cells and found that RIP3 was required for necrosis in other cells. RIP3 did not affect RIP1-mediated apoptosis but was required for RIP1-mediated necrosis and the enhancement of necrosis by the caspase inhibitor zVAD. By activating key enzymes of metabolic pathways, RIP3 regulates TNF-induced reactive oxygen species production, which partially accounts for RIP3's ability to promote necrosis. Our data suggest that modulation of energy metabolism in response to death stimuli has an important role in the choice between apoptosis and necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081758137,"Human brain tumors appear to have a hierarchical cellular organization suggestive of a stem cell foundation. In vitro expansion of the putative cancer stem cells as stable cell lines would provide a powerful model system to study their biology. Here, we demonstrate routine and efficient derivation of adherent cell lines from malignant glioma that display stem cell properties and initiate high-grade gliomas following xenotransplantation. Significantly, glioma neural stem (GNS) cell lines from different tumors exhibit divergent gene expression signatures and differentiation behavior that correlate with specific neural progenitor subtypes. The diversity of gliomas may, therefore, reflect distinct cancer stem cell phenotypes. The purity and stability of adherent GNS cell lines offer significant advantages compared to ""sphere"" cultures, enabling refined studies of cancer stem cell behavior. A proof-of-principle live cell imaging-based chemical screen (450 FDA-approved drugs) identifies both differential sensitivities of GNS cells and a common susceptibility to perturbation of serotonin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2149212390,"The origins of modern human behavior are marked by increased symbolic and technological complexity in the archaeological record. In western Eurasia this transition, the Upper Paleolithic, occurred about 45,000 years ago, but many of its features appear transiently in southern Africa about 45,000 years earlier. We show that demography is a major determinant in the maintenance of cultural complexity and that variation in regional subpopulation density and/or migratory activity results in spatial structuring of cultural skill accumulation. Genetic estimates of regional population size over time show that densities in early Upper Paleolithic Europe were similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa when modern behavior first appeared. Demographic factors can thus explain geographic variation in the timing of the first appearance of modern behavior without invoking increased cognitive capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2007610579,"To directly test the contribution of Scgb1a1(+) Clara cells to postnatal growth, homeostasis, and repair of lung epithelium, we generated a Scgb1a1-CreER ""knockin"" mouse for lineage-tracing these cells. Under all conditions tested, the majority of Clara cells in the bronchioles both self-renews and generates ciliated cells. In the trachea, Clara cells give rise to ciliated cells but do not self-renew extensively. Nevertheless, they can contribute to tracheal repair. In the postnatal mouse lung, it has been proposed that bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) which coexpress Scgb1a1 (Secretoglobin1a1) and SftpC (Surfactant Protein C), contribute descendants to both bronchioles and alveoli. The putative BASCs were lineage labeled in our studies. However, we find no evidence for the function of a special BASC population during postnatal growth, adult homeostasis, or repair. Rather, our results support a model in which the trachea, bronchioles, and alveoli are maintained by distinct populations of epithelial progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984807806,"War and Peace? Modern behavior, including the development of advanced tools, musical instruments, and art, seems to have arisen in humans in stages. The earliest hints are seen in Africa about 70 to 90,000 years ago, but later in Europe about 45,000 years ago. An ongoing discussion centers on the origins and significance of human prosociality. During early human development, could the benefits of altruistic behavior have outweighed its costs (see the Perspective by Mace )? Bowles (p. 1293 ) constructed a model of conflict between groups of humans and extracted estimates of the critical parameters from archaeological and ethnographic data sets. Provocatively, it appears that warfare might have enhanced the emergence and persistence of altruistic behavior. Powell et al. (p. 1298 ) present a population model that shows that the development of modern behaviors may rely on the attainment of critical population densities and migratory patterns required for stable cultural transmission. The model is consistent with genetic inferences of population dynamics in Africa and Europe and suggests that these cultural changes may not solely reflect increased cognitive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2160885731,"Going Faster The concentrations of most tropospheric pollutants and trace gases are kept in check by their reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH). OH is a short-lived, highly reactive species that is produced in the atmosphere by photochemical processes, and regenerated in the chain of chemical reactions that follows the oxidative destruction of those molecules. These regeneration mechanisms were thought to be fairly well understood, but now Hofzumahaus et al. (p. 1702 , published online 4 June) present evidence of a pathway not previously recognized. In a study of atmospheric composition in the Pearl River Delta, a highly polluted region of China, greatly elevated OH concentrations were observed without the correspondingly high levels of ozone expected from current models. Thus, OH concentrations may be augmented by a process that speeds the regeneration of OH without producing ozone."
https://openalex.org/W2069943755,"<h2>Summary</h2> Satellite cells in skeletal muscle are a heterogeneous population of stem cells and committed progenitors. We found that quiescent satellite stem cells expressed the Wnt receptor Fzd7 and that its candidate ligand Wnt7a was upregulated during regeneration. Wnt7a markedly stimulated the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells but did not affect the growth or differentiation of myoblasts. Silencing of Fzd7 abrogated Wnt7a binding and stimulation of stem cell expansion. Wnt7a signaling induced the polarized distribution of the planar cell polarity effector Vangl2. Silencing of Vangl2 inhibited Wnt7a action on satellite stem cell expansion. Wnt7a overexpression enhanced muscle regeneration and increased both satellite cell numbers and the proportion of satellite stem cells. Muscle lacking Wnt7a exhibited a marked decrease in satellite cell number following regeneration. Therefore, Wnt7a signaling through the planar cell polarity pathway controls the homeostatic level of satellite stem cells and hence regulates the regenerative potential of muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2108573150,"Coordinating Response to Stress Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) (a protein deacetylase implicated in aging), senses the metabolic state of the cell and modulates the activity of substrate proteins that in turn regulate cellular transcriptional responses. In response to hypoxia, cells activate the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2α), which promotes adaptive responses. Dioum et al. (p. 1289 ; see the Perspective by Guarente ) discovered a link between these two important cellular stress response systems—HIF-2α is a substrate of Sirt1. Direct interaction between Sirt1 and HIF-2α results in deacetylation of HIF-2α and enhances its transcriptional activity. In mice lacking Sirt1, the ability of HIF-2α to promote synthesis of the growth factor erythropoietin is diminished. Thus, the regulation of HIF-2α helps to coordinate responses of cells to various stresses."

https://openalex.org/W1973717482,"Let Me Present to You The presentation of exogenous antigens by major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules is referred to as cross-presentation. Cross-presentation by dendritic cells plays a central role in the priming of cytolytic T lymphocyte responses to natural and vaccine antigens and also in the initiation of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes. A satisfactory cell biological model of cross-presentation is not available, which would be required to decipher the link, inherent in cross-presentation, between the secretory and the endocytic pathways. Saveanu et al. (p. 213 , published online 4 June) identify an aminopeptidase, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which interacts directly with MHC class I molecules. IRAP plays an exclusive and important role in MHC class I cross-presentation of receptor-targeted and phagocytosed antigens. In particular, a specific endosomal compartment, which carries IRAP as a unique marker, is implicated in cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2048056386,"The Cucurbitaceae includes important crops such as cucumber, melon, watermelon, squash and pumpkin. However, few genetic and genomic resources are available for plant improvement. Some cucurbit species such as cucumber have a narrow genetic base, which impedes construction of saturated molecular linkage maps. We report herein the development of highly polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers originated from whole genome shotgun sequencing and the subsequent construction of a high-density genetic linkage map. This map includes 995 SSRs in seven linkage groups which spans in total 573 cM, and defines approximately 680 recombination breakpoints with an average of 0.58 cM between two markers. These linkage groups were then assigned to seven corresponding chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH assays also revealed a chromosomal inversion between Cucumis subspecies [C. sativus var. sativus L. and var. hardwickii (R.) Alef], which resulted in marker clustering on the genetic map. A quarter of the mapped markers showed relatively high polymorphism levels among 11 inbred lines of cucumber. Among the 995 markers, 49%, 26% and 22% were conserved in melon, watermelon and pumpkin, respectively. This map will facilitate whole genome sequencing, positional cloning, and molecular breeding in cucumber, and enable the integration of knowledge of gene and trait in cucurbits."

https://openalex.org/W2090773805,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is a developmentally conserved regulator of stem cell function. Several reports suggested that Hh signaling is an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and differentiation. Here we test this hypothesis in vivo using both gain- and loss-of-function Hh genetic models. Surprisingly, our studies demonstrate that conditional Smoothened (Smo) deletion or overactivation has no significant effects on adult HSC self-renewal and function. Moreover, they indicate a lack of synergism between the Notch and Hh pathways in HSC function, as compound RBPJ and Smo deficiency does not affect hematopoiesis. In agreement with this notion, detailed genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that silencing of Hh signaling does not significantly alter the HSC-specific gene expression ""signature."" Our studies demonstrate that the Hh signaling pathway is dispensable for adult HSC function and suggest that Hh inhibition on leukemia-initiating cell maintenance can be targeted in future clinical trials."

However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diversification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity from Lyngbya majuscula form a beta-branched cyclopropane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halogenase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for polyketide beta-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH(1)s), decarboxylases (ECH(2)s) and enoyl reductase domains from both Cur and Jam, were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation. Unexpectedly, the polyketide beta-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a gamma-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(ii), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme. In a divergent scheme, Cur ECH(2) was found to catalyse formation of the alpha,beta enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH(2) formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding beta,gamma enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH(2) instead of the canonical alpha,beta C = C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide beta-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH(2) and enoyl reductase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events in multienzyme systems leading to functional group diversity in secondary metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2013131400,"Theory suggests that stars with initial masses greater than 25–30 times that of the Sun end their stellar lives as Wolf–Rayet stars, becoming hydrogen-deficient by rapidly losing mass through strong stellar winds. Any subsequent supernova explosion should produce ejecta of low kinetic energy and faint optical luminosity, with a small mass fraction of radioactive nickel. Until now no core-collapse supernovae fitting this description have been detected. But SN 2008ha, discovered on 7 November 2008, appears to fit the bill. A detailed photometric and spectroscopic study shows SN 2008ha to be the faintest and lowest-luminosity hydrogen-deficient supernova known. This discovery raises the possibility that other similar events have been observed previously — SN 2002cx is one candidate — but were classified as 'peculiar thermonuclear supernovae'. Theory suggests that stars with initial masses greater than 25–30 solar masses end up as Wolf-Rayet stars, which are deficient in hydrogen in their outer layers; subsequent supernova explosions should produce ejecta of low kinetic energy, a faint optical luminosity and a small mass fraction of radioactive nickel, but no weak, hydrogen-deficient, core-collapse supernovae have hitherto been see. Now, SN 2008ha is reported to be a faint hydrogen-poor supernova. The final fate of massive stars depends on many factors. Theory suggests that some with initial masses greater than 25 to 30 solar masses end up as Wolf–Rayet stars, which are deficient in hydrogen in their outer layers because of mass loss through strong stellar winds. The most massive of these stars have cores which may form a black hole and theory predicts that the resulting explosion of some of them produces ejecta of low kinetic energy, a faint optical luminosity and a small mass fraction of radioactive nickel1,2,3. An alternative origin for low-energy supernovae is the collapse of the oxygen–neon core of a star of 7–9 solar masses4,5. No weak, hydrogen-deficient, core-collapse supernovae have hitherto been seen. Here we report that SN 2008ha is a faint hydrogen-poor supernova. We propose that other similar events have been observed but have been misclassified as peculiar thermonuclear supernovae (sometimes labelled SN 2002cx-like events6). This discovery could link these faint supernovae to some long-duration γ-ray bursts, because extremely faint, hydrogen-stripped core-collapse supernovae have been proposed to produce such long γ-ray bursts, the afterglows of which do not show evidence of associated supernovae7,8,9."
https://openalex.org/W1975104394,"We report the unexpected finding that loss of Hh signaling through conditional deletion of Smoothened (Smo) in the adult hematopoietic compartment has no apparent effect on adult hematopoiesis, including peripheral blood count, number or cell-cycle status of stem or progenitor cells, hematopoietic colony-forming potential, long-term repopulating activity in competitive repopulation assays, or stress response to serial 5-fluorouracil treatment. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of Hh signaling with a potent and selective small molecule antagonist has no substantive effect on hematopoiesis in the mouse. In addition, Hh signaling is not required for the development of MLL-AF9-mediated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Hh signaling is dispensable for normal hematopoietic development and hematopoietic stem cell function, indicating that targeting of Hh signaling in solid tumors is not likely to result in hematopoietic toxicity. Furthermore, the Hh pathway may not be a compelling target in certain hematopoietic malignancies."

Now with the demonstration of entanglement between distinct mechanical oscillators — familiar at a larger scale as springs or pendula — these esoteric phenomena take a tentative step nearer the world of our everyday existence. Jost et al. demonstrate entanglement between separated mechanical oscillators, consisting of the vibrational states of two pairs of atomic ions held in different locations. Such experiments may open the way to the generation of entangled states of larger-scale mechanical oscillators and the scaling-up of quantum information processing based on trapped ions. Superposition and entanglement are hallmarks of quantum mechanics. One system ubiquitous to nature where entanglement has not previously been shown is distinct mechanical oscillators, such as springs or pendula. Here, deterministic entanglement of separated mechanical oscillators—consisting of the vibrational states of two pairs of atomic ions held in different locations—is demonstrated. Hallmarks of quantum mechanics include superposition and entanglement. In the context of large complex systems, these features should lead to situations as envisaged in the ‘Schrödinger’s cat’1 thought experiment (where the cat exists in a superposition of alive and dead states entangled with a radioactive nucleus). Such situations are not observed in nature. This may be simply due to our inability to sufficiently isolate the system of interest from the surrounding environment2,3—a technical limitation. Another possibility is some as-yet-undiscovered mechanism that prevents the formation of macroscopic entangled states4. Such a limitation might depend on the number of elementary constituents in the system5 or on the types of degrees of freedom that are entangled. Tests of the latter possibility have been made with photons, atoms and condensed matter devices6,7. One system ubiquitous to nature where entanglement has not been previously demonstrated consists of distinct mechanical oscillators. Here we demonstrate deterministic entanglement of separated mechanical oscillators, consisting of the vibrational states of two pairs of atomic ions held in different locations. We also demonstrate entanglement of the internal states of an atomic ion with a distant mechanical oscillator. These results show quantum entanglement in a degree of freedom that pervades the classical world. Such experiments may lead to the generation of entangled states of larger-scale mechanical oscillators8,9,10, and offer possibilities for testing non-locality with mesoscopic systems11. In addition, the control developed here is an important ingredient for scaling-up quantum information processing with trapped atomic ions12,13,14."
https://openalex.org/W1997796989,"Background Blood vessels comprise endothelial cells, mural cells (pericytes/vascular smooth muscle cells) and basement membrane. During angiogenesis, mural cells are recruited to sprouting endothelial cells and define a stabilizing context, comprising cell-cell contacts, secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix components, that drives vessel maturation and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapeutics. Methods and Findings To better understand the basis for mural cell regulation of angiogenesis, we conducted high content imaging analysis on a microtiter plate format in vitro organotypic blood vessel system comprising primary human endothelial cells co-cultured with primary human mural cells. We show that endothelial cells co-cultured with mural cells undergo an extensive series of phenotypic changes reflective of several facets of blood vessel formation and maturation: Loss of cell proliferation, pathfinding-like cell migration, branching morphogenesis, basement membrane extracellular matrix protein deposition, lumen formation, anastamosis and development of a stabilized capillary-like network. This phenotypic sequence required endothelial-mural cell-cell contact, mural cell-derived VEGF and endothelial VEGFR2 signaling. Inhibiting formation of adherens junctions or basement membrane structures abrogated network formation. Notably, inhibition of mural cell VEGF expression could not be rescued by exogenous VEGF. Conclusions These results suggest a unique role for mural cell-associated VEGF in driving vessel formation and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2088056353,"Understanding the mechanism by which d wave superconductivity in the cuprates emerges and is optimized by doping the Mott insulator is one of the major outstanding problems in condensed-matter physics. Our high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of the high-transition temperature (Tc) superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta show that samples with different Tc values in the low doping regime follow a remarkably universal d wave low-energy excitation spectrum, indicating a doping-independent nodal gap. We demonstrate that Tc instead correlates with the fraction of the Fermi surface over which the samples exhibit the universal spectrum. Optimal Tc is achieved when all parts of the Fermi surface follow this universal behavior. Increasing the temperature above Tc turns the universal spectrum into an arc of gapless excitations, whereas overdoping breaks down the universal nodal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2135022152,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective, pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory enzyme, is strongly induced in injured tissues. Our aim was to clarify its role in cutaneous wound healing. In wild type mice, maximal expression of HO-1 in the skin was observed on the 2(nd) and 3(rd) days after wounding. Inhibition of HO-1 by tin protoporphyrin-IX resulted in retardation of wound closure. Healing was also delayed in HO-1 deficient mice, where lack of HO-1 could lead to complete suppression of reepithelialization and to formation of extensive skin lesions, accompanied by impaired neovascularization. Experiments performed in transgenic mice bearing HO-1 under control of keratin 14 promoter showed that increased level of HO-1 in keratinocytes is enough to improve the neovascularization and hasten the closure of wounds. Importantly, induction of HO-1 in wounded skin was relatively weak and delayed in diabetic (db/db) mice, in which also angiogenesis and wound closure were impaired. In such animals local delivery of HO-1 transgene using adenoviral vectors accelerated the wound healing and increased the vascularization. In summary, induction of HO-1 is necessary for efficient wound closure and neovascularization. Impaired wound healing in diabetic mice may be associated with delayed HO-1 upregulation and can be improved by HO-1 gene transfer."

While these organisms appear to be more closely related to the Methanosarcinales in ribosomal-based phylogenetic analyses, they are metabolically more similar to Class I methanogens.In order to improve our understanding of this lineage, we have completely sequenced the genomes of two members of this order, Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z and Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1, and compared them with the genome of a third, Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1. Similar to Class I methanogens, Methanomicrobiales use a partial reductive citric acid cycle for 2-oxoglutarate biosynthesis, and they have the Eha energy-converting hydrogenase. In common with Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales possess the Ech hydrogenase and at least some of them may couple formylmethanofuran formation and heterodisulfide reduction to transmembrane ion gradients. Uniquely, M. labreanum and M. hungatei contain hydrogenases similar to the Pyrococcus furiosus Mbh hydrogenase, and all three Methanomicrobiales have anti-sigma factor and anti-anti-sigma factor regulatory proteins not found in other methanogens. Phylogenetic analysis based on seven core proteins of methanogenesis and cofactor biosynthesis places the Methanomicrobiales equidistant from Class I methanogens and Methanosarcinales.Our results indicate that Methanomicrobiales, rather than being similar to Class I methanogens or Methanomicrobiales, share some features of both and have some unique properties.

Stability can be greatly enhanced, however, by the presence of a small number of strategically placed covalent bonds, for example those provided by disulfide bonds between Cys residues or by a bound metal ion that bonds to several amino acid side chains. Indeed, some striking examples have been reported in which the introduction of disulfide bonds that link sequentially distant parts of a polypeptide chain can result in large increases in protein stability (2Matsumura M.

In this process, which is common to a number of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, the pilus backbone is formed from a single protein subunit, the so-called major pilin, by the covalent, end-to-end polymerization of major pilin subunits, generating an assembly resembling beads on a string (5Ton-That H.

A close parallel exists in the self-generated Lys-Asn isopeptide bonds that form during maturation of the protein coat of the bacteriophage HK97, where a nearby Glu residue is essential for the reaction, and the capsid subunits become covalently linked to form interlocked circular rings referred to as chain mail (11Duda R.L.

Examination of previously determined structures of a minor pilin GBS52 from Streptococcus agalactiae (13Krishnan V. Gaspar A.H. Ye N. Mandlik A. Ton-That H. Narayana S.V.L.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) revealed constellations of Lys-Asn-Glu/Asp residues similar to those that form the internal cross-links in Spy0128, and examination of the electron density confirmed their probable presence in those cases where the x-ray data were available (3Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons showed that similar domains, with corresponding Lys-Asn-Glu/Asp residues, are present in many cell surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. Recently the Bacillus cereus major pilin BcpA was shown, by mass spectral analyses, to contain internal isopeptide bonds similar to those in Spy0128 (7Budzik J.M. Marraffini L.A. Souda P. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10215-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and sequence comparisons point to similar bonds in the major pilins of other species. These data suggest that isopeptide bond cross-links could be important features in many surface proteins involved in adhesive functions, where stability against physical and chemical stresses is important. Here we describe the preparation of mutants of Spy0128 that lack one or both of the internal isopeptide bonds, using mass spectrometry to confirm their absence. We show by x-ray crystallography that the overall structure of Spy0128 is not significantly affected by the loss of an isopeptide bond. We also show, however, that the proteolytic and thermal stability of Spy0128 is severely compromised when the internal isopeptide bonds are removed and thereby establish their important stabilizing role in proteins of this type. The DNA sequence encoding amino acids 18–311 of Spy0128 was amplified from GAS serotype M1 genomic DNA, using the primer pairs listed in Table 1. The amplified DNA product was double-digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the vector pGEX3C. The ligation reaction was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and positive colonies were screened by colony PCR. DNA sequencing was carried out to confirm the sequence. The resulting plasmid pGEX3C-Spy012818–311 contained the desired Spy0128 sequence, a linker with sequence GPGS, a picornavirus 3C protease cleavage site, and a glutathione S-transferase tag.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPrimerSequence 5′ → 3′pGEX3C-Spy012818–311 ForwardCGGGATCCGCTACAACAGTTCACGG ReverseGCGAATTCTTATGTTGGCACTTCAAAGSpy012818–308/311 E117A ForwardGTAACTGCGGAGAAGATAGATAAAG ReverseCTTCTCCGCAGTTACTTTGTAATAATAAACSpy012818–308/311 N168A ForwardGTTCAAAGCTAGCTTAGATTCTACTAC ReverseCTAAGCTAGCTTTGAACTGAATTGGCACSpy012818–308/311 E258A ForwardGTTGTCACTGCAGACGATTACAAATCAG ReverseATCGTCTGCAGTGACAACATAATCCAC Open table in a new tab Mutations were introduced to Spy0128 by the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of double-stranded DNA. Forward and reverse primer pairs for each mutation were designed, as listed in Table 1. Two alternative wild type constructs were used as templates for PCR amplification: pGEX3C-Spy012818–311, prepared as described above, and pGEX3C-Spy012818–308, prepared as described earlier (3Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). After amplification with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), each reaction was incubated with DpnI restriction enzyme at 37 °C to remove template DNA and then transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. The sequences of the resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids for pGEX3C-Spy012818–311, pGEX3C-Spy012818–308, and their mutants were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pRP cells for expression. Protein overexpression was carried out in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium (17Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). The cells were grown initially at 37 °C for 4 h followed by 20 h at 28 °C. Harvested cells were lysed in a buffer (buffer A) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl using sonication or a cell disruptor (Constant Systems). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the final supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to protein purification. Spy012818–311 and Spy012818–308 were purified as described previously (3Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were first purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) followed by cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase tag on the column using recombinant picornavirus 3C protease. The untagged protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap QFF column with a NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in buffer A, followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in buffer A. For the mutant proteins, purification was carried out at 4 °C, and the duration for the glutathione S-transferase tag cleavage was reduced to 4 h instead of overnight, because some mutants were susceptible to degradation. Gel filtration fractions containing pure Spy012818–311 or mutants were pooled and concentrated, and protein concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using the extinction coefficient of 26,360 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Accurate molecular masses of proteins were determined by infusion ESI-TOF mass spectrometry undertaken on a Q-STAR XL hybrid tandem mass spectrometry system (Applied Biosystems) in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The raw mass spectrometry data were deconvoluted using the Bayesian protein reconstruction tool in BioAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems). CD spectroscopy experiments were conducted on a JASCO J-815 CD spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control (JASCO Inc.). The proteins were used at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (∼ 3 × 10−6m), in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. For CD data collection, 1 ml of each protein was used in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Wavelength scans between 200 and 250 nm were collected at 20 °C using 1.0-nm bandwidth, 0.1-nm step size, and an averaging time of 1 s. For thermal melting, temperature was increased from 20 to 95 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min, and CD signals at 222 nm were collected at 0.5 °C intervals. Reversibility of thermal denaturation was checked by cooling and reheating the same samples. The raw data in millidegree units were corrected for background absorbance and converted to molar ellipticity [θ]. Thermal denaturation curves were determined by plotting changes in CD molar ellipticity as a function of temperature. The experimental curves were fit to the Boltzmann equation describing a two-state folding transition, and the melting temperature Tm was obtained from the inflection point of the curve. Spy012818–311 and mutant proteins were diluted in 25 mm NH4HCO3 to 0.3 mg/ml and mixed with 0.3% (w/w) trypsin. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C. At different time points between 1 min and 16 h from incubation, 15 μl of each reaction was drawn out and mixed with boiling SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by running on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Crystallization trials were performed at 18 °C by the vapor diffusion sitting drop method. In each case equal volumes of protein (concentration, 100 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl) and precipitant were mixed using a Cartesian nanoliter dispensing robot (Genome Solutions). The best crystals were obtained for mutants of the Spy012818–308 construct. The E117A mutant produced crystals with a precipitant comprising 0.2 m potassium acetate and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, whereas for the N168A mutant, the best crystals were obtained using 0.2 m MOPS/KOH, pH 7.5, and 21% polyethylene glycol 6000. Prior to data collection, the crystals were soaked for 5 s in cryoprotectant solutions comprising mother liquor solution supplemented with 0–20% ethylene glycol (E117A) or polyethylene glycol 400 (N168A) and were then immediately cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected to 2.0 Å resolution at 100 K using the MicroMax-007HF rotating anode generator (Rigaku) equipped with a Mar345 image plate detector. The data sets were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter J.C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals of both the E117A and N168A mutant proteins belong to space group P21, with three molecules/asymmetric unit and unit cell dimensions very similar to those of the WT crystals. The E117A crystals were isomorphous with WT Spy012818–308, but N168A crystals showed slightly altered unit cell dimensions (Table 2). The WT Spy012818–308 structure (Protein Data Bank code 3B2M) was used as a phasing model for structure determination after omitting all solvent molecules. The isomorphism of the E117A mutant meant that this WT model could be placed into the E117A unit cell, and its position and orientation could be optimized by rigid body refinement with REFMAC (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). For the less isomorphous N168A crystals, molecular replacement with PHASER (20McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar) was necessary, however, using the WT structure as search model. In both cases, the Rfree set of reflections used in the wild type structure refinement was transferred to the mutant reflection file before refinement commenced to avoid bias. Refinement was with REFMAC with TLS restraints (21Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), and manual model building was carried out using COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The E117A structure was refined at 2.03 Å resolution to final values of r = 0.212 and Rfree = 0.260, and N168A was refined at 2.20 Å resolution to r = 0.205 and Rfree = 0.278. For both structures, over 90% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, as defined by PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) with no outliers. The data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 2. The atomic coordinate and structure factor files were deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession codes 3GLD (E117A) and 3GLE (N168A).TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statisticsSpy012818–308 E117ASpy012818–308 N168ASpace groupP21P21Unit cell dimensions (Å, deg)a = 67.31, b = 52.15, c = 127.32, β = 98.83°a = 64.71, b = 50.87, c = 123.20, β = 104.27°Data collection statistics Resolution range (Å)aThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.50–2.03 (2.10–2.03)50–2.20 (2.28–2.20) Wavelength (Å)1.541781.54178 Total reflections20793912274826 No. unique reflectionsaThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.54403 (4811)40313 (4012) RedundancyaThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.5.9 (4.7)10.4 (10.0) Completeness (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.95.8 (84.9)99.8 (100.0) Mean I/σ(I)aThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.32.6 (5.8)38.7 (6.6) Rsym (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.,bRsym = ΣhΣi[|Ii(h) − <I(h)>|/ΣhΣiIi(h)], where Ii is the ith measurement, and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurement of Ii(h).4.9 (27.8)6.0 (39.5)Refinement Statistics Rwork/Rfree (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.21.2 (24.8)/26.0 (37.1)20.5 (25.4)/27.8 (36.6) Root mean square deviations from standard bond lengths (Å)0.0110.012 Root mean square deviations from standard bond angles (°)1.301.35 Average B-factor (Å2)33.125.8 Main chain atoms32.124.7 Side chains and waters34.126.8 No. of non-hydrogen atoms Protein66926690 Water550324Ramachandran plot Most favored regions (%)91.290.9 Additionally allowed (%)8.68.9 Generously allowed (%)0.30.1 Outliers (%)00a The values in parentheses are for the outermost shell of data.b Rsym = ΣhΣi[|Ii(h) − <I(h)>|/ΣhΣiIi(h)], where Ii is the ith measurement, and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurement of Ii(h). Open table in a new tab The formation of the two internal isopeptide bonds in Spy0128 is dependent in each case on an associated acidic residue, Glu117 for the N-terminal domain isopeptide bond and Glu258 for the C-terminal domain isopeptide bond. These residues were mutated to Ala to generate the single-mutation proteins E117A and E258A, and the double-mutation protein E117A/E258A. In addition, Asn168, which forms the isopeptide bond with Lys36 in the N-terminal domain, was also changed to alanine, creating the N168A mutant, to compare with the glutamate substitution mutants. The appropriate mutations were made in a construct encoding residues 18–311 (Spy012818–311), which ends with Thr311, known to be the C-terminal residue after sortase cleavage. For crystallography, however, the slightly shorter construct Spy012818–308 was used as this gave much better crystals and allowed direct comparison with the WT structure (3Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Both wild type (WT) Spy0128 and the mutant proteins were expressed and purified, and the presence or absence of isopeptide bonds was analyzed by ESI-TOF mass spectrometry (Table 3). The molecular mass of WT Spy0128 was 34.8 Da less than that calculated from the amino acid sequence (Mcalc), indicating the loss of two units of NH3 through formation of two isopeptide bonds. For the single-Glu mutants E117A and E258A, loss of only one NH3 was observed in each case, indicating formation of one isopeptide bond. In contrast, no mass decrease was detected for the double mutant E117A/E258A, indicating no isopeptide bonds. These results confirm the essential role of the Glu residues in the isopeptide bond formation. Mutation of Asn168 to Ala in N168A also effectively removed the isopeptide bond, as shown by the loss of only one NH3 from the overall protein mass.TABLE 3ESI-TOF mass spectral analyses of wild type and mutant proteins of Spy0128ProteinMaverageaAverage molecular mass.Δ (Mexpected − Mobserved)bDifference between expected molecular mass and observed molecular mass.NH3 units lostExpectedObserved by ESI-TOFDaDaSpy012818–31132,756.432,721.634.82Spy012818–311 E117A32,698.332,682.016.31Spy012818–311 N168A32,713.332,696.516.81Spy012818–311 E258A32,698.332,681.516.81Spy012818–311 E117A/E258A32,640.332,640.50.20a Average molecular mass.b Difference between expected molecular mass and observed molecular mass. Open table in a new tab The secondary structures of Spy0128 and its mutants were estimated by CD spectroscopy. The crystal structure of Spy0128 shows that it is an all-β protein with no α-helices (3Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum at pH 8.0 (Fig. 2) displayed a distinctive minimum at 215 nm and positive peaks at ∼200 nm (not shown) and ∼227 nm. These features differ slightly from those seen for classic anti-parallel β-sheet proteins, which show positive bands at ∼195 nm and a minimum at ∼218 nm. The mutant proteins all displayed similar CD spectra to WT Spy0128, with only minor differences, mainly around the 215-nm region. The CD spectra of E117A and E258A were virtually identical, and both showed deeper 215-nm minima relative to WT, whereas N168A showed a lesser 215-nm minimum than WT. For the double mutant E117A/E258A, the overall spectra were shifted downward. The spectra are consistent with similar folding in all cases. The thermal stabilities of Spy0128 and its mutant proteins were probed by measuring the temperature dependence of their CD spectra in the far-UV region over a temperature range of 20–95 °C. Unfolding of the proteins was monitored by the loss of ellipticity at 222 nm. This wavelength was chosen because the spectra were often noisy around the 215-nm minimum. The reversibility of unfolding was tested by reheating the same samples and cooling back to the starting temperature, 20 °C. After heating to 95 °C, both WT and N168A proteins could be refolded with no apparent sign of aggregation (Fig. 2, B and D). In contrast, E117A, E258A, and E117A/E258A all precipitated with increasing temperature and showed significant loss of CD signal after heating and cooling, indicating irreversible thermal denaturation of these mutants. In particular, E117A/E258A showed a nearly complete loss of the characteristic CD maximum and minimum. These results indicate that the reversibility of Spy0128 thermal unfolding is significantly perturbed by the Glu to Ala mutations. N168A also lacks the N domain isopeptide bond, like E117A, but it does refold after thermal unfolding. This indicates that the presence of the Lys-Asn isopeptide bonds in Spy0128 is not solely responsible for the reversibility of its thermal unfolding. All of the proteins showed a gradual decrease in their 222-nm CD signal as the temperature was increased. This was more pronounced in the E117A, E258A, and E117A/E258A mutants, whereas the wild type and N168A showed much slower descent (Fig. 3). The WT protein followed a typical two-state unfolding mechanism, with a sharply defined transition temperature (Tm) of 85.1 °C and no evidence of a stable intermediate (Fig. 3). In contrast, all of the single mutants exhibited two transitions, the first between ∼50 and 60 °C and the second between ∼80 and 85 °C, similar to the single transition seen for WT (Table 4). The transitions that occurred in the mutant proteins were less sharp than that of WT, however, indicating less cooperative unfolding reactions. The CD signals of the glutamate mutants E117A and E258A decreased more rapidly than that of the N168A from the starting temperature. This indicates that the unfolding was well under way at the low temperatures for the Glu mutants, whereas it was less so for N168A. For the double mutant E117A/E258A, the CD signal decreased markedly beyond 50 °C and then stopped at 60–70 °C, and no post-transition base line could be established.TABLE 4Tm values of Spy0128 and mutantsProteinTm°CSpy012818–31185.1Spy012818–311 E117A50.2/84.2Spy012818–311 N168A60.3/83.6Spy012818–311 E258A57.5/79.4Spy012818–311 E117A/E258Andand, not determined.a nd, not determined.

To this end, Spy012818–311 and its mutant proteins were subject to trypsin digestion at 37 °C, with the progress of the digestion being followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of samples taken at various time points (Fig. 4). The WT protein remained essentially intact after 4 h digestion and was still largely intact after 16 h. In contrast, the mutant proteins showed significantly increased susceptibility to proteolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2009554048,"Inflammatory cell migration characteristic of ischemic damages has a dual role providing the tissue with factors needed for tissue injury recovery simultaneously causing deleterious development depending on the quality and the quantity of infiltrated cells. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role in ischemic injuries where it increases the recovery process by activating mitogen signal transduction and increasing cell proliferation. However, SOD3 derived effects on inflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecule expression, which would explain reduced inflammation in vascular lesions, has not been properly characterized. In the present work the effect of SOD3 on the inflammatory cell extravasation was studied in vivo in rat hind limb ischemia and mouse peritonitis models by identifying the migrated cells and analyzing SOD3-derived response on inflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecule expression. SOD3 overexpression significantly reduced TNFalpha, IL1alpha, IL6, MIP2, and MCP-1 cytokine and VCAM, ICAM, P-selectin, and E-selectin adhesion molecule expressions in injured tissues. Consequently the mononuclear cell, especially CD68+ monocyte and CD3+ T cell infiltration were significantly decreased whereas granulocyte migration was less affected. According to our data SOD3 has a selective anti-inflammatory role in ischemic damages preventing the migration of reactive oxygen producing monocyte/macrophages, which in excessive amounts could potentially further intensify the tissue injuries therefore suggesting potential for SOD3 in treatment of inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1983278149,"Clouds on Titan result from the condensation of methane and ethane and, as on other planets, are primarily structured by circulation of the atmosphere. At present, cloud activity mainly occurs in the southern (summer) hemisphere, arising near the pole and at mid-latitudes from cumulus updrafts triggered by surface heating and/or local methane sources, and at the north (winter) pole, resulting from the subsidence and condensation of ethane-rich air into the colder troposphere. General circulation models predict that this distribution should change with the seasons on a 15-year timescale, and that clouds should develop under certain circumstances at temperate latitudes ( approximately 40 degrees ) in the winter hemisphere. The models, however, have hitherto been poorly constrained and their long-term predictions have not yet been observationally verified. Here we report that the global spatial cloud coverage on Titan is in general agreement with the models, confirming that cloud activity is mainly controlled by the global circulation. The non-detection of clouds at latitude approximately 40 degrees N and the persistence of the southern clouds while the southern summer is ending are, however, both contrary to predictions. This suggests that Titan's equator-to-pole thermal contrast is overestimated in the models and that its atmosphere responds to the seasonal forcing with a greater inertia than expected."
https://openalex.org/W2032612990,"The neurodegenerative disorder spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or Kennedy disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within the androgen receptor (AR) gene. The resulting expanded polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal region of the receptor renders AR prone to ligand-dependent misfolding and formation of oligomers and aggregates that are linked to neuronal toxicity. How AR misfolding is influenced by post-translational modifications, however, is poorly understood. AR is a target of SUMOylation, and this modification inhibits AR activity in a promoter context-dependent manner. SUMOylation is up-regulated in response to multiple forms of cellular stress and may therefore play an important cytoprotective role. Consistent with this view, we find that gratuitous enhancement of overall SUMOylation significantly reduced the formation of polyglutamine-expanded AR aggregates without affecting the levels of the receptor. Remarkably, this effect requires SUMOylation of AR itself because it depends on intact AR SUMOylation sites. Functional analyses, however, indicate that the protective effects of enhanced AR SUMOylation are not due to alterations in AR transcriptional activity because a branched protein structure in the appropriate context of the N-terminal region of AR is necessary to antagonize aggregation but not for inhibiting AR transactivation. Remarkably, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) attenuates AR aggregation through a unique mechanism that does not depend on critical features essential for its interaction with canonical SUMO binding motifs. Our findings therefore reveal a novel function of SUMOylation and suggest that approaches that enhance AR SUMOylation may be of clinical use in polyglutamine expansion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2078798575,"The methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine is synthesized in mammalian cytosol by three isoenzymes. Methionine adenosyltransferase II is ubiquitously expressed, whereas isoenzymes I (homotetramer) and III (homodimer) are considered the hepatic enzymes. In this work, we identified methionine adenosyltransferase I/III in most rat tissues, both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear localization was the preferred distribution observed in extrahepatic tissues, where the protein colocalizes with nuclear matrix markers. A battery of mutants used in several cell lines to decipher the determinants involved in methionine adenosyltransferase subcellular localization demonstrated, by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation, the presence of two partially overlapping areas at the C-terminal end of the protein involved both in cytoplasmic retention and nuclear localization. Immunoprecipitation of coexpressed FLAG and EGFP fusions and gel-filtration chromatography allowed detection of tetramers and monomers in nuclear fractions that also exhibited S-adenosylmethionine synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1987160935,"myc genes are best known for causing tumors when overexpressed, but recent studies suggest endogenous myc regulates pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells. For example, N-myc is associated with a number of tumors including neuroblastoma, but also plays a central role in the function of normal neural stem and precursor cells (NSC). Both c- and N-myc also enhance the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and are linked to neural tumor stem cells. The mechanisms by which myc regulates normal and neoplastic stem-related functions remain largely open questions. Here from a global, unbiased search for N-Myc bound genes using ChIP-chip assays in neuroblastoma, we found lif as a putative N-Myc bound gene with a number of strong N-Myc binding peaks in the promoter region enriched for E-boxes. Amongst putative N-Myc target genes in expression microarray studies in neuroblastoma we also found lif and three additional important embryonic stem cell (ESC)-related factors that are linked to production of iPSC: klf2, klf4, and lin28b. To examine the regulation of these genes by N-Myc, we measured their expression using neuroblastoma cells that contain a Tet-regulatable N-myc transgene (TET21N) as well as NSC with a nestin-cre driven N-myc knockout. N-myc levels closely correlated with the expression of all of these genes in neuroblastoma and all but lif in NSC. Direct ChIP assays also indicate that N-Myc directly binds the lif promoter. N-Myc regulates trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 in the promoter of lif and possibly in the promoters of several other stem-related genes. Together these findings indicate that N-Myc regulates overlapping stem-related gene expression programs in neuroblastoma and NSC, supporting a novel model by which amplification of the N-myc gene may drive formation of neuroblastoma. They also suggest mechanisms by which Myc proteins more generally contribute to maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of ESC as well as to iPSC formation."

https://openalex.org/W2047972120,"We recently reported a critical role of NFkappaB in mediating hyperproliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of progastrin on proximal colonic crypts of transgenic mice overexpressing progastrin (Fabp-PG mice). We now report activation of beta-catenin in colonic crypts of mice in response to chronic (Fabp-PG mice) and acute (wild type FVB/N mice) progastrin stimulation. Significant increases were measured in relative levels of cellular and nuclear beta-catenin and pbeta-cat45 in proximal colonic crypts of Fabp-PG mice compared with that in wild type littermates. Distal colonic crypts were less responsive. Interestingly, beta-catenin activation was downstream of IKKalpha,beta/NFkappaB, because treatment of Fabp-PG mice with the NFkappaB essential modulator (NEMO) peptide (inhibitor of IKKalpha,beta/NFkappaB activation) significantly blocked increases in cellular/nuclear levels of total beta-catenin/pbeta-cat45/and pbeta-cat552 in proximal colons. Cellular levels of pbeta-cat33,37,41, however, increased in proximal colons in response to NEMO, probably because of a significant increase in pGSK-3betaTyr216, facilitating degradation of beta-catenin. NEMO peptide significantly blocked increases in cyclin D1 expression, thereby, abrogating hyperplasia of proximal crypts. Goblet cell hyperplasia in colonic crypts of Fabp-PG mice was abrogated by NEMO treatment, suggesting a cross-talk between the NFkappaB/beta-catenin and Notch pathways. Cellular proliferation and crypt lengths increased significantly in proximal but not distal crypts of FVB/N mice injected with 1 nM progastrin associated with a significant increase in cellular/nuclear levels of total beta-catenin and cyclin D1. Thus, intracellular signals, activated in response to acute and chronic stimulation with progastrin, were similar and specific to proximal colons. Our studies suggest a novel possibility that activation of beta-catenin, downstream to the IKKalpha,beta/NFkappaB pathway, may be integral to the hyperproliferative effects of progastrin on proximal colonic crypts."

https://openalex.org/W2066102742,"Light converts rhodopsin, the prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, into a form capable of activating G proteins. Recent work has shown that the light-activated state of different rhodopsins can possess different molecular properties, especially different abilities to activate G protein. For example, bovine rhodopsin is ∼20-fold more effective at activating G protein than parapinopsin, a non-visual rhodopsin, although these rhodopsins share relatively high sequence similarity. Here we have investigated possible structural aspects that might underlie this difference. Using a site-directed fluorescence labeling approach, we attached the fluorescent probe bimane to cysteine residues introduced in the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane helices V and VI in both rhodopsins. The fluorescence spectra of these probes as well as their accessibility to aqueous quenching agents changed dramatically upon photoactivation in bovine rhodopsin but only moderately so in parapinopsin. We also compared the relative movement of helices V and VI upon photoactivation of both rhodopsins by introducing a bimane label and the bimane-quenching residue tryptophan into helices VI and V, respectively. Both receptors showed movement in this region upon activation, although the movement appears much greater in bovine rhodopsin than in parapinopsin. Together, these data suggest that a larger conformational change in helices V and VI of bovine rhodopsin explains why it has greater G protein activation ability than other rhodopsins.

Rhodopsin consists of a protein moiety (opsin, comprising seven transmembrane α-helical segments) combined with a chromophore (11-cis retinal) that acts as the light-sensitive ligand.

Nature. 2008; 453: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and crystal structures of the inactive form of β-adrenergic receptors and A2 adenosine receptor have been reported (5Rosenbaum D.M.

Remarkably, all of these crystal structures exhibit a very similar arrangement for the seven transmembrane helices (4Murakami M. Kouyama T.

Together, these facts suggest that the architecture for the inactive form is conserved among rhodopsin-like GPCRs. The structural features of an activated GPCR are much less defined. Thus, a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods, including cross-linking methods (9Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 10Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

The data from these studies consistently suggest that some kind of movement of helix VI is involved in the formation of the active state of the rhodopsins. In particular, the cytoplasmic end of helix VI has been proposed to rotate and/or tilt toward helix V (10Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 11Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L.

Remarkably, the recent crystal structures of bovine opsin are consistent with the widely accepted helix motion model. Both the structures of opsin (the ligand-free form of rhodopsin that has partial G protein activation ability) and a complex of opsin with a peptide derived from the G protein C terminus show a movement of helix VI toward helix V, compared with the dark state rhodopsin structure (14Park J.H. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Choe H.W. Ernst O.P. Nature. 2008; 454: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 15Scheerer P. Park J.H. Hildebrand P.W. Kim Y.J. Krauss N. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. Nature. 2008; 455: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Studies of β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors also show that agonist binding promotes movement of helix VI toward helix V in these receptors (16Ghanouni P. Steenhuis J.J. Farrens D.L. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 17Ward S.D. Hamdan F.F. Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the region between the cytoplasmic ends of helices V and VI in various GPCRs is a main site of interaction with G proteins (18Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), it is possible that movement of helices V and VI leads to formation of a conformation capable of interacting with G protein (19Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29767-29773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together, these studies imply that the active state conformation of GPCRs may be similar. However, a detailed comparison of the active-state conformation for two different GPCRs has never been precisely undertaken in the same laboratory using the same methods. In this context we have been investigating rhodopsins with different functional properties to determine whether their active states have different conformations. Our goal was to determine whether any functional or structural differences in the active states of these GPCRs could be detected under the exact same experimental conditions. Previously, we have found that several rhodopsins, such as an invertebrate rhodopsin and a vertebrate non-visual rhodopsin parapinopsin (20Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8083-8092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y. Tamotsu S. Terakita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), can be activated not only by light but also by exogenous all-trans retinal acting as a full agonist (22Tsukamoto H. Terakita A. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6303-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to vertebrate visual rhodopsins, including bovine rhodopsin, which cannot fully form the active state by direct binding of all-trans retinal (23Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although all-trans retinal can fully activate some rhodopsin mutants (24Han M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8253-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Other invertebrate rhodopsin (25Koutalos Y. Ebrey T.G. Tsuda M. Odashima K. Lien T. Park M.H. Shimizu N. Derguini F. Nakanishi K. Gilson H.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2732-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the circadian photoreceptor melanopsin (26Peirson S. Foster R.G. Neuron. 2006; 49: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) can also bind all-trans retinal directly. Interestingly, the active form of the all-trans retinal-activated rhodopsins exhibit some striking differences in their spectroscopic and biochemical properties compared with vertebrate visual rhodopsins (27Terakita A. Genome Biology. 2005; 6: 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In particular, the efficiency of bovine rhodopsin for activating G protein is ∼20∼50-fold higher than that of parapinopsin and invertebrate rhodopsin. This difference could be related to the difference in position of a specific amino acid residue counterion that is essential for rhodopsin to absorb visible light, namely one at position 113 or 181 (28Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 4In this paper the residue number of parapinopsin is described by using the bovine rhodopsin numbering system. 4In this paper the residue number of parapinopsin is described by using the bovine rhodopsin numbering system. Further biochemical analyses using chimeric mutants combining rhodopsins with lower and higher G protein activation abilities suggested that the difference in G protein activation ability was because of a structural difference in transmembrane helices in the active states but not because of difference in amino acid sequence of G protein interaction site (29Terakita A. Yamashita T. Nimbari N. Kojima D. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). In addition, the active states of parapinopsin and the invertebrate rhodopsin are thermally stable and can be reconverted to the inactive state by subsequent light absorption, showing photo-regenerable or bistable nature (21Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y. Tamotsu S. Terakita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), unlike the active state of bovine rhodopsin, which is thermally unstable and cannot revert to the inactive state by subsequent light absorption (30Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30161-30166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study we used site-directed fluorescence labeling (13Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2475-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to compare the structural features of active states of bovine rhodopsin with lamprey parapinopsin, a UV-sensitive non-visual pigment in the pineal organs (21Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y. Tamotsu S. Terakita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Parapinopsin shows relatively high sequence similarity (∼60%) to bovine rhodopsin, yet it has a greatly reduced ability to activate G protein (see Fig. 1, A–C) (21Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y. Tamotsu S. Terakita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Terakita A. Koyanagi M. Tsukamoto H. Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using established protocols, we introduced cysteine residues into the cytoplasmic ends of helices V and VI, the region proposed to rearrange upon activation in GPCRs (11Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 12Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv.

We then site-specifically labeled these cysteines with the small, non-polar fluorescent probe, bimane, and used the spectral properties of these bimane probes to act as reporter groups for environmental changes around their site of attachment upon formation of the photoactivated state for both rhodopsins. In addition, we measured changes in the relative proximity of the cytoplasmic ends of helix VI to helix V in both rhodopsin and parapinopsin using the tryptophan-induced-quenching of bimane (TrIQ-bimane) fluorescence method (31Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2475-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Mansoor S.E. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9426-9438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TrIQ-bimane measures the efficiency of intramolecular fluorescence quenching of bimane caused by tryptophan (Trp), which occurs in a distance-dependent manner. The goal of this study was to determine whether the helices in both receptors moved in the same way during formation of the active state. Our results show that whereas movement of helix VI relative to helix V occurs during formation of the active state for both parapinopsin and bovine rhodopsin, the “amplitude” of the movement is markedly different between the two rhodopsins. The coding region of bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin tagged with the monoclonal antibody rho 1D4 epitope sequence were inserted into plasmid vectors SRα and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), respectively (21Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y. Tamotsu S. Terakita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bovine rhodopsin mutant C140S/C316S/C322S/C323S and parapinopsin mutant V138F/C140A/C316A/C323A were used as respective “background” mutants in which reactive cysteine residues are substituted according to a previous report (13Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in parapinopsin, the V138F mutation recovered expression levels that were decreased by the C140A mutation, and the background mutant of parapinopsin showed normal photoreaction and light-dependent G protein activation (supplemental Fig. S1). Expression of the bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin wild types and mutants in human embryonic kidney 293S cells were carried out as described (21Koyanagi M. Kawano E. Kinugawa Y. Oishi T. Shichida Y.

The pigments reconstituted with 11-cis retinal were extracted with buffer A (1% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, 50 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) and mixed with 1D4-agarose for 6 h. Labeling of rhodopsins with monobromobimane or PDT-bimane and subsequent purification was carried out when the protein was bound to the 1D4 matrix as previously described (13Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29767-29773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It should be noted that labeling procedures were done at pH 7.8 (bovine rhodopsin) or 6.8 (parapinopsin) for 18 h at 4 °C. Label incorporation in each mutant of bovine rhodopsin was roughly estimated from difference spectra between the bimane-labeled mutant and wild type without label. Difference absorbance at around 380 nm was assumed to reflect absorbance of attached label, and the labeling efficiency was roughly estimated using excitation coefficients ϵ380 = 5000 for bimane (31Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2475-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The labeling efficiencies of parapinopsin mutants were estimated by comparison of the fluorescence intensity after denaturation of protein using SDS and removal of the retinal chromophore using hydroxylamine with the intensity of labeled bovine rhodopsin 250C mutant, of which labeling efficiency was already estimated, after the same treatment. For bovine rhodopsin, the labeling efficiencies for mutants 227C, 244C, 250C, and 251C were estimated as ∼0.4, ∼0.8, ∼1.1, and ∼1.6 label per the rhodopsin, respectively. The small increase in the number of labels with the 251C mutant may be because of the contribution of labels bound to cysteine residues in the population of non-functional rhodopsin proteins, which do not possess a retinal chromophore, as we routinely noticed a slightly lower efficiency of reconstitution with retinal for the mutant. In the case of parapinopsin, the labeling efficiencies for mutants 227C, 244C, 250C, and 251C were estimated as ∼0.7, ∼1.0, ∼0.9, and ∼1.1 label per parapinopsin, respectively. The background mutants of bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin were labeled with bimane at less than 0.1 and 0.2 label per rhodopsin, respectively. Importantly, the labels did not appear to inhibit formation of the active state, as all of the labeled mutants showed almost the same absorption spectra as respective wild types before and after photoactivation. In particular, all bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin mutants in this study were almost completely converted to their active states. Absorption spectra of purified samples were recorded with the Shimadzu UV2400 spectrophotometer, and irradiations of the samples were carried out as previously described (21Koyanagi M. Kawano E.

Yamashita T. Miyata T. Shichida Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). UV and yellow lights were supplied by the light source with a UTVAF-50S-36U glass filter (Sigma-Koki) and a Y-52 glass filter (Toshiba), respectively. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out using the Jasco FP-6300 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Measurement temperature was 10 °C. Excitation was set at 380 nm using a 2.5-nm bandpass setting. Excitation light was attenuated to ∼1/50 by a neutral density filter (Sigma-Koki) to avoid photoactivation of the pigments by excitation light. The fluorescence spectra of buffer were subtracted. In the KI quenching assay (Fig. 3) the salt concentration was kept at 25 mm by the addition of a corresponding amount of KCl, and Na2S2O3 was added to 0.1 mm to inhibit formation of I3−. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out using a PTI Laserstrobe fluorescence lifetime instrument (13Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and a PTI EasyLife LED fluorescence lifetime instrument. Measurements were taken at 10 °C using 380-nm excitation pulses while monitoring the emission through long pass filters. Measurements used 100 μl of 250∼500 nm samples placed in 2-mm cuvette and represented two averages of 5 shots (Laserstrobe) or three averages of 0.3-s integration (EasyLife), collected in 150 channels. Each measurement took less than 5 min to minimize a time-dependent decay of photoproducts. The fluorescence decays were fit to a double exponential using the commercial PTI program FeliX32, and average fluorescence lifetimes 〈τ〉 were determined as previously described (〈τ〉 = α1τ1 + α2τ2, where α1 and α2 are the fractional amplitudes of each lifetime τ1 and τ2, respectively) (33Sommer M.E. Smith W.C. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6861-6871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reduction of the disulfide bond between PDT-bimane and rhodopsin and parapinopsin was carried out as previously described (32Mansoor S.E. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9426-9438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin mutants in which the second and/or third cytoplasmic loop were swapped between each other was prepared as previously reported (29Terakita A. Yamashita T. Nimbari N. Kojima D. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The second cytoplasmic loop is the region from position 134 to position 152 in bovine rhodopsin numbering system, and the third loop is the region from position 231 to position 252 (see Fig. 1A). Functionality was measured using a radionucleotide filter binding assay, which measures GDP/guanosine GTPγS exchange by Gi (29Terakita A. Yamashita T. Nimbari N. Kojima D. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The assay mixture consisted of 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 140 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm [35S]GTPγS, and 4 μm GDP. The samples were either irradiated or kept in the dark and then mixed immediately with Gi solution (final concentration of 600 nm). A cysteine residue was introduced at position 227, 244, 250, or 251 of bovine rhodopsin (Rho) and parapinopsin (Para) (Fig. 1, A and D) in a background mutant in which reactive cysteines were mutated to alanine or serine. These sites were chosen because spin labels at these positions in bovine rhodopsin were previously shown to detect conformational changes upon light activation (11Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Each cysteine was labeled with the fluorescent probe monobromobimane (mBBr), as this probe has previously been used to detect conformational changes in bovine rhodopsin (13Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the β-adrenergic receptor (5Rosenbaum D.M. Cherezov V. Hanson M.A. Rasmussen S.G. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Choi H.J. Yao X.J. Weis W.I. Stevens R.C. Kobilka B.K. Science. 2007; 318: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” these cysteine mutants were expressed and purified, and mBBr was attached to the cysteine residue (Fig. 1E). The labeling efficiency of each mutant indicated specific bimane labeling (see “Experimental Procedures”). Hereafter, the mutants labeled with mBBr are named by the number of the residue and the suffix B1. We first analyzed light-dependent changes in the wavelength of maximum emission intensity (λmax) for the bimane-labeled mutants, as the λmax value of bimane reflects the local polarity surrounding its attachment site on the surface of a protein (32Mansoor S.E. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9426-9438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Mansoor S.E. McHaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Photoactivation of the bovine rhodopsin mutants produced an ∼14-nm red-shift in the λmax for mutant 244B1 and an ∼7-nm blue-shift in the λmax for mutant 227B1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Essentially no shift was observed for mutants 250B1 and 251B1 (Fig. 2, C and D). A qualitatively similar pattern of shifts was observed upon photoactivation of the parapinopsin mutants, except that wavelength shifts were smaller (Fig. 2, E–H), with the parapinopsin mutant 244B1 showing an ∼4-nm red-shift and mutant 227B1 showing an ∼1-nm blue-shift. These results suggest a similar, but not identical light-induced conformational change occurs in both rhodopsins, with the magnitude of change appearing smaller for the parapinopsin mutant. Interestingly, upon activation, a relatively small red-shift (∼5 nm) was observed for a bimane probe at the equivalent 244 site on the β-adrenergic receptor under similar conditions (5Rosenbaum D.M. Cherezov V. Hanson M.A. Rasmussen S.G. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Choi H.J. Yao X.J. Weis W.I. Stevens R.C. Kobilka B.K. Science. 2007; 318: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). There are subtle differences in absolute λmax values of the respective mutants between two rhodopsins, which might either be because of differences in environment around the introduced fluorescent probe or may be partially caused by the differences in the conditions of the ionic lock between helices III and VI (see “Discussion”). Because our data cannot rule out either interpretation, here we focus on light-induced changes of λmax. We further investigated these light-induced structural changes by measuring the susceptibility of each probe to collision with the water-soluble fluorescence quenching agent KI. Probe accessibility is often analyzed using a Stern-Volmer plot, which shows the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence (Fo) and presence (Fi) of quencher as a function of quencher concentration. The slope of the plot is named Ksv. Indeed, changes in the Ksv upon photoactivation of bovine rhodopsin and parapinopsin were detected (Fig. 3, A–H). In rhodopsin studies Ksv values provide only limited information on probe accessibility as Ksv depends not only on the collision rate of the probe with quenching agent but also on the fluorescence lifetime of the probe.

https://openalex.org/W2113641572,"Tetraspanin CD82 suppresses cell migration, tumor invasion, and tumor metastasis. To determine the mechanism by which CD82 inhibits motility, most studies have focused on the cell surface CD82, which forms tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) with other transmembrane proteins, such as integrins. In this study, we found that CD82 undergoes endocytosis and traffics to endosomes and lysosomes. To determine the endocytic mechanism of CD82, we demonstrated that dynamin and clathrin are not essential for CD82 internalization. Depletion or sequestration of sterol in the plasma membrane markedly inhibited the endocytosis of CD82. Despite the demand on Cdc42 activity, CD82 endocytosis is distinct from macropinocytosis and the documented dynamin-independent pinocytosis. As a TEM component, CD82 reorganizes TEMs and lipid rafts by redistributing cholesterol into these membrane microdomains. CD82-containing TEMs are characterized by the cholesterol-containing microdomains in the extreme light- and intermediate-density fractions. Moreover, the endocytosis of CD82 appears to alleviate CD82-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that lipid-dependent endocytosis drives CD82 trafficking to late endosomes and lysosomes, and CD82 reorganizes TEMs and lipid rafts through redistribution of cholesterol."

Recently, DLX5 was reported to act as an oncogene in lymphomas and lung cancers, although the mechanism is not known. The identification of target genes of DLX5 can facilitate our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms driven by overexpression of DLX5. The MYC oncogene is aberrantly expressed in many human cancers and regulates transcription of numerous target genes involved in tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate by luciferase assay that the MYC promoter is specifically activated by overexpression of DLX5 and that two DLX5 binding sites in the MYC promoter are important for transcriptional activation of MYC. We also show that DLX5 binds to the MYC promoter both in vitro and in vivo and that transfection of a DLX5 expression plasmid promotes the expression of MYC in a dose-dependent manner in mammalian cells. Furthermore, overexpression of DLX5 results in increased cell proliferation by up-regulating MYC. Knockdown of DLX5 in lung cancer cells overexpressing DLX5 resulted in decreased expression of MYC and reduced cell proliferation, which was rescued by overexpression of MYC.

All cDNAs were synthesized by using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT). Total RNA samples were treated with TURBO DNA-free (Ambion) to remove possible contaminating DNA. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop UV spectrophotometer and reverse-transcribed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion) with a mixture of anchored oligo(dT) and random decamers. Aliquots of cDNAs were used for PCR. Real time Taqman PCR assays were performed using an ABI 7900 HT instrument. The primers and dual labeled 6FAM and BHQ1 (Black Hole Quencher) probes for human DLX5, mouse Dlx5, and actin were designed using Primer ExpressTM version 1.5 software from Applied Biosystems. Assays-on-Demand from Applied Biosystems were used for human ACTIN (assay ID number Hs99999903_m1), human MYC (assay ID number Hs00153408_m1), and mouse Myc (assay ID number, Mm00487803_m1). PCR master mix from Applied Biosystems was used for PCR. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 (two-step) cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s). A 4-fold dilution standard curve established with a calibrator sample was used to convert the Ct values into quantities. For each sample, the values were averages from two PCRs performed with two different amounts of total RNA in the RT reaction.

An Amaxa Nucleofector kit V was used to transfect the DLX5 plasmid into Jurkat cells, using the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were centrifuged in 15-ml conical tubes. Cell pellets were suspended in Nucleofector solution V with DLX5 plasmids (or empty vector) in the indicated amounts. The mixture was then transferred to a cuvette and processed using program X-001 of the Amaxa Nucleofector II system. Cells were transferred immediately into prewarmed media using pipettes provided by the manufacturer and then placed in culture. Cells were harvested at the indicated time point(s) with either radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer for protein analysis or the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen) for RNA extraction. HeLa cells or HEK293 cells at 90% confluence were washed with PBS once and trypsinized. Then 2 × 106 cells were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution R (Amaxa, Nucleofector kit R) with plasmids pCMV-Renilla luciferase (0.5 μg; Promega), pGL2-XNM-Luc, or pGL2 SNM-Luc (4 μg each) and pcDNA3.1-DLX5 or pcDNA3.1 (4 μg each). All samples were processed using program I-13 and immediately transferred into 6 ml of warm culture media. Each 6-ml sample was evenly plated into three wells of a 6-well plate (2 ml/well). 12 h following transfection, the media were replaced with normal media. Cell extracts were collected in 200 μl of 1× Passive Lysis Buffer 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was evaluated using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). ChIP assays were performed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-DLX5. After 48 h, these cells (or untransfected NCI-H322M cells, which overexpress DLX5) were used for cross-linking of histones to DNA by the addition of formaldehyde. Cells were then washed and centrifuged, and then the cell pellet was suspended in SDS lysis buffer. The lysates were sonicated to shear DNA into fragments of 200–1000 base pairs. The samples were diluted 10-fold in ChIP Dilution Buffer, and the sheared chromatin was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of either anti-DLX5 (C-20) antibody or goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Then 60 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry) was added; after rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, the antibody-histone complex was collected. The immunoprecipitated chromatin complexes were washed and eluted with freshly prepared elution buffer. Following the reversal of cross-links, the DNA was extracted, resuspended in water, and used as template for subsequent PCRs. The primer sequences for endogenous human MYC promoter were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCTCCGCCCACCGGCCCTTTATAATGCGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGTTCTTTTTCCCGCCAAGC-3′. The primer sequences for upstream negative control were as follows: forward primer, 5′-AACTCCTCTTTCTTCGGACCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACCAATCGCTATGCTGGATT-3′. The primer sequences for downstream negative control were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TTCACTAAGTGCGTCTCCGA-3′, reverse primer, 5′-TCCTGTTGGTGAAGCTAACG-3′. PCR products were checked on agarose gel and confirmed by sequencing. Gel shift assays were performed by using a kit from Promega. Recombinant protein DLX5 (Prosci) was incubated in a reaction containing 1× gel shift binding buffer in a volume of 9 μl for 10 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the MYC promoter region (as shown under “Results”). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 2 μl of 5× TBE loading buffer was added to each reaction. The samples were loaded onto a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) and run at 300 V for 15 min. The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Whole cell extract proteins (20 μg) were separated electrophoretically on 4–12% Novex Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), blocked in 5% nonfat milk with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were probed with different antibodies, as indicated. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film or captured by the FluorchemTM SP imaging system (Alpha Innotech). All immunoblot experiments were performed at least three times. In previous studies of thymic lymphomas from Lck-Myr-Akt2 mice, we reported a novel recurrent inv(6) that leads to robust expression of Dlx5 (36Tan Y. Timakhov R.A. Rao M. Altomare D.A. Xu J. Liu Z. Gao Q. Jhanwar S.C. Di Cristofano A. Wiest D.L. Knepper J.E. Testa J.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Myc expression was consistently up-regulated in tumors from mice harboring the inv(6) (Fig. 1). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that Myc expression may be regulated, at least in part, by Dlx5. To test this hypothesis, we performed the following series of experiments. We initially analyzed the conventional MYC promoter (12Han Y. San-Marina S. Liu J. Minden M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6933-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and we identified four putative homeobox binding sites having the core binding sequence TAAT. In this report, these sites are designated D1, D2, D3, and D4 (Fig. 2, A and D), and the mutated binding sites are referred to as M1, M2, M3, and M4, respectively (Fig. 2D). The luciferase constructs (dubbed SNM-Luc and XNM-Luc) used in this investigation for the MYC promoter activity assay have been reported elsewhere (12Han Y. San-Marina S. Liu J. Minden M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6933-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SNM-Luc contains the entire conventional MYC promoter region, including the major transcription start sites P1 and P2 (39Hay N. Bishop J.M. Levens D. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas XNM-Luc contains only the P2 site. In HeLa cells, transient transfection of DLX5 together with XNM-Luc or SNM-Luc resulted in a 3- or 2-fold increase, respectively, in MYC promoter activity (Fig. 2B). In HEK293T cells, co-transfection of DLX5 with XNM-Luc or SNM-Luc resulted in a 2.7- or 1.8-fold increase, respectively, in MYC promoter activity (Fig. 2, B and C). These data suggest that DLX5 can directly regulate MYC transcription. Our site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that mutations in D1 and D4 binding sites can inhibit MYC transcriptional activation (Fig. 2, E and F). MYC promoter activity was assayed by transient transfection of DLX5 together with XNM-Luc or SNM-Luc. Interestingly, when the D4 binding site in either XNM-Luc or SNM-Luc was mutated, the MYC promoter did not respond to overexpression of DLX5. Likewise, when the MYC promoter was mutated from D1 to M1 in the SNM-Luc construct, impaired transcription was observed, whereas M2 and M3 mutations did not inhibit MYC promoter activity induced by DLX5. Collectively, these data suggest that the binding sites D1 and D4, but not D2 and D3, are important for the maintenance of MYC promoter activation in response to DLX5. To investigate whether DLX5 can directly bind to the MYC promoter, we employed a gel shift assay and a ChIP assay. Individual DNA probes corresponding to the four DLX5 binding sites within the MYC promoter region (Fig. 2D) were used to perform the gel shift assay. These probes were labeled by ATP (α-32P) and incubated with recombinant human DLX5 protein. Each probe was found to bind to recombinant DLX5 protein, and the binding was competed by an excess molar concentration of unlabeled probe. When an anti-DLX5 antibody together with recombinant human DLX5 protein were added into the reaction, we detected a supershift of the DNA probe. No band was detected by adding anti-DLX5 antibody alone into the reaction, indicating that the supershift is DLX5-specific. These results imply that DLX5 binds to the MYC promoter in vitro (Fig. 3A). In addition, ChIP assays were carried out in HeLa cells transiently transfected with DLX5 or in NCI-H322M cells, which express high endogenous levels of DLX5. Following ChIP with a DLX5 antibody, PCR analysis using specific primers against the MYC promoter revealed a single PCR amplification product. Sequence analysis confirmed that the PCR products represented a portion of the MYC promoter. No PCR band was detected when goat IgG was used in the ChIP assay. Importantly, PCR analysis using specific primers against upstream or downstream sequences of the MYC promoter did not show bands in ChIP samples (Fig. 3B). Thus, these findings suggest that DLX5 can directly bind to the MYC promoter in vivo. To test whether DLX5 can regulate MYC expression, we performed a series of transient transfection experiments. In Jurkat cells, overexpression of DLX5 resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the expression of MYC protein (Fig. 4A) as well as a 1.6-fold increase in MYC mRNA. These findings suggest that expression of DLX5 can up-regulate MYC expression. To further confirm that DLX5 can regulate the expression of MYC, we tested MYC expression in Jurkat cells transfected with increasing amounts of DLX5 expression plasmids. Parallel increases in MYC protein levels (Fig. 4C) and MYC mRNA levels (Fig. 4D) were observed. These data indicate that up-regulation of MYC correlates with expression of DLX5. We next tested whether expression of DLX5 can promote cell proliferation by directly regulating the expression of MYC. Transient transfection of DLX5 into Jurkat cells resulted in a ∼2.5-fold or 6-fold increase in cell proliferation at 24 or 48 h, respectively. However, when cells were transfected with both DLX5 and siRNAs against MYC, cell proliferation increased only about 1.5- or 3.5-fold at 24 or 48 h, respectively, which was similar to that of cells transfected with empty vector alone. On the other hand, when the cells were transfected with both DLX5 and non-targeting siRNA, the cell proliferation rate was similar to that observed with DLX5 alone. Transient transfection of MYC into Jurkat cells led to a similar enhancement in cell proliferation (Fig. 4E). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that MYC expression can be significantly up-regulated by transient transfection of DLX5 in Jurkat cells. When Jurkat cells were transfected with both DLX5 and siRNA against MYC, the expression level of MYC decreased to about the same level seen in cells transfected with vector alone, whereas in cells co-transfected with DLX5 and non-targeting siRNA, expression of MYC was comparable with that observed in cells transfected with DLX5 alone (Fig. 5F). Thus, these data strongly suggest that DLX5 accelerates cell proliferation by regulating the expression of MYC. NCI-H322M, NCI-H520, and NCI-H23 human lung cancer cells express high levels of DLX5. Stealth select siRNAs against DLX5 or non-targeting siRNA from Invitrogen were transfected into these cells by using the Amaxa Nucleofector System. To test the transfection efficiency, siRNA conjugated with fluorescein was introduced into cells. After transfection for 24 h, the cells with positive fluorescence were counted under a fluorescence microscope, which revealed a transfection efficiency of nearly 100% (data not shown). To test whether inhibition of the expression of DLX5 diminishes the expression of MYC, we performed real time RT-PCR analysis on NCI-H322M, NCI-H520, and NCI-H23 cells transfected with siRNA against DLX5. To minimize the possibility that expression of MYC could be affected by cell cycle progression, we analyzed early time points (i.e. 16 and 24 h) after transfection (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, MYC transcription was rapidly inhibited following transfection of siRNA against DLX5 in all of the three lung cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5A, transfection of NCI-H322M cells with stealth siRNA against DLX5 resulted in ∼90% knockdown of DLX5 16 or 24 h after transfection, whereas MYC mRNA expression was decreased ∼40%. In NCI-H520 cells, the expression of DLX5 was diminished about 70% after transfection with siRNA against DLX5, whereas MYC mRNA expression was decreased by nearly 40%. About 80% knockdown of DLX5 and 20% decrease of MYC mRNA were observed in NCI-H23 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of DLX5 in lung cancer cells also resulted in decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 5B). Cell proliferation was reduced by ∼50% in NCI-H322M and NCI-H520 cells following knockdown of DLX5 compared with ∼40% in NCI-H23 cells. Importantly, the reduction in cell proliferation caused by knockdown of DLX5 was rescued by overexpression of MYC (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these findings suggest that DLX5 regulates cell proliferation, at least in part, by reducing MYC expression. The Dlx5 and Dlx6 homeobox genes are co-expressed in all skeletal structures found in midgestation embryos after the initial formation of cartilage. Subsequent studies revealed that Dlx5 can be induced by BMP and is involved in osteoblast differentiation; furthermore, knock-out studies have confirmed that Dlx5 plays an important role in bone formation (24Robledo R.F. Rajan L. Li X. Lufkin T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Recently, overexpression of DLX5 was reported in human lymphomas and lung cancers and has been proposed to act as an oncogene (36Tan Y. Timakhov R.A. Rao M. Altomare D.A. Xu J. Liu Z. Gao Q. Jhanwar S.C. Di Cristofano A. Wiest D.L. Knepper J.E. Testa J.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Kato T. Sato N. Takano A. Miyamoto M. Nishimura H. Tsuchiya E. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 2363-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, we showed that Dlx5 can enhance the proliferation of JML-5 lymphoma cells as well as promote anchorage-independent growth of Rat-1 fibroblasts. Furthermore, Dlx5 was found to cooperate with activated Akt2 kinase to promote increased soft agar colony formation in Rat-1 fibroblasts (36Tan Y. Timakhov R.A. Rao M. Altomare D.A. Xu J. Liu Z. Gao Q. Jhanwar S.C. Di Cristofano A. Wiest D.L. Knepper J.E. Testa J.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, overexpression of DLX5 in lung tumors correlated with a poor prognosis. Proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro was inhibited by specific siRNA against DLX5 (37Kato T. Sato N. Takano A. Miyamoto M. Nishimura H. Tsuchiya E. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 2363-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MYC plays pivotal roles in controlling various cellular functions, such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and senescence, by regulating the expression of numerous target genes (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Deregulated MYC expression resulting from upstream oncogenic signals leads to constitutive activation of MYC in a variety of cancers to promote tumorigenesis. In an earlier study of thymic lymphomas from Akt2 transgenic mice, we reported overexpression of Dlx5 due to a rearrangement that places the Dlx5 locus near the Tcrb enhancer (36Tan Y. Timakhov R.A. Rao M. Altomare D.A. Xu J. Liu Z. Gao Q. Jhanwar S.C. Di Cristofano A. Wiest D.L. Knepper J.E. Testa J.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An analysis of global gene expression in these tumors revealed that Myc was consistently up-regulated compared with that observed in wild-type T cells. To confirm overexpression of Myc in the thymic lymphomas, real time RT-PCR analysis was performed on fresh (uncultured) T-cell tumors and control T cells harvested from wild-type mice at the same age (Fig. 1). Since numerous oncogenic transcription factors appear to regulate the expression of Myc (12Han Y. San-Marina S. Liu J. Minden M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6933-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 14Wierstra I. Alves J. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4645-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that overexpression of Dlx5 might up-regulate Myc and accelerate lymphoma progression in our mouse model. Here, we have used luciferase reporter assays to demonstrate that DLX5 can indeed regulate MYC promoter activity (Fig. 2). The fact that DLX5 binds to the MYC promoter both in vitro (Fig. 3A) and in vivo (Fig. 3B) suggests that DLX5 regulates MYC transcriptional activity. In addition, we have identified two DLX5 binding sites, D1 and D4, which appear to be important in regulating MYC expression. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, transient transfection of DLX5 in Jurkat results in significant up-regulation of MYC. Furthermore, we observed that in Jurkat cells, expression of the ornithine decarboxylase gene, ODC1, a transcriptional target of MYC, was also up-regulated by DLX5 (data not shown). Moreover, DLX5 regulates the expression of MYC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, our findings indicate that DLX5 can specifically bind to the MYC promoter, resulting in elevated expression of MYC. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLCs showed that positive staining for DLX5 correlates with increased tumor size and poor prognosis and was an independent prognostic factor (37Kato T. Sato N. Takano A. Miyamoto M. Nishimura H. Tsuchiya E. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 2363-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment of NSCLC cells with siRNAs against DLX5 effectively knocked down its expression and suppressed cell proliferation. Intriguingly, it is reported that overexpression of MYC is very common in NSCLC (40Cline M.J. Battifora H. Cancer. 1987; 60: 2669-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We identified three NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H322M, NCI-H520, and NCI-H23, with high expression of DLX5, and knockdown of DLX5 in these cells resulted in a decreased expression of MYC and decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 5, A and B). To exclude the possibility that decreased cell proliferations in siRNA-treated cells were due to apoptosis, we analyzed caspase 3 in those cells and found that the expressions of cleaved caspase 3 showed no significant difference between siRNA-transfected cells and normal cells (Fig. 5D). Since it is well known that MYC controls cellular proliferation, we had hypothesized that DLX5 might regulate cell proliferation via transcriptional regulation of MYC. Indeed, inhibition of MYC by siRNA inhibited the proliferative effects of DLX5 expression in Jurkat cells. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of MYC in Jurkat cells resulted in a similar enhancement of proliferation as DLX5 in this assay (Fig. 4, E and F). However, MYC may not be the only target of DLX5 responsible for enhanced proliferation connected with oncogenesis, because knockdown of DLX5 by 80–90% resulted in only a 20–40% decrease in MYC transcription and a ∼50% decrease in cell proliferation (Fig. 5, A and B). It is noteworthy that a growing number of homeobox genes are deregulated in cancers (25Abate-Shen C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 26Samuel S. Naora H. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2428-2437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Hennessy B.T. Mills G.B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since homeobox genes share the same DNA binding motif and can have multiple targets, it is likely that the number of targets of DLX5 involved in tumorigenesis will increase. Thus, in future investigations, we plan to use ChIP-on-chip assays to identify other potential targets of DLX5 that may contribute to increased cell proliferation. Because of its involvement in many different types of cancer, including lymphoma, lung cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, and pancreatic cancer, many investigators have conducted preclinical studies to explore the possibility of targeting Myc (15Pelengaris S.

Science. 2002; 297: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, small molecule inhibitors of MYC have had limited effectiveness in human cancer cells (20Huang M.J. Cheng Y.C.

Anticancer Drugs. 2007; 18: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlike MYC, DLX5 has a restricted pattern of expression in adult tissues (37Kato T. Sato N. Takano A. Miyamoto M. Nishimura H. Tsuchiya E. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 2363-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and thus targeting DLX5 may prove to be more efficacious in the treatment of a subset of tumors that co-express elevated levels of these transcription factors.

https://openalex.org/W2121062485,"Antithrombin, a major regulator of coagulation and angiogenesis, is known to interact with several natural sulfated polysaccharides. Previously, we prepared sulfated low molecular weight variants of natural lignins, called sulfated dehydrogenation polymers (DHPs) (Henry, B. L., Monien, B. H., Bock, P. E., and Desai, U. R. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 31891-31899), which have now been found to exhibit interesting antithrombin binding properties. Sulfated DHPs represent a library of diverse noncarbohydrate aromatic scaffolds that possess structures completely different from heparin and heparan sulfate. Fluorescence binding studies indicate that sulfated DHPs bind to antithrombin with micromolar affinity under physiological conditions. Salt dependence of binding affinity indicates that the antithrombin-sulfated DHP interaction involves a massive 80-87% non-ionic component to the free energy of binding. Competitive binding studies with heparin pentasaccharide, epicatechin sulfate, and full-length heparin indicate that sulfated DHPs bind to both the pentasaccharide-binding site and extended heparin-binding site of antithrombin. Affinity capillary electrophoresis resolves a limited number of peaks of antithrombin co-complexes suggesting preferential binding of selected DHP structures to the serpin. Computational genetic algorithm-based virtual screening study shows that only one sulfated DHP structure, out of the 11 present in a library of plausible sequences, bound in the heparin-binding site with a high calculated score supporting selectivity of recognition. Enzyme inhibition studies indicate that only one of the three sulfated DHPs studied is a potent inhibitor of free factor VIIa in the presence of antithrombin. Overall, the chemo-enzymatic origin and antithrombin binding properties of sulfated DHPs present novel opportunities for potent and selective modulation of the serpin function, especially for inhibiting the initiation phase of hemostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2007427455,"Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by hearing loss, branchial arch defects, and renal anomalies. Recently, eight mutations in the SIX1 homeobox gene were discovered in BOR patients. To characterize the effect of SIX1 BOR mutations on the EYA-SIX1-DNA complex, we expressed and purified six of the eight mutants in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that only the most N-terminal mutation in SIX1 (V17E) completely abolishes SIX1-EYA complex formation, whereas all of the other mutants are able to form a stable complex with EYA. We further show that only the V17E mutant fails to localize EYA to the nucleus and cannot be stabilized by EYA in the cell. The remaining five SIX1 mutants are instead all deficient in DNA binding. In contrast, V17E alone has a DNA binding affinity similar to that of wild type SIX1 in complex with the EYA co-factor. Finally, we show that all SIX1 BOR mutants are defective in transcriptional activation using luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that the SIX1 BOR mutations contribute to the pathology of the disease through at least two different mechanisms that involve: 1) abolishing the formation of the SIX1-EYA complex or 2) diminishing the ability of SIX1 to bind DNA. Furthermore, our data demonstrate for the first time that EYA: 1) requires the N-terminal region of the SIX1 Six domain for its interaction, 2) increases the level of the SIX1 protein within the cell, and 3) increases the DNA binding affinity of SIX1.

U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11974-11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and a highly conserved ∼270-amino acid C-terminal Eya domain (ED), also referred to as the eya homologous region. The ED possesses phosphatase activity (6Rayapureddi J.P. Kattamuri C. Steinmetz B.D. Frankfort B.J. Ostrin E.J. Mardon G. Hegde R.S.

The SIX family of homeoproteins are characterized by a DNA-binding homeodomain (HD) and the protein-interaction Six domain (SD), which binds directly to the ED of EYA (9Kawakami K. Sato S. Ozaki H. Ikeda K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). As a complex, the SIX and EYA proteins are believed to form a bipartite transcription factor where SIX confers DNA binding and EYA confers transactivation activity. Recently, mutations in two SIX family members (SIX5 and SIX1) have also been identified in BOR syndrome (13Hoskins B.E. Cramer C.H. Silvius D. Zou D. Raymond R.M. Orten D.J. Kimberling W.J.

Orten D.J. Kimberling W.J. Smith R.J. Weil D. Petit C. Otto E.A. Xu P.X. Hildebrandt F. Am. J. Hum.

In an independent study, Ruf et al. (14Ruf R.G. Berkman J. Wolf M.T. Nurnberg P. Gattas M. Ruf E.M. Hyland V. Kromberg J. Glass I. Macmillan J. Otto E. Nurnberg G. Lucke B. Hennies H.C.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8090-8095Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) identified three mutations in the SIX1 gene, which, like the mutations in the SIX5 gene, were argued to inhibit SIX1-EYA1 binding. In addition, two of the three identified mutations also interfere with SIX1-DNA binding. Five additional novel SIX1 mutations have been subsequently identified, although the effect of these mutations on SIX1 function have not yet been determined (16Kochhar A. Orten D.J. Sorensen J.L. Fischer S.M. Cremers C.W. Kimberling W.J. Smith R.J. Hum. Mutat. 2008; 29: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular mechanism of BOR syndrome caused by SIX1 mutations, we attempted to analyze all eight of the SIX1 BOR mutations that have been identified to date. We report the effects of six of the eight SIX1 BOR mutations on a variety of biological functions including: protein expression, protein stability, protein-protein interaction, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. Significantly, we found that only the most N-terminal mutation in SIX1 (V17E) is able to completely abolish the SIX1-EYA protein interaction, whereas the other five mutations appear to cause major deficiencies in the ability of SIX1 to bind DNA. Finally, we demonstrate that while residing in different regions of the protein, all six SIX1 mutations result in the inability of the complex to activate transcription. Mutations within the human SIX1 cDNA were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using WT human SIX1 in pcDNA-3.1 as a template, and the following primers: V17E (gcaagtggcgtgcgAgtgcgaggttctg), H73P (gatcctggagagccCccagttctcgcctc), V106G (ccctgggcgccgGgggcaaatatcg), R110Q (gtgggcaaatatcAggtgcgccgaaaa), R110W (gtgggcaaatatTgggtgcgccgaaaa), R112C (gcaaatatcgggtgTgccgaaaatttcc), Y129C (gaggagaccagctGctgcttcaaggagaag), and del133E (cagctactgcttcaagaagtcgaggggtgtc). Generation of all mutants was confirmed by sequencing. Bacterial expression plasmids were generated by subcloning the PCR products into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6P1 (GE Healthcare) vector and were sequenced. pGEX-6P1 vectors were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain XA-90. Two independent clones for each mutant were used for small scale expression tests by inoculating 1 ml of LB medium with an overnight culture and grown at 37 °C for 2 h. Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was analyzed by electrophoresis of cell lysates on a 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. All SIX1 proteins were expressed in E. coli at room temperature by inducing protein expression for 4 h at an A600 value of 0.8–1.0 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell pellets were lysed by sonication in precooled lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP) containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and leupeptin. The supernatant was then treated with 0.4% polyethyleneimine to precipitate out contaminating DNA, which was pelleted by centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was then purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare), and the fusion proteins were cleaved with PreScission protease. The SIX1 protein was further purified by ion exchange using a RESOURCE S column (GE Healthcare) and the following buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP) and buffer B (same as buffer A but with 1 m NaCl). Purified proteins were adjusted to 5 mm TCEP, pH 8.0, and stored at −80 °C. For EYA2 ED, after PreScission protease cleavage, the protein preparation was purified using a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP. Purified protein was adjusted to 5 mm TCEP and stored at −80 °C. The secondary structure contents of the purified proteins was assessed by CD spectroscopy using a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Inc). CD measurements were carried out in a 1-mm cuvette at 18 °C with a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. Each spectrum was the average of six wavelength scans collected from 196–250 nm in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP. Molar ellipticity was calculated using the following equation,[0]=0obs*/(CIn)(Eq. 1) where 0obs is the observed ellipticity (mdeg), C is protein concentration (m), l is the cuvette path length (mm), and n is the number of residues in the protein. Protein thermal stability was determined by monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm with increasing temperature. CD data points were obtained at a scan rate of 2 °C/min for the temperature range of 5–85 °C and plotted as the fraction of protein folded versus temperature. All SIX1 protein preparations were run alone or in the presence of the ED on an analytical Superdex 200 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP. The proteins were run alone at 30 μm or mixed at the same concentration with the ED in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated together on ice for 15 min prior to loading on the column. The gel filtration profiles were overlaid to reveal the elution volumes of the proteins alone, and the complex. SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining was carried out on the “complex” peak fractions to demonstrate the presence of both proteins. Reverse phase HPLC was used to confirm the presence of both proteins in the complex peak. Analytical reverse phase HPLC was performed with a linear gradient of eluents A (0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) on a Zorbax SB300-C18 (2.1 × 150 mm) column. Prior to loading, the peak fraction was diluted 10-fold with eluent A. MCF7 cells were cultured onto 10-cm dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were co-transfected with 8 μg/dish of the indicated Six1 mutant construct and pcDNA3.1 FLAG-Eya2 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For the EYA1 nuclear localization experiments, the pCMVTag2-FLAG-Eya1 construct was used. After 48 h nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were generated using the NE-PER nuclear/cytoplasmic kit (Thermo Scientific). Equal protein amounts were run out on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma). SIX1 expression levels were assessed by reprobing membranes with anti-SIX1 antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents). To demonstrate equal loading, the membranes were then probed with either anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz) or anti-α-actin antibodies (Sigma). 8 × 104 MCF7 cells/well were plated in 12-well plates. The cells were transfected with 250 ng of pcDNA3.1-Six1 and 250 ng of FLAG vector or 250 ng of pcDNA3.1-Six1 and 250 ng of FLAG-Eya2 using the FuGENE transfection method. After 48 h the cell lysates and RNA were isolated. The cell lysates were obtained using lysis buffer PLB (Promega). 40 μg of lysate were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with an anti-SIX1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) and to ensure that equal loading the membrane was reprobed with an anti-α-actin antibody (Sigma). To examine alterations in the message level, RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μg of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was carried out for Six1 and cyclophilin B (control) using TaqMan gene expression assays on demand (Applied Biosystems) (Six1 Hs00195590_m1, cyclophilin B Hs01018503_m1). The reactions were carried out in triplicate using the Bio-Rad CFX96 real time system. Six1 expression levels were normalized to cyclophilin B. All of the oligonucleotides (Operon) were ordered HPLC-purified. The oligonucleotides used were a fragment of the myogenin promoter containing the SIX1 binding MEF3 site (GGGGGCTCAGGTTTCTGTGGC) and a second oligonucleotide with this MEF3 site scrambled (GGGGGCATGCTGCTCTGTGGC). The oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified using CENTRI-SEP columns (Princeton Separations). The reactions were assembled on ice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 200 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm TCEP, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol. 4 fmol of oligonucleotide was used along with 750 fmol of protein. For the reactions that include the ED, 750 fmol of the SIX1 protein was mixed with 750 fmol of the ED before the addition of DNA. For the Kd determination, varied quantities of SIX1 or SIX1 and ED were used (7500, 3750, 1500, 750, 375, 150, 75, 37.5, and 15 fmol) while holding the DNA quantity constant at 4 fmol/reaction. For competition reactions the wild type oligonucleotide or the scrambled version at 200× concentration (800 fmol/reaction) was used. Electrophoresis was carried out for 90 min at 60 volts at 4 °C using a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were then dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging plate and visualized using a Storm phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). MCF7 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at 25,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, the cells were transfected with 300 ng/well pGL3–6×MEF3, 70 ng/well Renilla luciferase, 100 ng/well of the indicated pcDNA3.1 Six1 mutant construct, and 150 ng/well of either pcDNA3.1 FLAG-Eya2 or empty vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent. The cells were lysed 48 h later with passive lysis buffer, and the resulting extracts were analyzed for luciferase and Renilla activities. To ensure expression of exogenous SIX1 protein, equal amounts of protein were run out on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were probed with an anti-SIX1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), and to ensure equal loading the membranes were reprobed with anti-α-actin (Sigma). All eight identified SIX1 BOR mutations, including seven mis-sense mutations and one in-frame deletion, reside in either the SD or the HD (Fig. 1). To precisely define the molecular mechanism(s) by which these mutations compromise SIX1 function, we generated the eight mutations using site-directed mutagenesis. Wild type human SIX1 and the eight SIX1 mutants were then subcloned into a GST fusion vector in an effort to express these proteins in E. coli for biochemical analyses. Expression tests in E. coli were first performed using GST fusion proteins to determine whether all of the mutant proteins could be expressed effectively. Two independent clones for each mutant were treated with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce protein expression. Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The expression tests demonstrated that the H73P and R110Q mutants failed to express in E. coli, whereas all of the other six mutants were expressed efficiently (Fig. 2A). Therefore, all subsequent data presented will focus on wild type SIX1 and the six SIX1 mutants that were efficiently expressed in E. coli.FIGURE 2Expression and purification of human wild type SIX1 and BOR mutants.

D, SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified protein preparations. 3 μg of protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assure equal purity and quantities for biochemical characterization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subsequent large scale purification of wild type SIX1 and the six SIX1 mutants using glutathione affinity chromatography was carried out, and the GST moiety was removed using PreScission protease (Fig. 2B). The proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography to near homogeneity, as shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie analysis of the peak fractions (Fig. 2C). All of the purified protein preparations used for subsequent analyses were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, which demonstrated similar concentrations and purity (Fig. 2D). To evaluate the impact of the mutations on overall protein structure, we first examined protein secondary structure using CD spectroscopy. In CD spectra, α-helical secondary structure is characterized by strong ellipticity minima at 222 and 208 nm. In highly α-helical proteins, the ellipticity minima at 222 and 208 nm are similar, as is observed with wild type SIX1 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the R112C and delE133 mutations cause a reduction in α-helical structure, whereas the rest of the mutations do not considerably alter the α-helical content of SIX1. To further measure protein stability, CD spectroscopy was used to record the thermal denaturation profiles of wild type SIX1 and the six SIX1 mutant proteins. Both the V106G and R112C mutants demonstrated a significantly decreased melting temperature (Tm) when compared with wild type SIX1 (Tm = 28.2 and 26.8 °C for V106G and R112C, respectively, versus Tm = 34.5 °C for wild type SIX1) (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the V106G and R112C mutants are less stable than wild type SIX1 and the other SIX1 mutants. The decrease in protein stability is not surprising for R112C because it is consistent with the decrease in α-helical content. Although V106G did not disrupt the α-helical content noticeably, it nonetheless appears to have an overall destabilizing effect on the protein in vitro. Following our assessment of the stability of the SIX1 BOR mutants, we evaluated the ability of the same mutants to bind to the EYA co-factor using size exclusion gel filtration chromatography. Consistent with previous reports (8Li X. Oghi K.A. Zhang J. Krones A. Bush K.T. Glass C.K. Nigam S.K. Aggarwal A.K. Maas R. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 2003; 426: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Mutsuddi M. Chaffee B. Cassidy J. Silver S.J. Tootle T.L. Rebay I. Genetics. 2005; 170: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we had difficulty expressing functional recombinant EYA1 in E. coli. However, we were able to easily express and purify the ED of human EYA2. Both mammalian EYA1 and EYA2 can complement Drosophila eya mutations with comparable efficiency (18Bonini N.M. Bui Q.T. Gray-Board G.L. Warrick J.M. Development. 1997; 124: 4819-4826PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bui Q.T. Zimmerman J.E. Liu H. Bonini N.M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 709-720PubMed Google Scholar), and the EYA2 ED, which contains the SIX1-binding region, shares over 90% sequence similarity with the ED of EYA1. Therefore, we used the EYA2 ED (hereafter referred to as ED), for all subsequent in vitro analyses. The elution profiles of wild type SIX1 and the ED alone from an analytical S200 size exclusion column were very similar, with peaks in close proximity, consistent with their similar molecular mass. When wild type SIX1 and the ED were mixed and incubated to allow complex formation prior to analysis on the S200 column, a shifted elution peak corresponding to the SIX1-ED complex was observed, suggesting that the two proteins can form a stable complex. Indeed, examination of the protein content in the complex peak by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining revealed what appeared to be the presence of both wild type SIX1 and the ED (Fig. 4A). Because the molecular weights of the two proteins are similar, making it difficult to resolve them using SDS-PAGE, the complex peak fraction was also analyzed by analytical reverse phase chromatography to confirm the above finding. This analysis demonstrated that both SIX1 and the ED are present, and importantly, that they bind in a 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 4B). We next analyzed the six SIX1 mutants for their ability to bind to the ED. Interestingly, we found that all of the mutants could successfully form a protein complex with the ED except the V17E mutant (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, the R110W, Y129C, and delE133 mutants that were previously shown to be deficient in EYA1 binding using yeast two-hybrid analysis (15Ruf R.G. Xu P.X. Silvius D. Otto E.A. Beekmann F. Muerb U.T. Kumar S. Neuhaus T.J. Kemper M.J. Raymond Jr., R.M. Brophy P.D. Berkman J. Gattas M. Hyland V. Ruf E.M. Schwartz C. Chang E.H. Smith R.J. Stratakis C.A. Weil D. Petit C. Hildebrandt F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8090-8095Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) were able to bind the ED in our assay. Although the R112C-ED complex formation appears reduced, this is likely due to the large amount of R112C protein that is lost in the void volume, which is consistent with its decreased secondary structure content and stability. Together, these results indicate that only the V17E mutation abolishes SIX1-ED binding in vitro. Previous reports have demonstrated that EYA, which is localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of SIX1, is translocated to the nucleus by SIX1 (20Ohto H. Kamada S. Tago K. Tominaga S.I. Ozaki H. Sato S. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 21Buller C. Xu X. Marquis V. Schwanke R. Xu P.X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2775-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the intracellular distribution of full-length FLAG-tagged EYA2 after transfection into MCF7 cells in the presence of either wild type SIX1 or each of the six SIX1 BOR mutants to assess whether proper complex formation is taking place within the cell. Using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation, we observed cytoplasmic EYA2 localization in the absence of SIX1 (Fig. 5A, no SIX1). In contrast, the addition of wild type SIX1 led to predominantly nuclear localization of EYA2 as expected (Fig. 5A, WT). Similarly, the V106G, R110W, R112C, Y129C, and delE133 mutants were all able to localize the majority of EYA2 in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, V106G, R110W, R112C, Y129C, and delE133). However, when the SIX1 V17E mutant was co-expressed with EYA2, no detectable level of EYA2 could be found in the nucleus, similar to the control lane that lacked SIX1 expression (Fig. 5a, V17E and no SIX1). Instead, all visible EYA2 was localized in the cytoplasm. These data further suggest that V17E is the only mutation that abolishes the interaction between SIX1 and EYA. Because EYA1, not EYA2, is implicated in BOR syndrome and because previous studies had shown, in contrast to ours, that R110W, Y129C, and delE133 were deficient in EYA1 binding, we tested the ability of wild type SIX1 and the six SIX1 BOR mutants to specifically translocate full-length FLAG-tagged EYA1 to the nucleus. Again, using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation, we observed that in the absence of SIX1, EYA1 was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B, no SIX1). However, in the presence of wild type SIX1, EYA1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, WT). Likewise, V106G, R110W, R112C, Y129C, and delE133 were all able to localize the majority of EYA1 in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, V106G, R110W, R112C, Y129C, and delE133). In contrast, V17E was unable to localize EYA1 in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, V17E). Because these results are consistent with the results obtained with EYA2, our data strongly suggest that V17E is the only mutation that abolishes the interaction between SIX1 and the EYA proteins. In the EYA2 nuclear localization experiments, we observed that co-transfection of EYA2 with wild type SIX1 increases the intracellular quantity of both the SIX1 and EYA2 proteins compared with levels when either protein is expressed alone (data not shown and Fig. 5A). We thus examined whether the levels of the various SIX1 BOR mutants were affected by the presence of EYA2. Interestingly, the levels of all the SIX1 BOR mutants as well as wild type SIX1 are increased with the addition of EYA2, with the exception, again, of the V17E mutant (Fig. 5C). To test whether the increase in SIX1 protein was due to an increase in SIX1 transcription by the SIX1-EYA2 complex increasing SIX1 expression or EYA2 teaming up with endogenous SIX1 (or another SIX family member) to stimulate SIX1 expression, we performed a Western blot in conjunction with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of SIX1 transcript levels. When EYA2 is expressed alone, endogenous SIX1 protein levels are not increased to detectable levels (Fig. 5D, right panel). When SIX1 is exogenously expressed, the addition of EYA2 doe"

Bacteria belonging to this genus are very closely related to those belonging to the genus Escherichia. lacZYA operon and lacI are present in Escherichia coli, but not in Salmonella enterica. It has been proposed that Salmonella has lost lacZYA operon and lacI during evolution. In this study, we have investigated the physiological and evolutionary significance of the absence of lacI in Salmonella enterica. Using murine model of typhoid fever, we show that the expression of LacI causes a remarkable reduction in the virulence of Salmonella enterica. LacI also suppresses the ability of Salmonella enterica to proliferate inside murine macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that LacI interferes with the expression of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. This effect was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Interestingly, we found that SBG0326 of Salmonella bongori is homologous to lacI of Escherichia coli. Salmonella bongori is the only other species of the genus Salmonella and it lacks the virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. Overall, our results demonstrate that LacI is an antivirulence factor of Salmonella enterica and suggest that absence of lacI has facilitated the acquisition of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 in Salmonella enterica making it a successful systemic pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1966954204,"Background Y-SNP haplogroup G (hgG), defined by Y-SNP marker M201, is relatively uncommon in the United States general population, with only 8 additional sub-markers characterized. Many of the previously described eight sub-markers are either very rare (2–4%) or do not distinguish between major populations within this hg. In fact, prior to the current study, only 2% of our reference Caucasian population belonged to hgG and all of these individuals were in sub-haplogroup G2a, defined by P15. Additional Y-SNPs are needed in order to differentiate between individuals within this haplogroup. Principal Findings In this work we have investigated whether we could differentiate between a population of 63 hgG individuals using previously uncharacterized Y-SNPs. We have designed assays to test these individuals using all known hgG SNPs (n = 9) and an additional 16 unreported/undefined Y-SNPS. Using a combination of DNA sequence and genetic genealogy databases, we have uncovered a total of 15 new hgG SNPs that had been previously reported but not phylogenetically characterized. Ten of the new Y-SNPs are phylogenetically equivalent to M201, one is equivalent to P15 and, interestingly, four create new, separate haplogroups. Three of the latter are more common than many of the previously defined Y-SNPs. Y-STR data from these individuals show that DYS385*12 is present in (70%) of G2a3b1-U13 individuals while only 4% of non-G2a3b1-U13 individuals posses the DYS385*12 allele. Conclusions This study uncovered several previously undefined Y-SNPs by using data from several database sources.

We examined here the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) alpha in regulating IL-1-induced Ca2+ signaling in fibroblasts. IL-1 promoted recruitment of PTPalpha to focal adhesions and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fractions, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of the ER Ca2+ release channel IP3R. In response to IL-1, catalytically active PTPalpha was required for Ca2+ release from the ER, Src-dependent phosphorylation of IP3R1 and accumulation of IP3R1 in focal adhesions. In pulldown assays and immunoprecipitations PTPalpha was required for the association of PTPalpha with IP3R1 and c-Src, and this association was increased by IL-1. Collectively, these data indicate that PTPalpha acts as an adaptor to mediate functional links between focal adhesions and the ER that enable IL-1-induced Ca2+ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2101755834,"The second to fourth digit ratio (2D∶4D) is sexually differentiated in a variety of species, including humans, rats, birds, and lizards. In humans, this ratio tends to be lower in males than in females. Lower digit ratios are believed to indicate increased prenatal testosterone exposure, and are associated with more masculinized behavior across a range of traits. The story seems more complicated in laboratory mice. We have previously shown that there is no sex difference in the digit ratios of inbred mice, but found behavioral evidence to suggest that higher 2D∶4D is associated with more masculinized behaviors. Work examining intrauterine position effects show that neighbouring males raise pup digit ratio, suggesting again that higher digit ratios are associated with increased developmental androgens. Other work has suggested that masculinization is associated with lower digit ratios in lab mice. Here, we examine the fore- and hindlimb digit ratios of 20 inbred mouse strains. We find large inter-strain differences, but no sexual dimorphism. Digit ratios also did not correlate with mice behavioral traits. This result calls into question the use of this trait as a broadly applicable indicator for prenatal androgen exposure. We suggest that the inbred mice model presents an opportunity for researchers to investigate the genetic, and gene-environmental influence on the development of digit ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2161486924,"Alternative splicing is tightly regulated in a spatio-temporal and quantitative manner. This regulation is achieved by a complex interplay between spliceosomal (trans) factors that bind to different sequence (cis) elements. cis-elements reside in both introns and exons and may either enhance or silence splicing. Differential combinations of cis-elements allows for a huge diversity of overall splicing signals, together comprising a complex 'splicing code'. Many cis-elements have been identified, and their effects on exon inclusion levels demonstrated in reporter systems. However, the impact of interspecific differences in these elements on the evolution of alternative splicing levels has not yet been investigated at genomic level. Here we study the effect of interspecific differences in predicted exonic splicing regulators (ESRs) on exon inclusion levels in human and chimpanzee. For this purpose, we compiled and studied comprehensive datasets of predicted ESRs, identified by several computational and experimental approaches, as well as microarray data for changes in alternative splicing levels between human and chimpanzee. Surprisingly, we found no association between changes in predicted ESRs and changes in alternative splicing levels. This observation holds across different ESR exon positions, exon lengths, and 5' splice site strengths. We suggest that this lack of association is mainly due to the great importance of context for ESR functionality: many ESR-like motifs in primates may have little or no effect on splicing, and thus interspecific changes at short-time scales may primarily occur in these effectively neutral ESRs. These results underscore the difficulties of using current computational ESR prediction algorithms to identify truly functionally important motifs, and provide a cautionary tale for studies of the effect of SNPs on splicing in human disease."

These long-range interactions that correlate with substrate binding and critically, enzyme turnover, will have broad application to enzyme specificity and drug design for this medically relevant class of enzymes. Sequence-specific modification of DNA is essential for nearly all forms of life and contributes to a myriad of biological processes including gene regulation, mismatch repair, host defense, DNA replication, and genetic imprinting. Methylation of cytosine and adenine bases is a key epigenetic process whereby phenotypic changes are inherited without altering the DNA sequence (1Russo V.E.A. Martienssen R.A. Riggs A.D. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Gene Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1996: 1-69Google Scholar). The central role of the bacterial and mammalian S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineAdoHcyS-adenosylhomocysteineWTwild typeCOGcognateNCnon-cognateNSnonspecific. 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineAdoHcyS-adenosylhomocysteineWTwild typeCOGcognateNCnon-cognateNSnonspecific.-dependent DNA methyltransferases in virulence regulation and tumorigenesis, respectively, have led these enzymes to be validated targets for antibiotic and cancer therapies (2Egger G.

Soc. 2001; 123: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, AdoMet-dependent enzymes catalyze diverse reactions, and the design of potent and selective DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is particularly challenging (4Lee B.H. Yegnasubramanian S. Lin X.

Cancer. 2008; 123: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The design of drugs that bind outside the active site is a particularly attractive means of inhibition for enzymes with common cofactors like AdoMet because off-target inhibition often leads to toxicity (6Christopoulos A. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2002; 1: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, robust methods to identify and characterize such critical binding sites distal from the active site have not been developed. S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine wild type cognate non-cognate nonspecific. S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine wild type cognate non-cognate nonspecific. DNA methyltransferases bind to a particular DNA sequence, stabilize the target base into an extrahelical position within the enzyme active site, and transfer the methyl moiety from AdoMet to the DNA (7Bheemanaik S. Reddy Y.V. Rao D.N. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). During this process, dramatic changes in the DNA structure such as bending, base flipping, or the intercalation of residues into the recognition sequence are often accompanied by large scale protein rearrangements (8Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here we characterized a specific conformational rearrangement of M.HhaI, a model DNA cytosine C5 methyltransferase with a cognate recognition sequence of 5′-GCGC-3′. Many structures of M.HhaI are available at high resolution including an ensemble of complexes with either cognate or nonspecific DNA (9Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 10O'Gara M. Zhang X. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Reorganization of an essential catalytic loop (residues 80–100) is regulated by sequence-specific protein-DNA interactions that occur ∼28 Å away from the catalytic loop (Fig. 1). Our work quantifies the importance of such distal communication in sequence-specific DNA modification and provides plausible structural mechanisms. DNA-dependent positioning of the catalytic loop in M.HhaI was first observed crystallographically; cognate DNA stabilizes the loop-closed conformer, while nonspecific DNA leaves the loop in the open conformer (9Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 10O'Gara M. Zhang X. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Correct positioning of this loop is essential for catalysis because C81, the active site nucleophile that attacks the target cytosine base at the C6 position (supplemental Fig. S1), is ∼9.6 Å away in the loop-open conformer (Fig. 1A). Populating the closed conformer of the loop is essential for tight DNA binding and stabilizing the target cytosine that is flipped out of the DNA duplex (11Estabrook R.A. Lipson R. Hopkins B. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31419-31428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37205-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Youngblood B. Shieh F.K. de Los Rios S. Perona J.J. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor the environment of tryptophan (Trp) residues inserted into the catalytic loop, we recently observed reorganization of this loop upon DNA binding in the absence of cofactor using the M.HhaI mutants W41F, W41F/K91W, and W41F/E94W (12Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37205-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Loop positioning and the interconversion between the open and closed conformers, as determined from the intensities and rates of change in fluorescence signal are highly dependent on DNA sequence and confirm that cognate DNA stabilizes the loop-closed conformer whereas nonspecific DNA stabilizes the open conformer. In this study, W41F/K91W and W41F/E94W M.HhaI were preincubated with cognate (COG), non-cognate (NC), or nonspecific (NS) DNA and mixed with cofactor or cofactor product, AdoMet and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), respectively, in a stopped-flow apparatus. Differences in observed fluorescence intensity are indicative of shifts in the populations of the various loop conformers; no observable fluorescence change suggests no significant change in population and thus, essentially no loop positioning to the closed conformer. Non-cognate and cognate sequences are nearly identical but differ by a single base change, whereas the nonspecific DNA substrate has no similarity to the cognate sequence. As a methyltransferase searches for the cognate site within a genome, it must encounter both non-cognate and nonspecific DNA sequences and be able to distinguish these from the cognate sequence. We examine both binding, using the cofactor product AdoHcy, and catalysis, using the AdoMet cofactor of M.HhaI, with these various DNA substrates. Four mutants of WT M.HhaI were constructed, R240A, W41F, W41F/K91W, and W41F/E94W as previously reported (12Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37205-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Sequenced plasmids were transformed and the enzymes purified using a His6 tag and a nickel column. Enzymes were further purified using a second cation exchange column. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford, SDS-PAGE densitometry, and absorbance at 280 nm. DNA substrates used for kinetic, thermodynamic, and fluorescence studies were all synthesized by Midlands DNA (Midland, TX) and HPLC-purified. The following single strand oligonucleotide sequences were used, COGTOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGGCGCAGTGGGTGGATCCTG-3′, COGBOT: 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCGCGTCACCCACCTAGGAC-5′, MCOGTOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGGMGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′, MCOGBOT: 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCGMGTCACCCACCTAGGAC-5′, NC-1TOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGACGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′, NC-1BOT: 3′-CCCTTAAGTACTGMGTCACCCACCTAGGAC-5′, NC-PURTOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGNCGCAGTGGGTGGATCCTG-3′, NC-2APTOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGPCGCAGTGGGTGGATCCTG-3′, NC-INOTOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGICGCAGTGGGTGGATCCTG-3′, NSTOP: 5′-CAACAACTTCTTCTTCTTCT TCTTCTTCTTCTTCAACAAC-3′, NSBOT: 3′- GTTGTTGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGTTGTTG-5′, and ABTOP: 5′-GGGAATTCATGGBGCAGTGG GTGGATCCTG-3′. Recognition sites are underlined, and target bases are in bold where M is 5-methyl cytosine, P is 2-aminopurine (2AP), I is inosine, B is abasic, and N is nebularine (purine). Duplex substrates were annealed to form UCOG DNA from COGTOP and COGBOT, COG DNA from COGTOP and MCOGBOT, MCOG DNA from MCOGTOP and MCOGBOT, NC-1 DNA from NC-1TOP and NC-1BOT, NC-PUR DNA from NC-PURTOP and MCOGBOT, NC-2AP DNA from NC-2APTOP and MCOGBOT, NC-INO DNA from NC-INOTOP and MCOGBOT, NS DNA from NSTOP and NSBOT, and AB DNA from ABTOP and MCOGBOT. All substrates, except UCOG, MCOG, and NS DNA, are hemi-methylated to force bound enzymes to a single orientation. AdoMet and AdoHcy were purchased from Sigma. For DNA KD measurements, DNA substrates were radiolabeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). All substrate concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using Beer's Law and calculated extinction coefficients (14Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Steady state product formation over time was monitored at 22 °C using a filter binding assay previously described (14Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to determine observed kcat values (supplemental Table S1). These rate constants are only observed kcat values because substrate concentrations were not fully saturating; however, all enzymes were measured under identical conditions. Enzyme (1.9 nm) was added to 3H-labeled AdoMet (6.0 μm) and COG DNA (9.5 μm) in methyltransferase reaction buffer (MRB, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Aliquots were spotted onto 2.3-cm DE-81 filters at 10-min intervals. Washed filters were counted for 3H, and the data were fit to a straight line using SigmaPlot. Samples were analyzed with a Beckman Coulter LS6500 MultiPurpose Scintillation Counter. Kinetic constants for the rate of methyl transfer (kchem) were measured at 22 °C using a single turnover filter binding assay, which was previously described (14Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1). Enzyme (1.0 μm) was added to 3H-labeled AdoMet (4.0 μm) and DNA (500 nm) in MRB with time points taken over 300 s. DNA substrates measured were COG DNA, NC-PUR DNA, NC-2AP DNA, and NC-INO DNA. To quench the reaction, 12 μl of reaction mixture was added to 6 μl of 0.4% SDS with 0.5 m HCl and then neutralized with 6 μl of 0.5 m Tris base, and 20 μl were spotted onto DE-81 filters. To catch time points for WT with COG DNA, a KinTek Corp. RQF-3 rapid quench instrument was required. Quenched reactions from the rapid quench instrument were spotted on filters. Washed filters were counted for 3H, and data were fit to exponential curves using SigmaPlot (Systat). 12% non-denaturing PAGE mobility shifts were used to measure KD values for all DNA substrates with the addition of AdoHcy and AdoMet (supplemental Table S1) as previously described (14Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For all shifts, 32P-labeled DNA (∼20 pm) was used with cofactor either AdoHcy or AdoMet (500 μm) in MRB. Enzyme was titrated from 1 pm to 13 μm at 22 °C. Gels were scanned on a Storm 840 densitometer (Amersham Biosciences), and bottom band densitometry was determined using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Data were fit to a rectangular hyperbola using SigmaPlot (Systat). Michaelis-Menten constants for AdoMet were determined for W41F, W41F/K91W, and W41F/E94W using a filter binding assay as previously reported (14Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Enzyme (500 pm) was mixed with COG DNA (200 nm) followed by AdoMet titrations (50–2600 nm) in MRB at 22 °C. A single time point was taken at 45 min in duplicate and spotted onto DE-81 filters. Washed filters were counted for 3H, and data were fit to linear equations to determine the rates, which were then plotted versus AdoMet concentration. This data were fit to exponential curves using SigmaPlot (Systat) to give reported values. Time-resolved measurements were made at 22 °C with excitation at 290 nm and a cut-off filter at 295 nm similar to protocols previously reported (12Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37205-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-mm slit widths were used on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer equipped with a single channel emission photomultiplier tube positioned 90° from the excitation beam. All measurements were done in FLB (fluorescence buffer, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA), and data were fit using SigmaPlot (Systat). At least ten shots were averaged for each data point, which was then repeated in at least duplicate. Trp fluorescent measurements were made using AdoHcy, AdoMet, UCOG, COG, MCOG, NC-1, NC-PUR, NC-2AP, NC-INO, and NS DNA. For all measurements enzyme (500 nm) was preincubated with DNA (750 nm) and mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with cofactor (500 μm). Traces were made over 50 s in FLB. Drift corrections were made in Excel (Microsoft), and corrected data were plotted in SigmaPlot (Systat). Fitting of fluorescence traces was done with Scientist (Micro Math). Enzyme turnover was under single turnover conditions with enzyme (1 μm) preincubated with DNA (750 nm) and mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with cofactor (500 μm). Traces were made over 2, 20, and 200 s in FLB, which were tabulated as one file in Excel. The fit to the data are shown in (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), C1'=k7×C2−k1×C1(Eq. 1) C2'=k1×C1+k3×C3−k2×C2−k7×C2(Eq. 2) C3'=k2×C2+k9×C4−k3×C3−k3×C3(Eq. 3) C4'=k3×C3+k10×C5−k9×C4−k4×C4(Eq. 4) C5'=k4×C4+k11×C6−k10×C5−k5×C5(Eq. 5) C6'=k5×C5+k11×C6−k6×C6(Eq. 6) C7=Etotal−(C1+C2+C3+C4+C5+C6+IO)(Eq. 7) F=C1×I1+C2×I2+C3×I3+C4×I4+C5×I5+C6×I6+C7×I7+IO(Eq. 8) where C1–C7 are the concentrations of the various intermediate enzyme conformers having fluorescence intensities I1–I7, respectively, and k1–k11 are the respective forward and reverse rate constants, IO is the normalization factor, Etotal is the total enzyme concentration, and F is the total fluorescent signal measured. When mixed with NS DNA and either AdoMet or AdoHcy, no loop closure was observed in M.HhaI (Fig. 2B) (12Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37205-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with NC-1 DNA (Fig. 2, A and B) and other non-cognate DNA substrates previously used (NC-2 to NC-6: TCGC, CCGC, GCGA, GCGT, GCGG; data not shown) (15Youngblood B. Buller F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15563-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DNA recognition elements contacting either position one or four of the cognate sequence must contribute significantly to loop positioning because none of the non-cognate DNA substrates induce loop closure. Thus, although spatially removed by ∼28 Å, our data show that the recognition domain (residues 191–303) and the catalytic loop (residues 80–100) are conformationally linked (Fig. 1). Inspection of the first base pair of the recognition sequence in the 1.96 Å cocrystal structure (16Shieh F.K. Youngblood B. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 516-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reveals no protein interactions to the cytosine base whereas three can be seen to the guanosine base, two from Arg-240 via the major groove to guanosine O6 and N7 and one from Ile-86 via the minor groove to guanosine N2 (Fig. 1B). When compared with its cognate DNA substrate, M.HhaI discriminates against NC-1 ∼2,800-fold through a combination of a 70-fold change in binding and a 40-fold change in the rate of catalysis (15Youngblood B. Buller F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15563-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the exact protein-DNA interactions controlling loop rearrangement and DNA specificity, we used a series of non-cognate DNA substrates, which have base pair substitutions only at the first position of the cognate recognition sequence 5′-GCGC-3′, namely NC-1 (ACGC) (15Youngblood B. Buller F. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15563-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), NC-INO (ICGC), NC-2AP (2CGC), and NC-PUR (PCGC) (Fig. 2A). Replacement of the guanosine at position one with purine (NC-PUR) removes both the O6 and N2 moieties and nearly eliminated loop closure as determined by the fluorescence intensity at equilibrium (Fig. 2B). P:C base pairs are largely unperturbed in critical helical parameters when compared with G:C base pairs (17Li Y. Zon G. Wilson W.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7566-7572Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lack of loop closure is due to the loss of direct protein-DNA interactions. The backbone carbonyl of Ile-86 in the catalytic loop interacts with the guanosine N2 (Fig. 1B) and was previously implicated as being important for sequence recognition (18Svedruzić Z.M. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11460-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, substitution of 2AP at position one (NC-2AP) does not recover the loop positioning observed with COG DNA even though the amino moiety of 2AP directly contacts the catalytic loop (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the kinetic contributions leading to this difference in equilibrium population between NC-2AP and COG DNA appear to reflect altered rate constants of closing shown by slower observed rate constants for both NC-2AP and NC-PUR when compared with COG (supplemental Table S2). The side chain of Arg-240 in the small domain interacts with the guanosine O6; substitution of inosine for purine (NC-INO) at this position results in complete recovery of the equilibrium and kinetic fluorescence changes to cognate levels (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S2). Thus, the interaction between Arg-240 and guanosine O6 is a predominant determinant of loop closure in the presence of AdoHcy. To further elucidate the importance of loop closure, especially those involving specific protein-DNA interactions such as that between Arg-240 and the guanosine at position one (Fig. 1B), we monitored loop reorganization during catalytic turnover. Unlike proteins which are limited to binding, enzymes catalyze chemical reactions which must be coupled to the recognition process. Until now, all experiments have used AdoHcy, the cofactor product, and examined only aspects of substrate binding. To examine the role of the catalytic loop during catalysis, experiments were run with AdoMet and allowed to proceed through complete enzymatic turnover. Cognate DNA substrates were examined under a variety of methylation states (supplemental Table S2), either unmethylated (UCOG; data not shown), hemi-methylated (COG; Fig. 2), or fully methylated (MCOG; Fig. 2, C and G). UCOG DNA was measured but was indiscernible from COG substrates with both AdoMet and AdoHcy. Although COG DNA substrates were predominantly studied, MCOG data provide a basis for interpretation of other DNA substrates and is presented first. When mixed with enzyme and AdoMet, MCOG DNA gave very little observable change in fluorescence signal, substantially different from the AdoHcy trace, which itself was roughly half as intense as AdoHcy and COG DNA (Fig. 2C). Structural examination of the WT protein-DNA complex suggests that a steric clash between the methyl groups of AdoMet and 5-methyl cytosine could prevent the loop from closing properly. Loop motion during catalysis with COG DNA and AdoMet is different from COG DNA and AdoHcy in predominantly three ways: (i) with AdoMet, the loop shows an opening motion after the initial closure (Fig. 2C), (ii) the initial rate constants for loop closure are much faster with AdoMet (Fig. 2D and supplemental Table S2), and (iii) there is a lag with AdoMet before the loop reopens (Fig. 2, C and D). Traces of loop motion during catalysis fit to single or double exponentials during initial loop closure (decrease in signal for E94W and increase in signal for K91W) and to single exponentials for loop reopening (supplemental Table S2). In contrast, simulations run on the overall trace which includes the lag phase, revealed that the proper determination of intermediates and kinetic constants is extremely complicated, requiring multiple intermediates, each with different fluorescence intensity and a potential reverse rate. Although extensive population studies would need to be devised to fully separate each intermediate, these catalytic traces provide a real-time examination of conformational rearrangements responsible for enzyme catalysis. Loop reopening after the methylation of COG DNA, which forms MCOG DNA, is driven by the cofactor under single turnover conditions. To reopen the loop after initial closure and methyltransfer, the excess AdoMet in solution (500 μm) displaces the negligible amounts of product AdoHcy (750 nm) and creates the steric clash that prevented loop closure with AdoMet and MCOG DNA (Fig. 2C). To test this hypothesis, COG DNA methylation was performed under conditions where AdoMet and AdoHcy were at equivalent concentrations (500 μm each). Critically, initial intensities of closure were nearly identical for both AdoMet and AdoMet/AdoHcy additions confirming roughly equivalent populations of the closed conformer (Fig. 2D). When equivalent amounts of AdoHcy and AdoMet were present in solution after methyltransfer, roughly equivalent amounts of enzyme associated to each cofactor, AdoMet and AdoHcy, leading to different ternary complexes. The equilibrium intensity when both cofactors are present (purple) indicates a greater amount of loop-closed conformers when compared with just AdoMet (Fig. 2C, blue). Thus, it appears that some enzymes have bound AdoHcy and MCOG DNA and have populated the closed conformer greater than with AdoMet and MCOG DNA. These intensities are very close to the respective MCOG DNA traces (Fig. 2C, green). Finally, rate constants of initial loop closure are also consistent with this model (supplemental Table S2). With MCOG DNA, AdoHcy binding to M.HhaI leads to the closed conformer whereas AdoMet binding leads to the open conformer. Although the cofactor alone has no impact on loop positioning (12Estabrook R.A. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37205-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), rate constants of loop closure with AdoMet were faster than those with AdoHcy when in the presence of COG DNA, (Fig. 2D and supplemental Table S2). This suggests that loop positioning in the ternary complex is highly dependent on the cofactor, especially for initial closure, and that a ternary complex is briefly formed with the loop in the open conformer since DNA binding is concentration-dependent while loop repositioning is not (19Merkiene E. Klimasauskas S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Whereas absolute cofactor concentration-dependent loop rearrangements could not be accurately measured due to the large amounts of AdoMet needed to keep all enzymes bound, no dependence was observed for either DNA or cofactor under the conditions used. The lag period between initial loop closure and loop reopening increases with DNA concentration; however, a substantial lag (∼2–3 s; data not shown) remains under single-turnover conditions with limiting DNA. Because the enzymes are saturated and fully bound to the DNA substrates throughout these studies (supplemental Table S1), the lag must be due to a sum of multiple kinetic steps with nearly equivalent rate constants, implying the existence of several intermediates. Furthermore, the half-life derived from our observed kchem values (∼6 s, Fig. 2A) suggests that immediately after methylation, the loop reopens thereby releasing the cofactor. At ∼6 s in the stopped-flow trace, the loop appears to be well past initial closure, through the lag phase, and into loop reopening when half the DNA is methylated. This mechanism accounts for the decreased maximal intensity of COG DNA with AdoMet when compared with AdoHcy (Fig. 2C); the closed conformer was not as populated with AdoMet because the loops in some protein-DNA complexes are reopening after methyl transfer. Thus, methylation, or more specifically the conversion of AdoMet to AdoHcy, controls loop reopening which appears to follow rapid cofactor diffusion from the active site, as suggested by others (19Merkiene E. Klimasauskas S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Under multiple turnover conditions, with excess DNA, the lag phase is extended and represents the steady state population of loop motion during catalysis. Loop reopening does not begin until enzymes are bound to MCOG DNA after methyl transfer; hypothetically, if the concentration of COG DNA were kept constant while MCOG DNA was removed, the loop would never fully populate the open state. Also, because loop reopening is so much slower than methyltransfer, the transient species with COG DNA and AdoMet with a closed loop accumulates, leading to an increased lag period with the loop predominantly closed as determined by the maximum amplitude of fluorescence signal. If the intermediate were bound to MCOG DNA and AdoHcy or AdoMet, the lag would occur at a much lower intensity (Fig. 2, C and G). Loop reopening kinetics (after 20 s) fit well to single exponential curves with rate constants of ∼0.08 s−1 (supplemental Table S2) suggesting that this step contributes to kcat (∼0.05 s−1, supplemental Table S1) (18Svedruzić Z.M. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11460-11473Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Catalysis using AdoMet was also monitored with non-cognate DNA substrates to determine if loop positioning plays an active role in specificity and catalysis. Fluorescence traces with NC-PUR DNA and AdoMet show that the population of the closed conformer is significantly decreased when compared with COG DNA as determined by the maximum intensities (Fig. 2, E and F). This most likely accounts for the decrease in observed kchem because without proper loop closure, C81 is not in proximity to attack the flipped cytosine base (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). NC-INO DNA and COG DNA traces with AdoMet were nearly identical (Fig. 2, E and F), further supporting the notion that the interaction between Arg-240 and guanosine O6 is a major sequence determinant, which controls loop closure. Replacement of O6 into position one of the recognition sequence with an inosine base completely recovers loop motion when compared with NC-PUR/AdoMet traces. Because Arg-240 is the only protein moiety in contact with the O6, it strongly suggests that this residue communicates with and controls the positioning of the catalytic loop. NC-2AP DNA was measured with AdoMet but was not as definitive (Fig. 2, E and F and supplemental Discussion). The robustness of this fluorescence-based approach is supported by our observation that the W41F/K91W and W41F/E94W mutants have nearly identical loop rearrangements and are highly functional, with catalytic parameters very close to WT. In addition, loop closure with W41F/K91W (Fig. 2G) results in an increase in signal, the exact opposite to observations made with the W41F/E94W mutant (Fig. 2, B and C). However, the differential quenching can be structurally justified; in the WT structure, the loop-open conformer has Lys-91 buried while Glu-94 is exposed (10O'Gara M. Zhang X. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the closed conformer, Lys-91 is exposed while Glu-94 is buried (9Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). W41F/K91W showed nearly identical catalytic parameters (supplemental Table S1) to WT and W41F/E94W in addition to similar kinetics of loop motion (supplemental Table S2). This second mutant validates this fluorescence method of analysis and bolsters our conclusions about loop motion in this class of enzymes. To further examine the Arg-240 interaction with the guanosine O6, we removed the guanidinium side chain by constructing the R240A mutant of M.HhaI. The binding of R240A M.HhaI to its cognate DNA was decreased ∼23,000-fold from WT values and represents almost complete loss of affinity with values nearly identical to WT and NS DNA (supplemental Table S3). Interestingly, disruption of the Arg-240 to guanosine O6 interaction through either protein mutagenesis or with modified DNA substrates have similar impacts on affinity (WT/NC-2AP KD of 18 nm and R240A/COG KD of 394 nm versus WT/COG KD of 17 pm, supplemental Tables S1 and S3). This loss of binding energy (∼6–7 kcal/mol) is much larger than what is typically observed for individual protein-DNA contacts associated with binding, suggesting this interaction controls the formation of other contacts, perhaps through loop rearrangements (20Martin A.M. Sam M.D. Reich N.O. Perona J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Parry D. Moon S.A. Liu H.H. Heslop P. Connolly B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The complete recovery of this binding energy with a DNA substrate lacking the target base (abasic substrate, AB DNA, supplemental Table S3) suggests that Arg-240 is involved in base flipping which itself could account for improper loop closure if base flipping and loop positioning are fully coupled (11Estabrook R.A. Lipson R. Hopkins B. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31419-31428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, R240A shows the same 8-fold decrease in kchem with COG DNA as WT does with NC-2AP DNA (60 ms−1 and 74 ms−1, respectively, supplemental Table S3) further supporting the notion that removal of the Arg-240 to guanosine O6 interaction through modified DNA bases or mutant enzymes gives equivalent impacts on catalysis. Finally, the R240A mutant is unable to distinguish between the various non-cognate substrates, all giving a kchem of ∼50 ms−1. Thus, the side chain of Arg-240 and its contact with the DNA is essential for sequence discrimination. The combined data strongly support the critical interaction between Arg-240 and guanosine O6 as being a predominant determinant of loop closure, binding affinity, catalysis, and DNA discrimination. We have measured catalytic loop reorganization in M.HhaI and provided a structural basis for sequence-specific DNA discrimination during both binding and catalysis. Although mechanisms posited to account for the extraordinary specificity achieved by DNA-modifying enzymes are scarce, our results provide real-time observations of conformational rearrangements responsible for substrate specificity, which lead to controlled catalysis. Elements in the recognition domain, especially the single hydrogen bond between Arg-240 of the enzyme and O6 of the guanosine at the first position in the recognition sequence, contribute significantly to the correct positioning of the catalytic loop. Arg-240 and the recognition domain are ∼28 Å away from the catalytic loop in the open conformer and indirectly determine both loop positioning and kinetics. Loop transitions correlate well with observed kchem and kcat rate constants and are heavily modulated by cofactors. Steric clashes in the active site most likely disrupt base flipping, prevent loop closure, and drive loop reopening post-catalysis. These long-range interactions that correlate with substrate binding and critically, enzyme turnover, will have broad application to enzyme specificity and drug design for this medically relevant class of enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2005636586,"Background So far, all clinical cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), thought to result from the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) prion agent, have shown Methionine–Methionine (M/M) homozygosity at the M129V polymorphism of the PRNP gene. Although established, this relationship is still not understood. In both vCJD and experimental BSE models prion agents do reach the bloodstream, raising concerns regarding disease transmission through blood transfusion. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the impact of the M129V polymorphism on the expression and processing of the prion protein in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three blood donor populations with Methionine-Methionine (M/M), Valine-Valine (V/V) and M/V genotypes. Using real-time PCR, ELISA and immunoblot assays we were unable to find differences in prion protein expression and processing relating to the M129V polymorphism. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that in PBMCs, the M129V PrP polymorphism has no significant impact on PrP expression, processing and the apparent glycoform distribution. Prion propagation should be investigated further in other cell types or tissues."
