https://openalex.org/W4220711675,"Abstract We conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment (EA) in a sample of ~3 million individuals and identify 3,952 approximately uncorrelated genome-wide-significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A genome-wide polygenic predictor, or polygenic index (PGI), explains 12–16% of EA variance and contributes to risk prediction for ten diseases. Direct effects (i.e., controlling for parental PGIs) explain roughly half the PGI’s magnitude of association with EA and other phenotypes. The correlation between mate-pair PGIs is far too large to be consistent with phenotypic assortment alone, implying additional assortment on PGI-associated factors. In an additional GWAS of dominance deviations from the additive model, we identify no genome-wide-significant SNPs, and a separate X-chromosome additive GWAS identifies 57."
https://openalex.org/W4221065024,"Most studies on COVID-19 preventive behaviors have focused on single-level factors such as national policy, community social capital, or individuals' sociodemographic characteristics. Through a social-ecological model, this study attempts to comprehensively examine the multilevel factors associated with COVID-19 preventive practices in South Korea. Accordingly, a web survey involving 1,500 participants was conducted in December 2020. An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to examine the multilevel factors (individual, interpersonal, community, and policy levels) related to COVID-19 preventive measures, which are based on wearing a mask, washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing, and social distancing. When factors at each level were investigated, higher scores of COVID-19 fear and correct knowledge at the individual level, COVID-19 information share at the interpersonal level, and better evaluation of the national government policies in regard to COVID-19 at the policy level were positively associated with COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Community-level factors-neighborhood perception and community participation-were negatively significantly related to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Additionally, older age, being female, and having a graduate-level education were positively related to better preventive behaviors. The findings of the current study suggest that multilevel efforts are needed to promote preventive behaviors. Specifically, more effort to alleviate COVID-19-related fear and disseminate correct knowledge among Korean citizens is needed as the individual-level characteristics explained the preventive behaviors more than the factors at upper levels."

https://openalex.org/W4220786185,"COVID-19 is a multisystem disease, and some patients suffer from physical or psychological symptoms for weeks or even months after infection, which is described as post-COVID syndrome. The goal of this study is evaluating the prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms among Egyptian patients and detecting the factors associated with the presence of these symptoms.An on-line cross-sectional survey using Google Forms was used to conduct the present study, which took place between June and August 2021.Three hundred and ninety-six participants filled in the survey. The mean age of participants was 41.4 years. Most participants had mild to moderate COVID-19 (81.31%). The prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms was 87.63%, where the most frequent symptom was fatigue (60.86%). Female sex, the presence of comorbidities, lower degree of education, longer disease duration, as well as severe and critical forms of the disease were significantly associated with the presence of post-COVID symptoms. Using regression analysis, the predictors of post-COVID symptoms were severe and critical forms of the disease and intake of antibiotics and corticosteroids for treatment of COVID-19.COVID-19 is followed by high prevalence of post-COVID symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the relationship between the use of antibiotics and the development of post-COVID symptoms. We recommend further studies to understand this relationship. We also recommend restricting the use of these drugs to indicated cases according to the international guidelines. More studies are needed to gain better understanding of post-COVID symptoms especially in females."
https://openalex.org/W4226044266,"Routine mammography screening is currently the standard tool for finding cancers at an early stage, when treatment is most successful. Current breast screening programmes are one-size-fits-all which all women above a certain age threshold are encouraged to participate. However, breast cancer risk varies by individual. The BREAst screening Tailored for HEr (BREATHE) study aims to assess acceptability of a comprehensive risk-based personalised breast screening in Singapore. Advancing beyond the current age-based screening paradigm, BREATHE integrates both genetic and non-genetic breast cancer risk prediction tools to personalise screening recommendations. BREATHE is a cohort study targeting to recruit ~3,500 women. The first recruitment visit will include questionnaires and a buccal cheek swab. After receiving a tailored breast cancer risk report, participants will attend an in-person risk review, followed by a final session assessing the acceptability of our risk stratification programme. Risk prediction is based on: a) Gail model (non-genetic), b) mammographic density and recall, c) BOADICEA predictions (breast cancer predisposition genes), and d) breast cancer polygenic risk score. For national implementation of personalised risk-based breast screening, exploration of the acceptability within the target populace is critical, in addition to validated predication tools. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement a comprehensive risk-based mammography screening programme in Asia. The BREATHE study will provide essential data for policy implementation which will transform the health system to deliver a better health and healthcare outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220764539,"Clinical sequencing has provided molecular and therapeutic insights into the field of clinical oncology. However, despite its significance, its clinical utility in Japanese patients remains unknown. Here, we examined the clinical utility of tissue-based clinical sequencing with FoundationOne® CDx and FoundationOne® Heme. Between August 2018 and August 2019, 130 Japanese pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors were tested with FoundationOne® CDx or FoundationOne® Heme.The median age of 130 patients was 60.5 years (range: 3 to 84 years), and among them, 64 were males and 66 were females. Major cancer types were gastrointestinal cancer (23 cases) and hepatic, biliary, and pancreatic cancer (21 cases). A molecular tumor board had been completed on all 130 cases by October 31, 2019. The median number of gene alterations detected by Foundation testing, excluding variants of unknown significance (VUS) was 4 (ranged 0 to 21) per case. Of the 130 cases, one or more alterations were found in 123 cases (94.6%), and in 114 cases (87.7%), actionable alterations with candidates for therapeutic agents were found. In 29 (22.3%) of them, treatment corresponding to the gene alteration was performed. Regarding secondary findings, 13 cases (10%) had an alteration suspected of a hereditary tumor. Of the 13 cases, only one case received a definite diagnosis of hereditary tumor.Our study showed that clinical sequencing might be useful for detecting gene alterations in various cancer types and exploring treatment options. However, many issues still need to be improved."
https://openalex.org/W4220966362,"MicroRNAs are well characterized in their role in silencing gene expression by targeting 3´-UTR of mRNAs in cytoplasm. However, recent studies have shown that miRNAs have a role in the regulation of genes in the nucleus, where they are abundantly located. We show here that in mouse endothelial cell line (C166), nuclear microRNA miR-466c participates in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor a ( Vegfa) gene expression in hypoxia. Upregulation of Vegfa expression in response to hypoxia was significantly compromised after removal of miR-466c with CRISPR-Cas9 genomic deletion. We identified a promoter-associated long non-coding RNA on mouse Vegfa promoter and show that miR-466c directly binds to this transcript to modulate Vegfa expression. Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-466c regulates Vegfa gene transcription in the nucleus by targeting the promoter, and expands on our understanding of the role of miRNAs well beyond their canonical role."
https://openalex.org/W4221025886,"Despite the development of safe and highly efficacious COVID-19 vaccines, extensive barriers to vaccine deployment and uptake threaten the effectiveness of vaccines in controlling the pandemic. Notably, marginalization produces structural and social inequalities that render certain populations disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality, and less likely to be vaccinated. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive overview of definitions/conceptualizations, elements, and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among marginalized populations in the U.S. and Canada.The proposed scoping review follows the framework outlined by Arksey and O'Malley, and further developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. It will comply with reporting guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The overall research question is: What are the definitions/conceptualizations and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in the context of COVID-19 vaccines among adults from marginalized populations in the U.S. and Canada. Search strategies will be developed using controlled vocabulary and selected keywords, and customized for relevant databases, in collaboration with a research librarian. The results will be analyzed and synthesized quantitatively (i.e., frequencies) and qualitatively (i.e., thematic analysis) in relation to the research questions, guided by a revised WHO Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix.This scoping review will contribute to honing and advancing the conceptualization of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and broader elements and determinants of underutilization of COVID-19 vaccination among marginalized populations, identify evidence gaps, and support recommendations for research and practice moving forward."
https://openalex.org/W4220945920,"The COVID-19 pandemic put dents on every sector of the affected countries, and the informal sector was no exception. This study is based on the quantitative analyses of the primary data of 1,867 informal workers of Bangladesh to shed light on the impact of the pandemic-induced economic crisis on this working class. The survey was conducted between 8 July and 13 August 2020 across the eight administrative divisions of the country. Analysis points out that about ninety percent of these workers faced an income and food expenditure drop during the lockdown. The effect was higher in males, particularly among the urban-centric and educated males engaged in services and sales. The findings suggest that policy support is needed for the informal workers to face such a crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4226063799,"Due to rapid mutations in the coronavirus genome over time and re-emergence of multiple novel variants of concerns (VOC), there is a continuous need for a periodic genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes of particular region. This is for on-time development of diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutic tools against virus in the global pandemics condition. Toward this goal, we have generated 18 high-quality whole-genome sequence data from 32 SARS-CoV-2 genotypes of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, sampled from the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan. The nucleotide polymorphisms in the sequenced sample genomes were determined, including nonsynonymous (missense) and synonymous mutations in coding regions of coronavirus genome. Phylogenetic analysis grouped fourteen whole genome sample sequences (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10-15, 17, 32) into the G clade (or GR sub-clade) and four whole genome sample sequences (3, 6, 25, 27) into the S clade. A total of 128 mutations were identified, consisting of 45 shared and 83 unique mutations. Collectively, nucleotide changes represented one unique frameshift mutation, four upstream region mutations, six downstream region mutations, 50 synonymous mutations, and 67 missense mutations. The sequence data, presented herein, is the first coronavirus genomic sequence data from the Republic of Uzbekistan, which should contribute to enrich the global coronavirus sequence database, helping in future comparative studies. More importantly, the sequenced genomic data of coronavirus genotypes of this study should be useful for comparisons, diagnostics, monitoring, and therapeutics of COVID-19 disease in local and regional levels."
https://openalex.org/W3173990409,"Artificial neural networks are often interpreted as abstract models of biological neuronal networks, but they are typically trained using the biologically unrealistic backpropagation algorithm and its variants. Predictive coding has been proposed as a potentially more biologically realistic alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks. This manuscript reviews and extends recent work on the mathematical relationship between predictive coding and backpropagation for training feedforward artificial neural networks on supervised learning tasks. Implications of these results for the interpretation of predictive coding and deep neural networks as models of biological learning are discussed along with a repository of functions, Torch2PC, for performing predictive coding with PyTorch neural network models."
https://openalex.org/W4220782707,"Co-cultivation in microfluidic droplets has emerged as a versatile tool for the study of natural and synthetic microbial communities. In particular, the identification and characterization of syntrophic interactions in these communities is attracting increasing interest due to their critical importance for the functioning of environmental and host-associated communities as well as new biotechnological applications. However, one critical parameter in droplet-enabled co-cultivation that has evaded appropriate evaluation is the droplet size. Given the same number of initial cells, a larger droplet size can increase the length scale secreted metabolites must diffuse as well as dilute the initial concentration of cells and exchanged metabolites, impacting the community dynamics. To evaluate the effect of droplet size on a spectrum of syntrophic interactions, we cultivated a synthetic model system consisting of two E . coli auxotrophs, whose interactions could be modulated through supplementation of related amino acids in the medium. Our results demonstrate that the droplet size impacts substantially numerous aspects of the growth of a cross-feeding bi-culture, particularly the growth capacity, maximum specific growth rate, and lag time, depending on the degree of the interaction. This work heavily suggests that one droplet size does not fit all types of interactions; this parameter should be carefully evaluated and chosen in experimental studies that aim to utilize droplet-enabled co-cultivation to characterize or elucidate microbial interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4220814783,"The association between renal function and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertensive crisis remains unclear. We aimed to identify the impact of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on all-cause mortality in patients with hypertensive crisis visiting the emergency department (ED).This retrospective study included patients aged ≥18 years admitted to the ED between 2016 and 2019 for hypertensive crisis (systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg). They were classified into four groups according to the eGFR at admission to the ED: ≥90, 60-89, 30-59, and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.Among the 4,821 patients, 46.7% and 5.8% had an eGFR of ≥90 and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Patients with lower eGFR were older and more likely to have comorbidities. The 3-year all-cause mortality rates were 7.7% and 41.9% in those with an eGFR ≥90 and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. After adjusting for confounding variables, those with an eGFR of 30-59 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.54) and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.71-3.24) had significantly higher 3-year all-cause mortality risks than those with an eGFR of ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients with an eGFR of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2 had a higher mortality (21.1%) than those with an eGFR of ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (7.7%); however, the difference was not significant (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.94-1.56).Renal impairment is common in patients with hypertensive crisis who visit the ED. A strong independent association was observed between decreased eGFR and all-cause mortality in these patients. eGFR provides useful prognostic information and permits the early identification of patients with hypertensive crisis with an increased mortality risk. Intensive treatment and follow-up strategies are needed for patients with a decreased eGFR who visit the ED."
https://openalex.org/W4220893204,"The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) system is a multi-protein machinery that is involved in cell division of both Eukaryotes and Archaea. This spread across domains of life suggests that a precursor ESCRT machinery existed already at an evolutionary early stage of life, making it a promising candidate for the (re)construction of a minimal cell division machinery. There are, however, only few experimental data about ESCRT machineries in Archaea, due to high technical challenges in cultivation and microscopy. Here, we analyse the proteins of ESCRT machineries in archaea bioinformatically on a protein domain level, to enable mechanistical comparison without such challenging experiments. First, we infer that there are at least three different cell division mechanisms utilizing ESCRT proteins in archaea, probably similar in their constriction mechanisms but different in membrane tethering. Second, we show that ESCRT proteins in the archaeal super-phylum Asgard are highly similar to eukaryotic ESCRT proteins, strengthening the recently developed idea that all Eukaryotes descended from archaea. Third, we reconstruct a plausible evolutionary development of ESCRT machineries and suggest that a simple ESCRT-based constriction machinery existed in the last archaeal common ancestor. These findings not only give very interesting insights into the likely evolution of cell division in Archaea and Eukaryotes, but also offer new research avenues by suggesting hypothesis-driven experiments for both, cell biology and bottom-up synthetic biology."
https://openalex.org/W4220942893,"The world health organization estimates that more than a quarter of the human population is infected with parasitic worms that are called helminths. Many helminths suppress the immune system of their hosts to prolong their survival. This helminth-induced immunosuppression ""spills over"" to unrelated antigens and can suppress the immune response to vaccination against other pathogens. Indeed, several human studies have reported a negative correlation between helminth infections and responses to vaccinations. Using mice that are infected with the parasitic nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis as a model for chronic human filarial infections, we reported previously that concurrent helminth infection impaired the vaccination-induced protection against the human pathogenic 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus (2009 pH1N1). Vaccinated, helminth-infected mice produced less neutralizing, influenza-specific antibodies than vaccinated naïve control mice. Consequently helminth-infected and vaccinated mice were not protected against a challenge infection with influenza virus but displayed high virus burden in the lung and a transient weight loss. In the current study we tried to improve the vaccination efficacy using vaccines that are licensed for humans. We either introduced a prime-boost vaccination regimen using the non-adjuvanted anti-influenza vaccine Begripal or employed the adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad. Although both strategies elevated the production of influenza-specific antibodies and protected mice from the transient weight loss that is caused by an influenza challenge infection, sterile immunity was not achieved. Helminth-infected vaccinated mice still had high virus burden in the lung while non-helminth-infected vaccinated mice rapidly cleared the virus. In summary we demonstrate that basic improvements of influenza vaccination regimen are not sufficient to confer sterile immunity on the background of helminth-induced immunosuppression, despite amelioration of pathology i.e. weight loss. Our findings highlight the risk of failed vaccinations in helminth-endemic areas, especially in light of the ongoing vaccination campaign to control the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4221052242,"Tropical forests sustain many ant species whose mating events often involve conspicuous flying swarms of winged gynes and males. The success of these reproductive flights depends on environmental variables and determines the maintenance of local ant diversity. However, we lack a strong understanding of the role of environmental variables in shaping the phenology of these flights. Using a combination of community-level analyses and a time-series model on male abundance, we studied male ant phenology in a seasonally wet lowland rainforest in the Panama Canal. The male flights of 161 ant species, sampled with 10 Malaise traps during 58 consecutive weeks (from August 2014 to September 2015), varied widely in number (mean = 9.8 weeks, median = 4, range = 1 to 58). Those species abundant enough for analysis (n = 97) flew mainly towards the end of the dry season and at the start of the rainy season. While litterfall, rain, temperature, and air humidity explained community composition, the time-series model estimators elucidated more complex patterns of reproductive investment across the entire year. For example, male abundance increased in weeks when maximum daily temperature increased and in wet weeks during the dry season. On the contrary, male abundance decreased in periods when rain receded (e.g., at the start of the dry season), in periods when rain fell daily (e.g., right after the beginning of the wet season), or when there was an increase in the short-term rate of litterfall (e.g., at the end of the dry season). Together, these results suggest that the BCI ant community is adapted to the dry/wet transition as the best timing of reproductive investment. We hypothesize that current climate change scenarios for tropical regions with higher average temperature, but lower rainfall, may generate phenological mismatches between reproductive flights and the adequate conditions needed for a successful start of the colony."
https://openalex.org/W4220722236,"The Coronavirus-19 global pandemic has forced many governments around the world to enforce “lockdowns” to curtail the spread of the virus. Studies conducted in the UK, France, Italy and Brazil have demonstrated that one consequence of these lockdowns is significant distortion to the speed of the passage of time. The current study sought to establish how the passage of time was experienced during the Argentinian lockdown. An online questionnaire was used to measure passage of time judgments for the day and the week, physical activity, satisfaction with social interaction, the extent to which daily routines had changed due to covid and demographic data. The results show that distortions to the passage of time were widely experienced during the lockdown in Argentina. There was a tendency for participants to report time passing more quickly than normal. A faster passage of time was associated with being a woman, of younger age and more physically active. A slower passage of time was therefore associated with being a man, of older age and less physically active. The results indicate that whilst distortions to the passage of time during the covid-19 crisis appear to be a global phenomenon, cross-cultural differences are apparent in the factors which influence temporal experience."
https://openalex.org/W4220830906,"In prostate cancers, elongation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) supports an oncogenic translation program and is highly expressed, but its role remains elusive. By the use of human specimens and cell models, we addressed the role of eIF4A1 in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. EIF4A1 expression, as determined by mRNA and protein levels, was higher in primary prostate cancers relative to normal prostate tissue. Also, for primary prostate cancers, elevated mRNA levels of EIF4A1 correlated with DNA hypomethylation levels in the CpG-rich island of EIF4A1. Using a DNMT3a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool for specific targeting of DNA methylation, we characterized, in human prostate cancer cells, the epigenetic regulation of EIF4A1 transcripts through DNA methylation in the CpG-rich island of EIF4A1. Next, we investigated the oncogenic effect of EIF4A1 on cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. For prostate cancer cells, EIF4A1 heterozygous knockout or knockdown inhibited protein translation and tumor growth. In addition, using RNA immunoprecipitation with RNA sequencing, we discovered the eIF4A1-mediated translational regulation of the oncogene BRD2, which contains the most enriched eIF4A1-binding motifs in its 5' untranslated region, establishing an eIF4A1-BRD2 axis for oncogenic translation. Finally, we found a positive correlation between expression levels of eIF4A1 and BRD2 in primary prostate cancers. Our results demonstrate, for prostate cancer cells, epigenetic regulation of EIF4A1 transcripts through DNA methylation and an oncogenic role of eIF4A1 through BRD2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4220909977,"Although several proteasome subunits have been shown to bind ubiquitin (Ub) chains, many ubiquitylated substrates also associate with 26S proteasomes via ""shuttling factors."" Unlike the well-studied yeast shuttling factors Rad23 and Dsk2, vertebrate homologs Ddi2 and Ddi1 lack a Ub-associated domain; therefore, it is unclear how they bind Ub. Here, we show that deletion of Ddi2 leads to the accumulation of Ub conjugates with K11/K48 branched chains. We found using affinity copurifications that Ddi2 binds Ub conjugates through its Ub-like domain, which is also required for Ddi2 binding to proteasomes. Furthermore, in cell extracts, adding Ub conjugates increased the amount of Ddi2 associated with proteasomes, and adding Ddi2 increased the binding of Ub conjugates to purified proteasomes. In addition, Ddi2 also contains a retroviral protease domain with undefined cellular roles. We show that blocking the endoprotease activity of Ddi2 either genetically or with the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir increased its binding to Ub conjugates but decreased its binding to proteasomes and reduced subsequent protein degradation by proteasomes leading to further accumulation of Ub conjugates. Finally, nelfinavir treatment required Ddi2 to induce the unfolded protein response. Thus, Ddi2 appears to function as a shuttling factor in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation and delivers K11/K48-ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome. We conclude that the protease activity of Ddi2 influences this shuttling factor activity, promotes protein turnover, and helps prevent endoplasmic reticulum stress, which may explain nelfinavir's ability to enhance cell killing by proteasome inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4226185415,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have been marketed to diagnose previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a test of immune status. There is a lack of evidence on the performance and clinical utility of these tests. We aimed to carry out an evaluation of 14 point of care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. Serum from participants with previous RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pre-pandemic serum controls were used to determine specificity and sensitivity of each POC device. Changes in sensitivity with increasing time from infection were determined on a cohort of study participants. Corresponding neutralising antibody status was measured to establish whether the detection of antibodies by the POC device correlated with immune status. Paired capillary and serum samples were collected to ascertain whether POC devices performed comparably on capillary samples. Sensitivity and specificity varied between the POC devices and in general did not meet the manufacturers' reported performance characteristics, which signifies the importance of independent evaluation of these tests. The sensitivity peaked at ≥20 days following onset of symptoms, however sensitivity of 3 of the POC devices evaluated at extended time points showed that sensitivity declined with time. This was particularly marked at >140 days post infection. This is relevant if the tests are to be used for sero-prevalence studies. Neutralising antibody data showed that positive antibody results on POC devices did not necessarily confer high neutralising antibody titres, and that these POC devices cannot be used to determine immune status to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparison of paired serum and capillary results showed that there was a decline in sensitivity using capillary blood. This has implications in the utility of the tests as they are designed to be used on capillary blood by the general population."
https://openalex.org/W4220796694,"We herein report an innovative antisense approach based on Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) to down-modulate CD5 expression levels in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using bioinformatics tools, we selected a 12-mer tract of the CD5 mRNA as the molecular target and synthesized the complementary and control PNA strands bearing a serine phosphate dipeptide tail to enhance their water solubility and bioavailability. The specific recognition of the 12-mer DNA strand, corresponding to the target mRNA sequence by the complementary PNA strand, was confirmed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thermal difference spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and CD melting studies. Cytofluorimetric assays and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated the downregulation of CD5 expression due to incubation with the anti-CD5 PNA at RNA and protein levels in Jurkat cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients. Interestingly, we also observed that transfection with the anti-CD5 PNA increases apoptotic response induced by fludarabine in B-CLL cells. The herein reported results suggest that PNAs could represent a potential candidate for the development of antisense therapeutic agents in CLL."
https://openalex.org/W4221006253,"We previously reported that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is the pioneer factor inducing transcription enhancer mark H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in the promoter and enhancer regions of genes encoding insulin-like growth factor–binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and prolactin (PRL) and that this contributes to decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α; PPARGC1A) is a transcriptional coactivator known to regulate H3K27ac. However, although PGC-1α is expressed in ESCs, the potential role of PGC-1α in mediating decidualization is unclear. Here, we investigated the involvement of PGC-1α in the regulation of decidualization. We incubated ESCs with cAMP to induce decidualization and knocked down PPARGC1A to inhibit cAMP-induced expression of IGFBP-1 and PRL. We found cAMP increased the recruitment of PGC-1α and p300 to C/EBPβ-binding sites in the promoter and enhancer regions of IGFBP-1 and PRL, corresponding with increases in H3K27ac. Moreover, PGC-1α knockdown inhibited these increases, suggesting PGC-1α forms a histone-modifying complex with C/EBPβ and p300 at these regions. To further investigate the regulation of PGC-1α, we focused on C/EBPβ upstream of PGC-1α. We found cAMP increased C/EBPβ recruitment to the novel enhancer regions of PPARGC1A. Deletion of these enhancers decreased PGC-1α expression, indicating that C/EBPβ upregulates PGC-1α expression by binding to novel enhancer regions. In conclusion, PGC-1α is upregulated by C/EBPβ recruitment to novel enhancers and contributes to decidualization by forming a histone-modifying complex with C/EBPβ and p300, thereby inducing epigenomic changes in the promoters and enhancers of IGFBP-1 and PRL.

Gene expression including transcription involves a change of chromatin structure, which can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications (8Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L.

Acetylation of histone-H3 lysine-27 (H3K27ac) is one of the histone modifications that activate gene transcription and is highly enriched in the active promoter or enhancer regions (11Wang Z. Zang C.

We also found that H3K27ac levels increase throughout the genome during decidualization and that upregulation of the expressions of many genes was accompanied by increases of H3K27ac levels (4Tamura I.

In general, chromatin remodeling regulated by histone modifications is induced by the recruitment of pioneer transcription factors, which is responsible for the initiation of the epigenetic changes (13Cirillo L.A.

Furthermore, we recently reported that C/EBPβ was involved in the genome-wide increase of H3K27ac and the upregulation of a number of genes during decidualization (4Tamura I. Maekawa R. Jozaki K. Ohkawa Y. Takagi H. Doi-Tanaka Y. Shirafuta Y. Mihara Y. Taketani T. Sato S. Tamura H. Sugino N.

Cell Endocrinol. 2021; 520: 111085Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These facts indicated that genome-wide epigenomic changes induced by C/EBPβ are essential for decidualization. When pioneer factors induce histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling, they must form a complex at the genomic locus with cofactors that have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities (18Sterner D.E.

This complex is called the histone-modifying complex. p300 is one of the HATs that form a histone-modifying complex with C/EBPβ (20Cesena T.I. Cardinaux J.R. Kwok R. Schwartz J.

We have previously reported that p300 is a HAT that induces H3K27ac by cooperating with C/EBPβ at the IGFBP-1 enhancer region (21Tamura I. Jozaki K. Sato S. Shirafuta Y. Shinagawa M. Maekawa R.

However, a histone-modifying complex contains several cofactors other than pioneer factors and HATs. These cofactors are also essential to form a histone-modifying complex and activate transcription (22Spruce C. Dlamini S. Ananda G. Bronkema N. Tian H. Paigen K. Carter G.W. Baker C.L.

Therefore, it is important to identify cofactors of C/EBPβ that are involved in the induction of H3K27ac during decidualization. Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is a transcription cofactor that regulates various physiological functions, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, thermogenesis, metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation in several organs, including reproductive organs (25Wu Z.

PGC-1α is also expressed in human ESCs, and its expression increases with decidualization (32Bombail V. MacPherson S. Critchley H.O. Saunders P.T. Estrogen receptor related beta is expressed in human endometrium throughout the normal menstrual cycle.Hum. Reprod. 2008; 23: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of PGC-1α in the endometrium is unclear. Although PGC-1α itself does not have HAT activity, it recruits cofactors with HAT activities, such as p300 and steroid receptor coactivator-1, and contributes to the induction of histone acetylation (33Puigserver P.

It should be noted that PGC-1α has no DNA-binding domain so that it must interact with other transcription factors such as C/EBPβ to bind to promoter and enhancer regions (37Du Q. Tan Z. Shi F.

These facts led us to hypothesize that PGC-1α works as a cofactor of C/EBPβ to induce histone acetylation during decidualization. In this study, we showed that PGC-1α forms a histone-modifying complex with C/EBPβ and p300 and induces H3K27ac at the promoter and enhancer regions of IGFBP-1 and the promoter region of PRL in ESCs during decidualization. In addition, we show how PGC-1α is upregulated by decidualization. The expression of PGC-1α in the human endometrium was examined by immunohistochemistry. PGC-1α was expressed in stromal cells obtained from the proliferative phase endometrium (Fig. 1A). Stronger expression of PGC-1α was observed in the stromal cells that were morphologically identified as predecidual cells in the late secretory phase endometrium and decidual cells of early pregnancy. The expression of PGC-1α in the human ESCs was also examined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. cAMP increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of PGC-1α with the induction of IGFBP-1 and PRL mRNA in ESCs (Fig. 1B). To examine whether the stimulatory effects of cAMP on mRNA expression of IGFBP-1 and PRL are mediated through PGC-1α, PGC-1α was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA). The increase in PGC-1α protein expression by cAMP was suppressed by siRNA treatment (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of PGC-1α significantly inhibited cAMP-induced expressions of IGFBP-1 and PRL (Fig. 2B). The morphological changes induced by decidualization stimulus with cAMP were not altered by PGC-1α knockdown (data not shown). The promoter regions of IGFBP-1 and PRL are important for cAMP-induced expressions because there are many cis-regulatory elements, including C/EBPβ-binding regions (Fig. 3A) (10Tamura I. Asada H.

Therefore, we hypothesized that PGC-1α is recruited to C/EBPβ-biding sites in these promoter and enhancer regions through the interaction with C/EBPβ. First, by performing a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay, we confirmed that PGC-1α interacts with C/EBPβ both in nondecidualized ESCs and decidualized ESCs (Fig. 3B).

Because PGC-1α and p300 colocalized on the C/EBPβ-binding sites in the promoter and enhancer regions of IGFBP-1 and the promoter region of PRL, we hypothesized that PGC-1α is involved in the p300 recruitment and H3K"
https://openalex.org/W4221065025,"The relationship of the Functional Reach Test (FRT) value with the Center of Pressure Excursion (COPE) and physical function remains unclear, and would be influenced by different population characteristics and movement patterns used in the FRT. Therefore, we explored the relationship between the FRT value and the COPE and physical function in healthy young and older individuals classified according to movement patterns. In 21 healthy young participants (42 sides) and 20 older participants (40 sides), three-dimensional motion analysis was performed during the FRT and physical function assessments. The participants were assigned to two clusters after performing a motion analysis during the FRT. Kinematic and kinetic parameters during the FRT and physical function assessment results were compared between the clusters for both groups. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships of the FRT value with COPE and physical function parameters in each cluster, in young and older individuals separately. The results showed that the hip strategies could be divided into two groups according to the degree of use (Small Hip Strategy, SHS Group; Large Hip Strategy, LHS Group). In the older SHS group, the FRT values were significantly correlated with the COPE (r = 0.75), toe grip strength (r = 0.62), and the five-times sit-to-stand test time (r = -0.52). In the older LHS group and in both groups of young individuals, there were no significant correlations of the FRT value with any parameters. The FRT value reflects the COPE and physical function only in older individuals using the SHS. This could explain previous discrepant results. As there is no simple relationship between the FRT value and physical function, it is important to include movement strategy assessment when using the FRT in clinical evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W4220668707,"Sequential activity reflecting previously experienced temporal sequences is considered a hallmark of learning across cortical areas. However, it is unknown how cortical circuits avoid the converse problem: producing spurious sequences that are not reflecting sequences in their inputs. We develop methods to quantify and study sequentiality in neural responses. We show that recurrent circuit responses generally include spurious sequences, which are specifically prevented in circuits that obey two widely known features of cortical microcircuit organization: Dale's law and Hebbian connectivity. In particular, spike-timing-dependent plasticity in excitation-inhibition networks leads to an adaptive erasure of spurious sequences. We tested our theory in multielectrode recordings from the visual cortex of awake ferrets. Although responses to natural stimuli were largely non-sequential, responses to artificial stimuli initially included spurious sequences, which diminished over extended exposure. These results reveal an unexpected role for Hebbian experience-dependent plasticity and Dale's law in sensory cortical circuits."

Due to the emerging resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and β-lactams, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of β-lactams versus fluoroquinolones as empirical therapy for diabetic patients hospitalized for UTIs.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a medical center in Taiwan between 2016 and 2018. Patients with type 2 diabetes, aged ≥20 and hospitalized for UTIs were enrolled. Patients with UTI diagnosis within one year before the admission, co-infections at the admission, or ≥2 pathogens in the urine cultures were excluded. The primary outcome was empiric treatment failure.298 patients were followed for at least 30 days after the admission. Escherichia coli (61.07%) was the most common pathogen. The resistance rates of the pathogens to levofloxacin were 28.52% and 34.22% according to the historical Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints and the updated 2019 CLSI breakpoints, respectively. The resistance rates of ceftazidime and cefepime were 21.81% and 11.41%, respectively. Empirical β-lactams were associated with less treatment failure compared to fluoroquinolones (adjusted OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.17-0.60). Beta-lactams were associated with less treatment failure than fluoroquinolones when appropriatness was determined by the pre-2019 CLSI breakpoints but not the 2019 CLSI breakpoints.In diabetic patients hospitalized for UTIs, β-lactams were associated with less empiric treatment failure compared to fluoroquinolones when the resistance rate to fluoroquinolone is higher than β-lactams. The updated 2019 CLSI breakpoint for fluoroquinolone was better than pre-2019 CLSI breakpoints to correlate with treatment outcomes for hospitalized UTIs in diabetic patients."

Although many cell lines have been established from kidney tissues, the immortalization process has not been clarified in these cell lines. In this study, we analyzed the phenotypic changes that occurred during the immortalization of kidney cells derived from Chinese hamster tissue in terms of karyotype and gene expression profiles. In the newly established cell line, designated as CHK-Q, gene expression profiles at each stage of the immortalization process and during the adaptation to serum-free conditions were analyzed by DNA microarray. Renal stem cell markers CD24 and CD133 were expressed in CHK-Q cells, suggesting that CHK-Q cells were transformed from renal stem cells. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to identify the pathways of upregulated and downregulated genes revealed that the immortalization of CHK-Q cells was associated with increased fluctuations in the expression of specific proto-oncogenes. Karyotype analysis of spontaneously immortalized CHK-Q cells indicated that CHK-Q chromosomes had a typical modal number of 23 but possessed slight chromosomal abnormalities. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of cell environmental adaptation by analyzing gene expression behavior during the immortalization process and serum-free adaptation. CHK-Q cells are applicable to the fields of biotechnology and biomedical science by utilizing their characteristics as kidney-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W4220981577,"This paper presents the software application ORION (All-sky camera geOmetry calibRation from star positIONs). This software has been developed with the aim of providing geometrical calibration to all-sky cameras, i.e. assess which sky coordinates (zenith and azimuth angles) correspond to each camera pixel. It is useful to locate bodies over the celestial vault, like stars and planets, in the camera images. The user needs to feed ORION with a set of cloud-free sky images captured at night-time for obtaining the calibration matrices. ORION searches the position of various stars in the sky images. This search can be automatic or manual. The sky coordinates of the stars and the corresponding pixel positions in the camera images are used together to determine the calibration matrices. The calibration is based on three parameters: the pixel position of the sky zenith in the image; the shift angle of the azimuth viewed by the camera with respect to the real North; and the relationship between the sky zenith angle and the pixel radial distance regards to the sky zenith in the image. In addition, ORION includes other features to facilitate its use, such as the check of the accuracy of the calibration. An example of ORION application is shown, obtaining the calibration matrices for a set of images and studying the accuracy of the calibration to predict a star position. Accuracy is about 9.0 arcmin for the analyzed example using a camera with average resolution of 5.4 arcmin/pixel (about 1.7 pixels)."
https://openalex.org/W4221051200,"Background The loss of one or more pregnancies before viability (i.e. pregnancy loss or miscarriage), has been linked to an increased risk of diseases later in life such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Recurrent pregnancy loss (i.e. three consecutive pregnancy losses) and multiple sclerosis have both been linked to immunological traits, which could predispose to both occurrences. The objective of the current study was to investigate if pregnancy loss is associated with later autoimmune neurological disease. Methods This register-based cohort study, included the Danish female population age 12 or older between 1977–2017. Women were grouped hierarchically: 0, 1, 2, ≥3 pregnancy losses, primary recurrent pregnancy loss (i.e. not preceded by a delivery), and secondary recurrent pregnancy loss (i.e. preceded by a delivery). The main outcome was multiple sclerosis and additional outcomes were amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Bayesian Poisson regression estimated incidence rate ratios [IRR] and 95% credible intervals [CI] adjusted for year, age, live births, family history of an outcome, and education. Results After 40,380,194 years of follow-up, multiple sclerosis was diagnosed among 7,667 out of 1,513,544 included women (0.5%), median age at diagnosis 34.2 years (IQR 27.4–41.4 years), and median age at symptom onset 31.2 years (IQR 24.8–38.2). The adjusted IRR of multiple sclerosis after 1 pregnancy loss was: 1.03 (95% CI 0.95–1.11), 2 losses: 1.02 (95% CI 0.86–1.20), ≥3 non-consecutive losses: 0.81 (95% CI 0.51–1.24), primary recurrent pregnancy loss: 1.18 (95% CI 0.84–1.60), secondary recurrent pregnancy loss: 1.16 (95% CI 0.81–1.63), as compared to women with no pregnancy losses. Seven sensitivity analyses and analyses for additional outcomes did not show significantly elevated adjusted risk estimates. Conclusions In this nationwide study, pregnancy loss was not significantly associated with autoimmune neurological disorder."

Hospitals have played a key role in providing services to patients and the volume of hospital activities has been refocused on COVID-19 patients. Other activities have been limited/repurposed or even suspended and hospitals have been operating with reduced capacity. With the decrease in non-COVID-19 activities, their financial system and sustainability have been threatened, with hospitals facing shortage of financial resources. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the revenues of public hospitals in Lorestan province in western Iran, as a case study.In this quasi-experimental study, we conducted the interrupted time series analysis to evaluate COVID-19 induced changes in monthly revenues of 18 public hospitals, from April 2018 to August 2021, in Lorestan, Iran. In doing so, public hospitals report their earnings to the University of Medical Sciences monthly; then, we collected this data through the finance office.Due to COVID-19, the revenues of public hospitals experienced an average monthly decrease of $172,636 thousand (P-value = 0.01232). For about 13 months, the trend of declining hospital revenues continued. However, after February 2021, a relatively stable increase could be observed, with patient admission and elective surgeries restrictions being lifted. The average monthly income of hospitals increased by $83,574 thousand.COVID-19 has reduced the revenues of public hospitals, which have faced many problems due to the high costs they have incurred.

https://openalex.org/W4221130947,"Recommender Systems (RS) are widely used to help people or group of people in finding their required information amid the issue of ever-growing information overload. The existing group recommender approaches consider users to be part of a single group only, but in real life a user may be associated with multiple groups having conflicting preferences. For instance, a person may have different preferences in watching movies with friends than with family. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a Hybrid Two-phase Group Recommender Framework (HTGF) that takes into consideration the possibility of users having simultaneous membership of multiple groups. Unlike the existing group recommender systems that use traditional methods like K-Means, Pearson correlation, and cosine similarity to form groups, we use Fuzzy C-means clustering which assigns a degree of membership to each user for each group, and then Pearson similarity is used to form groups. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed framework using a movies data set. The experiments were conducted on MovieLens 1M dataset where we used Neural Collaborative Filtering to recommend Top-k movies to each group. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the traditional approaches when compared in terms of group satisfaction parameters, as well as the conventional metrics of precision, recall, and F-measure."

With the importance of rehabilitating patients in the pediatric intensive care unit being increasingly recognized, we evaluated the prevalence of physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT)-provided rehabilitation and factors affecting its use. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of rehabilitation between 2013 and 2019 using the Korean National Health Insurance database. All patients aged 28 days to 18 years who had been admitted to 245 ICUs for more than 2 days were included. Neonatal ICUs were excluded. Results Of 13,276 patients, 2,447 (18%) received PT/OT-provided rehabilitation during their hospitalization; prevalence was lowest for patients younger than 3 years (11%). Neurologic patients were most likely to receive rehabilitation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.11–8.20). Longer ICU stay (versus ≤ 1 week) was associated with rehabilitation (aOR for 1–2 weeks, 3.50 [95% CI, 3.04–4.03]; 2–3 weeks, 6.60 [95% CI, 5.45–8.00]; &gt;3 weeks, 13.69 [95% CI, 11.46–16.35]). Mechanical ventilation &gt;2 days (aOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91) and hemodialysis (aOR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41–0.52) were negatively affecting factors. Conclusion Prevalence of rehabilitation for critically ill children was low and concentrated on patients with a prolonged ICU stay. The finding that mechanical ventilation, a risk factor for ICU-acquired weakness, was an obstacle to rehabilitation highlights the need for studies on early preventive rehabilitation based on individual patient needs."
https://openalex.org/W4220905694,"Cluster analysis is a valuable unsupervised machine learning technique that is applied in a multitude of domains to identify similarities or clusters in unlabelled data. However, its performance is dependent of the characteristics of the data it is being applied to. There is no universally best clustering algorithm, and hence, there are numerous clustering algorithms available with different performance characteristics. This raises the problem of how to select an appropriate clustering algorithm for the given analytical purposes. We present and validate an analysis framework to address this problem. Unlike most current literature which focuses on characterizing the clustering algorithm itself, we present a wider holistic approach, with a focus on the user’s needs, the data’s characteristics and the characteristics of the clusters it may contain. In our analysis framework, we utilize a softer qualitative approach to identify appropriate characteristics for consideration when matching clustering algorithms to the intended application. These are used to generate a small subset of suitable clustering algorithms whose performance are then evaluated utilizing quantitative cluster validity indices. To validate our analysis framework for selecting clustering algorithms, we applied it to four different types of datasets: three datasets of homemade explosives spectroscopy, eight datasets of publicly available spectroscopy data covering food and biomedical applications, a gene expression cancer dataset, and three classic machine learning datasets. Each data type has discernible differences in the composition of the data and the context within which they are used. Our analysis framework, when applied to each of these challenges, recommended differing subsets of clustering algorithms for final quantitative performance evaluation. For each application, the recommended clustering algorithms were confirmed to contain the top performing algorithms through quantitative performance indices."

This causes high annual costs for treatment and control for the aquaculture industry. Salmon lice have a life cycle consisting of eight life stages. Sex determination by eye is only possible from the sixth stage onwards. A molecular sex determination has not been carried out so far, even though few individual sex-linked SNPs have been reported. In the present study, we used known sex-specific SNPs as a basis to sequence the complete sex-specific gene variants and used the sequence information to develop a sex determination assay. This assay could be used to determine the developmental speed of the two sexes already in the earliest life stages. Additionally, we sampled salmon lice in the nauplius II stage, determined the sex of each individual, pooled their RNA according to their sex, and used RNA sequencing to search for differences in gene expression and further sex-specific SNPs. We succeeded in developing a sex-determination assay that works on DNA or RNA from even the earliest larval stages of the salmon louse after hatching. At these early developmental stages, male salmon lice develop slightly quicker than females. We detected several previously unknown, sex-specific SNPs in our RNA-data seq, but only very few genes showed a differential expression between the sexes. Potential connections between SNPs, gene expression, and development are discussed."

The M1 protein sequence was amplified by RT-PCR using the cDNA of the H5N1 virus as a template, expressed in bacterial expression system BL21 (DE3) and purified. A human strain, high affinity, and single chain antibody (HuScFv) against M1 protein was obtained by phage antibody library screening using M1 as an antigen. A recombinant TAT-HuScFv protein was expressed by fusion with the TAT protein transduction domain (PTD) gene of HIV to prepare a human intracellular antibody against avian influenza virus. Further analysis demonstrated that TAT-HuScFv could inhibit the hemagglutination activity of the 300 TCID50 H1N1 virus, thus providing preliminary validation of the universality of the antibody. After two rounds of M1 protein decomposition, the TAT-HuScFv antigen binding site was identified as Alanine (A) at position 239. Collectively, our data describe a recombinant antibody with high binding activity against the conserved sequences of avian influenza viruses. This intracellular recombinant antibody blocked the M1 protein that infected intracellular viruses, thus inhibiting the replication and reproduction of H5N1 viruses."

However, in low- and middle-income countries, few experiences of such systems implementation have been reported in the scientific literature. We developed and piloted an innovative evaluation tool to assess the performance of health services provision for communicable diseases in three sub-Saharan African countries.A total of 42 indicators, 14 per each communicable disease care pathway, were developed. A sub-set of 23 indicators was included in the evaluation process. The communicable diseases care pathways were developed for Tuberculosis, Gastroenteritis, and HIV/AIDS, including indicators grouped in four care phases: prevention (or screening), diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. All indicators were calculated for the period 2017-2019, while performance evaluation was performed for the year 2019. The analysis involved four health districts and their relative hospitals in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda.Substantial variability was observed over time and across the four different districts. In the Tuberculosis pathway, the majority of indicators scored below the standards and below-average performance was mainly reported for prevention and diagnosis phases. Along the Gastroenteritis pathway, excellent performance was instead evaluated for most indicators and the highest scores were reported in prevention and treatment phases. The HIV/AIDS pathway indicators related to screening and outcome phases were below the average score, while good or excellent performance was registered within the treatment phase.The bottom-up approach and stakeholders' engagement increased local ownership of the process and the likelihood that findings will inform health services performance and quality of care. Despite the intrinsic limitations of data sources, this framework may contribute to promoting good governance, performance evaluation, outcomes measurement and accountability in settings characterised by multiple healthcare service providers."

Tele-mentoring is a method in which a mentor interactively guides a mentee at a different geographic location in real time using a technological communication device. During a healthcare procedure, tele-mentoring can support a medical expert, remote from the treatment site, to guide a less-experienced practitioner at a different geographic location. Augmented Reality (AR) technology has been incorporated in tele-mentoring systems in healthcare environments globally. However, evidence is absent about the usability of AR technology in tele-mentoring clinical healthcare professionals in managing clinical scenarios. Aim This study aims to evaluate the usability of Augmented Reality (AR) technology in tele-mentorship for managing clinical scenarios. Methods This study uses a quasi-experimental design. Four experienced health professionals and a minimum of twelve novice health practitioners will be recruited for the roles of mentors and mentees, respectively. In the experiment, each mentee wearing the AR headset performs a maximum of four different clinical scenarios in a simulated learning environment. A mentor who stays in a separate room and uses a laptop will provide the mentee remote instruction and guidance following the standard protocols for the treatment proposed for each scenario. The scenarios of Acute Coronary Syndrome, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Pneumonia Severe Reaction to Antibiotics, and Hypoglycaemic Emergency are selected, and the corresponding clinical management protocols developed. Outcome measures include the mentors and mentees’ perception of the AR’s usability, mentorship effectiveness, and the mentees’ self-confidence and skill performance.

https://openalex.org/W4221091400,"Fishery management relies on forecasts of fish abundance over time and space, on scales of months and kilometres. While much research has focussed on the drivers of fish populations, there has been less investigation of the decisions made day-to-day by fishers and their subsequent impact on fishing pressure. Studies that focus on the fisher decisions of smaller vessels may be particularly important due to the prevalence of smaller vessels in many fisheries and their potential vulnerability to bad weather and economic change. Here we outline a methodology with which to identify the factors affecting fisher decisions and success as well as quantifying their effects. We analyse first the decision of when to leave port, and then the success of the fishing trip. Fisher behaviour is here analysed in terms of the decisions taken by fishers in response to bio-physical and socio-economic changes and to illustrate our method, we describe its application to the under 10-meter fleet targeting sea bass in the UK. We document the effects of wave height and show with increasing wave height fewer vessels left port to go fishing. The decision to leave port was only substantially affected by time of high tide at one of the four ports investigated. We measured the success of fishing trips by the landings of sea bass (kg) per metre of vessel length. Fishing success was lower when wave height was greater and when fish price had increased relative to the previous trip. Fuel price was unimportant, but a large proportion of the variation in success was explained by variation between individual vessels, presumably due to variation in skipper ability or technical restrictions due to vessel characteristics. The results are discussed in the context of management of sea bass and other small-scale inshore fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W4221095836,"Biodiversity research relies largely on knowledge about species responses to environmental gradients, assessed using some commonly applied sampling method. However, the consistency of detected responses using different sampling methods, and thus the generality of findings, has seldom been assessed in tropical ecosystems. Hence, we studied the response consistency and indicator functioning of beetle assemblages in altitudinal gradients from two mountains in Malaysia, using Malaise, light, and pitfall traps. The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM), non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), multivariate regression trees (MRT), and indicator species analysis (IndVal). We collected 198 morpho-species of beetles representing 32 families, with a total number of 3,052 individual beetles. The richness measures generally declined with increasing altitude. The mountains differed little in terms of light and Malaise trap data but differed remarkably in pitfall-trap data. Only light traps (but not the other trap types) distinguished high from middle or low altitudes in terms of beetle richness and assemblage composition. The lower altitudes hosted about twice as many indicators as middle or high altitudes, and many species were trap-type specific in our data. These results suggest that the three sampling methods reflected the altitudinal gradient in different ways and the detection of community variation in the environment thus depends on the chosen sampling method. However, also the analytical approach appeared important, further underlining the need to use multiple methods in environmental assessments."

Most of these pit lakes have been limed to maintain a good water quality and to prevent generation of acidic water that could leach the exposed rocks and release metals into water. The aim of this work was to examine the concentration of stable elements and naturally occurring radionuclides in water and sediment samples from pit lakes originating from non-uranium mining activities in Northern Sweden. Surface water and surface sediments were collected from 27 pit lakes in Northern Sweden. Water quality parameters, concentration of stable elements and radionuclides were measured by a water probe, ICP-MS and XRF, and alpha and gamma spectrometry, respectively. Furthermore, a multivariate statistical analysis (PCA) was performed on the water samples and sediments. In general, the quality of the surface water was good, but some lakes had low pH values (2.5–5.7), and high concentrations of Fe (up to 200 mg/L) and other metals (e.g. Zn, Cu). When relating the metal concentrations in sediments in pit lakes with the concentration found in natural lakes, some sites had relatively high levels of Cu, As, Cr and Pb. The activity concentration of 210 Po, and U and Th isotopes in water and sediment samples were at environmental levels, as was the ambient dose equivalent rate at these sites (range 0.08–0.14 μSv/h)."

We sought to investigate the association between prepregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain (GWG) and the risk of early childhood caries. Data from 1,429 mother-offspring participants of the 1991/1992 Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were analyzed. The exposures were prepregnancy BMI (under/normal weight vs. overweight/obese), and gestational weight gain (GWG) based on the Institute of Medicine's recommended levels. The main outcome measured was offspring caries experience determined by clinical oral examinations at three time points. Log binomial regression estimated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Seventy six percent (76%) of the mothers were under/normal weight prepregnancy, 39% and 26% respectively gained less and more than the recommended weight for their prepregnancy BMI during pregnancy. Being overweight/obese prepregnancy was associated with unadjusted RR (95% CI) of offspring caries of 1.16 (0.90, 1.51) at 31-months, 1.20 (0.96, 1.49) at 43-months and 1.09 (0.91, 1.30) at 61-months. GWG less than recommended was associated with higher unadjusted offspring caries experience of 1.13 (0.86, 1.48), 1.17 (0.92, 1.48) and 1.04 (0.87, 1.25) at 31-months, 43-months and 61-months respectively. There was insufficient evidence to indicate an association between prepregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain on offspring caries experience risk."

However, for researchers to play this role, they need knowledge translation (KT) capacities that many typically lack. Furthermore, research has confirmed that little is known on KT training approaches for LMICs researchers and their effectiveness. This paper seeks to contribute to filling this knowledge gap on KT training approaches for LMIC researchers by assessing the effectiveness of a training and mentorship intervention to build African researchers' KT capacity. We conducted KT training and mentorship for 23 early and mid-career researchers from 20 universities in sub-Saharan Africa. This comprised a 5-day intense residential training workshop, followed by a 6-months mentorship. A pre- and post-training test was used to assess the immediate effect of the workshop. The intermediate effect of the training following a 6-month mentorship was assessed by the number of researchers who completed policy briefs during this period and those who participated in the webinar series conducted during this period. Overall, the aggregate average point change in the self-reported learning between the pre-training and the post-training survey was 1.9, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the training workshop. This was confirmed by a 33.7% increase in the aggregate average percentage of participants that responded correctly to questions assessing topics covered in the training between the pre-training and the post-training survey. During the mentorship period, 19 of the 23 researchers prepared and submitted complete drafts of their policy briefs within two months after the training. Fewer (4) researchers revised and submitted final policy briefs. More than half of the trained researchers participated in the webinars conducted in the first three months of the mentorship, whereas less than half of the researchers participated in the webinars conducted in the last three months. KT training and mentorship can be an effective intervention for addressing researchers' KT capacity gaps. For sustainability, KT training and mentorship need to be integrated in graduate training programmes in universities so that future LMIC researchers leave training institutions with the KT capacities they need for influencing policy and programme decisions and actions."
https://openalex.org/W4220728288,"The major goal of this project was to formulate iodine-based self nano-emulsifying drug delivery system to provide improve antimicrobial activity and enhanced mucosal residence time via mucus penetration. Iodine SNEDDS (Self nano-emulsifying drug delivery system) with different concentration were formulated using castor oil as the oil phase, cremophor ethoxylated (CrEL) as a surfactant and after screening a number of vehicles, PEG 400 was employed as co-surfactant. Self-emulsification time, thermodynamic stability tests, robustness to dilution, percent transmittance, droplet size, and drug release were measured. Ternary phase diagrams were plotted to determine the area of emulsification. When compared to the commercial formulation, dissolving experiments revealed that the iodine from the SNEDDS enhanced aqueous solubility. In-vitro iodine release was determined to be around 15% per hour, with muco-adhesive and, muco-penetrating characteristics showing a 38-fold improvement. Furthermore, SNEDDS demonstrated significant antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Similarly, when compared to marketed drugs, in-vitro drug absorption profile from the manufactured SNEDDS shown to be much higher. According to these results iodine containing SNEDDS could be a useful new formulation for iodine mucosal usage."
https://openalex.org/W4220770609,"Deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) is reported responsible for the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine (dA) and deoxyguanosine (dG) in the mitochondrial purine salvage pathway. Antiviral nucleoside analogs known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) must be phosphorylated by host enzymes for the analog to become active. We address the possibility that NRTI purine analogs may be competitive inhibitors of dGK. From a group of such analogs, we demonstrate that entecavir (ETV) competitively inhibited the phosphorylation of dG and dA in rat mitochondria. Mitochondria from the brain, heart, kidney, and liver showed a marked preference for phosphorylation of dG over dA (10–30-fold) and ETV over dA (2.5–4-fold). We found that ETV inhibited the phosphorylation of dG with an IC50 of 15.3 ± 2.2 μM and that ETV and dG were both potent inhibitors of dA phosphorylation with IC50s of 0.034 ± 0.007 and 0.028 ± 0.006 μM, respectively. In addition, the phosphorylation of dG and ETV followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics and each competitively inhibited the phosphorylation of the other. We observed that the kinetics of dA phosphorylation were strikingly different from those of dG phosphorylation, with an exponentially lower affinity for dGK and no effect of dA on dG or ETV phosphorylation. Finally, in an isolated heart perfusion model, we demonstrated that dG, dA, and ETV were phosphorylated and dG phosphorylation was inhibited by ETV. Taken together, these data demonstrate that dGK is inhibited by ETV and that the primary role of dGK is in the phosphorylation of dG rather than dA.

Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) are both cytoplasmic (1Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A.

Ther. 2003; 100: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), while thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) are mitochondrial kinases. TK1 phosphorylates thymidine (thy) and deoxyuridine and is typically only expressed during S phase of cell division and thus not expressed in nonmitotic cells. The other three deoxynucleoside kinases are thought to be constitutively expressed. dCK phosphorylates deoxycytidine, deoxyadenosine (dA), and deoxyguanosine (dG), while dGK phosphorylates dA, and dG. TK2 phosphorylates thy, deoxycytidine, and deoxyuridine (2Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S. Eriksson S. Substrate specificity of mitochondrial 2'-deoxyguanosine kinase.

Interestingly, while deficiencies of the cytoplasmic deoxynucleoside kinase have not been associated with disease, the mitochondrial kinases are essential enzymes in the mitochondrial deoxynucleoside salvage pathway and deficiencies of TK2 and dGK are associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndromes (MDSs) that are often severe (5Saada A.

Autosomal recessive mutations in the TK2 gene were initially described in 2001 by Saada et al. (9Saada A. Shaag A. Mandel H. Nevo Y. Eriksson S. Elpeleg O. Mutant mitochondrial thymidine kinase in mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy.Nat.

This type is characterized by childhood onset of muscle weakness associated with mtDNA depletion in skeletal muscle (10Garone C. Taylor R.W. Nascimento A. Poulton J. Fratter C. Domínguez-González C.

Genet. 2018; 55: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The most severe form has onset in infancy and is rapidly progressive with early death due to respiratory failure. Other forms have a later onset and are more slowly progressive (11Domínguez-González C. Hernández-Laín A. Rivas E. Hernández-Voth A. Sayas Catalán J. Fernández-Torrón R. Fuiza-Luces C.

This syndrome is characterized by liver failure and neurologic abnormalities in infancy that are progressive, leading to death in the first year of life from liver failure (13Saada A. Deoxyribonucleotides and disorders of mitochondrial DNA integrity.DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fourteen percent of MDSs are caused by mutations in the DGUOK gene (14Salviati L. Sacconi S. Mancuso M. Otaegui D. Camaño P. Marina A. Rabinowitz S. Shiffman R. Thompson K. Wilson C.M. Feigenbaum A. Naini A.B. Hirano M. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. et al.Mitochondrial DNA depletion and dGK gene mutations.Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Patients with dGK deficiency are also reported to have hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis (15Arya V.B. Dhawan A. Kapoor R.R. Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency.Clin. Endocrinol. (Oxf). 2019; 91: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). There is also a less severe adult-onset form of dGK deficiency (OMIM # 617070) that is associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia and recurrent rhabdomyolysis as well as hepatic and neural deficits that present later in infancy or childhood (16El-Hattab A.W. Scaglia F. Mitochondrial cytopathies.Cell Calcium. 2016; 60: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There also appears to be a link between mtDNA depletion and tumorigenesis. Waich et al (17Waich S. Roscher A. Brunner-Krainz M. Cortina G. Köstl G. Feichtinger R.G. Entenmann A. Müller T. Knisely A.S. Mayr J.A. Janecke A.R. Vodopiutz J.

Nutr. 2019; 68: e1-e6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) report 6 patients with MDSs harboring biallelic DGUOK mutations, of which 3 are novel, including a large intragenic Austrian founder deletion. One patient aged 6 months was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. DGUOK was frequently overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and aberrant expression of DGUOK correlated with tumor progression and patient overall survival (18Lin S. Huang C. Sun J. Bollt O. Wang X. Martine E. Kang J. Taylor M.D. Fang B. Singh P.K. Koomen J. Hao J. Yang S. The mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase is required for cancer cell stemness in lung adenocarcinoma.EMBO Mol. Med. 2019; 11e10849Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). DGUOK may play a role in regulating NAD+ biogenesis. Depletion of dGK significantly decreased NAD+ level. Furthermore, knockout of the DGUOK considerably reduced expression of the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase, a key molecule controlling NAD+ synthesis, at both mRNA and protein levels. Ectopic expression of the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase abrogated the effect of knockdown of DGUOK on NAD+ (19Sang L. He Y.J. Kang J. Ye H. Bai W. Luo X.D. Sun J. Mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase regulates NAD.Front. Oncol. 2020; 10: 570656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).mtDNA synthesis occurs without any problems during S phase via cytosolic supply of dNTPs irrespective of dGK activity, whereas mutations in DGUOK compromise cell cycle–independent mtDNA synthesis (7Taanman J.-W. Muddle J.R. Muntau A.C. Mitochondrial DNA depletion can be prevented by dGMP and dAMP supplementation in a resting culture of deoxyguanosine kinase-deficient fibroblasts.Hum. Mol.

Early studies showed that treatment of cells with dGMP and dAMP was capable of partially correcting mtDNA content in DGUOK-mutant cell cultures (7Taanman J.-W. Muddle J.R. Muntau A.C.

In vitro supplementation with deoxynucleoside monophosphates rescues mitochondrial DNA depletion.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2012; 107: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Later work demonstrated that this improvement was not due directly to dAMP and dGMP but rather to their dephosphorylation to deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine, as the monophosphates do not cross the plasma membrane and are quickly dephosphorylated in the culture medium (5Saada A. Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide pools in deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 95: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Cámara Y. González-Vioque E. Scarpelli M.

Genet. 2014; 23: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, improvement in mtDNA levels was related to increased cellular levels of deoxyguanosine, as addition of deoxyadenosine had no additional effect. Treatment of a DGUOK knockout in a rat primary hepatocyte model of mtDNA depletion with CERC-913, a dGMP ProTide, worked much better than dG or dGMP treatment (22Vanden Avond M.A. Meng H. Beatka M.J.

Dis. 2021; 44: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) as the hydrophobic ProTide masks the phosphate group, increasing stability in the medium and allowing transport into the cell. Once in the cell, the ProTide is cleaved away by esterases releasing dGMP.Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are nucleoside analog drugs used to slow or stop multiplication of virus-infected cells. The prodrugs are phosphorylated through the salvage pathway in cells to their active forms (1Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A.

Previous results from our laboratory showed that 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT), a thymidine analog used to treat HIV patients, was a potent inhibitor of TK2 in the thymidine salvage pathway (24Kamath V.G.

The role of dGK in the phosphorylation of dA and dG and the extent to which various deoxynucleoside purine analogs may interfere with dGK phosphorylation of dG and dA are unknown and are the goals of this study. We used freshly isolated intact functional mitochondria from the liver, heart, brain, and kidney to investigate the activity and kinetics of dGK and its role in phosphorylating dA and dG. We chose to use isolated functioning intact mitochondria for this study rather than purified enzymes to provide data that are more relevant to the natural setting of mitochondria that includes intact membranes and transport systems, as well as active metabolic processes of energy generation and biosynthesis. With this approach, we can deduce potential tissue differences observed in the organelle setting that cannot be obtained using purified enzymes. The effects of various common deoxynucleoside purine analogs, including entecavir (ETV), adefovir, tenofovir, tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), lobucavir, penciclovir, ganciclovir, and dideoxyguanosine, on dA and dG phosphorylation were determined. Of those analogs tested, only ETV was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of dG and dA. Additional results will show that while dGK phosphorylates both dG and dA, it demonstrates a marked preference for dG (1Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A.

Further, we show for the first time that dG was a potent inhibitor of the phosphorylation of dA, while dA had no effect on the phosphorylation of dG.As ETV was inhibitory, we selected it for additional study. ETV is a drug used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and is a deoxyguanosine analog (23Robinson D.M. Scott L.J. Plosker G.L.

Entecavir treatment reduces hepatic events and deaths in chronic hepatitis B patients with liver cirrhosis.Hepatology. 2013; 58: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). While ETV is generally considered to be safe and well tolerated (30Chang T.T. Lai C.L. Kew Yoon S. Lee S.S. Coelho H.S. Carrilho F.J. Poordad F. Halota W. Horsmans Y. Tsai N. Zhang H. Tenney D.J.

Entecavir treatment for up to 5 years in patients with hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B.Hepatology. 2010; 51: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), there are reports of severe and fatal lactic acidosis related to mitochondrial toxicity on long-term treatment (31Cohen S.M.

Severe lactic acidosis during treatment of chronic hepatitis B with entecavir in patients with impaired liver function.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As it has been reported that ETV-triphosphate is not recognized by mitochondrial polymerase γ, this common target of mitochondrial toxicity is unlikely to account for toxicity of ETV (33Mazzucco C.E. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Tenney D.J. Entecavir for treatment of hepatitis B virus displays no in vitro mitochondrial toxicity or DNA polymerase gamma inhibition.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2008; 52: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rather, toxicity if observed may be caused by competition with dA and dG for phosphorylation, decreasing dATP or dGTP levels as noted above for AZT inhibition of thymidine phosphorylation.ETV has been shown to be readily phosphorylated in hepatocyte cell culture; however, the deoxykinase(s) involved have never been investigated (34Yamanaka G. Wilson T. Innaimo S. Bisacchi G.S. Egli P. Rinehart J.K. Zahler R. Colonno R.J. Metabolic studies on BMS-200475, a new antiviral compound active against hepatitis B virus.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 190-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results will show for the first time that ETV is readily phosphorylated in isolated mitochondria, presumably by dGK and, as noted earlier, inhibited the phosphorylation of dA and dG, but was much more potent in inhibiting dA. Thus, ETV has the potential to inhibit the purine deoxynucleoside salvage pathway and reduce the level of deoxypurine nucleotides, leading to a potential imbalance in dNTP pools which has been associated with a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number (5Saada A. Mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide pools in deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 95: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Saada A. Shaag A. Mandel H. Nevo Y.

[3H]-dG (0.5 μM) was incubated in isolated liver, kidney, heart, and brain mitochondria, while [3H]-dA (0.5 μM) was incubated only in liver mitochondria for 2 h in the presence of erythro-9-Amino-β-hexyl--α-methyl-9H-purine-9-ethanol hydrochloride, erythro-9-(2-Hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine hydrochloride (EHNA) (5 μM) and Immucillin H (I-H) (2.0 μM) as described in the Experimental procedures (Fig. 1). ETV was shown to be the only dG/dA analog of the eight tested that showed significant inhibition of the phosphorylation of dA and dG. As a result, ETV was chosen for further study.Tissue-specific phosphorylation of [3H]-dG, [3H]-dA, and [3H]-ETVTo detect potential tissue-specific effects, we studied the phosphorylation of [3H]-dG, [3H]-dA, or [3H]-ETV, all at 1 μM concentrations, in mitochondria freshly isolated from four postmitotic tissues, heart, liver, kidney, and brain. All four preparations of tissue mitochondria produced monophosphates (∼20%), diphosphates (∼< 5%), and triphosphates (∼75%) in the relative amounts shown. As noted in the Experimental procedures, these were added together to determine total phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 2, dG was phosphorylated about 10- to 30-fold more readily than dA and 5- to 7-fold more readily than ETV. With the exception of liver mitochondria, ETV was phosphorylated about 2.5 to 4 times better than dA. Phosphorylation of dA was the lowest in all four mitochondrial preparations and was barely detectable in the heart. The liver had the highest rate of phosphorylation of all three precursors, followed by the kidney, brain, and heart (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of [3H]-dG was sufficiently robust to measure in mitochondria isolated from any of the four tissues; however, further experiments on [3H]-dA phosphorylation were done only in isolated liver mitochondria.Figure 2Phosphorylation rates of [3H]-dA, [3H]-dG, or [3H]-ETV in mitochondria from the brain, heart, kidney, and liver. Mitochondria were isolated from the rat brain, heart, kidney, and liver and were incubated with 1 μM of [3H]-dA, [3H]-dG, or [3H]-ETV all at ∼3000 DPM/pmol for 2 h as described for Figure 1 and the results plotted as pmol phosphorylated product/mg protein for mitochondria from each tissue.

To compare the relative extent of this inhibition, we determined IC50 curves for each labeled compound in the presence of the unlabeled competing compound. To make comparisons between compounds, it was necessary to use the same concentration for each labeled compound. Cellular levels of dG and dA to our knowledge have never been reported, presumably due to the difficulty in measuring these in the face of much higher levels of their ribonucleosides. In our hands, the levels of dA and dG in rat tissues were below the limits of detection, < 5 μM. As plasma levels of deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine have been reported at about 1 μM (22Vanden Avond M.A. Meng H. Beatka M.J. Helbling D.C. Prom M.J. Sutton J.L. Slick R.A. Dimmock D.P. Pertusati F.

As shown, in Figure 3, 1 μM of [3H]-dA phosphorylation in liver mitochondria was potently inhibited by dG (Fig. 3A) or ETV, a guanosine analog (Fig. 3B), with very similar IC50 values of 0.034 ± 0.007 and 0.028 ± 0.006 μM, respectively. In contrast, [3H]-dG phosphorylation in heart mitochondria was not inhibited at all by the presence of up to 40 μM dA (Fig. 3A). ETV also inhibited [3H]-dG phosphorylation, but with a much higher IC50 value of 15.3 ± 2.2 μM (Fig. 3I). The IC50 of ETV inhibition of [3H]-dG phosphorylation in mitochondria from the brain, kidney, or liver (18.9 ± 6.2, 14.3 ± 3.3, and 15.7 ± 1.8 μM), respectively) were quite similar. In contrast, the inhibition of [3H]-ETV phosphorylation in liver mitochondria by dG yielded a much more potent IC50 of 0.55 ± 0.10 μM (Fig. 3F), indicating the preference of dGK for its natural substrate, dG over ETV. As above for dG, [3H]-ETV phosphorylation in liver mitochondria was not inhibited at all by the presence of up to 40 μM dA (Fig. 3E).Figure 3Effect of competing deoxynucleosides on the phosphorylation rates of [3H]-dA, [3H]-dG, or [3H]-ETV. Mitochondria were incubated for 60 min as described for Figure 1 and the total amount of phosphorylation calculated as described for Figure 1. A, phosphorylation rate of 1 μM [3H]-dA, ∼3000 DPM/pmol, in liver mitochondria in the presence of dG (0–0.25 μM). B, phosphorylation rate of 1 μM [3H]-dA, 3000 DPM/pmol, in liver mitochondria in the presence of ETV (0–0.25 μM). C, phosphorylation rate of 1 μM [3H]-dG, 3000 DPM/pmol, in heart mitochondria in the presence of dA (up to 40 μM). D, phosphorylation rate of 1 μM [3H]-dG, 3000 DPM/pmol, in heart mitochondria in the presence of ETV (0–40 μM). E, phosphorylation rate of 1 μM [3H]-ETV, 3000 DPM/pmol, in liver mitochondria in the presence of dA (0–40 μM). F, phosphorylation rate of 1 μM [3H]-ETV, 3000 DPM/pmol, in liver mitochondria in the presence of dG (0–6.5 μM). For all panels, the best-fit rate of incorporation over 60 min was plotted against inhibitor concentration. The IC50s were calculated from the best-fit hyperbolic decay line (y = ab/(b + x) by SigmaPlot 14.0. The data shown (except (E)) are the mean and SEM of phosphorylation in 3 independent observations. As the rate shown in (E) was essentially the same for all dA concentrations, the experiment was not repeated and the values were averaged (line) ± standard error of the mean. dA, deoxyadenosine; dG, deoxyguanosine; ETV, entecavir.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic properties of [3H]-dG and [3H]-ETV phosphorylation and cross inhibitionThe kinetic properties of [3H]-dG and [3H]-ETV phosphorylation were studied in freshly isolated heart mitochondria. The Km values of dG and ETV were 0.72 ± 0.09 μM (Fig. 4B) and 0.77 ± 0.62 μM (Fig. 5B), with accompanying Vmax values of 101 ± 5 pmol/mg protein/hr (Fig. 4B) and 7.1 ± 2.2 pmol/mg protein/hr (Fig. 5B), respectively. These data indicate that dG and ETV bind with similar affinity to the enzyme but that phosphorylation of ETV is far less efficient than phosphorylation of dG. The effect of ETV on [3H]-dG phosphorylation was determined at four inhibitor concentrations. The rates obtained were analyzed for the best fit to three models of inhibition, competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive using the kinetic wizard in Sigma Plot 14.0. As shown in Figure 4B, the best fit was obtained using a competitive model of inhibition with a Ki of 6.7 ± 0.8 μM. Given the similarity of structure between ETV and dG, competitive inhibition was expected. In turn, the effect of dG on [3H]-ETV"

Since type A fibrils are associated with an older age in ATTRVal30Met (p.Val50Met) amyloidosis patients, it has been discussed if the TTR fragments are derived from degradation of the amyloid deposits as the patients are aging. The present study aimed to investigate if the fibril composition type changes over time, especially if type B fibrils can shift to type A fibrils as the disease progresses.Abdominal adipose tissue biopsies from 29 Swedish ATTRVal30Met amyloidosis patients were investigated. The fibril type in the patients´ initial biopsy taken for diagnostic purposes was compared to a biopsy taken several years later (ranging between 2 and 13 years). The fibril composition type was determined by western blot.All 29 patients had the same fibril composition type in both the initial and the follow-up biopsy (8 type A and 21 type B). Even patients with a disease duration of more than 12 years and an age over 75 years at the time of the follow-up biopsy had type B fibrils in both biopsies.The result clearly shows that the amyloid fibril composition containing large amounts of C-terminal fragments (fibril type A) is a consequence of other factors than a slow degradation process occurring over time."

However, barriers in accessing health care still exist in the US especially as it relates to some of the most vulnerable Americans including those with depressive disorders. The purpose of this cross-sectional secondary data analysis was to examine the differences in health-related quality of life for individuals with depressive disorders in early years of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as compared to later years of implementation.This study used a repeated cross-sectional design that pooled data from the 2011-2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System which is a nationally representative survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the before and after impact of the Affordable Care Act on health related quality of life for those with depressive disorders.Those with depressive disorders in early years of implementation of the Affordable Care Act were less likely to report 14 or more days of poor physical health (AOR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.98), were less likely to report 14 or more days of poor mental health (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.94), and less likely to report 14 or more days of overall poor physical and mental health (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.96) as opposed to later years of implementation.Our results indicate poorer health related quality of life for those with depressive disorders in later years of implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Despite expanded mental health benefits under the Affordable Care Act, those benefits do not always translate into improved access or improved patient-reported outcomes. The federal government needs to comprehensively address mental health services in order to improve patient-reported outcomes and mental health treatment for those with depression."

A specialized physical therapist has been assigned as part of the early rehabilitation, but the effectiveness of the program remains unclear. We investigated how early rehabilitation provided by a specialized physical therapist affects ADL in patients with sepsis.This was a retrospective cohort study. This study's subjects were sepsis patients who entered the advanced emergency critical care center of Shinshu University Hospital between April 2014 and March 2020. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain information on demographic characteristics, severity score, primary source of infection, therapeutic medication, the number of days after hospital admittance until rehabilitation begins, length of hospital stay, discharge to home, and an assessment of daily living activities for each patient. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they were treated before or after a specialized physical therapist had been hired by the advanced emergency critical care center.Assigning a physical therapist to a patient significantly shortened the number of days until rehabilitation began. In a multivariable model, the strongest predictors of return to independent living after hospital discharge were (1) assigning a specialized physical therapist (odds ratio = 2.40; 95% confidence interval = 1.09-5.79; P = 0.050) and (2) the number of days until rehabilitation started (odds ratio = 0.24; 95% confidence interval = 0.08-0.76; P = 0.014).Assigning a specialized physical therapist to sepsis patients at an advanced emergency critical care center significantly shortened the number of days until a patient can begin rehabilitation after hospital admittance and improved activities of daily living after hospital discharge.Trial registration [University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000040570 (2020/5/28).]."
https://openalex.org/W4221130819,"Despite the big increase in precision medicine targeted therapies developing curative treatments for many cancers is still a major challenge due mainly to the development of drug resistance in cancer stem cells. The cancer stem cells are constantly evolving to survive and targeted drug treatment often increases the selective pressure on these cells from which the disease develops. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a paradigm of cancer stem cell research. Targeted therapies to the causative oncogene, BCR/ABL, have been developed but drug resistance remains a problem. The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR/ABL were transformative in the management of CML. However, patients are rarely cured as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors fail to eradicate the leukaemic stem cell which often leads to loss of response to therapy as drug resistance develops and progression to more fatal forms of acute leukaemia occurs. New treatment strategies targeting other entities within the leukemic stem cell either alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase are therefore required. Drawing on our previous published work on the development of potential novel targets in CML and other myeloproliferative diseases along with analysis of the facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex in CML we hypothesised that curaxin, a drug that targets the FACT complex and is in clinical trial for the treatment of other cancers, could be of use in the treatment of CML. We therefore assessed the curaxin CBL0137 as a new agent to extinguish CML primitive cells and show its ability to preferentially target CML cells compared to healthy control cells, especially in combination with clinically relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
