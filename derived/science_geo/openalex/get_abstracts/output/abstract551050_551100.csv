https://openalex.org/W2256675298,"Virally based transsynaptic tracing technologies are powerful experimental tools for neuronal circuit mapping. The glycoprotein-deletion variant of the SAD-B19 vaccine strain rabies virus (RABV) has been the reagent of choice in monosynaptic tracing, since it permits the mapping of synaptic inputs to genetically marked neurons. Since its introduction, new helper viruses and reagents that facilitate complementation have enhanced the efficiency of SAD-B19ΔG transsynaptic transfer, but there has been little focus on improvements to the core RABV strain. Here we generate a new deletion mutant strain, CVS-N2cΔG, and examine its neuronal toxicity and efficiency in directing retrograde transsynaptic transfer. We find that by comparison with SAD-B19ΔG, the CVS-N2cΔG strain exhibits a reduction in neuronal toxicity and a marked enhancement in transsynaptic neuronal transfer. We conclude that the CVS-N2cΔG strain provides a more effective means of mapping neuronal circuitry and of monitoring and manipulating neuronal activity in vivo in the mammalian CNS."

Exosomes contain proteins, micro RNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) from their cells of origin. Although miRNA, protein and lncRNA have been isolated from serum as potential biomarkers for benign and malignant disease, it is unknown if lncRNAs in UEs from urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) patients can serve as biomarkers. lncRNAs are > 200 nucleotide long transcripts that do not encode protein and play critical roles in tumor biology. As the number of recognized tumor-associated lncRNAs continues to increase, there is a parallel need to include lncRNAs into biomarker discovery and therapeutic target algorithms. The lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been shown to facilitate tumor initiation and progression and is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. The importance of HOTAIR in cancer biology has sparked interest in using HOTAIR as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Here we show HOTAIR and several tumor-associated lncRNAs are enriched in UEs from UBC patients with high-grade muscle-invasive disease (HGMI pT2-pT4). Knockdown of HOTAIR in UBC cell lines reduces in vitro migration and invasion. Importantly, loss of HOTAIR expression in UBC cell lines alters expression of epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) genes including SNAI1, TWIST1, ZEB1, ZO1, MMP1 LAMB3, and LAMC2. Finally, we used RNA-sequencing to identify four additional lncRNAs enriched in UBC patient UEs. These data, suggest that UE-derived lncRNA may potentially serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2275587382,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that utilizes a defined series of membrane trafficking events to generate a de novo double-membrane vesicle termed the autophagosome, which matures by fusing to the lysosome. Subsequently, the lysosome facilitates the degradation and recycling of the cytoplasmic cargo. In yeast, the upstream signals that regulate the induction of starvation-induced autophagy are clearly defined. The nutrient-sensing kinase Tor inhibits the activation of autophagy by regulating the formation of the Atg1-Atg13-Atg17 complex, through hyperphosphorylation of Atg13. However, in mammals, the ortholog complex ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 is constitutively formed. As such, the molecular mechanism by which mTOR regulates mammalian autophagy is unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of novel nutrient-regulated phosphorylation sites on ATG13: Ser-224 and Ser-258. mTOR directly phosphorylates ATG13 on Ser-258 while Ser-224 is modulated by the AMPK pathway. In ATG13 knock-out cells reconstituted with an unphosphorylatable mutant of ATG13, ULK1 kinase activity is more potent, and amino acid starvation induced more rapid ATG13 and ULK1 translocation. These events culminated in a more rapid starvation-induced autophagy response. Therefore, ATG13 phosphorylation plays a crucial role in autophagy regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2260769725,"Humans often slow down after mistakes (post-error slowing [PES]), but the neural mechanism and adaptive role of PES remain controversial. We studied changes in the neural mechanisms of decision making after errors in humans and monkeys that performed a motion direction discrimination task. We found that PES is mediated by two factors: a reduction in sensitivity to sensory information and an increase in the decision bound. Both effects are implemented through dynamic changes in the decision-making process. Neuronal responses in the monkey lateral intraparietal area revealed that bound changes are implemented by decreasing an evidence-independent urgency signal. They also revealed a reduction in the rate of evidence accumulation, reflecting reduced sensitivity. These changes in the bound and sensitivity provide a quantitative account of choices and response times. We suggest that PES reflects an adaptive increase of decision bound in anticipation of maladaptive reductions in sensitivity to incoming evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2256644786,"The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is implicated in habit formation. However, the DLS circuit mechanisms underlying habit remain unclear. A key role for DLS is to transform sensorimotor cortical input into firing of output neurons that project to the mutually antagonistic direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways. Here we examine whether habit alters this input-output function. By imaging cortically evoked firing in large populations of pathway-defined striatal projection neurons (SPNs), we identify features that strongly correlate with habitual behavior on a subject-by-subject basis. Habitual behavior correlated with strengthened DLS output to both pathways as well as a tendency for action-promoting direct pathway SPNs to fire before indirect pathway SPNs. In contrast, habit suppression correlated solely with a weakened direct pathway output. Surprisingly, all effects were broadly distributed in space. Together, these findings indicate that the striatum imposes broad, pathway-specific modulations of incoming activity to render learned motor behaviors habitual."
https://openalex.org/W2272398100,"The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling is a key regulator of lifespan, growth, and development. While reduced IGF-1R signaling delays aging and Alzheimer's disease progression, whether and how it regulates information processing at central synapses remains elusive. Here, we show that presynaptic IGF-1Rs are basally active, regulating synaptic vesicle release and short-term plasticity in excitatory hippocampal neurons. Acute IGF-1R blockade or transient knockdown suppresses spike-evoked synaptic transmission and presynaptic cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, while promoting spontaneous transmission and resting Ca(2+) level. This dual effect on transmitter release is mediated by mitochondria that attenuate Ca(2+) buffering in the absence of spikes and decrease ATP production during spiking activity. We conclude that the mitochondria, activated by IGF-1R signaling, constitute a critical regulator of information processing in hippocampal neurons by maintaining evoked-to-spontaneous transmission ratio, while constraining synaptic facilitation at high frequencies. Excessive IGF-1R tone may contribute to hippocampal hyperactivity associated with Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2307972733,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the major contributors to neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson disease. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore is a protein complex located on the mitochondrial membrane. Under cellular stress, the pore opens, increasing the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, and ultimately resulting in cell death. MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) is a small non-coding RNA that has been found to exhibit a protective role in the cellular models of Parkinson disease. In the present study, miR-7 was predicted to regulate the function of mitochondria, according to gene ontology analysis of proteins that are down-regulated by miR-7. Indeed, miR-7 overexpression inhibited mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, reactive oxygen species generation, and release of mitochondrial calcium in response to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, several of these findings were confirmed in mouse primary neurons. Among the mitochondrial proteins identified by gene ontology analysis, the expression of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), a constituent of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, was down-regulated by miR-7 through targeting 3′-untranslated region of VDAC1 mRNA. Similar to miR-7 overexpression, knockdown of VDAC1 also led to a decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent cellular protection against MPP+. Notably, overexpression of VDAC1 without the 3′-UTR significantly abolished the protective effects of miR-7 against MPP+-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the protective effect of miR-7 is partly exerted through promoting mitochondrial function by targeting VDAC1 expression. These findings point to a novel mechanism by which miR-7 accomplishes neuroprotection by improving mitochondrial health.

The mitochondrial PTP consists of three proteins: voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT), and cyclophilin D (1Abou-Sleiman P.M. Muqit M.M. Wood N.W. Expanding insights of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). VDAC1 and ANT are integral membrane proteins of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively. Together, these two proteins form the conductance channel of the mitochondrial PTP. Cyclophilin D is a mitochondrial matrix protein that associates with ANT and modulates pore function. Under normal physiological conditions, the mitochondrial PTP is maintained in a closed state, allowing mitochondria to remain polarized. Stressful stimuli, such as oxidative stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins, lead to the opening of the mitochondrial PTP (1Abou-Sleiman P.M. Muqit M.M. Wood N.W. Expanding insights of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). As a result, the mitochondrial membrane potential is dissipated, causing depolarization of mitochondria, decrease in ATP production, swelling of mitochondria, efflux of mitochondrial calcium, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and release of pro-apoptotic proteins (cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)) (2Duchen M.R. Mitochondria in health and disease: perspectives on a new mitochondrial biology.Mol. Aspects Med. 2004; 25: 365-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These events trigger the apoptotic cascade, resulting in cell death. Numerous studies have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction as a causative factor in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson disease (PD) (3Exner N. Lutz A.K. Haass C. Winklhofer K.F.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2013; 106–107: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The level of the NADPH ubiquinone reductase component of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain is significantly reduced in the substantia nigra of PD patients (6Schapira A.H. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Clark J.B. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. Mitochondrial complex I deficiency in Parkinson's disease.J.

Additionally, the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) that recapitulates Parkinsonian symptoms in humans, non-human primates, and mice acts by inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain after being converted into its active metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (8Langston J.W. Ballard P. Tetrud J.W. Irwin I. Chronic Parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis.Science. 1983; 219: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Further, MPP+ administration to cultured cells results in depolarization of mitochondria due to the opening of the mitochondrial PTP (9Cassarino D.S. Parks J.K. Parker Jr., W.D. Bennett Jr., J.P. The parkinsonian neurotoxin MPP+ opens the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and releases cytochrome c in isolated mitochondria via an oxidative mechanism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Exaggerated opening of the mitochondrial PTP has also been reported in response to α-synuclein overexpression (10Martin L.J. Semenkow S. Hanaford A. Wong M. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulates Parkinson's disease development in mutant α-synuclein transgenic mice.Neurobiol. Aging. 2014; 35: 1132-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and 6-hydroxydopamine (11Gomez-Lazaro M. Galindo M.F. Concannon C.G. Segura M.F. Fernandez-Gomez F.J. Llecha N. Comella J.X. Prehn J.H. Jordan J. 6-Hydroxydopamine activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through p38 MAPK-mediated, p53-independent activation of Bax and PUMA.J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 1599-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Opening of the mitochondrial PTP therefore appears to be one of the most prominent cell death-triggering mechanisms in PD models. Strategies aimed at preventing the opening of the mitochondrial PTP might have therapeutic potential in PD. MicroRNAs (miRs) belong to a class of small, non-coding, regulatory RNAs that bind to the 3′-UTR of target mRNA, thereby reducing target protein level. miRs are important regulators of neuronal function, both in normal physiological state as well as in pathological conditions. Differential expression and function of miRs have been linked to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases (12Junn E. Mouradian M.M. MicroRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutic potential.Pharmacol Ther. 2012; 133: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Harraz M.M. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L.

Defining larger roles for “tiny” RNA molecules: role of miRNAs in neurodegeneration research.J. Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2010; 5: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For example, miR-7 has been suggested as a player in the pathogenesis of PD. miR-7 could functionally target 3′-UTR of α-synuclein mRNA, resulting in decrease in its mRNA and protein levels, which could potentially help to prevent aggregation of α-synuclein, a prominent feature of PD pathology (15Junn E.

Chem. 2010; 285: 12726-12734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition, miR-7 has been shown to protect neuronal cells against the cytotoxic effect of MPP+ by down-regulating another target, RelA, through promoting glycolysis (17Chaudhuri A.D. Kabaria S. Choi D.C. Mouradian M.M. Junn E. MicroRNA-7 promotes glycolysis to protect against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced cell death.J. Biol.

Herein, we show that miR-7 regulates the function of mitochondrial PTP by targeting the 3′-UTR of VDAC1 mRNA, which resulted in a decrease of VDAC1 mRNA and protein levels. Consequently, miR-7 prevents MPP+-induced opening of mitochondrial PTP, thereby conferring neuroprotection. MPP+ was purchased from Sigma. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Rhod2-AM was purchased from Invitrogen. All animals were housed and handled in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care guidelines of Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. C57BL/6J mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory were used in this study. VDAC1 3′-UTR was amplified from genomic DNA using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CAATATCTAGAATGAATACTGTACAATTGTTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GGCCGTCTAGAGTTTATTTATATTTTATTAAT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pGL4.51 luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The predicted miR-7 binding site in VDAC1 3′-UTR was mutated with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technology) using the following primers: 5′-GGGTACATTTTAGAGTCTAGCATTTTGTTGGAATTAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTAATTCCAACAAAATGCTAGACTCTAAAATGTACCC-3′. VDAC1 coding sequence was amplified from human brain cDNA library using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-ATAAAGGATCCATGGCTGTGCCACCCACGTAT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CGGGCCTCGAGTTATGCTTGAAATTCCAGTCC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, and then named pcDNA3.1-VDAC1. All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells obtained from ATCC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with pre-miR-scrambled (miR-SC) (Ambion), pre-miR-7 (Ambion), siRNA-NT (non-targeting siRNA; Ambion), siRNA-human VDAC1 (Ambion), anti-miR-SC (Ambion), and anti-miR-7 (Ambion) by using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of pcDNA3.1-VDAC1, pGL4.51-VDAC1-3′-UTR, and pGL4.51-mutant VDAC1-3′-UTR plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary mouse cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18 embryos and cultured as described previously (15Junn E. Lee K.W. Jeong B.S. Chan T.W. Im J.Y. Mouradian M.M.

Neurons were allowed to differentiate in Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) containing B27 supplement (Life Technologies), penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies), and GlutaMAX (Life Technologies) for 10 days before experiments. Primary neurons were transfected with siRNA-mouse VDAC1 (Ambion) or siRNA-NT using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Lenti-miR-SC and lenti-miR-7 were packaged in HEK293T cells using the packaging vectors pDMG.2 and psPAX as described previously (18Choi D.C. Chae Y.J. Kabaria S. Chaudhuri A.D. Jain M.R. Li H.

Lentiviral particles were concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lentiviral titer was estimated by counting the number of RFP-positive cells after the transduction of serially diluted virus. Approximately 1 × 108 transduction units/ml were used for experiments. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter 96 AQueous cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. iTRAQ labeling and mass spectrometry were performed as described previously (18Choi D.C.

Neurosci. 2014; 34: 12725-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from SH-SY5Y cells using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using the Superscript RT III kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies) using the Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system. The following PCR primers were used: VDAC1, 5′-CGGAAGGCAGAAGATGGCTGT-3′ and 5′-CCCGTCACTTTGGTGGTCTC-3′; 18S, 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′. Relative mRNA expression level was normalized to 18S rRNA and calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. Cells were lysed with the Glo lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) with a Wallac 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using chlorophenol Red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) and reaction buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Cells were lysed with PBS containing 2% SDS with protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were sonicated for 30 s, and protein concentration in the lysates was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were resolved using 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by transfer to PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk. The following primary antibodies were used for Western blotting: anti-VDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, N-18), anti-β-actin (catalogue number A5316, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat (catalogue number HAF008, R&D Systems) or anti-mouse antibody (catalogue number HAF007, R&D Systems). Western blots were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated using the mitochondrial fractionation kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein extracts from the mitochondria and cytosol were resolved using SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were used for detection of protein levels by Western blotting analysis: anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, H-104), anti-AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, D-20), anti-TOM20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, FL-145), and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma, catalogue number T-4026). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (4Dias V. Junn E. Mouradian M.M. The role of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease.J. Parkinsons Dis. 2013; 3: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated with anti-TOM20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, FL-145) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips were mounted using Prolong Diamond mounting media (Life Technologies) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with a built-in camera using a 63× water immersion objective at room temperature. To quantify mitochondrial fragmentation, cells were categorized in two groups according to their mitochondrial morphology: tubular (interconnected) and fragmented (clumping) as reported previously (19Lutz A.K. Exner N. Fett M.E. Schlehe J.S. Kloos K. Lämmermann K. Brunner B. Kurz-Drexler A. Vogel F. Reichert A.S. Bouman L. Vogt-Weisenhorn D. Wurst W. Tatzelt J. Haass C. Winklhofer K.F.

Five distinct microscopic fields containing at least 20 cells were analyzed for each sample. Intracellular ROS levels were measured with DCF-DA as described previously (20Junn E. Taniguchi H. Jeong B.S. Zhao X. Ichijo H. Mouradian M.M. Interaction of DJ-1 with Daxx inhibits apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 activity and cell death.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9691-9696Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 10 μm DCF-DA for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were then washed with PBS. The fluorescence intensities were measured using excitation and emission filters of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, in a Wallac1420 Victor 2 microplate reader (PerkinElmer). JC-1 labeling was performed as described previously (21Zhu J.H. Gusdon A.M. Cimen H. Van Houten B. Koc E. Chu C.T. Impaired mitochondrial biogenesis contributes to depletion of functional mitochondria in chronic MPP+ toxicity: dual roles for ERK1/2.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e312Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were loaded with JC-1 dye (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed in PBS and immediately imaged using an Axiovert 2000 fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera using 20× air objective (numerical aperture 0.55). Images were imported into ImageJ and converted to 8 bits, and fluorescent intensity was measured. Cells were seeded onto glass bottom 35-mm dish (MatTek). After transfection and treatment, Rhod2-AM labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cells were loaded with Rhod2-AM at a concentration of 5 μm for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Live cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber to maintain temperature at 37 °C and CO2 concentration at 5%. Imagings were performed using 63× water immersion objective. Images were quantified using Zen lite software. SH-SY5Y cells seeded on glass coverslips were co-transfected as indicated in the figure. Notably, a 10 times higher amount of pcDNA3.1-VDAC1 was co-transfected with EGFP-C1 into SH-SY5Y cells to ensure that nearly all GFP-positive cells express the transfected VDAC1 construct. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 2 mm MPP+ for 24 h. Cells were then labeled with PI (10 μg/ml), washed, and imaged using an Axiovert 2000 fluorescent microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera using a 20× air objective (numerical aperture 0.55). For quantifying the number of dead cells in each sample, cells that were successfully transfected (GFP-positive) and labeled with PI were counted. Five distinct microscopic fields were quantified for each sample. Data were representative of three sets of independent experiments performed in triplicates for each group. Data are presented as means ± S.E. and were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test using GraphPad Prism software unless otherwise stated. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. We performed proteomic analysis to determine the miR-7 target profile. Human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y, were transfected with miR-7 or a scrambled control, miR-SC. Changes in protein expression were quantified using an iTRAQ-based proteomic platform. As miRs mostly down-regulate the expression of their target proteins, we focused on the proteins that were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the miR-7-transfected cells. One hundred and eighty-five proteins were found to be significantly down-regulated with a -fold change of <0.8 in the miR-7-transfected cells (supplemental Table 1). To identify over-represented groups of proteins, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) (22Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat.

Bioinformatics enrichment tools: paths toward the comprehensive functional analysis of large gene lists.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (10271) Google Scholar). Three out of the top ten enriched GO terms pertained to the mitochondria, namely, mitochondrion, mitochondrial part, and mitochondrial large ribosome (Fig. 1A). Nineteen down-regulated proteins, belonging to the GO term mitochondrial part, are listed (Table 1). Therefore, we postulate that miR-7 regulates the expression of mitochondrial proteins and could play a crucial role in modulating mitochondrial function.TABLE 1List of proteins significantly downregulated by miR-7 belonging to the GO term “mitochondrial part”Gene I.D.Gene name-Fold change (miR-7/miR-SC)p valueAGKHomo sapiens multiple substrate lipid kinase0.60.005COX11Cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX11, mitochondrial0.60.03TIMM9Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim90.60.03ACO2Aconitate hydratase, mitochondrial0.70.005ACSL4Long-chain fatty-acid-CoA ligase 40.70.005SRGAP2SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase-activating protein 20.70.01ABCB10ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 10, mitochondrial0.80.03APEX2DNA-apurinic or -apyrimidinic site lyase 20.80.04BCKDHAH. sapiens branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1, α-polypeptide0.80.03COX6B1Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B10.80.005CYB5R3NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 30.80.03MRPL10Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L100.80.03MRPL1239S ribosomal protein L12, mitochondrial0.80.005MRPL2739S ribosomal protein L27, mitochondrial0.80.005MRPL3539S ribosomal protein L35, mitochondrial0.80.03MRPL5239S ribosomal protein L52, mitochondrial0.80.005NLRX1NLR family member X10.80.02SARM1Sterile α and TIR motif-containing protein 10.80.005VDAC1Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 10.80.04 Open table in a new tab Our proteomics analysis prompted us to investigate the mitochondrial biology in response to miR-7. First, we observed the mitochondrial morphology. To this end, we employed MPP+, which is well known to induce mitochondrial fragmentation by blocking complex I activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (24Zhu M. Li W.-W. Lu C.-Z. Histone deacetylase inhibitors prevent mitochondrial fragmentation and elicit early neuroprotection against MPP+.CNS Neurosci. Ther. 2014; 20: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although a small percentage (15 ± 3.4%) of cells demonstrated fragmented mitochondria as evidenced by the appearance of small and round mitochondria in control SH-SY5Y cells (serum-free condition for 12 h), MPP+ (2 mm) exposure for 12 h led to a significant increase in mitochondrial fragmentation in 61.2 ± 6.8% cells (Fig. 1, B and D). However, overexpression of miR-7 by transducing lenti-miR-7 significantly reduced the percentage of cells having fragmented mitochondria to 33.2 ± 4.0% in response to MPP+ (Fig. 1, B and D). We also confirmed this effect of miR-7 using mouse primary cortical neurons. MPP+ (0.5 mm) treatment resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and clumping in 48.3 ± 7.9% of mouse primary cortical neurons infected with lenti-miR-SC (Fig. 1, C and E). However, lenti-miR-7 infection exhibited significantly less mitochondrial fragmentation (27.9 ± 4.6%) when compared with lenti-miR-SC (Fig. 1, C and E). Next, we investigated whether miR-7 affects mitochondrial membrane potential by using JC-1. JC-1 is a lipophilic, cationic dye that can selectively enter into mitochondria of healthy cells and forms J-aggregates with red fluorescence (emission 590 nm). Following exposure to cytotoxic stimuli such as MPP+, mitochondria are depolarized. As a result, J-aggregates fail to form and JC-1 remains in the cytosol as a diffuse green staining (emission 529 nm). The ratio of red/green fluorescent intensity therefore indicates the polarization state of mitochondria, with healthy mitochondria having a higher red/green intensity ratio. Exposure to MPP+ for 12 h leads to depolarization of mitochondria in SH-SY5Y cells, observed as an increase in green fluorescence and a decrease in red/green intensity ratio (Fig. 2A, second row, quantified in Fig. 2C). However, overexpression of miR-7 prevented mitochondrial depolarization after MPP+ treatment (Fig. 2A, bottom panel) as evidenced by a significant increase in red/green fluorescent intensity ratio when compared with cells transfected with miR-SC (Fig. 2, A and C). To confirm that miR-7 helps to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential in post-mitotic neurons, we transduced primary mouse cortical neurons with lenti-miR-SC or lenti-miR-7. As the lentiviral constructs express an RFP reporter, we could only quantify the increase in JC-1 green fluorescence intensity as a marker for mitochondrial depolarization upon exposure to MPP+. Similar to our observation in SH-SY5Y cells, treatment with MPP+ led to mitochondrial depolarization in primary cortical neurons, as evidenced by an increase in green signal (Fig. 2B, second row, quantified in Fig. 2D), which was prevented by miR-7 (Fig. 2, B and D). Depolarization of the mitochondria in response to cytotoxic stimuli occurs due to opening of the mitochondrial PTP (25Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y.

As miR-7 significantly inhibited mitochondrial depolarization following MPP+ treatment, we investigated whether miR-7 inhibits the opening of the mitochondrial PTP.

LPMOs can contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs), but their role in the activity of these enzymes is poorly understood. Here we explored the importance of CBMs in LPMO function. The family 2a CBMs of two monooxygenases, CfLPMO10 and TbLPMO10 from Cellulomonas fimi and Thermobispora bispora, respectively, were deleted and/or replaced with CBMs from other proteins. The data showed that the CBMs could potentiate and, surprisingly, inhibit LPMO activity, and that these effects were both enzyme-specific and substrate-specific. Removing the natural CBM or introducing CtCBM3a, from the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome scaffoldin CipA, almost abolished the catalytic activity of the LPMOs against the cellulosic substrates. The deleterious effect of CBM removal likely reflects the importance of prolonged presentation of the enzyme on the surface of the substrate for efficient catalytic activity, as only LPMOs appended to CBMs bound tightly to cellulose. The negative impact of CtCBM3a is in sharp contrast with the capacity of this binding module to potentiate the activity of a range of glycoside hydrolases including cellulases. The deletion of the endogenous CBM from CfLPMO10 or the introduction of a family 10 CBM from Cellvibrio japonicus LPMO10B into TbLPMO10 influenced the quantity of non-oxidized products generated, demonstrating that CBMs can modulate the mode of action of LPMOs.

https://openalex.org/W2274414600,"Dopamine (DA) type 1 receptor (D1R) signaling in the striatum presumably regulates neuronal excitability and reward-related behaviors through PKA. However, whether and how D1Rs and PKA regulate neuronal excitability and behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we developed a phosphoproteomic analysis method to identify known and novel PKA substrates downstream of the D1R and obtained more than 100 candidate substrates, including Rap1 GEF (Rasgrp2). We found that PKA phosphorylation of Rasgrp2 activated its guanine nucleotide-exchange activity on Rap1. Cocaine exposure activated Rap1 in the nucleus accumbens in mice. The expression of constitutively active PKA or Rap1 in accumbal D1R-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) enhanced neuronal firing rates and behavioral responses to cocaine exposure through MAPK. Knockout of Rap1 in the accumbal D1R-MSNs was sufficient to decrease these phenotypes. These findings demonstrate a novel DA-PKA-Rap1-MAPK intracellular signaling mechanism in D1R-MSNs that increases neuronal excitability to enhance reward-related behaviors."

While existing therapies for prostate cancer such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), destroy the bulk of the AR-positive cells within the tumor, eradicating this population eventually leads to castration-resistance, owing to the continued survival of AR-/lo stem-like cells. In this study, we identified a critical nexus between p38MAPK signaling, and the transcription factor Forkhead Box Protein C2 (FOXC2) known to promote cancer stem-cells and metastasis. We demonstrate that prostate cancer cells that are insensitive to ADT, as well as high-grade/NE prostate tumors, are characterized by elevated FOXC2, and that targeting FOXC2 using a well-tolerated p38 inhibitor restores epithelial attributes and ADT-sensitivity, and reduces the shedding of circulating tumor cells in vivo with significant shrinkage in the tumor mass. This study thus specifies a tangible mechanism to target the AR-/lo population of prostate cancer cells with stem-cell properties."

These findings reveal that activity-dependent processes are central bona fide components of neuronal TF-differentiation programs and establish the importance of intrinsic firing modes in circuit assembly within the neocortex. The corpus callosum (CC) connects the hemispheres of the cerebral cortex and allows the high associative functions of the mammalian brain. Partial or total CC agenesis is a feature of several developmental disorders (Fame et al., 2011Fame R.M. MacDonald J.L. Macklis J.D. Development, specification, and diversity of callosal projection neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2011; 34: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The CC is formed by myelinated axons that project from neurons in layers II/III (∼80% in mouse) and V (∼20%) and a very minor layer VI population (Fame et al., 2011Fame R.M. MacDonald J.L.

In CC formation, studies have shown that diminishing layer II/III neurons’ excitability by overexpressing the inward-rectifier potassium-ion channel Kir2.1 reduces axonal branching and changes the columnar patterns of callosal innervation in the contralateral hemisphere (Mizuno et al., 2010Mizuno H.

More recently, it was shown that altered innervation is not due to decreased firing rates per se, but because reducing excitability disrupts the balanced cortical activity of the hemispheres (Suárez et al., 2014Suárez R.

These studies pointed to the intrinsic excitability of neurons as possibly determining CC development by regulating the neurons’ communication and/or forms of cortical activity. Yet much remains to be learned about how activity instructs callosal connectivity. Cux1 and other layer-specific TFs have been shown to govern several aspects of neuronal identity and connectivity (Cubelos et al., 2010Cubelos B. Sebastián-Serrano A. Beccari L. Calcagnotto M.E.

However, the possible links between TF determining the molecular identity of neuronal populations and activity-dependent wiring are only beginning to be investigated (García-Frigola and Herrera, 2010García-Frigola C. Herrera E. Zic2 regulates the expression of Sert to modulate eye-specific refinement at the visual targets.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated the coupling of Er81 expression and intrinsic excitability through the regulation of Kv1 channels in a subpopulation of interneurons. Importantly, it was shown that Er81 expression levels are dynamically modulated in an activity-dependent manner along the life of the neuron, providing a mechanistic explanation for the activity-dependent regulation of the excitability of these interneurons (Dehorter et al., 2015Dehorter N. Ciceri G. Bartolini G. Lim L. del Pino I. Marín O. Tuning of fast-spiking interneuron properties by an activity-dependent transcriptional switch.Science. 2015; 349: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is not known whether neuronal subtype-specific transcriptional programs instruct the specific firing responses of pyramidal neurons. Some reports have linked the identity of mature adult pyramidal neurons to their distinct firing responses (De la Rossa et al., 2013De la Rossa A. Bellone C. Golding B. Vitali I. Moss J. Toni N.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but did not address to what extent this association is due to their intrinsic differentiation. Furthermore, it is unknown if and how TF-directed regulation of excitability might be related to selective wiring. The acquisition of specific firing modes is a gradual process of differentiation that involves the dynamic expression of a wide repertoire of ion channels. Maturation of firing responses during the development of layer II/III neurons correlates with the onset of the critical period of maximal plasticity (Maravall et al., 2004Maravall M. Stern E.A. Svoboda K. Development of intrinsic properties and excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons during a critical period for sensory maps in rat barrel cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From postnatal day (P)10 to approximately P17 in rodent somatosensory (SS) cortex, spiking behavior of layer II/III neurons shifts from phasic (more spike-frequency adaptation) to regular (less spiking adaptation) over time, such that the number of action potentials (APs) elicited by a given stimulus increases (Locke and Nerbonne, 1997Locke R.E. Nerbonne J.M. Role of voltage-gated K+ currents in mediating the regular-spiking phenotype of callosal-projecting rat visual cortical neurons.J.

Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Concurrent with these electrical changes, the expression of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1) increases in cortical pyramidal neurons from P8 onward (Guan et al., 2011Guan D. Horton L.R. Armstrong W.E. Foehring R.C. Postnatal development of A-type and Kv1- and Kv2-mediated potassium channel currents in neocortical pyramidal neurons.J.

Kv1 channels open at voltages close to AP threshold, limit excitability, and contribute to the emergence of distinct firing modes (Goldberg et al., 2008Goldberg E.M. Clark B.D. Zagha E. Nahmani M.

These channels are key to the strong adapting behavior of P10–P12 layer II/III neurons: pharmacological blockade of Kv1 currents in these neurons decreased spiking adapting capacity and increased firing rates such that they resembled the firing responses of more mature P16 neurons (Locke and Nerbonne, 1997Locke R.E. Nerbonne J.M. Role of voltage-gated K+ currents in mediating the regular-spiking phenotype of callosal-projecting rat visual cortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 2321-2335PubMed Google Scholar). Here we investigate the role of the transcription factor Cux1 in callosal axon development. We find that downmodulation of Cux1 expression results in complete impairment of callosal axonal innervation in the contralateral cortical plate and show that this is due to the inability to switch on Kv1-dependent firing responses. Our data indicate that transcriptional regulation of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 genes by Cux1 contributes to the normal electrical differentiation and the developmental upregulation of Kv1 channels in layer II/III neurons. We also show that restoring Kv1 currents in Cux1-deficient neurons allows the acquisition of a strong-adapting firing mode and rescues contralateral CC innervation, while knocking down Kv1 channels eliminates contralateral innervation. Restoring Cux1 expression after P8 is sufficient to rescue electrical and axonal defects of shRNACux1 layer II/III neurons. Our data thus demonstrate that Cux1-mediated regulation of Kv1-dependent firing is a developmental mechanism that determines CC contralateral innervation of callosal layer II/III neurons. The results demonstrate the importance of electrical differentiation for the establishment of neuronal networks, which has implications for the treatment of neuronal disorders. To determine the role of Cux1 in connectivity, we knocked down gene expression in layer II/III neurons of the SS cortex using a previously reported shRNA (shRNACux1) in conjunction with in utero electroporation (IUE) of wild-type (WT) embryonic day (E)15 mouse cortices (Cubelos et al., 2010Cubelos B.

This knockdown strategy circumvents the prenatal lethality of Cux1 knockout mice (Cubelos et al., 2010Cubelos B. Sebastián-Serrano A. Beccari L. Calcagnotto M.E. Cisneros E. Kim S. Dopazo A. Alvarez-Dolado M. Redondo J.M.

Analysis of callosal contralateral axons appeared relevant because axonal retrotracing labeling of contralateral projections demonstrated that all labeled callosal layer II/III neurons expressed Cux1 (Figure S1B), as expected by the widespread expression of Cux1 in layer II/III (Britanova et al., 2008Britanova O. de Juan Romero C.

We first analyzed GFP-positive layer II/III axonal projections in control shRNA-electroporated mice at P16, an age at which the branching pattern reflects that of the mature circuit (Mizuno et al., 2010Mizuno H. Hirano T. Tagawa Y. Pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity supports the axon development of callosal projection neurons during different post-natal periods in the mouse cerebral cortex.Eur.

As shown in Figure 1C, in the electroporated ipsilateral side, GFP-positive dendritic and axonal processes intermingled with the somas of layer II/III targeted neurons, and axonal branches developed in layer V; in the contralateral hemisphere, callosal axons formed columns with profuse branching in layers II/III and V in the SS areas and a diffuse layer pattern in the insular cortex (Figures 1A and 1D). Upon shRNA-mediated Cux1 knockdown, we did not detect any major defect in ipsilateral axonal projections in layers II/III and V (Figures 1E and 1G). In contrast, loss of Cux1 function eliminated most of the GFP-positive axons in the contralateral hemisphere, both in the SS and the insular cortex, and greatly reduced those within the contralateral white matter (WM) (Figures 1F–1I). These defects were not due to delayed innervation, as they persisted at P28, nor could they be explained by alternative GFP axonal tracts toward ventral, frontal, or rostral areas (data not shown). They were also not due to neuronal death because, as we previously reported (Cubelos et al., 2010Cubelos B. Sebastián-Serrano A. Beccari L. Calcagnotto M.E. Cisneros E. Kim S. Dopazo A. Alvarez-Dolado M. Redondo J.M. Bovolenta P. et al.Cux1 and Cux2 regulate dendritic branching, spine morphology, and synapses of the upper layer neurons of the cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), shRNACux1-electroporated neurons did not show signs of degeneration or increased expression of the apoptotic marker Cleaved Caspase 3 (Figure S1C). The specificity of shRNACux1-mediated defects in CC innervation was demonstrated by reversion of the innervation phenotype via coelectroporation of a shRNACux1-resistant Cux1 construct (Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S1D and S1E). As most layer II/III neurons also express the Cux1 homolog Cux2 (Cubelos et al., 2010Cubelos B. Sebastián-Serrano A. Beccari L. Calcagnotto M.E. Cisneros E. Kim S. Dopazo A. Alvarez-Dolado M. Redondo J.M. Bovolenta P. et al.Cux1 and Cux2 regulate dendritic branching, spine morphology, and synapses of the upper layer neurons of the cortex.Neuron. 2010; 66: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we also analyzed the effects of loss of function of Cux2 on contralateral innervation using Cux2 knockout mice or shRNACux2 in WT mice. These experiments did not reveal impaired CC contralateral connections (Figures S1D and S1E), which indicates that control of contralateral CC innervation is a Cux1-specific function. Overall, the results show that Cux1 is essential for the establishment of CC contralateral axonal innervation. We next analyzed earlier stages of CC axonal development to investigate the process leading to the absence of P16 contralateral CC axons induced by loss of Cux1 function. At P2–P4, soon after axons cross the midline, no major differences were observed between control and Cux1-deficient axons (Figures S2Aand S2B). At P8, when axons branch in the WM and begin to invade the contralateral cortical plate, the only apparent difference was a slight increase in GFP signal in the WM of shRNACux1-electroporated brains as compared to controls (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2H ). In contrast, by P10, the phenotype resulting from Cux1 knockdown was striking and equivalent to that of P16 brains: while in control mice GFP-positive axons profusely invaded the contralateral territories in a still-unrefined columnar pattern (Figures 2C and 2E), only a few axons appeared in the cortical plate in shRNACux1-electroporated brains (Figures 2D, 2F, and 2G). There was also a significant decrease of GFP-positive axons in the WM at both P10 and P12 (Figures 2H and S2A), indicating a reduced number of WM branches compared to controls. At P28, the reduction in GFP signal in the contralateral WM of shRNACux1-targeted brains was as marked as, but not higher than, that observed at P16, indicating that not all WM axons are eventually eliminated (not shown). These data indicate that axons of Cux1-deficient neurons initiate invasion of the cortical plate normally but cannot sustain further development after P8. The reduction of GFP-positive axons in the cortical plate and WM observed between P8 and P10 suggests that Cux1-deficient axons retract. The onset of axonal loss in Cux1-deficient conditions coincides with the earliest establishment of synapses, and it has been reported that CC axons that are unable to make synapses are eliminated (Wang et al., 2007Wang C.L. Zhang L. Zhou Y. Zhou J. Yang X.J. Duan S.M. Xiong Z.Q. Ding Y.Q. Activity-dependent development of callosal projections in the somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11334-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, coelectroporation experiments with a construct encoding fluorescently tagged synaptophysin showed indistinguishable patterns of presynaptic clusters in the axons of control and Cux1-deficient neurons at P8 in both ipsilateral and contralateral territories (Figures S3A–S3C), indicating that the loss of shRNACux1 CC axons is not due to a general inability to make synapses. We next investigated whether a general deficit in branching mechanisms could explain the loss of CC innervation in Cux1-deficient neurons. To be able to reconstruct the branches of individual neurons, we activated GFP expression in a sparse population of control or shRNACux1 cells by coelectroporating a GFP-floxed construct (pCALNL-GFP) and very low concentrations of a CRE plasmid (see Experimental Procedures). We then reconstructed individual axons at the contralateral cortical plate and analyzed the number of branches. This analysis showed no differences between P8 shRNACux1 and control branches (Figures S3D and S3E). This indicated that Cux1-deficient callosal neurons can branch normally in contralateral territories until at least P8. At P10 there were very few axons in the cortical plate of shRNACux1-electroporated brains, but these few axons did not show defective branching compared to controls (Figures S3D and S3E). Thus, in Cux1-deficient contralateral axons, we did not observe any evidence to suggest a general branching deficit. We further investigated potential branching deficits by analyzing the ipsilateral axons of Cux1-deficient layer II/III neurons projecting callosally. This also assessed whether axonal loss is specific to the contralateral axonal territory. As in P16 (Figure 1E), in IUE experiments targeting the majority of layer II/III neurons, no obvious differences were detected between ipsilateral axons of control and shRNACux1-targeted neurons at P4 (not shown) or P8 (Figure S2C). To distinguish possible differences with neurons projecting only ipsilaterally, the subpopulation of control and shRNACux1-targeted neurons with axons crossing to the contralateral hemisphere were retrograde labeled at P5 by fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) injections in the CC at the midline. Ipsilateral branches of individual CTB+ neurons were analyzed at P11, when the major loss of contralateral axons has already occurred in shRNACux1 brains, using the CRE-floxed-GFP dilution strategy. Reconstructions and quantifications of the number of branches in layers II/III and V showed that ipsilateral arbors from all Cux1-deficient CTB+ callosal neurons were indistinguishable from controls (Figure 3 and Movie S1). Importantly, this demonstrates that Cux1-deficient axons branch and develop normally in ipsilateral territories. Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of Cux1 does not generally alter the capacity of callosal neurons to establish synapses or axonal branches but specifically disrupts the development of contralateral callosal connectivity. Activity has a role in regulating CC axonal development (Mizuno et al., 2010Mizuno H. Hirano T. Tagawa Y.

In order to ascertain a possible role for neuronal activity in Cux1-mediated CC contralateral patterning, we perturbed electrical activity by utilizing the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir2.1. Overexpression of Kir2.1 in WT brains eliminated many of the branches of the primary SS areas (60% innervation compared to controls) and altered the normal CC contralateral layer-specific branching pattern (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4E ), coinciding with previously reported data (Mizuno et al., 2010Mizuno H.

https://openalex.org/W2265610272,"We identify a limited subpopulation of epidermal cancer stem cells (ECS cells), in squamous cell carcinoma, that form rapidly growing, invasive and highly vascularized tumors, as compared with non-stem cancer cells. These ECS cells grow as non-attached spheroids, and display enhanced migration and invasion. We show that ECS cell-produced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is required for the maintenance of this phenotype, as knockdown of VEGF-A gene expression or treatment with VEGF-A-inactivating antibody reduces these responses. In addition, treatment with bevacizumab reduces tumor vascularity and growth. Surprisingly, the classical mechanism of VEGF-A action via interaction with VEGF receptors does not mediate these events, as these cells lack VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Instead, VEGF-A acts via the neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) co-receptor. Knockdown of NRP-1 inhibits ECS cell spheroid formation, invasion and migration, and attenuates tumor formation. These studies suggest that VEGF-A acts via interaction with NRP-1 to trigger intracellular events leading to ECS cell survival and formation of aggressive, invasive and highly vascularized tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2252896286,"Endoglin, a transforming growth factor-β co-receptor, is highly expressed on angiogenic endothelial cells in solid tumors. Therefore, targeting endoglin is currently being explored in clinical trials for anti-angiogenic therapy. In this project, the redundancy between endoglin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in angiogenesis and the effects of targeting both pathways on breast cancer metastasis were explored. In patient samples, increased endoglin signaling after VEGF inhibition was observed. In vitro TRC105, an endoglin-neutralizing antibody, increased VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. Moreover, combined targeting of the endoglin and VEGF pathway, with the VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor SU5416, increased antiangiogenic effects in vitro and in a zebrafish angiogenesis model. Next, in a mouse model for invasive lobular breast cancer, the effects of TRC105 and SU5416 on tumor growth and metastasis were explored. Although TRC105 and SU5416 decreased tumor vascular density, tumor volume was unaffected. Strikingly, in mice treated with TRC105, or TRC105 and SU5416 combined, a strong inhibition in the number of metastases was seen. Moreover, upon resection of the primary tumor, strong inhibition of metastatic spread by TRC105 was observed in an adjuvant setting. To confirm these data, we assessed the effects of endoglin-Fc (an endoglin ligand trap) on metastasis formation. Similar to treatment with TRC105 in the resection model, endoglin-Fc-expressing tumors showed strong inhibition of distant metastases. These results show, for the first time, that targeting endoglin, either with neutralizing antibodies or a ligand trap, strongly inhibits metastatic spread of breast cancer in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2407716000,"This paper describes the discovery of novel α-L-fucosidases and evaluation of their potential to catalyse the transglycosylation reaction leading to production of fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides. Seven novel α-L-fucosidase-encoding genes were identified by functional screening of a soil-derived metagenome library and expressed in E. coli as recombinant 6xHis-tagged proteins. All seven fucosidases belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 29 (GH 29). Six of the seven α-L-fucosidases were substrate-inhibited, moderately thermostable and most hydrolytically active in the pH range 6–7, when tested with para-nitrophenyl-α-L-fucopyranoside (pNP-Fuc) as the substrate. In contrast, one fucosidase (Mfuc6) exhibited a high pH optimum and an unusual sigmoidal kinetics towards pNP-Fuc substrate. When tested for trans-fucosylation activity using pNP-Fuc as donor, most of the enzymes were able to transfer fucose to pNP-Fuc (self-condensation) or to lactose. With the α-L-fucosidase from Thermotoga maritima and the metagenome-derived Mfuc5, different fucosyllactose variants including the principal fucosylated HMO 2’-fucosyllactose were synthesised in yields of up to ~6.4%. Mfuc5 was able to release fucose from xyloglucan and could also use it as a fucosyl-donor for synthesis of fucosyllactose. This is the first study describing the use of glycosyl hydrolases for the synthesis of genuine fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides."

Here, we report the identification and characterization of p65BTK, a novel isoform abundantly expressed in colon carcinoma cell lines and tumour tissue samples. p65BTK protein is expressed, through heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK)-dependent and internal ribosome entry site-driven translation, from a transcript containing an alternative first exon in the 5′-untranslated region, and is post-transcriptionally regulated, via hnRNPK, by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. p65BTK is endowed with strong transforming activity that depends on active signal-regulated protein kinases-1/2 (ERK1/2) and its inhibition abolishes RAS transforming activity. Accordingly, p65BTK overexpression in colon cancer tissues correlates with ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, p65BTK inhibition affects growth and survival of colon cancer cells. Our data reveal that BTK, via p65BTK expression, is a novel and powerful oncogene acting downstream of the RAS/MAPK pathway and suggest that its targeting may be a promising therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2262610975,"We report that Mucin1 (MUC1), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in >80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), induced a pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment by increasing the levels of neuropilin-1 (NRP1, a co-receptor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) and its ligand VEGF. Expression of tumor-associated MUC1 (tMUC1) positively correlated with NRP1 levels in human and mouse PDA. Further, tMUC1hi PDA cells secreted high levels of VEGF and expressed high levels of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and its phosphorylated forms as compared with tMUC1low/null PDA. This enabled the tMUC1hi/NRP1hi PDA cells to (a) induce endothelial cell tube formation, (b) generate long ectopic blood vessels and (c) enhance distant metastasis in a zebrafish xenograft model. Concurrently, the proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, N-cadherin and Vimentin, were highly induced in these tMUC1/NRP1hi PDA cells. Hence, blocking signaling via the NRP1–VEGF axis significantly reduced tube formation, new vessel generation and metastasis induced by tMUC1hi PDA cells. Finally, we show that blocking the interaction between VEGF165 and NRP1 with a NRP1 antagonist significantly reduced VEGFR signaling and PDA tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest a novel molecular mechanism by which tMUC1 may modulate NRP1-dependent VEGFR signaling in PDA cells."
https://openalex.org/W2417546716,"Inhibiting the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) domain family of epigenetic reader proteins has been shown to have potent anti-tumoral activity, which is commonly attributed to suppression of transcription. In this study, we show that two structurally distinct BET inhibitors (BETi) interfere with replication and cell cycle progression of murine Myc-induced lymphoma cells at sub-lethal concentrations when the transcriptome remains largely unaltered. This inhibition of replication coincides with a DNA-damage response and enhanced sensitivity to inhibitors of the upstream replication stress sensor ATR in vitro and in mouse models of B-cell lymphoma. Mechanistically, ATR and BETi combination therapy cause robust transcriptional changes of genes involved in cell death, senescence-associated secretory pathway, NFkB signaling and ER stress. Our data reveal that BETi can potentiate the cell stress and death caused by ATR inhibitors. This suggests that ATRi can be used in combination therapies of lymphomas without the use of genotoxic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2265677187,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) invasion and metastasis are complex phenomena that result from the coordinated action of many metastatic regulators and must be overcome to improve clinical outcomes for patients with these cancers. The identification of novel therapeutic targets is critical because of the limited success of current treatment regimens, particularly in advanced-stage ovarian cancers. In this study, we found that tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) is overexpressed in about 52% (14/27) of EOC tissues and correlates with poor survival. Using small interfering RNA-mediated TSPAN8 knockdown and a competition assay with purified TSPAN8 large extracellular loop (TSPAN8-LEL) protein, we identified TSPAN8-LEL as a key regulator of EOC cell invasion. Furthermore, monotherapy with TSPAN8-blocking antibody we developed shows that antibody-based modulation of TSPAN8-LEL can significantly reduce the incidence of EOC metastasis without severe toxicity in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that the TSPAN8-blocking antibody promotes the internalization and concomitant downregulation of cell surface TSPAN8. Collectively, our data suggest TSPAN8 as a potential novel therapeutic target in EOCs and antibody targeting of TSPAN8 as an effective strategy for inhibiting invasion and metastasis of TSPAN8-expressing EOCs."
https://openalex.org/W2270025418,"Animals behave differently in response to visual cues with distinct ethological meaning, a process usually thought to be achieved through differential visual processing. Using a defined zebrafish escape circuit as a model, we found that behavior selection can be implemented at the visuomotor transformation stage through a visually responsive dopaminergic-inhibitory circuit module. In response to non-threatening visual stimuli, hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons and their positively regulated hindbrain inhibitory interneurons increase activity, suppressing synaptic transmission from the visual center to the escape circuit. By contrast, threatening visual stimuli inactivate some of these neurons, resulting in dis-inhibition of the visuomotor transformation and escape generation. The distinct patterns of dopaminergic-inhibitory neural module's visual responses account for this stimulus-specific visuomotor transformation and behavioral control. Thus, our study identifies a behavioral relevance-dependent mechanism that controls visuomotor transformation and behavior selection and reveals that neuromodulation can be tuned by visual cues to help animals generate appropriate responses."
https://openalex.org/W2271414705,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation is the most common genetic change in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Although deregulations of miRNAs have been frequently reported in this malignancy, APC-regulated miRNAs have not been extensively documented. Here, by using an APC-inducible cell line and array analysis, we identified a total of 26 deregulated miRNAs. Among them, members of miR-17-92 cluster were dramatically inhibited by APC and induced by enforced expression of β-catenin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activated β-catenin resulted from APC loss binds to and activates the miR-17-92 promoter. Notably, enforced expression of miR-19a overrides APC tumor suppressor activity, and knockdown of miR-19a in cancer cells with compromised APC function reduced their aggressive features in vitro. Finally, we observed that expression of miR-19a significantly correlates with β-catenin levels in colorectal cancer specimens, and it is associated to the aggressive stage of tumor progression. Thus, our study reveals that miR-17-92 cluster is directly regulated by APC/β-catenin pathway and could be a potential therapeutic target in colon cancers with aberrant APC/β-catenin signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2268817254,"N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), which catalyzes the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc branch on N-glycans, is usually described as a metastasis suppressor. Overexpression of GnT-III inhibited migration in multiple types of tumor cells. However, these results seem controversial to the clinical observations for the increased expression of GnT-III in human hepatomas, glioma, and ovarian cancers. Here, we present evidence that these inconsistencies are mainly attributed to the different expression pattern of cell sialylation. In detail, we show that overexpression of GnT-III significantly inhibits α2,3-sialylation but not α2,6-sialylation. The migratory ability of cells without or with a low level of α2,6-sialylation is consistently suppressed after GnT-III overexpression. In contrast, the effects of GnT-III overexpression are variable in tumor cells that are highly α2,6-sialylated. Overexpression of GnT-III promotes the cell migration in glioma cells U-251 and hepatoma cells HepG2, although it has little influence in human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and gastric cancer cell MKN-45. Interestingly, up-regulation of α2,6-sialylation by overexpressing β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltranferase 1 in the α2,6-hyposialylated HeLa-S3 cells abolishes the anti-migratory effects of GnT-III. Conversely, depletion of α2,6-sialylation by knock-out of β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltranferase 1 in α2,6-hypersialylated HepG2 cells endows GnT-III with the anti-migratory ability. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that high expression of α2,6-sialylation on the cell surface could affect the anti-migratory role of GnT-III, which provides an insight into the mechanistic roles of GnT-III in tumor metastasis.

Interestingly, up-regulation of α2,6-sialylation by overexpressing β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltranferase 1 in the α2,6-hyposialylated HeLa-S3 cells abolishes the anti-migratory effects of GnT-III. Conversely, depletion of α2,6-sialylation by knock-out of β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltranferase 1 in α2,6-hypersialylated HepG2 cells endows GnT-III with the anti-migratory ability. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that high expression of α2,6-sialylation on the cell surface could affect the anti-migratory role of GnT-III, which provides an insight into the mechanistic roles of GnT-III in tumor metastasis. Alterations in N-linked glycosylation have been observed in various malignant diseases such as cancer. Certain glycan structures resulting from the dysregulated glycosyltransferases and glycosidases are well known tumor markers and closely associated with the malignant progression (1Pinho S.S. Reis C.A. Glycosylation in cancer: mechanisms and clinical implications.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 540-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). As examples, the α1,6-fucosylated α-fetoprotein catalyzed by α1,6-fucosyltransferase has been developed as a biomarker for primary hepatoma by Abelev (2Abelev G.I. α-Fetoprotein in ontogenesis and its association with malignant tumors.Adv.

An increase in β1,6-GlcNAc branching of N-glycans as a consequence of enhanced expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) 2The abbreviations used are: GnT-V, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V; ConA, concanavalin A; DSA, D. stramonium agglutinin; E4-PHA, erythro-agglutinating phytohemagglutinin; FN, fibronectin; GnT-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III; MAA, M. amurensis agglutinin; SNA, S. nigra lectin; ST6GAL1, β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltranferase 1; DOX, doxycycline; PA, pyridiaminated. is convincingly correlated with the increased frequency of tumor metastasis (3Dennis J.W.

It catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a β1,4 linkage to mannose on N-glycans forming a bisecting GlcNAc structure. This step plays critical roles in determining the structure of N-glycans because introduction of the bisecting GlcNAc residue could preclude further processing and elongation of N-glycans, such as the formation of β1,6-GlcNAc branching structures (9Zhao Y.

Considering also that overexpression of GnT-III inhibited the metastasis of multiple types of carcinomas (10Song Y. Aglipay J.A. Bernstein J.D. Goswami S. Stanley P.

Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in fact, there also exist some inconsistent results. It has been reported for decades that GnT-III expression was enhanced more than 100 times in human hepatomas (15Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Determination of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IV and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V in normal and hepatoma tissues of rats.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Also, recently, the expression of GnT-III, as well as α2,6-galactoside sialylatransferase 1 (ST6GAL1), which primarily catalyzes α2,6-linked sialic acids on N-glycans, was found up-regulated in the ovarian cancer (16Anugraham M. Jacob F. Nixdorf S. Everest-Dass A.V. Heinzelmann-Schwarz V. Packer N.H.

Thaysen-Andersen M. Smith J.T. Baker M.S. Packer N.H. Hancock W.S. Fanayan S.

Proteome Res. 2014; 13: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results indicate that there may exist one or several independent factors that overwhelm the effects of GnT-III and affect tumor metastasis. Sialic acid is the most abundant terminal monosaccharide of glycoconjugates and known to be linked via an α2,3 or α2,6 bond to Gal/GalNAc or an α2,8 bond to sialic acid in proteins through a group of sialyltransferases. Altered sialylation has been reported in almost all types of carcinomas and has long been associated with metastatic cell behaviors (18Lu J. Gu J.

Recently, accumulating information is obtained on the molecular details of how distinct sialylated structures or sialylated carrier proteins regulate cell signaling to control responses such as cell adhesion and migration (1Pinho S.S. Reis C.A. Glycosylation in cancer: mechanisms and clinical implications.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 540-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 23Schultz M.J. Swindall A.F. Bellis S.L. Regulation of the metastatic cell phenotype by sialylated glycans.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2012; 31: 501-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is limited knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanisms of sialylation on the cell surface. Several reports have indicated that some transcription factors were involved in the dysregulated expression of some sialyltransferases and neuraminidases (24Wang P.H. Li Y.F. Juang C.M. Lee Y.R. Chao H.T. Ng H.T. Tsai Y.C. Yuan C.C. Expression of sialyltransferase family members in cervix squamous cell carcinoma correlates with lymph node metastasis.Gynecol.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the altered transcription of these enzymes in tumor cells could not explain all the changes in sialylation. Given the outermost position of sialic acids on glycans and the branch specificities of different sialyltransferases, the amount and distribution of sialylation on the cell surface are also supposed to be affected by the altered expression of other glycosyltransferases responsible for branch formation in the N-glycan biosynthetic pathway. Nevertheless, the mechanisms in this respect are poorly understood. Given the important role of GnT-III in N-glycan biosynthesis and tumor cell behaviors, we considered there exists an interplay between GnT-III and sialyltransferases in the expression of their enzymatic products and also their functions in tumor metastasis. In this work, we present evidence that overexpression of GnT-III in different tumor cells significantly inhibits α2,3-sialylation, but not α2,6-sialylation. Further, GnT-III exerts anti-migratory functions only in cells without or with a low level of α2,6-sialylation. Knock-out of ST6GAL1 in the α2,6-hypersialylated HepG2 cells endows GnT-III with the anti-migratory role. Together, these findings implicate GnT-III as a tumor migration suppressor under an α2,6-hyposialylated context, but this role could be impaired by high expression of ST6GAL1, which provides a plausible explanation for the increased expression of GnT-III during tumor progression. The 293T and HeLa S3 cell lines were provided by the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). The MDA-MB-231 cell line was purchased from ATCC. The CHO-K1 and the U-251MG cell lines were gifted by Dr. Hideyoshi Higashi (Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Japan) and Prof. Jun Nakayama (Graduate School of Medicine, Shinshu University, Matsumoto, Japan), respectively. All cell lines above, as well as human hepatoma HepG2 cells, were maintained in high glucose DMEM with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% FBS, for CHO-K1 cells also with nonessential amino acids. Two other previously established MKN-45 cell lines transfected with GnT-III-expressing or mock vectors were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS (9Zhao Y. Nakagawa T. Itoh S. Inamori K.

All cells were cultured under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and then lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein were separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and probed with the appropriate antibodies as indicated or with biotinylated erythro-agglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E4-PHA), biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA), Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA), Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), and concanavalin A (ConA) lectins (Seikagaku Kogyo Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Monoclonal antibodies against α3 integrin, αv integrin, and β1 integrin were purchased from BD Biosciences, and the anti-α-tubulin antibody was from Sigma. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant (2 mg of protein) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with ConA-agarose or MAM (M. amurensis) agarose or Sambucus sieboldiana agarose (J-Oil Mill). After washing three times with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with a lectin for lectin blot analysis or with an antibody for immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (29Lu J. Isaji T. Im S. Fukuda T.

Samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight with appropriate primary antibodies. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce Biotechnology or Immobilon Western, Millipore).

The obtained lentiviral vectors were transfected into 293T cells with packaging plasmids by the calcium phosphate for the preparation of viruses. The obtained viruses were then incubated with different cell lines for 72 h. The infected cells were selected by the Kusabira Orange marker using FACS Aria II (BD Bioscience). The expression of GnT-III was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml DOX in the established cell line, and the cells cultured under DOX-free medium were used as the control in the present study. The sgRNAs (pSpCas9-ST6GAL1-For, CACCGATGATCATGACGCAGTCCTG; and pSpCas9 ST6GAL1-Rev, AAACCAGGACTGCGTCATGATCATC) for ST6GAL1 knock-out were designed based on previously described design rules and inserted into the plasmid pX458 (32Ran F.A.

The obtained plasmid were confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into DH5α competent cells for amplification. The constructed plasmids were transfected into different tumor cells by Cell Line NucleofectorTM kits (Lonza). The transfected cells were then incubated for 72 h and selected by the GFP marker using FACS Aria II (BD Bioscience). Finally, further negative selection for the obtained cells by SNA lectin was performed by using FACS Aria II to remove the cells expressing α2,6-sialylation. Cells were grown to ∼90% confluency, detached using trypsin containing 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C, and washed three times with cold PBS. Then cells were stained with anti-β1 integrin antibody (P5D2) or 10 μg/ml biotinylated SNA or MAA for 30 min on ice, followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugate Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Total RNA was prepared with TRI reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit with a gDNA Eraser (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primers used for the PCR amplification were designed previously (29Lu J. Isaji T. Im S. Fukuda T. Hashii N. Takakura D. Kawasaki N.

Cells cultured for 4 days were starved in serum-free medium for 12 h, trypsinized, and suspended with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Nacalai Tesque) in DMEM. The suspended cells were centrifuged, and the supernatants were removed. The resulted cell pellets were resuspended with assay medium (serum-free DMEM) and diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml. To each FN-coated Transwell, 500-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were added; the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for appropriate time. After incubation, cells on the upper side were removed by scraping with a cotton swab. The membranes in the Transwells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 1 h. The cells that had migrated to the lower side were counted using a phase contrast microscope. Cells were harvested from three dishes (15 cm) of subconfluent cultures.

The prepared PA oligosaccharides were subjected to an HPLC system equipped with a TSK-gel 80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C using 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) as solvent A and the same buffer containing 1% 1-butanol as solvent B. The column was pre-equilibrated with 10% solvents B, and after injection of a sample, the PA oligosaccharides were separated by a linear gradient of 10–25% of solvent B for 60 min. The eluted PA oligosaccharides were monitored by a fluorescence detector at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively.

Pellets were dissolved in 8 m urea in PBS, and then the aliquots (300 μg of protein) were reduced in 20 mm DTT, followed by alkylation with 40 mm iodoacetamide. After dilution with distilled water to 2 m urea solution, 6 μg of trypsin from bovine pancreas (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was added to the solution. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h and then dialyzed against distilled water by using a mini dialysis kit (1-kDa cutoff; GE Healthcare). After inactivation of the trypsin by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by lyophilization, the mixtures were dissolved in 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate. Glycopeptidase F (1 milliunit; Takara Bio Inc.) was added to the solution, incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, and then lyophilized. Obtained residues were dissolved in distilled water (100 μl) and passed through cation exchange cartridge OASIS MCX (1 ml; Waters) and solid phase extraction cartridge SepPak C18 (1 ml; Waters), and then the cartridges were washed with 1 ml of distilled water. The pass-through fraction and washings were combined and lyophilized. For α2,3-neuraminidase digestion, the lyophilized residues were dissolved in 40 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). α2,3-Neuraminidases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (2 μl; Sigma) was added to the solution and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h, then passed through solid phase extraction cartridge SepPak C18 (1 ml, Waters), and lyophilized.

Mass measurements were performed with a MALDI quadrupole ion trap TOF instrument (AXIMA-QIT; Shimadzu Corp.). All of the spectra were obtained using MS mode with high mass range (over m/z 2000) and were the result of signal averaging of 200 laser shots. For sample preparation, 0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution (10 mg/ml in 30% ethanol) was deposited on the target plate and allowed to dry. Then 0.5 μl of analyte dissolved in 50% acetonitrile was used to cover the matrix on the target plate and allowed to dry. Finally, the dried materials were recrystallized by adding 0.15 μl of 99.5% ethanol to the matrix-analyte mixture on the target plate.

However, in mouse models for atherosclerosis, global Acat1 knockout (Acat1−/−) did not prevent lesion development. Acat1−/− increased apoptosis within lesions and led to several additional undesirable phenotypes, including hair loss, dry eye, leukocytosis, xanthomatosis, and a reduced life span. To determine the roles of Acat1 in monocytes/macrophages in atherosclerosis, we produced a myeloid-specific Acat1 knockout (Acat1−M/−M) mouse and showed that, in the Apoe knockout (Apoe−/−) mouse model for atherosclerosis, Acat1−M/−M decreased the plaque area and reduced lesion size without causing leukocytosis, dry eye, hair loss, or a reduced life span. Acat1−M/−M enhanced xanthomatosis in apoe−/− mice, a skin disease that is not associated with diet-induced atherosclerosis in humans. Analyses of atherosclerotic lesions showed that Acat1−M/−M reduced macrophage numbers and diminished the cholesterol and cholesteryl ester load without causing detectable apoptotic cell death. Leukocyte migration analysis in vivo showed that Acat1−M/−M caused much fewer leukocytes to appear at the activated endothelium. Studies in inflammatory (Ly6Chi-positive) monocytes and in cultured macrophages showed that inhibiting ACAT1 by gene knockout or by pharmacological inhibition caused a significant decrease in integrin β 1 (CD29) expression in activated monocytes/macrophages. The sparse presence of lesion macrophages without Acat1 can therefore, in part, be attributed to decreased interaction between inflammatory monocytes/macrophages lacking Acat1 and the activated endothelium. We conclude that targeting ACAT1 in a myeloid cell lineage suppresses atherosclerosis progression while avoiding many of the undesirable side effects caused by global Acat1 inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2406007515,"Ceftaroline (CPT) is a novel cephalosporin with in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Ceftaroline exhibits a level of binding affinity for PBPs in S. aureus including PBP2a of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The aims of this study were to investigate the morphological, physiological and molecular responses of MRSA clinical strains and MRSA biofilms to sub-MICs (1/4 and 1/16 MIC) of ceftaroline by using transmission, scanning and confocal microscopy. We have also used quantitative Real-Time PCR to study the effect of sub-MICs of ceftaroline on the expression of the staphylococcal icaA, agrA, sarA and sasF genes in MRSA biofilms. In one set of experiments, ceftaroline was able to inhibit biofilm formation in all strains tested at MIC, however, a strain dependent behavior in presence of sub-MICs of ceftaroline was shown. In a second set of experiments, destruction of preformed biofilms by addition of ceftaroline was evaluated. Ceftaroline was able to inhibit biofilm formation at MIC in all strains tested but not at the sub-MICs. Destruction of preformed biofilms was strain dependent because the biofilm formed by a matrix-producing strain was resistant to a challenge with ceftaroline at MIC, whereas in other strains the biofilm was sensitive. At sub-MICs, the impact of ceftaroline on expression of virulence genes was strain-dependent at 1/4 MIC and no correlation between ceftaroline-enhanced biofilm formation and gene regulation was established at 1/16 MIC. Our findings suggest that sub-MICs of ceftaroline enhance bacterial attachment and biofilm formation by some, but not all, MRSA strains and, therefore, stress the importance of maintaining effective bactericidal concentrations of ceftaroline to fight biofilm-MRSA related infections."
https://openalex.org/W2256898151,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus that induces a fatal T-cell malignancy, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Among several regulatory/accessory genes in HTLV-1, HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is the only viral gene constitutively expressed in infected cells. Our previous study showed that HBZ functions in two different molecular forms, HBZ protein and HBZ RNA. In this study, we show that HBZ protein targets retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is a critical tumor suppressor in many types of cancers. HBZ protein interacts with the Rb/E2F-1 complex and activates the transcription of E2F-target genes associated with cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Mouse primary CD4+ T cells transduced with HBZ show accelerated G1/S transition and apoptosis, and importantly, T cells from HBZ transgenic (HBZ-Tg) mice also demonstrate enhanced cell proliferation and apoptosis. To evaluate the functions of HBZ protein alone in vivo, we generated a new transgenic mouse strain that expresses HBZ mRNA altered by silent mutations but encoding intact protein. In these mice, the numbers of effector/memory and Foxp3+ T cells were increased, and genes associated with proliferation and apoptosis were upregulated. This study shows that HBZ protein promotes cell proliferation and apoptosis in primary CD4+ T cells through activation of the Rb/E2F pathway, and that HBZ protein also confers onto CD4+ T-cell immunophenotype similar to those of ATL cells, suggesting that HBZ protein has important roles in dysregulation of CD4+ T cells infected with HTLV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2265720901,"The mechanisms underlying reprogramming of growth factor signaling and metabolic pathways during bone metastasis of breast cancer are not clear. The Runt-related transcription factor (Runx2) regulates cell signaling during mammary epithelial morphogenesis and promotes invasion; therefore, we investigated its role in cell growth and metabolic signaling in bone-seeking breast cancer cells. We performed systemic inoculation of control or Runx2 knockdown invasive MDA-MB-231 cells in NOD/SCID mice, and compared parental and bone-derived variants for phenotypic and molecular alterations. The Runx2 knockdown showed early (0–2 weeks) inhibition of metastatic spread but late (4–6 weeks) outgrowth, suggesting Runx2-dependent bi-phasic response and reprogramming of metastatic cells. The late-stage tumor outgrowth of bone-derived Runx2 knockdown cells was associated with increased insulin-like growth factor- 1Rβ (IGF-1Rβ) levels. Interestingly, glucose uptake and glycolysis were reduced in the bone-derived Runx2 knockdown cells that could be further reduced by extracellular-regulated protein kinase (Erk1/2) inhibition. Furthermore, the Runx2 knockdown cells displayed activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα), the sensor of cellular metabolism. Importantly, the Runx2 knockdown in bone-derived cells resulted in increased sensitivity to both Erk1/2 inhibition and AMPKα activation by PD184161 and metformin, respectively, despite increased IGF-1Rβ and AMPKα levels. Our results reveal that Runx2 promotes metastatic spread of mammary tumor cells. The growth of late-stage tumor cells can be targeted by Runx2 knockdown in combination with Mek-Erk1/2 inhibition and metformin treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2270019828,"Although systemic hypertension is a risk factor of age-related macular degeneration, antihypertensive medications do not affect the risk of the disease. One condition that induces hypertension is high intake of dietary salt resulting in increased blood osmolarity. In order to prove the assumption that, in addition to hypertension, high osmolarity may aggravate neovascular retinal diseases, we determined the effect of extracellular hyperosmolarity on the expression of angiogenic cytokines in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.Hyperosmolarity was induced by the addition of 100 mM NaCl or sucrose to the culture medium. Hypoxia and oxidative stress were induced by the addition of the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2 and H2O2, respectively. Alterations in gene expression were determined with real-time RT-PCR. Secretion of bFGF was evaluated by ELISA. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Nuclear factor of activated T cell 5 (NFAT5) expression was knocked down with siRNA. Hyperosmolarity induced transcriptional activation of bFGF, HB-EGF, and VEGF genes, while the expression of other cytokines such as EGF, PDGF-A, TGF-β1, HGF, and PEDF was not or moderately altered. Hypoxia induced increased expression of the HB-EGF, EGF, PDGF-A, TGF-β1, and VEGF genes, but not of the bFGF gene. Oxidative stress induced gene expression of HB-EGF, but not of bFGF. The hyperosmotic expression of the bFGF gene was dependent on the activation of p38α/β MAPK, JNK, PI3K, and the transcriptional activity of NFAT5. The hyperosmotic expression of the HB-EGF gene was dependent on the activation of p38α/β MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK. The hyperosmotic expression of bFGF, HB-EGF, and VEGF genes was reduced by inhibitors of TGF-β1 superfamily activin receptor-like kinase receptors and the FGF receptor kinase, respectively. Hyperosmolarity induced secretion of bFGF that was reduced by inhibition of autocrine/paracrine TGF-β1 signaling and by NFAT5 siRNA, respectively. Hyperosmolarity decreased the viability of the cells; this effect was not altered by exogenous bFGF and HB-EGF. Various vegetable polyphenols (luteolin, quercetin, apigenin) inhibited the hyperosmotic expression of bFGF, HB-EGF, and NFAT5 genes.Hyperosmolarity induces transcription of bFGF and HB-EGF genes, and secretion of bFGF from RPE cells. This is in part mediated by autocrine/paracrine TGF-β1 and FGF signaling. It is suggested that high intake of dietary salt resulting in osmotic stress may aggravate neovascular retinal diseases via stimulation of the production of angiogenic factors in RPE cells, independent of hypertension."

Gα12 and Gα13, encoded by GNA12 and GNA13, respectively, are referred to as the GEP oncogene and are implicated in tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Gα12/13 activation promotes cancer progression are not fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate elevated expression of Gα12/13 in human ovarian cancer tissues. Gα12/13 activation did not promote cellular migration in the ovarian cancer cell lines examined. Rather, Gα12/13 activation promoted cell growth. We used a synthetic biology approach using chimeric G proteins and GPCRs activated solely by artificial ligands to selectively trigger signaling pathways downstream of specific G proteins. We found that Gα12/13 promotes proliferation of ovarian cancer cells by activating the transcriptional coactivator YAP, a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway. Furthermore, we reveal that inhibition of YAP by short hairpin RNA or a specific inhibitor prevented the growth of ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, YAP may be a suitable therapeutic target in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2345041451,"Although iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in subsurface environments have crucial roles in biogeochemical cycling of C, Fe, and S, how specific electron donors impact the compositional structure and activity of native iron- and/or sulfate-reducing communities is largely unknown. To understand this better, we created bicarbonate-buffered batch systems in duplicate with three different electron donors (acetate, lactate, or glucose) paired with ferrihydrite and sulfate as the electron acceptors and inoculated them with subsurface sediment as the microbial inoculum. Sulfate and ferrihydrite reduction occurred simultaneously and were faster with lactate than with acetate. 16S rRNA-based sequence analysis of the communities over time revealed that Desulfotomaculum was the major driver for sulfate reduction coupled with propionate oxidation in lactate-amended incubations. The reduction of sulfate resulted in sulfide production and subsequent abiotic reduction of ferrihydrite. In contrast, glucose promoted faster reduction of ferrihydrite, but without reduction of sulfate. Interestingly, the glucose-amended incubations led to two different biogeochemical trajectories among replicate bottles that resulted in distinct coloration (white and brown). The two outcomes in geochemical evolution might be due to the stochastic evolution of the microbial communities or subtle differences in the initial composition of the fermenting microbial community and its development via the use of different glucose fermentation pathways available within the community. Synchrotron-based x-ray analysis indicated that siderite and amorphous Fe(II) were formed in the replicate bottles with glucose, while ferrous sulfide and vivianite were formed with lactate or acetate. These data sets reveal that use of different C utilization pathways projects significant changes in microbial community composition over time that uniquely impact both the geochemistry and mineralogy of subsurface environments."
https://openalex.org/W2473490130,"Organ-transplant-recipients exhibit cancerization of the skin from which multiple human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) arise. However, the molecular basis for HPV-induced invasion of skin keratinocytes is not known. We generated a transgenic mouse model expressing the E7 oncoprotein of HPV8 in the murine epidermis under the control of the keratin-14 promoter and showed that E7 is carcinogenic in mice. We further showed that both, the E7-expressing keratinocyte and mesenchymal components of the extracellular matrix as critical in eliciting the invasive behavior. E7 expression in basal keratinocytes, grown on fibronectin, led to epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediated by a cadherin switch. E7-positive keratinocytes displayed enhanced EDA-fibronectin expression and secretion and stimulated dermal fibroblasts to express EDA-fibronectin. Deposition of fibronectin was also detected in the peritumoral stroma of HPV8-positive skin SCC. When grown on fibronectin, E7-positive keratinocytes, in particular stem cell-like cells, exhibited increased cell surface levels of the α3-integrin chain. Functional blocking confirmed α3 as a critical molecule sufficient to induce E7-mediated invasion. This mechanistic link is further supported by expression of an E7-mutant, impaired in targeting α3 to the cell surface. These findings highlight the importance of epithelial-extracellular matrix interaction required for keratinocyte invasion and provide further mechanistic evidence for a role of HPV in skin carcinogenesis."

However, no effective and environmentally friendly chemical method has been discovered to control this pest. Until recently, the molecular basis of the olfactory system in A. quadriimpressum was completely unknown. In this study, antennae and leg transcriptomes were analyzed and compared using deep sequencing data to identify the olfactory genes in A. quadriimpressum. Moreover, the expression profiles of both male and female candidate olfactory genes were analyzed and validated by bioinformatics, motif analysis, homology analysis, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and RT-qPCR experiments in antennal and non-olfactory organs to explore the candidate olfactory genes that might play key roles in the life cycle of A. quadriimpressum. As a result, approximately 102.9 million and 97.3 million clean reads were obtained from the libraries created from the antennas and legs, respectively. Annotation led to 34344 Unigenes, which were matched to known proteins. Annotation data revealed that the number of genes in antenna with binding functions and receptor activity was greater than that of legs. Furthermore, many pathway genes were differentially expressed in the two organs. Sixteen candidate odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 10 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 34 odorant receptors (ORs), 20 inotropic receptors [1] and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and their isoforms were identified. Additionally, 15 OBPs, 9 CSPs, 18 ORs, 6 IRs and 2 SNMPs were predicted to be complete ORFs. Using RT-PCR, RT-qPCR and homology analysis, AquaOBP1/2/4/7/C1/C6, AquaCSP3/9, AquaOR8/9/10/14/15/18/20/26/29/33, AquaIR8a/13/25a showed olfactory-specific expression, indicating that these genes might play a key role in olfaction-related behaviors in A. quadriimpressum such as foraging and seeking. AquaOBP4/C5, AquaOBP4/C5, AquaCSP7/9/10, AquaOR17/24/32 and AquaIR4 were highly expressed in the antenna of males, suggesting that these genes were related to sex-specific behaviors, and expression trends that were male specific were observed for most candidate olfactory genes, which supported the existence of a female-produced sex pheromone in A. quadriimpressum. All of these results could provide valuable information and guidance for future functional studies on these genes and provide better molecular knowledge regarding the olfactory system in A. quadriimpressum."
https://openalex.org/W2271920132,"Resisting death is a central hallmark of cancer cells. Tumors rely on a number of genetic mechanisms to avoid apoptosis, and alterations in mRNA alternative splicing are increasingly recognized to have a role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we identify the splicing regulator SLU7 as an essential factor for the preservation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells viability. Compared with hepatocytes, SLU7 expression is reduced in HCC cells; however, further SLU7 depletion triggered autophagy-related cellular apoptosis in association with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Remarkably, these responses were not observed in primary human hepatocytes or in the well-differentiated HepaRG cell line. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that SLU7 binds the C13orf25 primary transcript in which the polycistronic oncomir miR-17-92 cluster is encompassed, and is necessary for its processing and expression. SLU7 knockdown altered the splicing of the C13orf25 primary transcript, and markedly reduced the expression of its miR-17, miR-20 and miR-92a constituents. This led to the upregulation of CDKN1A (P21) and BCL2L11 (BIM) expression, two bona fide targets of the miR-17-92 cluster and recognized mediators of its pro-survival and tumorigenic activity. Interestingly, altered splicing of miR-17-92 and downregulation of miR-17 and miR-20 were not observed upon SLU7 knockdown in non-transformed hepatocytes, but was found in other (HeLa, H358) but not in all (Caco2) non-hepatic tumor cells. The functional relevance of miR-17-92 dysregulation upon SLU7 knockdown was established when oxidative stress, autophagy and apoptosis were reversed by co-transfection of HCC cells with a miR-17 mimic. Together, these findings indicate that SLU7 is co-opted by HCC cells and other tumor cell types to maintain survival, and identify this splicing regulator as a new determinant for the expression of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster. This novel mechanism may be exploited for the development of antitumoral strategies in cancers displaying such SLU7-miR-17-92 crosstalk."
https://openalex.org/W2264283438,"The WASF3 gene is overexpressed in high-grade breast cancer and promotes invasion and metastasis, but does not affect proliferation. The HER2/ERBB2/NEU gene is also frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, and has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis in these tumors. Here, we show that WASF3 is present in the HER2 immunocomplex and suppression of WASF3 function leads to suppression of invasion even in the presence of HER2 expression. Overexpression of both HER2 and WASF3 in non-metastatic MCF7 breast cancer cells promotes invasion and metastasis more significantly than either gene alone. HER2 forms homodimers as well as heterodimers with other HER family members and we now show that the ability of WASF3 to promote invasion is highly dependent on the HER2/HER3 heterodimer. The engagement of WASF3 with the HER2/HER3 complex facilitates its phospho-activation and transcriptional upregulation, which is facilitated by HER2/HER3 activation of JAK/STAT signaling. In breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2, therefore, WASF3 is specifically required to facilitate the invasion/metastasis response. Targeting WASF3, therefore, could be a potential therapeutic approach to suppress metastasis of HER2-overexpressing breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2256182217,"A new method is presented to determine the retinal spectral sensitivity function S(λ) using the electroretinogram (ERG). S(λ)s were assessed in three different species of myomorph rodents, Gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), Wistar rats (Ratus norvegicus), and mice (Mus musculus). The method, called AC Constant Method, is based on a computerized automatic feedback system that adjusts light intensity to maintain a constant-response amplitude to a flickering stimulus throughout the spectrum, as it is scanned from 300 to 700 nm, and back. The results are presented as the reciprocal of the intensity at each wavelength required to maintain a constant peak to peak response amplitude. The resulting S(λ) had two peaks in all three rodent species, corresponding to ultraviolet and M cones, respectively: 359 nm and 511 nm for mice, 362 nm and 493 nm for gerbils, and 362 nm and 502 nm for rats. Results for mouse and gerbil were similar to literature reports of S(λ) functions obtained with other methods, confirming that the ERG associated to the AC Constant-Response Method was effective to obtain reliable S(λ) functions. In addition, due to its fast data collection time, the AC Constant Response Method has the advantage of keeping the eye in a constant light adapted state."
https://openalex.org/W2261313036,"Amacrine cells are thought to be a major locus for mechanisms of light adaptation and contrast enhancement in the retina. However, the potential for plasticity in their AMPA receptor currents remains largely unknown. Using paired patch-clamp recordings between bipolar cell terminals and amacrine cells, we have simultaneously measured presynaptic membrane capacitance changes and EPSCs. Repetitive bipolar cell depolarizations, designed to maintain the same amount of exocytosis, nevertheless significantly potentiated evoked EPSCs in a subpopulation of amacrine cells. Likewise, repetitive iontophoresis (or puffs) of glutamate (or AMPA) onto the dendrites of amacrine cells also significantly potentiated evoked currents and [Ca2+]i rises. However, strong postsynaptic Ca2+ buffering with BAPTA abolished the potentiation and selective antagonists of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors also blocked the potentiation of AMPA-mediated currents. Together these results suggest that Ca2+ influx via Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors can elicit a rapid form of postsynaptic plasticity in a subgroup of amacrine cell dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2265385781,"Research on role congruity theory and descriptive and prescriptive stereotypes has established that when men and women violate gender stereotypes by crossing spheres, with women pursuing career success and men contributing to domestic labor, they face backlash and economic penalties. Less is known, however, about the types of individuals who are most likely to engage in these forms of discrimination and the types of situations in which this is most likely to occur. We propose that psychological research will benefit from supplementing existing research approaches with an individual differences model of support for separate spheres for men and women. This model allows psychologists to examine individual differences in support for separate spheres as they interact with situational and contextual forces. The separate spheres ideology (SSI) has existed as a cultural idea for many years but has not been operationalized or modeled in social psychology. The Separate Spheres Model presents the SSI as a new psychological construct characterized by individual differences and a motivated system-justifying function, operationalizes the ideology with a new scale measure, and models the ideology as a predictor of some important gendered outcomes in society. As a first step toward developing the Separate Spheres Model, we develop a new measure of individuals’ endorsement of the SSI and demonstrate its reliability, convergent validity, and incremental predictive validity. We provide support for the novel hypotheses that the SSI predicts attitudes regarding workplace flexibility accommodations, income distribution within families between male and female partners, distribution of labor between work and family spheres, and discriminatory workplace behaviors. Finally, we provide experimental support for the hypothesis that the SSI is a motivated, system-justifying ideology."

This diversity is accompanied by extensive chromosome variation challenging attempts to reconstruct their ancestral genome. The species Hylaeamys megacephalus–HME (Oryzomyini, 2n = 54), Necromys lasiurus—NLA (Akodontini, 2n = 34) and Akodon sp.–ASP (Akodontini, 2n = 10) have extreme diploid numbers that make it difficult to understand the rearrangements that are responsible for such differences. In this study we analyzed these changes using whole chromosome probes of HME in cross-species painting of NLA and ASP to construct chromosome homology maps that reveal the rearrangements between species. We include data from the literature for other Sigmodontinae previously studied with probes from HME and Mus musculus (MMU) probes. We also use the HME probes on MMU chromosomes for the comparative analysis of NLA with other species already mapped by MMU probes. Our results show that NLA and ASP have highly rearranged karyotypes when compared to HME. Eleven HME syntenic blocks are shared among the species studied here. Four syntenies may be ancestral to Akodontini (HME2/18, 3/25, 18/25 and 4/11/16) and eight to Sigmodontinae (HME26, 1/12, 6/21, 7/9, 5/17, 11/16, 20/13 and 19/14/19). Using MMU data we identified six associations shared among rodents from seven subfamilies, where MMU3/18 and MMU8/13 are phylogenetic signatures of Sigmodontinae. We suggest that the associations MMU2entire, MMU6proximal/12entire, MMU3/18, MMU8/13, MMU1/17, MMU10/17, MMU12/17, MMU5/16, MMU5/6 and MMU7/19 are part of the ancestral Sigmodontinae genome."

We have reported that the expression of GPR3 in cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) contributes to neurite outgrowth and modulates neuronal proliferation and survival. To further identify its role, we have analyzed the precise distribution and local functions of GPR3 in neurons. The fluorescently tagged GPR3 protein was distributed in the plasma membrane, the Golgi body, and the endosomes. In addition, we have revealed that the plasma membrane expression of GPR3 functionally up-regulated the levels of PKA, as measured by a PKA FRET indicator. Next, we asked if the PKA activity was modulated by the expression of GPR3 in CGNs. PKA activity was highly modulated at the neurite tips compared to the soma. In addition, the PKA activity at the neurite tips was up-regulated when GPR3 was transfected into the cells. However, local PKA activity was decreased when endogenous GPR3 was suppressed by a GPR3 siRNA. Finally, we determined the local dynamics of GPR3 in CGNs using time-lapse analysis. Surprisingly, the fluorescent GPR3 puncta were transported along the neurite in both directions over time. In addition, the anterograde movements of the GPR3 puncta in the neurite were significantly inhibited by actin or microtubule polymerization inhibitors and were also disturbed by the Myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. Moreover, the PKA activity at the tips of the neurites was decreased when blebbistatin was administered. These results suggested that GPR3 was transported along the neurite and contributed to the local activation of PKA in CGN development. The local dynamics of GPR3 in CGNs may affect local neuronal functions, including neuronal differentiation and maturation."

NPC1L1 mRNA expression was also measured in liver biopsies from patients with cholesterol gallstone disease and compared between genotypes. The G allele of the g1679C>G (rs2072183) polymorphism was significantly more prevalent in patients with gallstones compared with gallstone-free subjects. Moreover, patients carrying the G allele had lower hepatic NPC1L1 mRNA expression and higher biliary cholesterol (molar percentages) and cholesterol saturation index.

Entecavir, a deoxyguanosine analog, is one of the most widely used oral antiviral NAs against hepatitis B virus. It has reported that entecavir gave positive responses in both genotoxicity and carcinogenicity assays. However the genotoxic mechanism of entecavir remains elusive. To evaluate the genotoxic mechanisms, we analyzed the effect of entecavir on a panel of chicken DT40 B-lymphocyte isogenic mutant cell line deficient in DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways. Our results showed that Parp1-/- mutant cells defective in single-strand break (SSB) repair were the most sensitive to entecavir. Brca1-/-, Ubc13-/- and translesion-DNA-synthesis deficient cells including Rad18-/- and Rev3-/- were hypersensitive to entecavir. XPA-/- mutant deficient in nucleotide excision repair was also slightly sensitive to entecavir. γ-H2AX foci forming assay confirmed the existence of DNA damage by entecavir in Parp1-/-, Rad18-/- and Brca1-/- mutants. Karyotype assay further showed entecavir-induced chromosomal aberrations, especially the chromosome gaps in Parp1-/-, Brca1-/-, Rad18-/- and Rev3-/- cells when compared with wild-type cells. These genetic comprehensive studies clearly identified the genotoxic potentials of entecavir and suggested that SSB and postreplication repair pathways may suppress entecavir-induced genotoxicity."

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is highly expressed in leukaemia cells from the majority of paediatric patients with B-lineage ALL (pre-B ALL). CTGF is a matricellular protein and plays a role in aggressive cancers. Here we have genetically engineered leukaemia cells to modulate CTGF expression levels. Elevated CTGF levels accelerated disease dissemination and reduced survival in NOD/SCID mice. In vitro studies showed that CTGF protein induces stromal cell proliferation, promotes adhesion of leukaemia cells to stromal cells and leads to overexpression of genes associated with cell cycle and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM). Corresponding data from our leukaemia xenograft models demonstrated that CTGF leads to increased proliferation of non-leukaemia cells and deposition of ECM in the bone marrow. We document for the first time a functional role of CTGF in altering disease progression in a lymphoid malignancy.

The function of Hox genes in the axis patterning process is particularly well documented for bone development in the vertebral column and the limbs. We here show that Hoxb6, in skeletal elements at the cervico-thoracic junction, controls multiple independent aspects of skeletal pattern, implicating discrete developmental pathways as substrates for this transcription factor. In addition, we demonstrate that Hoxb6 function is subject to modulation by genetic factors. These results establish Hox-controlled skeletal pattern as a quantitative trait modulated by gene-gene interactions, and provide evidence that distinct modifiers influence the function of conserved developmental genes in fundamental patterning processes."
https://openalex.org/W2273976658,"Background Regulatory and biophysical mechanisms of cell-cell fusion are largely unknown despite the fundamental requirement for fused cells in eukaryotic development. Only two cellular fusogens that are not of clear recent viral origin have been identified to date, both in nematodes. One of these, EFF-1, is necessary for most cell fusions in Caenorhabditis elegans. Unregulated EFF-1 expression causes lethality due to ectopic fusion between cells not developmentally programmed to fuse, highlighting the necessity of tight fusogen regulation for proper development. Identifying factors that regulate EFF-1 and its paralog AFF-1 could lead to discovery of molecular mechanisms that control cell fusion upstream of the action of a membrane fusogen. Bioinformatic analysis of the EFF-1A isoform’s predicted cytoplasmic domain (endodomain) previously revealed two motifs that have high probabilities of interacting with 14-3-3 proteins when phosphorylated. Mutation of predicted phosphorylation sites within these motifs caused measurable loss of eff-1 gene function in cell fusion in vivo. Moreover, a human 14-3-3 isoform bound to EFF-1::GFP in vitro. We hypothesized that the two 14-3-3 proteins in C. elegans, PAR-5 and FTT-2, may regulate either localization or fusion-inducing activity of EFF-1. Methodology/Principal Findings Timing of fusion events was slightly but significantly delayed in animals unable to produce full-length EFF-1A. Yet, mutagenesis and live imaging showed that phosphoserines in putative 14-3-3 binding sites are not essential for EFF-1::GFP accumulation at the membrane contact between fusion partner cells. Moreover, although the EFF-1A endodomain was required for normal rates of eff-1-dependent epidermal cell fusions, reduced levels of FTT-2 and PAR-5 did not visibly affect the function of wild-type EFF-1 in the hypodermis. Conclusions/Significance Deletion of the EFF-1A endodomain noticeably affects the timing of hypodermal cell fusions in vivo. However, prohibiting phosphorylation of candidate 14-3-3-binding sites does not impact localization of the fusogen. Hypodermal membrane fusion activity persists when 14-3-3 expression levels are reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2418779518,"Iron is an essential element needed by all organisms for growth and development. Because iron becomes toxic at higher concentrations iron is under homeostatic control. Plants face also the problem that iron in the soil is tightly bound to oxygen and difficult to access. Plants have therefore developed special mechanisms for iron uptake and regulation. During the last years key components of plant iron regulation have been identified. How these components integrate and maintain robust iron homeostasis is presently not well understood. Here we use a computational approach to identify mechanisms for robust iron homeostasis in non-graminaceous plants. In comparison with experimental results certain control arrangements can be eliminated, among them that iron homeostasis is solely based on an iron-dependent degradation of the transporter IRT1. Recent IRT1 overexpression experiments suggested that IRT1-degradation is iron-independent. This suggestion appears to be misleading. We show that iron signaling pathways under IRT1 overexpression conditions become saturated, leading to a breakdown in iron regulation and to the observed iron-independent degradation of IRT1. A model, which complies with experimental data places the regulation of cytosolic iron at the transcript level of the transcription factor FIT. Including the experimental observation that FIT induces inhibition of IRT1 turnover we found a significant improvement in the system's response time, suggesting a functional role for the FIT-mediated inhibition of IRT1 degradation. By combining iron uptake with storage and remobilization mechanisms a model is obtained which in a concerted manner integrates iron uptake, storage and remobilization. In agreement with experiments the model does not store iron during its high-affinity uptake. As an iron biofortification approach we discuss the possibility how iron can be accumulated even during high-affinity uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2259530289,"A large local health department in Colorado partnered with 15 school districts to develop an approach to evaluate changes in access to healthy foods in reimbursable school lunches and a la carte offerings.School district nutrition managers were engaged at the start of this project. Health department dietitians developed criteria to classify food items as ""Lower Fat and less added Sugar"" (LFS) and ""Higher Fat and more added Sugar"" (HFS) based on the percentage of calories from fat and grams of added sugar. Lunch production sheets were obtained for two time periods, food items and the number of planned servings recorded. LFS and HFS planned servings were summed for each time period, and a LFS to HFS ratio calculated by dividing LFS planned servings by HFS planned servings. Additional analyses included calculating LFS: HFS ratios by school district, and for a la carte offerings.In 2009, the LFS: HFS ratio was 2.08, in 2011, 3.71 (P<0.0001). The method also detected changes in ratios at the school district level. For a la carte items, in 2009 the ratio of LFS: HFS was 0.53, and in 2011, 0.61 (not statistically significant).This method detected an increase in the LFS: HFS ratio over time and demonstrated that the school districts improved access to healthful food/drink by changing the contents of reimbursable school lunches. The evaluation method discussed here can generate information that districts can use in helping sustain and expand their efforts to create healthier environments for children and adults. Although federal regulations now cover all food and beverages served during the school day, there are still opportunities to improve and measure changes in food served in other settings such as child care centers, youth correction facilities, or in schools not participating in the National School Lunch Program."
https://openalex.org/W2286208801,"Effective and efficient spatial normalization of a large population of brain images is critical for many clinical and research studies, but it is technically very challenging. A commonly used approach is to choose a certain image as the template and then align all other images in the population to this template by applying pairwise registration. To avoid the potential bias induced by the inappropriate template selection, groupwise registration methods have been proposed to simultaneously register all images to a latent common space. However, current groupwise registration methods do not make full use of image distribution information for more accurate registration. In this paper, we present a novel groupwise registration method that harnesses the image distribution information by capturing the image distribution manifold using a hierarchical graph with its nodes representing the individual images. More specifically, a low-level graph describes the image distribution in each subgroup, and a high-level graph encodes the relationship between representative images of subgroups. Given the graph representation, we can register all images to the common space by dynamically shrinking the graph on the image manifold. The topology of the entire image distribution is always maintained during graph shrinkage. Evaluations on two datasets, one for 80 elderly individuals and one for 285 infants, indicate that our method can yield promising results."
https://openalex.org/W2414528959,"To test the validity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of tissue injury by examining such measures in a white matter structure with well-defined function, the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). Injury to the MLF underlies internuclear ophthalmoparesis (INO).40 MS patients with chronic INO and 15 healthy controls were examined under an IRB-approved protocol. Tissue integrity of the MLF was characterized by DTI parameters: longitudinal diffusivity (LD), transverse diffusivity (TD), mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). Severity of INO was quantified by infrared oculography to measure versional disconjugacy index (VDI).LD was significantly lower in patients than in controls in the medulla-pons region of the MLF (p < 0.03). FA was also lower in patients in the same region (p < 0.0004). LD of the medulla-pons region correlated with VDI (R = -0.28, p < 0.05) as did FA in the midbrain section (R = 0.31, p < 0.02).This study demonstrates that DTI measures of brain tissue injury can detect injury to a functionally relevant white matter pathway, and that such measures correlate with clinically accepted evaluation indices for INO. The results validate DTI as a useful imaging measure of tissue integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2265423636,"The bulk of models used to understand the species diversification on Madagascar have been constructed using vertebrate taxa. It is not clear how these models affect less vagile species that may interact at a variety of spatial scales. Several studies on vertebrates have divided Madagascar into east-west bioclimatic regions, suggesting there is a fundamental division between eastern wet-adapted and western dry-adapted taxa. An alternative model of ecogeographic constraints shows a north-south division. We test whether the diversification in a small arthropod with variable degrees of dispersal conform to either model of ecogeographic constraints proposed for vertebrate taxa. We employ a molecular taxonomic dataset using ~2 kilobases nuDNA (Wg, LW Rh, Abd-A, 28s) and 790 basepairs mtDNA (CO1), along with geographic and habitat data, to examine the diversification patterns of the ant genus Mystrium Roger, 1862, (Subfamily Amblyoponinae) from Madagascar. The nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies were both congruent with morphospecies as indicated in a recent revision of the genus. Species of Mystrium practice different colony reproductive strategies (winged queens vs non-winged queens). Alternate reproductive strategies led to inequalities in female dispersal ability among species, providing an additional layer for examination of the impacts of vagility on divergence, especially when measured using a maternally inherited locus. Mystrium species distribution patterns support these models of ecogeographic constraints. Reproductive strategy effected how Mystrium mtDNA lineages were associated with large-scale habitat distinctions and various topographical features. Furthermore, in some cases we find microgeographic population structure which appears to have been impacted by localized habitat differences (tsingy limestone formations, littoral forest) on a scale much smaller than that found in vertebrates. The current system offers a finer scale look at species diversification on the island, and helps achieve a more universal understanding of the generation of biodiversity on Madagascar."
