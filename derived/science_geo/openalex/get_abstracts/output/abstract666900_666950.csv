However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we identified a hypoxia-induced long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) KB-1980E6.3, which is aberrantly upregulated in clinical breast cancer tissues and closely correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. The enhanced lncRNA KB-1980E6.3 facilitates breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) self-renewal and tumorigenesis under hypoxic microenvironment both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lncRNA KB-1980E6.3 recruited insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) to form a lncRNA KB-1980E6.3/IGF2BP1/c-Myc signaling axis that retained the stability of c-Myc mRNA through increasing binding of IGF2BP1 with m6A-modified c-Myc coding region instability determinant (CRD) mRNA. In conclusion, we confirm that lncRNA KB-1980E6.3 maintains the stemness of BCSCs through lncRNA KB-1980E6.3/IGF2BP1/c-Myc axis and suggest that disrupting this axis might provide a new therapeutic target for refractory hypoxic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3122978181,"Online citizen science projects have broadened options for accessing science and enabled different forms of participation in scientific research for adult and young volunteers. Yet, little is known regarding participation patterns among youth participants. Quantitative approaches were used to investigate the contribution of 183 young volunteers to citizen science on the iNaturalist platform and the participation behaviour that relates to their contribution. The participants accessed and used iNaturalist as part of one-day field-based events (bioblitzes) facilitated by museums. Compared to the observation behaviour of all iNaturalist users, as documented on the platform, the young volunteers observe fewer plants and birds, and more molluscs, arachnids and insects. The average daily contributions of young volunteers were found to be positively associated with a large proportion of active days on iNaturalist and a systematic contribution behaviour, yet negatively related to a long duration on the platform. This study enhances our understanding of young volunteers’ contributions to citizen science and provides insights for research on participation in online citizen science. Our findings have implications on how museums design the field-based events to encourage follow-up systematic participation and maintain active contribution."
https://openalex.org/W3125823132,"Sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] seed germination is sensitive to salinity, and seed priming is an effective method for alleviating the negative effects of salt stress on seed germination. However, few studies have compared the effects of different priming agents on sorghum germination under salt stress. In this study, we quantified the effects of priming with distilled water (HP), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on sorghum seed germination under 150 mM NaCl stress. The germination potential, germination rate, germination index, vigor index, root length, shoot length, root fresh weight, shoot fresh weight, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight were significantly reduced by salt stress. Different priming treatments alleviated the germination inhibition caused by salt stress to varying degrees, and 50 mM CaCl 2 was the most effective treatment. In addition, the mitigation effect of priming was stronger on root traits than on shoot traits. Mitigation efficacy was closely related to both the type of agent and the concentration of the solution. Principal component analysis showed that all concentrations of CaCl 2 had higher scores and were clearly distinguished from other treatments based on their positive effects on all germination traits. The effects of the other agents varied with concentration. The priming treatments were divided into three categories based on their priming efficacy, and the 50, 100, and 150 mM CaCl 2 treatments were placed in the first category. The 150 mM KCl, 10% PEG, HP, 150 mM NaCl, 30% PEG, and 50 mM KCl treatments were placed in the second category, and the 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 20% PEG, and 50 mM NaCl treatments were least effective and were placed in the third category. Choosing appropriate priming agents and methods for future research and applications can ensure that crop seeds germinate healthily under saline conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3123611856,"Chopping tools/choppers provide one of the earliest and most persistent examples of stone tools produced and used by early humans. These artifacts appeared for the first time ~2.5 million years ago in Africa and are characteristic of the Oldowan and Acheulean cultural complexes throughout the Old World. Chopping tools were manufactured and used by early humans for more than two million years regardless of differences in geography, climate, resource availability, or major transformations in human cultural and biological evolution. Despite their widespread distribution through time and space in Africa and Eurasia, little attention has been paid to the function of these items, while scholars still debate whether they are tools or cores. In this paper, we wish to draw attention to these prominent and ubiquitous early lithic artifacts through the investigation of 53 chopping tools retrieved from a specific context at Late Acheulean Revadim (Israel). We combined typo-technological and functional studies with a residue analysis aimed at shedding light on their functional role within the tool-kits of the inhabitants of the site. Here we show that most of the chopping tools were used to chop hard and medium materials, such as bone, most probably for marrow extraction. A few of the tools were also used for cutting and scraping activities, while some also served as cores for further flake detachment. The chopping tools exhibit extraordinarily well-preserved bone residues suggesting they were used mainly for bone-breaking and marrow acquisition. We discuss the data and explore the tool versus core debate also in light of a sample of 50 flake cores made on pebbles/cobbles retrieved from the same archeological layer. The results add further pieces to the puzzle of activities carried out at Revadim and add to our knowledge of the production and use of these enigmatic tools and their role in human evolutionary history."

The study of lncRNA in lower invertebrates is still unclear compared with that in mammals. Here, we identified a novel lncRNA, termed IRAK4-related lncRNA (IRL), as a key regulator for innate immunity in teleost fish. We find that miR-27c-3p inhibits IRAK4 expression and thus weakens the NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway. Furthermore, the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio anguillarum and lipopolysaccharide significantly upregulated host lncRNA IRL expression. Results indicate that IRL functions as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-27c-3p to regulate protein abundance of IRAK4; thus, invading microorganisms are eliminated and immune responses are promoted. Our study also demonstrates the regulation mechanism that lncRNA IRL can competitively adsorb miRNA to regulate the miR-27c-3p/IRAK4 axis that is widespread in teleost fish.

Innate immunity is the host's first line of defense against the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), as crucial receptor molecule in the innate immune signal transmission, play crucial roles in protecting the host from pathogen invasion. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-like receptors, and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors are the most important types of PRRs, and they play an irreplaceable role in helping the host identify and monitor various invasive microorganisms (1Kim T.W. Staschke K. Bulek K. Yao J. Peters K. Oh K.H. Vandenburg Y. Xiao H. Qian W. Hamilton T. A critical role for IRAK4 kinase activity in Toll-like receptor–mediated innate immunity.J. Exp.

TLRs, as one of the most extended receptors, play an irreplaceable role in recognizing and helping to eliminate the invasion of bacteria and viruses (3Takeda K. Akira S.

The inflammasome NLRs in immunity, inflammation, and associated diseases.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 707-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Moreover, nearly all TLRs (except TLR3) can activate transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3 in downstream signaling pathways through the interaction of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) with IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) (5Xiong Y. Medvedev A.E. Induction of endotoxin tolerance in vivo inhibits activation of IRAK4 and increases negative regulators IRAK-M, SHIP-1, and A20.J. Leukoc.

IRAK4 activity controls immune responses to intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2018; 104: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Ultimately, these transcription factors activate the host’s antibacterial and inflammatory responses. IRAK4, as a member of IRAKs, is a crucial serine/threonine kinase involved in the TLR/IL-1R stimulation transduction pathway (7Li X. IRAK4 in TLR/IL-1R signaling: Possible clinical applications.Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). IRAK4, as a central kinase in the TLR signaling pathway, can bind to MyD88 to form dimers that induce IRAK-1-related phosphorylation; these dimers are recruited into the TLR/IL-1R complex to mediate the NF-κB signaling pathway and induce inflammatory factors and chemokines to fight bacterial invasion (8Motshwene P.G.

The eradication of pathogenic infections requires timely and appropriate immune and inflammatory responses. However, excessive induction of inflammatory cytokines can lead to acute or chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have shown that IRAK4 is associated with some autoimmune diseases. Umar et al. (13Umar S. Palasiewicz K. Van Raemdonck K. Volin M.V. Romay B. Amin M.A. Zomorrodi R.K. Arami S. Gonzalez M. Rao V. IRAK4 inhibition: A promising strategy for treating RA joint inflammation and bone erosion.Cell. Mol.

Recent studies have also found that suppressed IRAK4 can inhibit plasmacytoid dendritic cells and natural killer cells from producing cytokines to treat systemic lupus erythematosus, which is an autoimmune disease that activates the circulating immune complexes and type I interferon and then produces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines; this phenomenon to autoimmune reactions and organ inflammations (14Hjorton K. Hagberg N. Israelsson E. Jinton L. Berggren O. Sandling J.K. Thörn K. Mo J. Eloranta M.-L. Rönnblom L. Cytokine production by activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and natural killer cells is suppressed by an IRAK4 inhibitor.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2018; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Studies show that IRAK4-deficient children are susceptible to life-threatening pyogenic infections; therefore, IRAK4 is essential for the innate immune system (7Li X. IRAK4 in TLR/IL-1R signaling: Possible clinical applications.Eur. J. Immunol. 2008; 38: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Hynes Jr., J. Nair S.K. Advances in the discovery of small-molecule IRAK4 inhibitors.Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 2014; 49: 117-133Google Scholar). Similar to the situation in mammals, our previous study suggested that IRAK4 is a key mediator involved in the host's innate immune response of the host in fish (16Xu T. Chu Q. Cui J. Zhao X. The inducible microRNA-203 in fish represses the inflammatory responses to Gram-negative bacteria by targeting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 1386-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). IRAK4 plays a key role in inflammatory cytokine induction and innate immune response. Thus, further exploration of the regulatory mechanism of IRAK4-mediated signal transduction is urgently needed. Noncoding RNA (ncRNA) is defined as a collection of RNAs that do not have the potential to encode proteins (17Hu G. Cabrera A. Kono M. Mok S. Chaal B.K. Haase S. Engelberg K. Cheemadan S. Spielmann T. Preiser P.R. Transcriptional profiling of growth perturbations of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs are the three types of noncoding RNAs that have been studied comprehensively in mammals (18Paraskevopoulou M.D. Hatzigeorgiou A.G. Analyzing miRNA–lncRNA interactions.Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1402: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 19Cuperus J.T. Fahlgren N. Carrington J.C. Evolution and functional diversification of MIRNA genes.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 20Patop I.L. Wüst S. Kadener S. Past, present, and future of circRNAs.Embo J. 2019; 38e100836Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). LncRNAs were first discovered in large-scale sequencing of mouse full-length enriched cDNA library (21Struhl K. Transcriptional noise and the fidelity of initiation by RNA polymerase II.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Considering their unexpected abundance, lncRNAs were originally thought to be pseudotranscriptional noise caused by low RNA polymerase fidelity considering their unexpected abundance (22Okazaki Y. Furuno M. Kasukawa T. Adachi J. Bono H. Kondo S. Nikaido I. Osato N. Saito R. Suzuki H. Analysis of the mouse transcriptome based on functional annotation of 60,770 full-length cDNAs.Nature. 2002; 420: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). However, increasing evidence has shown that lncRNAs can play a critical regulator involved in higher-order chromosome dynamics, telomere biology, and subcellular structure organization (23Amaral P.P. Mattick J.S. Noncoding RNA in development.Mamm. Genome. 2008; 19: 454-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that lncRNAs regulate targets via different mechanistic models. Some lncRNAs directly interact with heteronuclear ribonucleo proteins or chromatin modification complexes, whereas some lncRNAs function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and cross talk with mRNAs by competing for shared miRNAs (24Rinn J.L. Chang H.Y. Genome regulation by long noncoding RNAs.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 25Batista P.J. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNAs: Cellular address codes in development and disease.Cell. 2013; 152: 1298-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 26Guttman M. Rinn J.L. Modular regulatory principles of large non-coding RNAs.Nature. 2012; 482: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). ceRNA regulatory networks have been widely investigated in mammals, such as humans and mice, to date. Although considerable literature has proposed that an increasing number of lncRNAs have been annotated in vertebrates, the question of whether the ceRNA regulatory networks are widespread in all vertebrates is of particular interest for researchers. miRNAs are a class of highly conserved ncRNAs with a length of only 21 to 24 nucleotides (27Slezak-Prochazka I. Durmus S. Kroesen B.-J. van den Berg A. MicroRNAs, macrocontrol: Regulation of miRNA processing.RNA. 2010; 16: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The in-depth study of miRNA in recent decades has shown that miRNA has an irreplaceable important role in organisms, from lower vertebrates to mammals. Studies have shown that miRNA can participate in various physiological and pathological development processes, such as regulating cell proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (28Hatfield S. Shcherbata H. Fischer K. Nakahara K. Carthew R. Ruohola-Baker H. Stem cell division is regulated by the microRNA pathway.Nature. 2005; 435: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). miRNAs repress gene expression through binding to the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNAs by inhibiting mRNA translation or promoting mRNA degradation. In addition, recent studies show that miRNAs have many other regulatory mechanisms, such as the more popular ceRNA network mechanism. In this mechanism, there are many miRNA response elements on lncRNA molecules, so it can be used as a molecular sponge to competitively bind miRNA to regulate mRNA (29Zhou M. Wang X. Shi H. Cheng L. Wang Z. Zhao H. Yang L. Sun J. Characterization of long non-coding RNA-associated ceRNA network to reveal potential prognostic lncRNA biomarkers in human ovarian cancer.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This ceRNA mechanism was first discovered in Arabidopsis by Franco-Zorrilla et al (30Franco-Zorrilla J.M. Valli A. Todesco M. Mateos I. Puga M.I. Rubio-Somoza I. Leyva A. Weigel D. García J.A. Paz-Ares J. Target mimicry provides a new mechanism for regulation of microRNA activity.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). They found that lncRNA IPS1 can regulate the expression of PHO2 gene by competitively sponging miR-399. Subsequently, increasing evidence has shown that the ceRNA mechanism of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA exists both in plants and mammals (31Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P. A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology.Nature. 2010; 465: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). However, the lncRNA-miRNA regulatory mechanism has been limited to be found in plants and mammals, and little is known whether the mechanism exists in lower vertebrates, such as fish. In this study, we first identified a ceRNA regulatory loop involved in IRAK4-mediated NF-κB signaling in teleost fish. Our results suggested that the miR-27c-3p can regulate IRAK4 expression and suppress the IRAK4-mediated immune response. We demonstrated that a lncRNA, named IRL, can act as a ceRNA for miR-27c-3p to facilitate IRAK4 expression; as a result, immune responses are modulated. Our research not only contributes to the understanding of the ceRNA network mechanism in teleost fish but also provides a reference for the importance of lncRNA in the innate immune response in lower vertebrates. Miiuy croaker, Miichthys miiuy (∼50 g) was obtained from Zhoushan Fisheries Research Institute, Zhejiang Province, China. Fish were acclimated in aerated seawater tanks at 25 °C for 6 weeks before experiments. The bacterial challenge was performed as described (32Chu Q. Sun Y. Cui J. Xu T. MicroRNA-3570 modulates the NF-κB pathway in teleost fish by targeting MyD88.J. Immunol. 2017; 198: 3274-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, fish was challenged with 0.2 ml of Vibrio anguillarum (1.5 × 108 cfu/ml) or 0.2 ml suspension of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg/ml) intraperitoneally. As comparison, 0.2 ml of physiological saline was used to challenge the individuals. Afterward, fish were respectively sacrificed at different time points and the spleen samples were collected for RNA extraction. All animal experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the experimental protocols were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ocean University (No. SHOU-DW-2018-047). M. miiuy intestine cells (MICs) and M. miiuy kidney cells were cultured in L-15 medium (HyClone) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 26 °C. Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells were maintained in medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 26 °C in 5% CO2. For stimulation experiments, MICs were challenged with an LPS concentration of 10 μg/ml and harvested at different times for RNA extraction (33Zhang L. Chu Q. Chang R. Xu T. Inducible MicroRNA-217 inhibits NF-κB–and IRF3-driven immune responses in lower vertebrates through targeting TAK1.J. Immunol. 2020; 205: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To construct IRL and IRAK4 3’UTR luciferase genes, the sequences of IRL and IRAK4 3’UTR in M. miiuy, Nibea diacanthus, and Larimichthys crocea were cloned into pmirGLO luciferase reporter vector, respectively. The mutated forms with point mutations in the miR-27c-3p-binding site were synthesized using Mut Express II Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2 with specific primers (Table S1). Meanwhile, the sequences of IRL were inserted into the mVenus-C1 vector (Invitrogen), which included the sequence of enhanced GFP. Also, IRL and IRAK4 expression plasmids were constructed by cloning the IRL and IRAK4 sequence region of M. miiuy, N. diacanthus, and L. crocea into the pcDNA3.1 vector, respectively. To build pcDNA3.1-MS2, the MS2-12X fragment was inserted into the BamH I and EcoR V restriction sites of pcDNA3.1 vector, and then the IRL was amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1-MS2. The mutated forms with point mutations in the miR-27c-3p-binding site were synthesized using Mut Express II Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2 with specific primers (Table S1). An miR-27c-3p sensor was created by inserting two consecutive miR-27c-3p complementary sequences into the psiCHECK vector (Promega). The correct construction of the plasmids was verified by Sanger sequencing and extracted through EndoFree Plasmid DNA Miniprep Kit (Tiangen). Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. The miR-27c-3p mimics are synthetic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) with stimulating naturally occurring mature miRNAs. The miR-27c-3p mimics sequences were 5’-UUCACAGUGGUUAAGUUCUGC-3’ (sense) and 5’-AGAACUUAACCACUGUGAAUU-3’ (antisense). The negative control RNA sequences were 5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’ (sense) and 5’-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3’ (antisense). miRNA inhibitors are synthetic single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) that sequester intracellular miRNAs and block their activity in the RNA interfering pathway. The miR-27c-3p inhibitor sequence was 5’-GCAGAACUUAACCACUGUGAA-3’. The negative control inhibitor sequence was 5’-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3’. The RNA interference for IRL are as follows: the si-IRL-1 sequence was 5’-ACGUCAUCACUGUCACAUCTT-3’; the si-IRL-2 sequence was 5’- CGAUCAGGUUAAUCUUCUATT-3; the negative control RNA sequences were 5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’ (sense) and 5’-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3’ (antisense). The RNA interference for IRAK4 is as follows: the si-IRAK4 sequences were 5’-GCAUCAUGUGAGGAGGUUUTT-3’ (sense) and 5’-AAACCUCCUCACAUGAUGCTT-3’ (antisense). The scrambled control RNA sequences were 5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’ (sense) and 5’-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3’ (antisense). Both nuclear RNA and cytoplasmic RNA were extracted from MICs using the Cytoplasmic & Nuclear RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptional RNA using FastQuant RT Kit (Tiangen), which includes DNase treatment of RNA to eliminate genomic contamination. The nuclear and cytosolic fractions were separated using the Cytoplasmic & Nuclear RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression was measured by using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara). The small RNA was extracted by using miRcute miRNA Isolation Kit (Tiangen), and miRcute miRNA FirstStrand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Tiangen) was applied to reverse transcription of miRNAs. The expression analysis of miR-27c-3p was executed by using the miRcute miRNA qPCR Detection Kit (Tiangen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). GAPDH and 5.8S rRNA were used as negative controls to detect mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA expression, respectively (34Chu Q. Xu T. Zheng W. Chang R. Zhang L. Long noncoding RNA MARL regulates antiviral responses through suppression miR-122-dependent MAVS downregulation in lower vertebrates.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16e1008670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are displayed in Table S1. The IRL or IRAK4-3’UTR wildtype and the mutant devoid of the miR-27c-3p-binding site were cotransfected with miR-27c-3p mimics into EPC cells. At 24 h post transfection, reporter luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). To determine the functional regulation of IRL or IRAK4, MICs were cotransfected with IRAK4 expression plasmid or IRL expression plasmid, together with NF-κB, IL-8, and IL-1β luciferase reporter gene plasmids (34Chu Q. Xu T. Zheng W. Chang R. Zhang L. Long noncoding RNA MARL regulates antiviral responses through suppression miR-122-dependent MAVS downregulation in lower vertebrates.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16e1008670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), phRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid, either miR-27c-3p mimics or negative controls. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were lysed for reporter activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The miR-27c-3p sensor was cotransfected with miR-27c-3p mimics or IRL expression plasmid into MICs. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were lysed for reporter activity. All the luciferase activity values were achieved against the Renilla luciferase control. The transfection of each construct was performed in triplicate in each assay. Ratios of Renilla luciferase readings to firefly luciferase readings were taken for each experiment, and triplicates were averaged. Cells were lysed and collected in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The protein content in the collected cell lysates was measured with the bicinchoninic acid protein detection kit (Vazyme), then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) gel and transferred to PVDF (Millipore) membranes by semidry blotting (Bio-Rad Trans Blot Turbo System). The membrane is sealed with 5% bovine serum albumin. Protein was detected with different antibodies. The antibody against IRAK4 was diluted at 1:1000 (Genscript); anti-FLAG, anti-GFP, and anti-Tubulin monoclonal antibodies were diluted at 1: 2000 (Beyotime); and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Abbkine) were diluted at 1: 5000. The results were representative of three independent experiments. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by using WesternBright ECL (Advansta). The digital imaging was performed with a cold CCD camera. IRL and IRL-mut with miR-27c-3p-binding sites mutated were transcribed in vitro. The two transcripts were biotin labeled with the T7 RNA polymerase and Biotin RNA Labeling Mix (Roche), treated with RNase-free DNase I, and purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The whole-cell lysates from MICs (∼1.0 × 107) were incubated with purified biotinylated transcripts for 1 h at 25 °C. The complexes were isolated by streptavidin agarose beads (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted from the remaining beads, and qPCR was used to evaluate the expression levels of miRNAs. The specific protocol of pull-down assay was as described (35Xu T. Chu Q. Cui J. Rhabdovirus-Inducible MicroRNA-210 modulates antiviral innate immune response via targeting STING/MITA in fish.J. Immunol. 2018; 201: 982-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To explore whether IRL is involved in the ceRNA regulation process, MICs (∼2.0 × 107) were cotransfection with pcDNA3.1-FLAG, pcDNA3.1-AGO2-FLAG, or miR-27c-3p for RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. To prove that IRL has the ability to directly bind to miR-217, MICs (∼2.0 × 107) were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-MS2, pcDNA3.1-MS2-IRL, pcDNA3.1-MS2-IRL-mut, pcDNA3.1-MS2-IRAK4-3’UTR, or pMS2-GFP for RIP assays. In short, MICs were harvested after 48 h transfection and RIP assays were carried out with Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore) and anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was extracted from the beads, and the expression level of miRNA was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was measured 48 h after transfection in LPS-treated MIC with Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability assays (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At the same time, cell proliferation was measured with BeyoClick EdU cell Proliferation Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Beyotime). All the experiments were performed in triplicate. The apoptotic assay was conducted using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime) and analyzed with flow cytometry (Beckman). The ratio of early and late apoptotic cells was detected to calculate the apoptotic rate (36Jing Z.-T. Liu W. Wu S.-X. He Y. Lin Y.-T. Chen W.-N. Lin X.-J. Lin X. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen enhances the sensitivity of hepatocytes to Fas-mediated apoptosis via suppression of AKT phosphorylation.J. Immunol. 2018; 201: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± SD from at least three independent triplicated experiments. Student’s t test was used to evaluate the data. The relative gene expression data were acquired using the 2 ΔΔCT method, and comparisons between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan’s multiple comparison tests (37Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2− ΔΔCT method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (103415) Google Scholar). The value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. We treated miiuy croaker with V. anguillarum to identify whether lncRNAs are potentially involved in the regulation of bacterial infection, and then, the expression of lncRNAs in the spleen tissues of the treated group and the untreated group was analyzed by RNA-Seq data. The circus plot displayed the distribution and expression of detected and significantly expressed lncRNAs on miiuy croaker chromosomes (Fig. 1A). IRL that is one of the significantly different upregulated lncRNAs has attracted our attention. The single-molecule full-length transcript sequencing was used to characterize the complete sequence of IR. The results demonstrate that the length of IRL is 1891 base pairs (bp) and IRL locates on miiuy croaker, N. diacanthus, and L. crocea chromosome 23, between gene tha1 and gene socs3b, and consists of only one exon (Fig. 1B). Then, we detected the subcellular location of IRL and found that IRL is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Consistent with IRL being an ncRNA, there was no putative protein conserved in all species, and the CPC (coding potential calculator) computational algorithm predicts that IRL has a very low coding potential (Fig. 1D). We first detected the IRL expression in the spleen under different V. anguillarum or LPS stimulation times to verify the results of RNA-Seq. As shown in Figure 2A, we found that the expression of IRL is significantly upregulated after V. anguillarum or LPS stimulation. Two small interfering RNAs were designed against IRL (si-IRL-1 and si-IRL-2) and the overexpression plasmid of IRL was constructed to explore the biological functions of IRL. As expected, both siRNAs can inhibit the expression of IRL and si-IRL-1 can induce higher inhibitory efficiency (Fig. 2B). The IRL overexpression plasmid could significantly increase IRL expression levels (Fig. 2D). Inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the antibacterial immune response; we thus focused on investigating the function of IRL in regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines. As shown in Figure 2C, knockdown of IRL can significantly inhibit the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β upon LPS stimulation. On the contrary, overexpression of IRL increases these gene expression levels in MICs under LPS treatment (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, cell apoptosis analysis showed that IRL knockdown increased the proportion of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2F). We conducted EdU assays and ATP activity assay to examine cell proliferation and cell viability for further exploring the role of IRL in innate immunity. Furthermore, we tested the effects of si-IRL and IRL-overexpressed plasmid on MIC viability. The results showed that knockdown of IRL decreases the cell viability, whereas it greatly increased when IRL-overexpressed plasmid is transfected (Fig. 2G). As shown in Figure 2, H and I, the results showed that knockdown of IRL considerably decreased the percentage of EdU-positive cells and cell viability, whereas it greatly increased when IRL is overexpressed. These results suggested that IRL can promote the proliferation and viability in miiuy croaker cell lines. Of interest, our results are in perfect agreement with some reports that low concentrations of LPS can stimulate cell proliferation (38Fu T. Ji K. Jin L. Zhang J. Wu X. Ji X. Fan B. Jia Z. Wang A.

https://openalex.org/W3121433206,"Skeletal muscle gene expression is governed by the myogenic regulatory family (MRF) which includes MyoD (MYOD1) and myogenin (MYOG). MYOD1 and MYOG are known to regulate an overlapping set of muscle genes, but MYOD1 cannot compensate for the absence of MYOG in vivo . In vitro , late muscle genes have been shown to be bound by both factors, but require MYOG for activation. The molecular basis for this requirement was unclear. We show here that MYOG is required for the recruitment of TBP and RNAPII to muscle gene promoters, indicating that MYOG is essential in assembling the transcription machinery. Genes regulated by MYOD1 and MYOG include genes required for muscle fusion, myomake r and myomerger , and we show that myomaker is fully dependent on activation by MYOG. We also sought to determine the role of MYOD1 in MYOG dependent gene activation and unexpectedly found that MYOG is required to maintain Myod1 expression. However, we also found that exogenous MYOD1 was unable to compensate for the loss of Myog and activate muscle gene expression. Thus, our results show that MYOD1 and MYOG act in a feed forward loop to maintain each other’s expression and also show that it is MYOG, and not MYOD1, that is required to load TBP and activate gene expression on late muscle gene promoters bound by both factors."
https://openalex.org/W3099097710,"Although flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) are attractive biocatalysts, their practical applications are limited because of their low catalytic efficiency. Here, we investigated the reaction mechanisms and structures of tryptophan 6-halogenase (Thal) from Streptomyces albogriseolus using stopped-flow, rapid-quench flow, quantum/mechanics molecular mechanics calculations, crystallography, and detection of intermediate (hypohalous acid [HOX]) liberation. We found that the key flavin intermediate, C4a-hydroperoxyflavin (C4aOOH-FAD), formed by Thal and other FDHs (tryptophan 7-halogenase [PrnA] and tryptophan 5-halogenase [PyrH]), can react with I−, Br−, and Cl− but not F− to form C4a-hydroxyflavin and HOX. Our experiments revealed that I− reacts with C4aOOH-FAD the fastest with the lowest energy barrier and have shown for the first time that a significant amount of the HOX formed leaks out as free HOX. This leakage is probably a major cause of low product coupling ratios in all FDHs. Site-saturation mutagenesis of Lys79 showed that changing Lys79 to any other amino acid resulted in an inactive enzyme. However, the levels of liberated HOX of these variants are all similar, implying that Lys79 probably does not form a chloramine or bromamine intermediate as previously proposed. Computational calculations revealed that Lys79 has an abnormally lower pKa compared with other Lys residues, implying that the catalytic Lys may act as a proton donor in catalysis. Analysis of new X-ray structures of Thal also explains why premixing of FDHs with reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide generally results in abolishment of C4aOOH-FAD formation. These findings reveal the hidden factors restricting FDHs capability which should be useful for future development of FDHs applications.

However, by traditional chemical synthesis, halogenations are generally not environmentally friendly reactions because most of these reactions need to be carried out under harsh conditions and often involve the use of toxic reagents, catalysts, and solvents. Chemical halogenation reactions also lack regioselectivity, resulting in many by-products (10Alonso F. Beletskaya I.P. Yus M. Metal-mediated reductive hydrodehalogenation of organic halides.Chem.

The use of enzymes, i.e., halogenases, to catalyze halogenation is an attractive green chemistry method because the reactions can be done under mild conditions. Halogenases discovered to date can be classified into four groups: haloperoxidases, fluorinases, α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases, and flavin-dependent halogenases (FDHs) (14Latham J.

FDHs belong to the class of two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases which require a reductase component to generate reduced FAD (FADH−) for a halogenase (monooxygenase) component to catalyze halogenation (14Latham J.

Rev. 2017; 117: 5619-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) which showed that all FDHs have two separated binding sites. While the FAD binding site is well conserved among different FDHs, a significant difference lies in the substrate binding site which allows FDHs to utilize a broad range of substrates and catalyze halogenation at various positions (14Latham J.

In the first model, HOX is thought to react with Lys to form the chloramine intermediate which acts as a halogenating species (27Yeh E. Blasiak L.C. Koglin A. Drennan C.L. Walsh C.T. Chlorination by a long-lived intermediate in the mechanism of flavin-dependent halogenases.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas in the second model, HOX is thought to be a direct halogenation reagent with the conserved Lys facilitating and controlling the binding of HOX in the proper geometry necessary for halogenation (15Dong C. Flecks S. Unversucht S. Haupt C. van Pée K.-H. Naismith J.H.

None of the previous studies has also investigated the mechanism of HOX formation and determined the factors controlling HOX production. Most FDHs are inefficient because their turnovers are quite slow (kcat = 0.5–3 min−1), and they can be easily inactivated (26Andorfer M.C. Lewis J.C. Understanding and improving the activity of flavin-dependent halogenases via random and targeted mutagenesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 159-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite gram scale synthesis of halogenated tryptophan product was reported for the reaction of RebH, full conversion was obtained only after 8 days (33Frese M. Sewald N. Enzymatic halogenation of tryptophan on a gram scale.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2015; 54: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which is too slow to be accepted for a real industrial process. Therefore, kinetic and structural investigation to understand mechanistic features controlling their halogenation are necessary for future improvement of FDHs for industrial applications. Tryptophan 6-halogenase or Thal from Streptomyces albogriseolus (34Moritzer A.-C. Niemann H.H.

As Thal catalyzes tryptophan halogenation at the 6-position, not 7-position as in RebH or PrnA, the results would also contribute to the understanding of a mechanism related to halogenation of tryptophan at the 6-position. Recently, crystal structures of Thal were solved and the results showed that FAD and tryptophan substrates could not be co-crystallized (34Moritzer A.-C. Niemann H.H. Binding of FAD and tryptophan to the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal is negatively coupled.Protein Sci. 2019; 28: 2112-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This feature is different from other tryptophan halogenases such as RebH (36Bitto E. Huang Y. Bingman C.A. Singh S. Thorson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. The structure of flavin-dependent tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH.Proteins. 2008; 70: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), tryptophan 5-halogenase (PyrH) (37Zhu X. De Laurentis W. Leang K. Herrmann J. Ihlefeld K. van Pée K.-H. Naismith J.H. Structural insights into regioselectivity in the enzymatic chlorination of tryptophan.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and PrnA (15Dong C. Flecks S. Unversucht S. Haupt C. van Pée K.-H. Naismith J.H. Tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA) structure suggests a mechanism for regioselective chlorination.Science. 2005; 309: 2216-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) which could be co-crystallized with both FAD and tryptophan. This suggests that protein dynamics between the flavin and substrate binding sites of Thal are strongly linked. Therefore, we set out to investigate the mechanism of HOX formation and its role in regulating the Thal reaction and used Thal as a model for exploring the factors contributing to the catalytic inefficiency of FDHs in general. In this report, the reaction of Thal was investigated with regard to four main mechanistic issues to unravel why the reactions of FDHs are not very efficient. (A) The mechanism of HOX formation was investigated using transient kinetics (stopped-flow absorbance and fluorescence and rapid-quench flow techniques) in combination with quantum/mechanics molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computational calculations. (B) The cause of the low product coupling ratio was investigated by measuring the leakage of the HOX intermediate using an organic substrate (D-luciferin) as a halogenating target to detect free HOX. (C) The functional role of the conserved Lys was investigated using site-saturation mutagenesis studies along with detection of free HOX formation and theoretical pKa calculations. Unlike the mechanism previously proposed, our results do not support formation of chloramine or bromamine intermediates but rather suggest that the conserved Lys likely protonates the HOX in the halogenation reaction. (D) Results from transient kinetics, newly crystallized structures of Thal:FADH− and Thal:FAD:AMP and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could be used to explain the cause for formation of the dead-end inactive Thal:FADH-∗ complex. To explore whether Thal represents a halogenase which can catalyze a reasonable halogenation reaction, multiple turnover reactions of Thal were carried out and compared with the reactions of PrnA and PyrH. The products from the Thal reaction were characterized by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S2C). The results indicated that among the three halogenases investigated, Thal was the fastest halogenase (Fig. S2A). These data also clearly imply that most of the halogenases are not very efficient enzymes which agrees with previous data reporting that FDHs suffer from having low kcat values (26Andorfer M.C. Lewis J.C. Understanding and improving the activity of flavin-dependent halogenases via random and targeted mutagenesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 159-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the cause of catalytic inefficiency in Thal as a representative of FDHs would contribute to identification of the bottleneck in the reaction of FDHs in general. The percentage of product halogenation in the Thal reaction was measured from the consumption of the substrate (tryptophan) in single turnover reactions carried out in a rapid-quench flow instrument (Experimental Procedures). The reaction of Thal was carried out using FADH− as a limiting reagent (Fig. 1). After the first turnover was completed (data collected at 400 s), we found that only about 30% of the tryptophan was halogenated (data not shown). The results indicate that the coupling ratio (product produced per substrate consumed) is quite low, which is likely one of the factors explaining the catalytic inefficiency in Thal and in FDHs in general. Therefore, we further explored the fates of each reaction intermediate after C4aOOH-FAD is formed. A stopped-flow experiment was carried out under conditions in which C4aOOH-FAD was fully formed (details described in Figs. S5 and S6). In the absence of halide, mixing of an anaerobic solution of FADH− with an aerobic solution of Thal resulted in reactions with kinetic traces showing two phases (Fig. 2). The first phase (0.02–0.15 s) showed an increase in absorbance at 380 nm with almost no change at 450 nm. The second phase (0.15–100 s) showed a decrease in absorbance at 380 nm which was concomitant with an increase in absorbance at 450 nm. Kinetic traces of the first phase and second phase represent C4aOOH-FAD formation (kobs of 16.52 s−1) and decay (kobs of 0.41 s−1) to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and FAD, respectively (Fig. 2). The kinetics of C4aOOH-FAD formation in the presence of 10 mM Br− or Cl− (the condition in which HOBr or HOCl was formed maximally, as explained in detail in the next section) was the same as that in the absence of Br− or Cl− (Fig. 2), but the kinetics of the reaction after C4aOOH-FAD formation was different. The reaction in the presence of halide ions showed three phases. The first phase (0.02–0.15 s) showed an increase in absorbance at 380 nm. The second (0.15–2.5 s) and third phases (2.5–100 s) showed a decrease in absorbance at 380 nm and an increase in absorbance at 450 nm. The kinetics of the second phase of both reactions (kobs of 1.6 s−1) were similar to that in the absence of halide, indicating that this phase was the uncoupling path to elimination of H2O2 without forming HOBr or HOCl. As the amplitude of this phase (absorbance 450 nm) in the presence of Br− and Cl− was about 20% and 55%, respectively, the results indicate that the uncoupling path is more prominent in the presence of Cl− compared with Br− and that C4aOOH-FAD reacts more efficiently with Br− than Cl−. The kinetics of the third phase was clearly different from the reaction in the absence of the halide ions. This phase was later identified as the step of C4a-hydroxyflavin (C4aOH-FAD) decay after HOX formation (see the following results in the next section). These data indicate that even under saturating amounts of halide, the reaction of Thal still proceeds through an uncoupling path (no formation of HOX) with a frequency of about 20% and 55% in the case of Br− and Cl−, respectively. The data also indicate that 80% of the C4aOOH-FAD intermediate can react with Br− to form HOBr. However, our results in the first section (halogenation activity of Thal) indicate that only 30% of the tryptophans were brominated, implying that not all of the HOBr formed reacts with tryptophan. We therefore investigated the mechanisms of HOX formation by FDHs and examined their control of HOX reactivity. Because the reaction of halide ions with C4aOOH-FAD is crucial for the catalysis of FDHs and this reaction is not well understood, we investigated the reactivity of halide ions with Thal and other tryptophan halogenases (PrnA and PyrH) by monitoring the kinetics of its formation. To monitor the kinetics of HOX formation, we monitored the transitions from C4aOOH-FAD to C4aOH-FAD and HOX (Fig. 3). C4aOH-FAD is a common intermediate in the reactions of flavin-dependent monooxygenases (28Yeh E. Cole L.J. Barr E.W. Bollinger J.M. Ballou D.P. Walsh C.T.

Therefore, we carried out similar experiments as in the previous section but instead we measured the appearance of highly fluorescent species using excitation wavelengths (Ex) of 380 nm and 450 nm and monitoring emission wavelength at > 495 nm. Results in Figure 4 show a large increase in fluorescence during 0.15 to 2.5 s (corresponding to an observed rate constant of 1.5 s−1) in the presence of Cl− when using Ex at 380 nm (blue solid line). This fluorescent species decayed during 2.5 to 100 s (corresponding to an observed rate constant of 0.073 s−1). The data clearly indicate that the fluorescence decay occurred simultaneously with the third phase of Figure 2 in which the absorbance at 380 nm decreased and the absorbance at 450 nm increased. The data in Figures 2 and 4 indicate that in the presence of Cl− after C4aOOH-FAD was formed, and the next step was formation of a highly fluorescent C4aOH-FAD species which eventually eliminates H2O to form oxidized FAD (Fig. 3).

To investigate the role of citrullinated antigens in HLA-DR1- and DR4-restricted T cell responses, we utilized mouse models that express these MHC-II alleles to determine the relationship between citrullinated peptide affinity for these DR molecules and the ability of these peptides to induce a T cell response. Using a set of peptides from proteins thought to be targeted by the autoimmune T cell responses in RA, aggrecan, vimentin, fibrinogen, and type II collagen, we found that while citrullination can enhance the binding affinity for these DR alleles, it does not always do so, even when in the critical P4 position. Moreover, if peptide citrullination does enhance HLA-DR binding affinity, it does not necessarily predict the generation of a T cell response. Conversely, citrullinated peptides can stimulate T cells without changing the peptide binding affinity for HLA-DR1 or DR4. Furthermore, citrullination of an autoantigen, type II collagen, which enhances binding affinity to HLA-DR1 did not enhance the severity of autoimmune arthritis in HLA-DR1 transgenic mice. Additional analysis of clonal T cell populations stimulated by these peptides indicated cross recognition of citrullinated and wild type peptides can occur in some instances, while in others cases the citrullination generates a novel T cell epitope. Finally, cytokine profiles of the wild type and citrullinated peptide stimulated T cells unveiled a significant disconnect between proliferation and cytokine production. Altogether, these data demonstrate the lack of support for a simplified model with universal correlation between affinity for HLA-DR alleles, immunogenicity and arthritogenicity of citrullinated peptides. Additionally they highlight the complexity of both T cell receptor recognition of citrulline as well as its potential conformational effects on the peptide:HLA-DR complex as recognized by a self-reactive cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3123188017,"Purpose Daily time spent on one activity cannot change without compensatory changes in others, which themselves may impact on health outcomes. Optimal daily activity combinations may differ across outcomes. We estimated optimal daily activity durations for the highest fitness and lowest adiposity. Methods Cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint data (1182 11-12-year-olds; 51% boys) from the population-based Longitudinal Study of Australian Children were used. Daily activity composition (sleep, sedentary time, light physical activity [LPA], moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) was from 8-day, 24-hour accelerometry. We created composite outcomes for fitness (VO 2max ; standing long jump) and adiposity (waist-to-height ratio; body mass index; fat-to-fat-free log-ratio). Adjusted compositional models regressed activity log-ratios against each outcome. Best activity compositions ( optimal time-use zones ) were plotted in quaternary tetrahedrons; the overall optimal time-use composition was the center of the overlapping area. Results Time-use composition was associated with fitness and adiposity (all measures p&lt;0.001). Optimal time use differed for fitness and adiposity. While both maximized MVPA and minimized sedentary time, optimal fitness days had higher LPA (3.4 h) and shorter sleep (8.25 h), but optimal adiposity days had lower LPA (1.0 h) and longer sleep (10.9 h). Balancing both outcomes, the overall optimal time-use composition was (mean [range]): 10.2 [9.5; 10.5] h sleep, 9.9 [8.8; 11.2] h sedentary time, 2.4 [1.8; 3.2] h LPA and 1.5 [1.5; 1.5] h MVPA. Conclusion Optimal time use for children’s fitness and adiposity involves trade-offs. To best balance both outcomes, estimated activity durations for sleep and LPA align with, but for MVPA exceed, 24-h guidelines."

To understand the impact of COVID-19 on public health, many studies have been conducted for various countries. To complement the available work, in this article we examine Canadian COVID-19 data for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020 with the aim to forecast the dynamic trend in a short term. Method We focus our attention on Canadian data and analyze the four provinces, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, which have the most severe situations in Canada. To build predictive models and conduct prediction, we employ three models, smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models, neural network (NN) models, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, to fit time series data of confirmed cases in the four provinces separately. In comparison, we also analyze the data of daily infections in two states of USA, Texas and New York state, for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020. We emphasize that different models make different assumptions which are basically difficult to validate. Yet invoking different models allows us to examine the data from different angles, thus, helping reveal the underlying trajectory of the development of COVID-19 in Canada. Finding The examinations of the data dated from March 18, 2020 to August 11, 2020 show that the STAR, NN, and SIR models may output different results, though the differences are small in some cases. Prediction over a short term period incurs smaller prediction variability than over a long term period, as expected. The NN method tends to outperform other two methods. All the methods forecast an upward trend in all the four Canadian provinces for the period of August 12, 2020 to August 23, 2020, though the degree varies from method to method. This research offers model-based insights into the pandemic evolvement in Canada."

Several NUS are drought and heat stress-tolerant, making them ideal for improving marginalised cropping systems in drought-prone areas. However, owing to their status as NUS, current crop suitability maps do not include them as part of the crop choices. This study aimed to develop land suitability maps for selected NUS [sorghum, (Sorghum bicolor), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), amaranth and taro (Colocasia esculenta)] using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in ArcGIS. Multidisciplinary factors from climatic, soil and landscape, socio-economic and technical indicators overlaid using Weighted Overlay Analysis. Validation was done through field visits, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to measure AHP model performance. The results indicated that sorghum was highly suitable (S1) = 2%, moderately suitable (S2) = 61%, marginally suitable (S3) = 33%, and unsuitable (N1) = 4%, cowpea S1 = 3%, S2 = 56%, S3 = 39%, N1 = 2%, amaranth S1 = 8%, S2 = 81%, S3 = 11%, and taro S1 = 0.4%, S2 = 28%, S3 = 64%, N1 = 7%, of calculated arable land of SA (12 655 859 ha). Overall, the validation showed that the mapping exercises exhibited a high degree of accuracies (i.e. sorghum AUC = 0.87, cowpea AUC = 0.88, amaranth AUC = 0.95 and taro AUC = 0.82). Rainfall was the most critical variable and criteria with the highest impact on land suitability of the NUS. Results of this study suggest that South Africa has a huge potential for NUS production. The maps developed can contribute to evidence-based and site-specific recommendations for NUS and their mainstreaming. Also, the maps can be used to design appropriate production guidelines and to support existing policy frameworks which advocate for sustainable intensification of marginalised cropping systems through increased crop diversity and the use of stress-tolerant food crops."
https://openalex.org/W3122482253,"3,4-Diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) increases transmitter release from neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and low doses of 3,4-DAP (estimated to reach ∼1 μM in serum) are the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for neuromuscular weakness caused by Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Canonically, 3,4-DAP is thought to block voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, resulting in prolongation of the presynaptic action potential (AP). However, recent reports have shown that low millimolar concentrations of 3,4-DAP have an off-target agonist effect on the Cav1 subtype (""L-type"") of voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels and have speculated that this agonist effect might contribute to 3,4-DAP effects on transmitter release at the NMJ. To address 3,4-DAP's mechanism(s) of action, we first used the patch-clamp electrophysiology to characterize the concentration-dependent block of 3,4-DAP on the predominant presynaptic Kv channel subtypes found at the mammalian NMJ (Kv3.3 and Kv3.4). We identified a previously unreported high-affinity (1-10 μM) partial antagonist effect of 3,4-DAP in addition to the well-known low-affinity (0.1-1 mM) antagonist activity. We also showed that 1.5-μM DAP had no effects on Cav1.2 or Cav2.1 current. Next, we used voltage imaging to show that 1.5- or 100-μM 3,4-DAP broadened the AP waveform in a dose-dependent manner, independent of Cav1 calcium channels. Finally, we demonstrated that 1.5- or 100-μM 3,4-DAP augmented transmitter release in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was also independent of Cav1 channels. From these results, we conclude that low micromolar concentrations of 3,4-DAP act solely on Kv channels to mediate AP broadening and enhance transmitter release at the NMJ."

There is a substantial difference in the quality of healthcare received by older people in developing and developed countries. Elderly persons in developing countries including Ghana are increasingly becoming marginalised and isolated. There is, however, limited evidence of healthcare challenges and expectations by elderly persons in Ghana. This study explored healthcare challenges and expectations of elderly persons to inform policy that could lead to improved quality of life for elderly persons in Ghana. Materials and methods Qualitative exploratory descriptive study design was used in conducting this study. Semi-structured interviews were used in collecting data from 30 participants from three regions in Ghana (10 from each region). Data analysis was carried out through content analysis. Results Four themes were extracted from data. These themes were: 1. Inadequate information from health workers regarding care of the older person. 2. Queuing frustrations. 3. Financial burden. 4. Focused elderly care demand. Conclusion The elderly in Ghana experience challenges of healthcare which include inadequate information, queuing frustrations and financial burdens. Elderly persons also have expectations of healthcare which include having dedicated professionals and units that will attend to them during their hospital visits. Academic and clinical gerontology experts could collaborate and help improve gerontology knowledge of health workers through workshops and conferences.

Here we address the influence of cognition in motion sickness and show that such a conflict is not provocative when the observer believes that the motion illusion is indeed actually occurring. Illusory self-motion and motion sickness were elicited in healthy human participants who were seated on a stationary rotary chair inside a rotating optokinetic drum. Participants knew that both chair and drum could rotate but were unaware of the actual motion stimulus. Results showed that motion sickness was correlated with the discrepancy between participants’ perceived self-motion and participants’ beliefs about the actual motion. Together with the general motion sickness susceptibility, this discrepancy accounted for 51% of the variance in motion sickness intensity. This finding sheds a new light on the causes of visually induced motion sickness and suggests that it is not governed by an inter-sensory conflict per se, but by beliefs concerning the actual self-motion. This cognitive influence provides a promising tool for the development of new countermeasures."

This study aims to evaluate the association between serum adiponectin and myostatin levels and identify independent factors using body composition and metabolic parameters in patients with obesity. Methods Overall, 148 patients (age, 45.9 ± 14.3 years, body mass index, 37.2 ± 8.0 kg/m 2 ) who initially visited the outpatient clinic of obesity between November 2013 and November 2019 were included. Body composition was measured using InBody 720 and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, muscle strength, vascular function, and metabolic parameters were measured. Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, myostatin, and irisin were measured from blood samples. Results The serum adiponectin level was 2.9 μg/mL (1.7–4.1 μg/mL), and the serum myostatin level was 2398.4 pg/mL (1,777.1–2952.5 pg/mL). The stepwise regression analysis revealed less leg strength, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein as an independent predictor of serum adiponectin levels based on the significance of the univariate analysis (R 2 = 0.190, P &lt; 0.001). A high appendicular lean mass/body weight, reactive hyperemia index, and irisin were independent factors for serum myostatin levels (R 2 = 0.260, P &lt; 0.001) Conclusion The serum adiponectin level was associated with less muscle strength. Although serum myostatin was associated with a high appendicular lean mass, it is possible that myostatin was regulated by the percentage of body weight from appendicular lean mass."

Accurate gene prediction of insect ORs from newly sequenced genomes is an important but challenging task. We have developed a dedicated webserver, ‘insectOR’, to predict and validate insect OR genes using multiple gene prediction algorithms, accompanied by relevant validations. It is possible to employ this server nearly automatically and perform rapid prediction of the OR gene loci from thousands of OR-protein-to-genome alignments, resolve gene boundaries for tandem OR genes and refine them further to provide more complete OR gene models. InsectOR outperformed the popular genome annotation pipelines (MAKER and NCBI eukaryotic genome annotation) in terms of overall sensitivity at base, exon and locus level, when tested on two distantly related insect genomes. It displayed more than 95% nucleotide level precision in both tests. Finally, given the same input data and parameters, InsectOR missed less than 2% gene loci, in contrast to 55% loci missed by MAKER for Drosophila melanogaster . The webserver is freely available on the web at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/insectOR/ and the basic package can be downloaded from https://github.com/sdk15/insectOR for local use.

We conducted an online survey across Brazil during the initial outbreak, in which 8,345 participants answered a questionnaire designed to identify the maximum tolerated risk (k’) necessary for them to disregard social distancing recommendations and guarantee their salaries. Generalized linear mixed models, path analysis structural equation, and conditional interference classification tree were performed to further understand how sociodemographic factors impact k’ and to establish a predictive model for the risk behavior of leaving home during the pandemic. We found that, on average, people tolerate 38% risk of infection to leave home and earn a full salary, but this number decreased to 13% when the individual risk perception of becoming ill from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is considered. Furthermore, participants who have a medium-to-high household income and who are older than 35 years are more likely to be part of the risk-taking group who leave home regardless of the potential COVID-19 infection level; while participants over 45 years old and with good financial health are more likely to be part of the risk-averse group, who stay home at the expense of any salary offered. Our findings add to the political and public debate concerning lockdown strategies by showing that, contrary to supposition, people with low socioeconomic status are not more likely to ignore social distancing recommendations due to personal economic matters."

In the retina, phospholipids had been scrutinized because of their distinct composition and requirement in visual transduction. However, how lipid composition changes during retinal development remains unclear. Here, we used liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to assess the dynamic changes in the levels of two main glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), in the developing mouse retina under physiological and pathological conditions. The total levels of PC and PE increased during retinal development, and individual lipid species exhibited distinct level changes. The amount of very-long-chain PC and PE increased dramatically in the late stages of retinal development. The mRNA levels of Elovl2 and Elovl4, genes encoding enzymes essential for the synthesis of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, increased in developing photoreceptors. Cell sorting based on CD73 expression followed by LC-MS revealed distinct changes in PC and PE levels in CD73-positive rod photoreceptors and CD73-negative retinal cells. Finally, using the NaIO3-induced photoreceptor degeneration model, we identified photoreceptor-specific changes in PC and PE levels from 1 day after NaIO3 administration, before the outer segment of photoreceptors displayed morphological impairment. In conclusion, our findings provide insight into the dynamic changes in PC and PE levels in the developing and adult mouse retina under physiological and pathological conditions.

Gruss P. Generating neuronal diversity in the retina: One for nearly all.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The majority of retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, and cone photoreceptors differentiate before birth, whereas bipolar cells, rod photoreceptors, and Müller glia are largely generated after birth. Numerous studies have shown that the well-ordered retinal cell differentiation is regulated by the coordinated action of transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms (2Swaroop A. Kim D. Forrest D.

Retinal photoreceptor degeneration is a leading cause of blindness. Despite extensive efforts, there is currently no effective treatment for retinal photoreceptor degeneration. Various biological processes, such as lipid metabolism, have been suggested to regulate photoreceptor maintenance. Of note, mounting evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid homeostasis leads to retinal degeneration. Rd1-16 mice have widely been used as mouse models of inherited retinal degeneration and to study the mechanisms of retinitis pigmentosa. Rd11 mice have a single-nucleotide insertion (c.420-421 in sG) in exon 3 of the Lpcat1 gene (4Friedman J.S. Chang B. Karauth D.S. Lopez I. Waseem N.H. Hurd R.E. Feathers K.L. Branham K.E. Shaw M.

LPCAT1 is a phospholipid biosynthesis/remodeling enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (5Shindou H. Shimizu T. Acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although reduced DPPC levels were found in the retina of rd11 mice (4Friedman J.S. Chang B. Karauth D.S. Lopez I. Waseem N.H. Hurd R.E. Feathers K.L. Branham K.E. Shaw M. Thomas G.E. Brooks M.J.

A. 2002; 107: 15523-115528Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the mechanistic links between low DPPC levels and photoreceptor degeneration remain unclear. Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) exert antiangiogenic and neuroprotective functions in the retina (6SanGiovanni J.P. Chew E.Y. The role of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in health and disease of the retina.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2005; 24: 87-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The LC-PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plays a pivotal role in photoreceptor development and maintenance (7Agbaga M.-P. Mandal M.N. Anderson R.E.

High intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA has been shown to prevent or delay intermediate age-related macular degeneration. However, the role of EPA and DHA in advanced age-related macular degeneration remains unknown (9Wu J. Cho E. Giovannucci E.L. Rosner B. Sastry S.M. Willett W.C. Schaumberg D.A. Dietary intakes of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and risk of age-Related macular degeneration.Am. Acad. Ophthalmol. 2017; 124: 634-643Google Scholar). We previously found that mice lacking lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3 (LPAAT3), a DHA-containing phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme, exhibited retinal development impairments, such as incomplete elongation of the outer segment (OS) and degeneration characterized by a decreased thickness of the outer nuclear layers (ONLs), as well as impaired visual function and disordered disc morphology in photoreceptor cells (10Shindou H.

Stargardt's disease is characterized by the accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), leading to photoreceptor degeneration (11Tanna P. Strauss R.W. Fujinami K.

Mutations in the elongase-coding gene Elovl4, which is essential for very-long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs), have been implicated in the development of a rare form of Stargardt's disease known as Stargardt's disease 3 (12Zhang K.

In addition, mutations in ABCA4, an ATP-binding cassette transporter facilitating the removal of potentially reactive retinal lipid derivatives, have been implicated in Stargardt's disease pathology (14Lenis T.L.

These data support the importance of lipid homeostasis in preventing retinal degeneration. Recent evidence suggested the involvement of aging and stress in neuronal degeneration in the brain; changes in lipid composition have been proposed as a critical link between aging and neuronal degeneration. Although age-related changes in retinal glycopeptidolipid are insignificant (16Hopiavuori B.R. Agbaga M.-P. Brush R.S. Sullivan M.T. Sonntag W.E. Anderson R.E. Regional changes in CNS and retinal glycerophospholipid profiles with age: A molecular blueprint.J. Lipid Res. 2017; 58: 668-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), stress-induced dysregulation of lipid homeostasis may promote photoreceptor degeneration. Lipid composition mapping in the retina in health and disease is important for the elucidation of the relevance of lipid homeostasis in retinal degeneration. Previous work had identified dynamism of phospholipids during retinal development (17Scott B.L. Racz E. Lolley R.N. Bazan N.G. Developing rod photoreceptors from normal and mutant Rd mouse retinas: Altered fatty acid composition early in development of the mutant.J. Neurosce Res. 1988; 20: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on changes in the levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cell membranes (18van der Veen J.N. Kennelly J.P. Wan S. Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Jacobs R.L. The critical role of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2017; 1896: 1558-1572Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We examined the temporal changes in PC and PE composition in the developing retina using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In combination with our technique of retinal cell fractionation, we performed a comparative analysis of PC and PE levels in photoreceptors and other retinal cells. Our data revealed dynamic changes in PC and PE composition depending on the developmental stage, retinal cell lineage, and pathological situation. Cell sorting may serve as a powerful tool to study membrane lipid biology in the retina. To examine the changes in PC and PE levels during retinal development, we isolated the retinas of mice at different developmental stages ranging between E14 and 8 weeks old (adults). Membrane lipids were extracted and subjected to LC-MS to measure the levels of PC and PE. Protein amounts were measured, and the total PC or PE peak-area per microgram protein was calculated. The total PC area/protein in the retina sharply increased from E14 until birth, followed by a slow increase until P12 and then a decrease (Fig. 1A). Increasing evidence shows that VLC-PUFAs are critical regulators of neuronal survival (13Deak F. Anderson R.E. Fessler J.L. Sherry D.M. Novel cellular functions of very long chain-fatty acids: Insight from elovl4 mutations.Front Cell Neurosci. 2019; 13: 428Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the retina, VLC-PUFAs are enriched in light-sensitive photoreceptors in the outer retinal segments (7Agbaga M.-P. Mandal M.N. Anderson R.E.

A novel group of very long chain polyenoic fatty acides in dipolyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines form vertebrate retina.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1172-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we defined VLC-PC and VLC-PE as PC and PE species having more than 44:12 molecular weight. Although VLC-PC levels were negligible in the embryonic period, they dramatically increased after birth (Fig. 1B). The total amount of PE/protein also increased until birth, and then stayed constant until P5. Subsequently, the total amount of PE/protein sharply increased until P12 and then stayed constant until adulthood (Fig. 1C). The changes in the total amount of VLC-PE (Fig. 1D) followed a similar pattern to that of total VLC-PC (Fig. 1B). We then examined the levels of individual PC species during retinal development. PC 32:0 and 34:1 were abundant PC species; their levels increased in the embryonic period, followed by a decrease after birth (Fig. 1E). All other PC species exhibited dynamic and distinct temporal patterns during retinal development, and the levels of most of them increased during the embryonic period (Fig. 1E). The levels of VLC-PC exhibited a continuous and sharp increase after birth, especially after P12 (Figs. 1F and S1). This observation is consistent with the OS development in the late phase of retinal development. However, the levels of certain PC species, including 52:6, 56:10, 58:11, and 58:12, peaked at P15, and their levels dramatically decreased in the adult retina (Figs. 1F and S1) The levels of predominant PE species in the retina, such as 38:4, 38:6, and 40:6, showed a continuous increase during retinal development until P12 (Fig. 1G), largely accounting for the observed pattern of total PE during retinal development (Fig. 1C). The levels of other PE species peaked around birth, followed by a gradual decrease (Fig. 1G). The levels of the primary VLC-PE molecular species, 44:12 and 44:11, increased after birth (Fig. 1H). Next, we examined membrane phospholipid composition in the degenerating retina of rd1 mice. Previous works that examined the alteration of fatty acid composition and DHA metabolism in mouse retina of wildtype and rd1 by TLC or TLC/GC methods showed altered fatty acid metabolism especially an increment of DHA during retinal development (17Scott B.L. Racz E. Lolley R.N. Bazan N.G. Developing rod photoreceptors from normal and mutant Rd mouse retinas: Altered fatty acid composition early in development of the mutant.J.

Docosahexaenoate metabolism and fatty-acid composition in developing retinas of normal and rd mutant mice.Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 44: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the rd1 mouse model, photoreceptor degeneration starts at around P10 (21Chang B. Hawes N.L. Hurd R.E. Davisson M.T. Nusinowitz S. Heckenlively J.R. Retinal degeneration mutants in the mouse.Vis. Res. 2002; 42: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 22Iwagawa T. Aihara Y. Umutoni D. Baba Y. Murakami A. Miyado K. Watanabe S. Cd9 protects photoreceptors from injury and potentiates Edn2 expression.Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2020; 61: 1-12Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and progresses rapidly; at P16, only a thin ONL was observed in the retina (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the thickness of the inner nuclear layer was indistinguishable between control and rd1 retinas in these three developmental stages (Fig. 2B). We isolated the retinas of rd1 and control mice at P10, P13, and P16 and subsequently analyzed the PC and PE components. The levels of both total PC and PE per retina decreased in the developing retina of rd1 mice; in contrast, the levels of total PC and PE increased in the developing retina of control mice (Fig. 2, C and D). This is probably because the size of the rd1 retinas gradually decreased. In rd1 retinas, the levels of PC 32:0, PC 38:6, and PC/PE 44:12 decreased during development, although the levels of these lipid species increased in control retinas (Fig. 2, E and F). In contrast, the levels of PC 34:1 and PE 38:4 increased in the developing retina of rd1 mice but decreased in control retinas (Fig. 2, E and F). The decrease in PC and PE levels in the developing rd1 retina could be explained by the progressive loss of photoreceptors; hence, we next measured the levels of photoreceptor-specific PC and PE after retinal cell sorting. First, we examined the effects of cell sorting on the membrane PC and PE composition. We also determined the number of cells required to measure PC and PE levels by LC-MS. We isolated the retinas of mice at E17 or adult mice, followed by trypsinization and cell sorting. Cells were collected, and membrane lipids were extracted after pooling different numbers of cells (Fig. S2A). The extracted lipids were subjected to LC-MS for PC and PE composition analysis. Total levels of PC or PE increased with increasing numbers of cells (Fig. S2, B and D). Values per 1 × 104 cells showed larger but higher standard deviation values in samples with smaller number of cells than other samples in both PC and PE analyses (Fig. S2, C and E). The predominant PC species exhibited comparable levels in E17 and adult retinas, with some exceptions (Fig. S2, F and G, left panel). It is surprising that this was also the case for low-abundance PC species (Fig. S2, F and G, right panel), indicating the high sensitivity of the method regardless of the cell number. In adult retinas, long-chain PC, such as PC 46:12 and PC 54:12, exhibited comparable levels from 5 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells, suggesting that a small number of cells was sufficient to analyze long-chain fatty acids (Fig. S2G, right panels). Similarly, the levels of most PE species in E17 and adult retinas showed comparable values, with a few exceptions when 5× 103 cells were used for analysis (Fig. S2, H and I). However, many low-abundance PE species exhibited varying levels among different samples (data not shown). As a control, lipid samples from E17 and adult retinas were also subjected to LC-MS at the same time with samples from sorted cells. In E17 retinas, we found similar PC and PE levels in sorted and whole retinal samples (Fig. S2, F and H). In adult retinal samples, we found comparable PC and PE levels for abundant species; however, low-abundance species exhibited higher relative values in sorted samples than in control samples (Fig. S2, G and I). Therefore, for subsequent experiments, we used 5 × 104 cells. Rod photoreceptors comprise 70% to 80% of retinal cells; therefore, LC-MS analysis in whole retinal samples does not provide sufficient information on the lipid composition of less abundant retinal cells. We previously identified CD73 as a marker of rod photoreceptors in the developing and adult retina (23Koso H. Minami C. Tabata Y. Inoue M. Sasaki E. Satoh S. Watanabe S. CD73 is a novel cell surface antigen characterizes retinal photoreceptor precursor cells.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RNA sequencing analysis of adult CD73-positive and CD73-negative retinal cells (GSE71462, GSE71464) (24Ueno K. Iwagawa T. Kuribayashi H. Baba Y. Nakauchi H. Murakami A. Nagasaki M. Suzuki Y. Watanabe S. Transition of differential histone H3 methylation in photoreceptors and other retinal cells during retinal differentiation.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 29264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) confirmed the expression of rod photoreceptor-specific genes in the CD73-positive fraction at P12 (Fig. S3). We analyzed PC and PE levels by LC-MS after sorting retinal cells based on CD73 expression. We observed striking differences in PC levels between CD73-positive and CD73-negative cells. Of note, PC 34:1 and PC 36:1 levels were considerably higher in CD73-negative than in CD73-positive cells, whereas the opposite was observed for PC 44:12, PC 38:6, and PC 40:6 (Fig. 3A), although the difference for PC 40:6 did not reach statistical significance. Among the low-abundance species, VLC-PC species (54:12, 56:12) were almost exclusively present in the CD73-positive cell population (Fig. 3A, right panel). Although PE 44:12 levels were significantly higher in CD73-positive cells, CD73-negative cells exhibited higher levels of most PE species (Fig. 3B). We then examined the dynamism of expression patterns of genes involving VLC during retinal development. ELOVL2 and ELOVL4 are elongases involved in VLC-PUFA-CoA biosynthesis (7Agbaga M.-P.

Using our previous RNA sequencing data (GSE71462, GSE71464) (24Ueno K. Iwagawa T. Kuribayashi H. Baba Y. Nakauchi H. Murakami A. Nagasaki M. Suzuki Y. Watanabe S. Transition of differential histone H3 methylation in photoreceptors and other retinal cells during retinal differentiation.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 29264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we found that Elovl2 and Elovl4 were upregulated in CD73-positive rod photoreceptors as early as at P2, which corresponds to the rod photorecetpor birth period (Fig. 4A). During late retinal development, which corresponds to the rod photoreceptor maturation period, although Elovl4 expression levels kept high in CD73-positive cells, Elovl2 expression in CD73-positive cells gradually decreased and became similar to the level of the CD73-negative fraction (Fig. 4A). Although ELOVL5 was also shown to catalyze the elongation of long-chain fatty acids, Elovl5 mRNA levels were higher in nonphotoreceptor cells than in rod photoreceptors (Fig. 4A). Consistently, no mutations in Elovl5 were observed in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (27Barragan I. Marcos I. Borrego S. Antinolo G.

Nrl is the Maf-family leucine zipper transcription factor, and in the Nrl knockout (Nrl-KO) retina, photoreceptor precursors fated to cells with characteristics of short-wavelength cones (28Mears A.J.

We confirmed that rod photoreceptor kept high Elovl4 expression pattern after P14, which was in contrast to the low expression level of Elovl2 (Fig. 4B). Of interest, Nrl-KO mice–derived retina showed higher expression levels of Elovl2 and Elovl5, but Elovl4 was lower than Nrl-GFP rod (Fig. 4B), suggesting differential expression patterns of these genes between rod and cone. We also examined two enzymes involved in DHA metabolism and found that Agpat3 was expressed in CD73P cells much higher than in CD73N cells, but Fads2 in CD73P cells was rather lower than in CD73N cells (Fig. 4A). The expression pattern of Fads1 was similar to that of Fads2 (data not shown). The Nrl-KO retina showed that the expression levels of both Agpat3 and Fads2 were lower in cone than in rod (Fig. 4B). Publicized RNA-Seq data of human iPS-derived retinal organoid (GSE119320) (31Brooks M.J. Chen H.Y. Kelley R.A. Mondal A.K. Nagashima K. De Val N. Li T. Chaitankar V. Swaroop A.

The difference of PC and PE levels of rd1 mice was partly explained by the difference of PC and PE species in photoreceptor and other cells, but we aimed to directly analyze the transition of PC and PE levels in the degenerating photoreceptor. For that purpose, we employed the sodium iodate (NaIO3) model because degeneration occurs more uniformly than in the rd1 model. NaIO3 causes photoreceptor degeneration, but it primarily targets the RPE (32Enamann V. Row B.W. Yamauchi Y. Kheirandish L. Gozal D. Kaplan H.J. McCall M.A. Behavioral and anatomical abnormalities in a sodium iodate-induced model of retinal pigment epithelium degeneration.Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 82: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We examined PC and PE dynamism of CD73-positive and -negative cell fractions after treatment with NaIO3. We isolated mouse retinas 1, 3, or 5 days after treatment with NaIO3. Three days after treatment, the ONL of NaIO3-treated mice was distinguishable from that of control ONLs (Fig. 5A). Five days after treatment, ONLs in the NaIO3-treated mice were profoundly thinner than control ONLs (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined the levels of PC and PE in CD73-positive and CD73-negative retinal cells in mice treated with NaIO3 (day 1, 3, and 5). When we analyzed the CD73-positive fraction, NaIO3 treatment decreased PC 44:12 significantly and increased PC 32:0 and 34:2. More than half of the PC species with small amount (Fig. 5B) showed increment, but it may be caused by the relative change caused by a large decrease of PC 44:12. In PE analysis, PE 44:12 decreased significantly, and the increment of PE 38:6 and 40:8 was remarkable (Fig. 5D). The relative levels of PC and PE species with small amount also showed changes of their percentage to the total amounts of PC and PE (Fig. 5, C and E). The levels of most PC and PE sp"

We aimed to characterise polypharmacy using data from the Newcastle 85+ Study—a prospective cohort of people born in 1921 who turned 85 in 2006 (n = 845). Methods The prevalence of polypharmacy at baseline (mean age 85.5) was examined using cut-points of 0, 1, 2–4, 5–9 and ≥10 medicines—so-called ‘no polypharmacy’, ‘monotherapy’, ‘minor polypharmacy’, ‘polypharmacy’ and ‘hyperpolypharmacy.’ Cross-tabulations and upset plots identified the most frequently prescribed medicines and medication combinations within these categories. Mixed-effects models assessed whether gender and socioeconomic position were associated with prescribing changes over time (mean age 85.5–90.5). Participant characteristics were examined through descriptive statistics. Results Complex multimorbidity (44.4%, 344/775) was widespread but hyperpolypharmacy was not (16.0%, 135/845). The median medication count was six (interquartile range 4–8). Preventative medicines were common to all polypharmacy categories, and prescribing regimens were diverse. Nitrates and oral anticoagulants were more frequently prescribed for men, whereas bisphosphonates, non-opioid analgesics and antidepressants were more common in women. Cardiovascular medicines, including loop diuretics, tended to be more frequently prescribed for socioeconomically disadvantaged people (&lt;25 th centile Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)), despite no difference in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (p = 0.56) and diabetes (p = 0.92) by IMD. Conclusion Considering their complex medical conditions, prescribing is relatively conservative amongst 85-year-olds living in North East England. Prescribing shows significant gender and selected socioeconomic differences. More support for managing preventative medicines, of uncertain benefit, might be helpful in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3124377792,"While correlations between postural stability deficits and schizophrenia are well documented, information on dynamic motor alterations in schizophrenia are still scarce, and no data on their onset are available yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was i) to measure gait pattern(s) in patients with schizophrenia; ii) to identify posture and gait alterations which could potentially be used as a predictive clinical tool of the onset of the disorder. Body composition, posture and gait parameters were assessed in a group of 30 patients with schizophrenia and compared to 25 healthy subjects. Sway area was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group compared to controls regardless of whether the participants were in eyes open or eyes closed condition. Gait cadence and speed were significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia, while stride length was similar. We concluded that the combination of an increased sway area (independent from eye closure) and a gait cadence reduction—in the presence of normal gait speed and stride length—might be considered peculiar postural and gait profile characteristic of early schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W3123473886,"Background Lower-grade glioma (LGG) is the most common histology identified in glioma. CKMT1B has not been investigated in glioma. The purpose of this research was to investigate the prognostic value of CKMT1B and its correlation with immune infiltration in LGG. Methods We used Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) to analyze the expression of CKMT1B in LGG. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to assess the effect of CKMT1B expression and screened variables on survival. The correlation between CKMT1B and immune infiltration was evaluated by TIMER and CIBERSORT. Moreover, the possible biological functions of CKMT1B were studied by GSEA. The statistical analysis was conducted by R software. Results The expression of CKMT1B was significantly lower than the normal samples in LGG. Low expression of CKMT1B predicts a worse prognosis. Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that CKMT1B might be an independent favorable prognostic indicator. TIMER analysis revealed that CKMT1B expression level was related to immune infiltration. CIBERSORT analysis showed that CKMT1B expression was positively related to the infiltration level of activated mast cells and negatively related to macrophage M2 in LGG. Moreover, GESA showed that multiple cancer-related and immune-related gene sets were enriched in the low-CKMT1B group in the top 5 of the most significant differences. Conclusion CKMT1B is a prognostic biomarker with potential applications and associated with immune infiltration in Lower-grade glioma."
https://openalex.org/W3123716393,"Evasion of apoptosis is associated with treatment resistance and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Various cellular processes are associated with evasion of apoptosis. These include overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins (including p53 and PD-L1), anti-apoptotic proteins (BIRC7/Livin and Bcl-2), chemokine receptors (including DARC), and dysregulation of DNA mismatch repair proteins (including MSH2 and PMS2). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of folinic acid, 5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as a single agent and aspirin plus FOLFOX in various combinations on the aforementioned proteins in human CRC, SW480 cell line and rat models of N-Methyl-N-Nitrosourea (NMU)-induced CRC. In addition, effects of the NMU-induced CRC and chemotherapeutic regimens on haematological and biochemical parameters in the rat models were studied. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and immunoblot techniques were used to study the expression pattern of the related proteins in the human CRC cells pre- and post-treatment. Double contrast barium enema, post-mortem examination and histological analyses were used to confirm tumour growth and the effect of the treatment in vivo in rat models. Notably, we found in human mucinous CRC, a significant increase in expression of the BIRC7/Livin post-FOLFOX treatment compared with pre-treatment ( p = 0.0001). This increase provides new insights into the prognostic role of BIRC7/Livin in evasion of apoptosis and facilitation of treatment resistance, local recurrence and metastasis particularly among mucinous CRCs post-FOLFOX chemotherapy. These poor prognostic features in the CRC may be further compounded by the significant suppression of DARC, PD-L1, PMS2 and overexpression of MSH2 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and p53 proteins observed in our study (p &lt; 0.05). Importantly, we found a significant reduction in expression of BIRC7/Livin and reactivation of DARC and PD-L1 with a surge in Annexin V expression in rat models of CRC cells post-treatment with a sequential dose of aspirin plus FOLFOX compared with other treatments in vivo ( p &lt;0.05). The mechanistic rational of these effects underscores the importance of expanded concept of possible aspirin combination therapy with FOLFOX sequentially in future CRC management. Validation of our findings through randomized clinical trials of aspirin plus FOLFOX sequentially in patients with CRC is therefore warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3123877353,"Office-based workplaces are an important but understudied context for infectious disease transmission. We examined the feasibility of two different sensors (Opos and Bluetooth beacons) for collecting person-to-person contacts and hand hygiene in office-based workplaces. Opo is an interaction sensor that captures sensor-to-sensor interactions through ultrasonic frequencies, which correspond to face-to-face contacts between study participants. Opos were additionally used to measure hand hygiene events by affixing sensors to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers. Bluetooth beacons were used in conjunction with a smartphone application and recorded proximity contacts between study participants. Participants in two office sites were followed for one-week in their workplace in March 2018. Contact patterns varied by time of day and day of the week. Face-to-face contacts were of shorter mean duration than proximity contacts. Supervisors had fewer proximity contacts but more face-to-face contacts than non-supervisors. Self-reported hand hygiene was substantively higher than sensor-collected hand hygiene events and duration of hand washing events was short (median: 9 seconds, range: 2.5–33 seconds). Given that office settings are key environments in which working age populations spend a large proportion of their time and interactions, a better characterization of empirical social networks and hand hygiene behaviors for workplace interactions are needed to mitigate outbreaks and prepare for pandemics. Our study demonstrates that implementing sensor technologies for tracking interactions and behaviors in offices is feasible and can provide new insights into real-world social networks and hygiene practices. We identified key social interactions, variability in hand hygiene, and differences in interactions by workplace roles. High-resolution network data will be essential for identifying the most effective ways to mitigate infectious disease transmission and develop pandemic preparedness plans for the workplace setting."
https://openalex.org/W3122815434,"Neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid malignancy among children, originates from undifferentiated neural crest cells (NCC). Despite recent intensified treatment, high-risk patients still have a high mortality rate. To explore a new therapeutic strategy, we performed an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 30 high-risk neuroblastoma cases. Based on the expression profiling of RNA sequencing, neuroblastoma was classified into Mesenchymal (MES; n = 5) and Noradrenergic (ADRN; n = 25) clusters, as previously reported in the super-enhancer landscape. The expression patterns in MES-cluster cases were similar to normal adrenal glands, with enrichment in secretion-related pathways, suggesting chromaffin cell-like features built from NCC-derived Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). In contrast, neuron-related pathways were enriched in the ADRN-cluster, indicating sympathoblast features reported to originate from NCC but not via SCPs. Thus, MES- and ADRN-clusters were assumed to be corresponding to differentiation pathways through SCP and sympathoblast, respectively. ADRN-cluster cases were further classified into MYCN- and ATRX-clusters, characterized by genetic alterations, MYCN amplifications and ATRX alterations, respectively. MYCN-cluster cases showed high expression of ALDH18A1 , encoding P5CS related to proline production. As reported in other cancers, this might cause reprogramming of proline metabolism leading to tumor specific proline vulnerability candidate for a target therapy of metabolic pathway. In ATRX-cluster, SLC18A2 (VMAT2), an enzyme known to prevent cell toxicity due to the oxidation of dopamine, was highly expressed and VMAT2 inhibitor (GZ-793A) represented significant attenuation of cell growth in NB-69 cell line (high SLC18A2 expression, no MYCN amplification) but not in IMR-32 cell line ( MYCN amplification). In addition, the correlation of VMAT2 expression with metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) avidity suggested a combination of VMAT2 inhibitor and MIBG radiation for a novel potential therapeutic strategy in ATRX-cluster cases. Thus, targeting the characteristics of unique neuroblastomas may prospectively improve prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3125756249,"Objective Task-specific training is often used in functional rehabilitation for its potential to improve performance at locomotor tasks in neurological populations. As push-off impairment are often seen with these patients, this functional approach shows potential to retrain gait overground to normalize the gait pattern and retrain the ability to improve gait speed. The main objective of this project was to validate, in healthy participants, a simple, low-cost push-off retraining protocol based on task-specific training that could be implemented during overground walking in the clinic. Methods 30 healthy participants walked in an 80-meter long corridor before, during, and after the application of an elastic resistance to the right ankle. Elastic tubing attached to the front of a modified ankle-foot orthosis delivered the resistance during push-off. Relative ankle joint angular displacements were recorded bilaterally and continuously during each walking condition. Results On the resisted side, participants presented aftereffects (increased peak plantarflexion angle from 13.4±4.2° to 20.0±6.4°, p&lt;0.0001 and increased peak plantarflexion angular velocity from 145.8±22.7°/s to 174.4±37.4°/s, p&lt;0.0001). On the non-resisted side, aftereffects were much smaller than on the resisted side suggesting that the motor learning process was mainly specific to the trained leg. Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of modifying push-off kinematics using an elastic resistance applied at the ankle while walking overground. This approach represents an interesting venue for future gait rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3121405335,"Introduction The aging of staff and skill shortage are major challenges for social enterprises. Nurturing a workplace culture of health and fostering employee engagement could be starting points to combat these challenges. The associations between these two factors have received comparatively little attention from the scientific community, in particular with regard to social enterprises. Hence, this study aims to examine those associations, drawing on the job demands-resources theory and the social-ecological workplace culture of health model. It is hypothesized that employees’ self-rated health acts as a mediator in the relationship between culture of health and employee engagement and that health as personal value works as a moderator. Method The study used the Workplace Culture of Health scale to measure culture of health in social enterprises and UWES-9 to assess employee engagement. Data was collected administering a quantitative online survey among employees of social enterprises in Germany. The dataset for analyses comprised N = 172 employees in total. Data analyses included Pearson’s correlations, regression analysis, as well as mediation, moderation and moderated mediation analyses. Results Culture of health is a predictor of employee engagement in social enterprises. The analyses demonstrate a moderate association between culture of health and employee engagement. Indications were found that employees’ self-rated health acts as a mediator and that health as personal value acts as a moderator between culture of health and employee engagement in social enterprises. Discussion This study suggests that fostering a culture of health in social enterprises does not only have a positive effect on employee health, but also on employee engagement. This applies in particular when employees attribute great value to their health, which is to be expected even more in future. Hence, nurturing a culture of health becomes a pivotal management task in social enterprises. Moreover, a comprehensive assessment of the benefits of health promotion programs in social enterprises should not only consider their health-related outcomes, but also factor in their impact on employee engagement."
https://openalex.org/W3123552085,"Accumulating evidence has suggested a correlation of tumor infiltrating B cells (TiBcs) and a good prognosis of cancer diseases. In some cases, TiBcs appear to have experienced antigen stimulation since they have undergone class-switching and somatic hypermutation and formed tertiary lymphoid structures around tumors together with T cells. Assuming TiBcs include those that recognize some tumor antigens, we sought to investigate their possible usefulness for cell-mediated immunotherapies. To expand usually small number of TiBcs in vitro , we modified our B cell culture system: we transduced B cells with ER T2 -Bach2 so that they grow unlimitedly provided with tamoxifen, IL-21 and our original feeder cells. Such cells differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies upon withdrawal of tamoxifen, and further by addition of a Bach2-inhibitor in vitro . As a preliminary experiment, thus expanded splenic B cells expressing a transgenic antigen receptor/antibody against hen egg lysozyme were intravenously injected into mice pre-implanted with B16 melanoma cells expressing membrane-bound HEL in the skin, which resulted in suppression of the growth of B16 tumors and prolonged survival of the recipient mice. To test the usefulness of TiBcs for the immunotherapy, we next used APC min/+ mice as a model that spontaneously develop intestinal tumors. We cultured TiBcs separated from the tumors of APC min/+ mice as above and confirmed that the antibodies they produce recognize the APC min/+ tumor. Repeated injection of such TiBcs into adult APC min/+ mice resulted in suppression of intestinal tumor growth and elongation of the survival of the recipient mice. Serum antibody from the TiBc-recipient mice selectively bound to an antigen expressed in the tumor of APC min/+ mice. These data suggest a possibility of the novel individualized cancer immunotherapy, in which TiBcs from surgically excised tumor tissues are expanded and infused into the donor patients."

The Gram-negative bacteria possess a multilayer cell envelope composed of the inner membrane surrounding the cytoplasm and the outer membrane facing the external medium. The two membranes delimit an extracytoplasmic compartment, the periplasm, which contains a peptidoglycan layer (1Silhavy T.J. Kahne D. Walker S. The bacterial cell envelope.Cold Spring Harb.

For instance, the phytopathogenic γ-proteobacteria, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Dickeya dadantii, cause soft rot disease in a variety of plants through the action of several pectinases secreted by the T2SS, called Out (11Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N.

The T2SS is a sophisticated transenvelope scaffold that is composed of at least 12 conserved core elements, generically called GspC to GspO (for General Secretory Pathway) or, more specifically, OutC to OutO for Pectobacterium and Dickeya.

Microbiol. 2011; 2: 155Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the same T2SS restricts the secretion of very similar orthologous proteins from other species. For example, the T2SS of D. dadantii secretes more than 15 different proteins, but it can discriminate between its own pectate lyase PelI and the Pel3 from P. carotovorum, although they share 67% of sequence identity (20Bouley J. Condemine G. Shevchik V.E. The PDZ domain of OutC and the N-terminal region of OutD determine the secretion specificity of the type II out pathway of Erwinia chrysanthemi.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, we have exploited this species-specific secretion to study the molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition by T2SS (21Pineau C. Guschinskaya N. Robert X. Gouet P. Ballut L. Shevchik V.E. Substrate recognition by the bacterial type II secretion system: More than a simple interaction.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have shown that PelI interacts with two T2SS components, the inner membrane GspC and the outer membrane GspD (21Pineau C. Guschinskaya N. Robert X. Gouet P. Ballut L. Shevchik V.E. Substrate recognition by the bacterial type II secretion system: More than a simple interaction.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that an exposed 9 residue-long region, loop 3 of PelI, acts as a specific secretion signal that controls protein recruitment by the T2SS. The interaction of this loop with the dedicated domains of GspC and GspD is essential for the T2SS to discriminate between the cognate substrate PelI and heterologous Pel3. Furthermore, these data suggest that some other zones of PelI could also be involved in protein recruitment by the T2SS, indicating that this process is more complex than simply the recognition of a single loop (21Pineau C. Guschinskaya N. Robert X. Gouet P. Ballut L. Shevchik V.E. Substrate recognition by the bacterial type II secretion system: More than a simple interaction.Mol.

Previous studies have largely benefited from the high-resolution structures available for the pectate lyase PelI and for the periplasmic domains of the GspC and GspD components (22Korotkov K.V.

However, the structure of Pel3 from P. carotovorum was still unresolved. It can be expected that the orthologous Pel3 and PelI would share a similar overall topology, but fine specific structural features may also exist since Pel3 is not recognized by the T2SS of D. dadantii. Therefore, we undertook a structural characterization of Pel3 to identify such potential secretion determinants and to carry out a rational design and construction of the Pel3 variants that could be secreted by D. dadantii. We reveal that Pel3 shares the same general topology as PelI, consisting of an N-terminal domain of a fibronectin type III fold (Fn3) linked to a catalytic domain (CD) that adopts a parallel β-helix topology. Whereas the core structure of both Fn3 and CD is well conserved in Pel3 and PelI, significant differences were observed for several exposed loop regions, indicating that these are putative secretion determinants. To test this hypothesis, we systematically substituted such divergent zones of Pel3 with those from PelI and then assessed the secretion of the generated hybrids in D. dadantii. We have demonstrated that, in addition to loop 3 of Fn3, several other loop regions are essential for secretion. Some of them are spatially close to the loop 3 and could together constitute a composite secretion determinant, whereas others are more distant and may act as independent secretion signals. These data suggest that the proteins secreted by T2SS pass through a multifaceted control that monitors the adequacy of several secretion determinants. Remarkably, structural analysis of Pel3 reveals that the key secretion signal, loop 3 of Fn3, is present in the crystals in different conformations. Such conformational transitions could reflect a transient structuration of loop 3 when in contact with an appropriate T2SS component. We hypothesize that such T2SS-induced structuration of some intrinsically disordered zones of the protein to be secreted is part of the recruitment mechanism used by T2SS. We crystallized the full-length Pel3 in two types of monoclinic crystals with one or two monomers in the asymmetric unit, named Pel31m and Pel32m, and solved the structures at 1.8 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively (Table S1). The structures are very similar, with the same fold and domain arrangement, as testified by an r.m.s. deviation of 1.6 Å on all Cα pairs. Pel3 adopts a compact pear-like overall shape composed of two unequal domains, a small fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) (residues 1–109) and a large catalytic domain that has a β-helix fold (residues 120–347) (Fig. 1). The two domains are linked by a decapeptide segment (residues 110–119), which is observed in the electron density map of Pel31m, and have the same respective orientation in Pel31m and Pel32m. When superimposed onto the structure of the orthologous PelI from D. dadantii, the same domain composition and overall shape are observed, with an r.m.s. deviation of 2 Å on all Cα pairs (Fig. 1A). The pectate lyases (EC 4.2.2.2 and EC 4.2.2.9) catalyze the cleavage of polymeric α-1-4-linked polygalacturonic acid within the pectin component of the plant cell wall, leaving an unsaturated C4–C5 bond at the newly formed nonreducing end (24Creze C.

Pectate lyases have been classified into five structurally and phylogenetically unrelated families of polysaccharide lyases (PL-1, 2, 3, 9, and 10) (www.cazy.org, (26Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H.

The catalytic domain of Pel3 adopts the general β-helix fold typical of the structurally characterized proteins from the PL-3 family: it is made up of eight right-handed coils stacked on top of one another. Each coil consists of three consecutive strand-turn motifs, termed PBn.m-Tn.m, where n is 1 to 3 and m is 1 to 8 (Fig. 1). Five disulfide bonds are well conserved between PelI and Pel3 (Fig. S1): three of them (124/137, #1, 180/185, #3, and 312/337, #5) reinforce the stability of the β-solenoid fold while the two other disulfide bonds (146/196, #2 and 257/260, #4) fasten the positions of the extended loops. The hydrophobic core of the Pel3 β-helix is stabilized by a series of hydrophobic interactions between the inward-pointing side chains of several aliphatic residues, Ile, Val, and Leu. These residues are organized into two regular ladders, extending along the whole length of the β-helix, at the β-strands PB1 and PB3, respectively (Fig. S2). These aliphatic interstrand stackings are well conserved among the PL-3 family members, while in some proteins, Phe is present instead of aliphatic residues (Fig. 2). The Pel3 catalytic site is nearly identical to that of PelI and similar to those of two other structurally characterized PL-3 members from Bacillus sp. KSM-P15 and from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (PDB entries 1EE6 and 3T9G, respectively) (27Alahuhta M. Chandrayan P. Kataeva I. Adams M.W. Himmel M.E. Lunin V.V.

It carries the same invariant residues with Lys227 acting as the catalytic base and Lys252 and Arg255 implicated in the binding of the substrate (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). In the catalytic site of Pel31m, a sulfate ion was detected, which forms salt bridges with Lys227, Lys252, and Arg255 mimicking the hydroxyl groups of the natural substrate, polygalacturonic acid (Fig. S4). In addition, a structural calcium ion was present in the monomer B of Pel32m where it coordinates the main-chain carbonyl O of Ile195 and Pro221, the side-chain Oδ atom of Asp194 and Asn216, and two water molecules, which complete the pentagonal bipyramidal geometry (Fig. S3A). Superimposition of monomers A and B of Pel32m indicated that the Ca2+ ion seems to be necessary for a proper fold of loop T3.4. Indeed, in the monomer B, T3.4 forms a lid over the bound Ca2+, whereas this turn is highly destabilized, in the monomer A, in the absence of calcium (Fig. S5). Interestingly, this arrangement is specific to Pel3 and PelI as the loop forming T3.4 is absent from other pectate lyases of the PL-3 family (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). Superimposition of the catalytic domains of Pel3 and PelI reveals some subtle structural differences that are essentially restricted to the extended loops formed by T3.1, T3.2, T3.4, and T1.8 (Fig. 3A). These zones have a low degree of sequence conservation and show variable arrangements in Pel3 and PelI. Notably, these loops are also differently arranged in the various crystal forms of Pel3, indicating their high intrinsic flexibility (Fig. S6). Such properties could be consistent with the formation of specific secretion patterns for cognate T2SS. The N-terminal domain of Pel3 has a seven-stranded Fn3 fold very similar to that of the Fn3 domain of PelI, with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.0 Å on all Cα pairs. It is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets packed against each other (Fig. 1). Except for Pel3, PelI, and a few close homologs from γ-proteobacteria, other characterized representatives of the PL-3 family do not possess an Fn3-like domain. Some PL-3 members carry, instead, a carbohydrate-binding module (Firmicutes and Fungi) or a ricin B-like lectin domain (Actinobacteria), while the Nematode’s pectate lyases usually consist of the catalytic PL-3 domain only (Table S2). The Fn3 domain does not affect the catalytic activity of PelI and its biological function remains unclear (24Creze C. Castang S. Derivery E. Haser R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Shevchik V.E. Gouet P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 18260-18268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fn3-like modules have also been identified in some other carbohydrate-active enzymes suggesting its possible implication in plant cell wall degradation (29Little E. Bork P. Doolittle R.F.

Carbohydrate binding modules: Diversity of domain architecture in amylases and cellulases from filamentous microorganisms.Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2020; 8: 871Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Fn3 topology is, however, very common in eukaryotes, and it has been found in about 2% of all animal proteins (32Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Proposed acquisition of an animal protein domain by bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8990-8994Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, a search for structural homologs of Fn3 Pel3, using the Dali server (33Holm L. Laakso L.M. Dali server update.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), shows that the highest scoring hits are the Fn3 domains from eukaryotic proteins (Fig. S7 and Table S3). In contrast, a few characterized Fn3 domains from bacterial carbohydrate-active enzymes are structurally divergent from Fn3 Pel3. Regardless of the level of structural similarity of the considered Fn3 domains, their sequence identity is low (less than 15% for the best hits) and only a few aromatic and/or hydrophobic core-forming residues are conserved across these Fn3 domains (Fig. S7). In addition, the loop/turn regions vary widely, even between the orthologous Fn3 domains of Pel3 and PelI where the sequence identity is very poor (Fig. 1B and Fig. S7). This could be consistent with the specific functions of these zones. For instance, in some eukaryotic Fn3 domains, loop regions have been shown to constitute binding sites for cognate protein partners (34Kavran J.M. Ward M.D. Oladosu O.O. Mulepati S. Leahy D.J. All mammalian Hedgehog proteins interact with cell adhesion molecule, down-regulated by oncogenes (CDO) and brother of CDO (BOC) in a conserved manner.J. Biol.

Biol. 2015; 22: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Comparison of the three monomer structures of Pel3 observed in the different crystals shows that loop 3 of Fn3, located between strands βC and βC’, adopts distinct conformations depending on the intra- and intermolecular contacts. Notably, in the Pel32m monomer A, no electronic density corresponding to loop 3 could be detected, indicating that it is completely disordered (Fig. 4A). However, monomer B presents a well-structured loop with a 310-helix (Fig. 4B). The helix seems to be stabilized by Q59, which is sandwiched between two tryptophan residues, W89 from the same monomer B and W89∗ from monomer A. A similar conformation with a 310-helix is observed in Pel31m, where loop 3 is stabilized, by two hydrogen bonds, with another monomer and by a polar-π interaction between Q59 and W89 in the same monomer (Fig. 4C and Fig. S8B). Interestingly, a similar cation–π interaction is observed in the crystal of PelI, where R60 interacts with W87 and the loop 3 Fn3 is neatly ordered in a 310-helix (Fig. S8A). In PelI, the 310-helix is additionally stabilized by a salt bridge between D58 and K328∗, as well by a hydrogen bond between N56 and Y325∗. Since the loop 3 of Fn3 has been shown to interact with the cognate T2SS (21Pineau C. Guschinskaya N. Robert X. Gouet P. Ballut L. Shevchik V.E. Substrate recognition by the bacterial type II secretion system: More than a simple interaction.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 94: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that such transient interactions with the T2SS components could play a similar structuring role during the Pel3/PelI recruitment by the secretion system. The two domains of Pel3 form a closed structure with a buried surface area of 880 Å2 stabilized by a series of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions (Fig. S9). The Fn3 side of the interdomain interface includes several residues of strands βA, βB, and βE. On the CD side of the interface, the residues Asn166, Asn189, and Asn243 form a “Velcro”-like motif that offers a series of ionic and polar groups stabilizing the Fn3/CD interface. These residues form the turns T2 at coils 2, 3, and 5 of the β-helix, and they are well conserved among the PL-3 family members as a part of an Asn stacking (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2). In Pel3 and PelI, the Fn3 domain covers these residues of the CD until the protein is secreted from the periplasm by the T2SS. Once secreted in planta, the Fn3 domain of Pel3/PelI is cleaved off from the catalytic domain by the bacterial proteases (37Shevchik V.E. Boccara M. Vedel R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Processing of the pectate lyase PelI by extracellular proteases of Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar compact organization is observed for PelI, with an interdomain buried contact surface of 750 Å2 (Fig. S9). The interdomain interface has a similar orientation in Pel3 and PelI and most interacting residue pairs are conserved, though some specific contacts are more prominent in PelI. For instance, a salt bridge K29/E190 is present in the PelI interface but absent in Pel3 (Fig. S9). These subtle differences in organization of the interface cause some displacements of the Fn3 and CD domains relative to each other, in the Pel3 and PelI core structures. Indeed, when superimposing the catalytic domains of Pel3 and PelI, their respective Fn3 domains and, more specifically, the loops 3 and 5 are obviously shifted (Fig. 3A). Since the loop 3 of Fn3 has been previously identified as a key secretion signal, these differences could, in turn, affect recognition of the protein by the T2SS. Comparison of Pel3 and PelI revealed that their core structures composed of β-strands are highly conserved, whereas the arrangement of several extended loop regions of both Fn3 and CD varies significantly (Fig. 3A). To examine whether these regions could act as specific secretion signals, first, we systematically substituted these zones of Fn3 Pel3 with those from PelI and then assessed secretion of the generated hybrids in D. dadantii. As was expected from the previous study (21Pineau C. Guschinskaya N. Robert X. Gouet P. Ballut L. Shevchik V.E.

Knowing that the amino acid glutamine is a physiological regulator of gluconeogenesis, whereas cystine promotes adiposity, herein we investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with glutamine and cystine on the serum biochemical parameters of piglets fed on amino acid-enriched diets, as well as on the transcriptional profile of membrane water and glycerol channels aquaporins (AQPs) in the ileum portion of the small intestine and its impact on intestinal permeability. Twenty male piglets with an initial body weight of 8.8 ± 0.89 kg were allocated to four dietary treatments (n = 5) and received, during a four week-period, a basal diet without supplementation (control) or supplemented with 8 kg/ton of glutamine (Gln), cystine (Cys) or the combination of the two amino acids in equal proportions (Gln + Cys). Most biochemical parameters were found improved in piglets fed Gln and Cys diet. mRNA levels of AQP3 were found predominant over the others. Both amino acids, individually or combined, were responsible for a consistent downregulation of AQP1 , AQP7 and AQP10 , without impacting on water permeability. Conversely, Cys enriched diet upregulated AQP3 enhancing basolateral membranes glycerol permeability and downregulating glycerol kinase ( GK ) of intestinal cells. Altogether, our data reveal that amino acids dietary supplementation can modulate intestinal AQPs expression and unveil AQP3 as a promising target for adipogenesis regulation."

Mutations in HMX1 are linked to an ocular defect termed Oculo-auricular syndrome of Schorderet-Munier-Franceschetti (MIM #612109). We identified UHRF1 as a target of HMX1 during development. UHRF1 and its partner proteins actively regulate chromatin modifications and cellular proliferation. Luciferase assays and in situ hybridization analyses showed that HMX1 exerts a transcriptional inhibitory effect on UHRF1 and a modification of its expression pattern. Overexpression of hmx1 in hsp70-hmx1 zebrafish increased uhrf1 expression in the cranial region, while mutations in the hmx1 dimerization domains reduced uhrf1 expression. Moreover, the expression level of uhrf1 and its partner dnmt1 was increased in the eye field in response to hmx1 overexpression. These results indicate that hmx1 regulates uhrf1 expression and, potentially through regulating the expression of factors involved in DNA methylation, contribute to the development of the craniofacial region of zebrafish."

Research has exploited the science of networks to explain the resilience of complex systems against random attacks, malicious attacks, and the localized attacks induced by natural disasters or mass attacks. Little is known about the elucidation of system recovery by the network topology. This study adds to the knowledge of network resilience by examining the nexus of recoverability and network topology. We establish a new paradigm for identifying the recovery behavior of networks and introduce the recoverability measure. Results indicate that the recovery response behavior and the recoverability measure are the function of both size and topology of networks. In small sized networks, the return to recovery exhibits homogeneous recovery behavior over topology, while the return shape is dispersed with an increase in the size of network. A network becomes more recoverable as connectivity measures of the network increase, and less recoverable as accessibility measures of network increase. Overall, the results not only offer guidance on designing recoverable networks, but also depict the recovery nature of networks deliberately following a disruption. Our recovery behavior and recoverability measure has been tested on 16 distinct network topologies. The relevant recovery behavior can be generalized based on our definition for any network topology recovering deliberately."

We explored how people would view the causes of ethnic stereotypes in contexts where human genetic variability was either emphasized or downplayed. In two studies with over 1600 participants we found that people viewed ethnic stereotypes to be more of a function of underlying genetics after they read an article describing how ancestry can be estimated by geographic distributions of gene frequencies than after reading an article describing how relatively homogeneous the human genome was or after reading a control essay. Moreover, people were more likely to attribute ethnic stereotypes to genes when they scored higher on a measure of genetic essentialism or when they had less knowledge about genes. Our understanding of stereotypes is a function of our understanding of genetics."

Using the valuation methods of market pricing, cost replacement, and two benefit transfer approaches (with adjustment and with meta-analysis), the value of 13 ES from five ecosystems (forests, wetlands, croplands, prairies and grasslands, and freshwater systems) was measured. The annual economic value of these 13 ES amounts to an average of 332 million dollars, and to a total economic value of over 5 billion dollars, annualized over 20 years. The largest part of this value is generated by nonmarket ES, indicating that much more emphasis should be put on the management, preservation, and understanding of processes that make up these types of ES. The work generated as part of this study is a first step towards operationalizing the concept of ES in planning. More specifically, these results can be used to raise awareness, but also as a stepping stone to improve ecosystem-wide planning in the Canada’s Capital Region."

However, the restriction of inflammatory and immune responses by IL-10 can also favor the development and/or persistence of chronic infections or neoplasms. Dogs that succumb to canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by L . infantum develop exhaustion of T lymphocytes and are unable to mount appropriate cellular immune responses to control the infection. These animals fail to mount specific lymphoproliferative responses and produce interferon gamma and TNF-alpha that would activate macrophages and promote destruction of intracellular parasites. Blocking IL-10 signaling may contribute to the treatment of CanL. In order to obtain a tool for this blockage, the present work endeavored to identify the canine casIL-10R1 amino acid sequence, generate a recombinant baculovirus chromosome encoding this molecule, which was expressed in insect cells and subsequently purified to obtain rcasIL-10R1.

https://openalex.org/W3124882445,"Malaria is a potentially life-threatening disease with approximately half of the world’s population at risk. Young children and pregnant women are hit hardest by the disease. B cells and antibodies are part of an adaptive immune response protecting individuals continuously exposed to the parasite. An infection with Plasmodium falciparum can cause dysregulation of B cell homeostasis, while antibodies are known to be key in controlling symptoms and parasitemia. BAFF is an instrumental cytokine for the development and maintenance of B cells. Pregnancy alters the immune status and renders previously clinically immune women at risk of severe malaria, potentially due to altered B cell responses associated with changes in BAFF levels. In this prospective study, we investigated the levels of BAFF in a malaria-endemic area in mothers and their infants from birth up to 9 months. We found that BAFF-levels are significantly higher in infants than in mothers. BAFF is highest in cord blood and then drops rapidly, but remains significantly higher in infants compared to mothers even at 9 months of age. We further correlated BAFF levels to P . falciparum- specific antibody levels and B cell frequencies and found a negative correlation between BAFF and both P . falciparum -specific and total proportions of IgG + memory B cells, as well as CD27 − memory B cells, indicating that exposure to both malaria and other diseases affect the development of B-cell memory and that BAFF plays a part in this.

https://openalex.org/W3125167371,"Background Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with large-vessel occlusion within 6 h of symptom onset to treatment initiation (OTP). Recent trials have extended the therapeutic time window for MT to within 24 h. However, MT treatment remains low in remote areas. Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan has many inhabited islands with no neurointerventionalists. Our hospital on the mainland is a regional hub for eight island hospitals. We evaluated clinical outcomes of MT for patients with AIS on these islands versus on the mainland. Methods During 2014–2019, we reviewed consecutive patients with AIS who received MT at our hospital. Patients comprised the Islands group and Mainland group. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between groups. Results We included 91 patients (Islands group: 15 patients, Mainland group: 76 patients). Seven patients (46.7%) in the Islands group versus 43 (56.6%) in the Mainland group achieved favorable outcomes. Successful recanalization was obtained in 11 patients (73.3%) on the islands and 67 (88.2%) on the mainland. The median OTP time in the Islands was 365 min. In both the Islands and Mainland groups, the OTP time and successful recanalization were associated with functional outcome. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days ≤2 was obtained in two patients and mRS = 3 in four patients among eight patients with OTP time &gt;6 h. Conclusions Few patients with AIS on remote islands have received MT. Although patients who underwent MT on the islands had longer OTP, the clinical outcomes were acceptable. OTP time on remote islands must be shortened, as this is related to functional outcome. In some cases with successful recanalization, a favorable outcome can still be obtained even after 6 h. Even if OTP exceeds 6 h, it is desirable to appropriately select patients and actively perform MT."
https://openalex.org/W3125652426,"Precision point positioning (PPP) is widely used in maritime navigation and other scenarios because it does not require a reference station. In PPP, the satellite clock bias (SCB) cannot be eliminated by differential, thus leading to an increase in positioning error. The prediction accuracy of SCB has become one of the key factors restricting positioning accuracy. Although International GNSS Service (IGS) provides the ultra-rapid ephemeris prediction part (IGU-P), its quality and real-time performance can not meet the practical application. In order to improve the accuracy of PPP, this paper proposes to use the Prophet model to predict SCB. Specifically, SCB sequence is read from the observation part in the ultra-rapid ephemeris (IGU-O) released by IGS. Next, the SCB sequence between adjacent epochs are subtracted to obtain the corresponding SCB single difference sequence. Then using the Prophet model to predict SCB single difference sequence. Finally, the prediction result is substituted into the PPP positioning observation equation to obtain the positioning result. This paper uses the final ephemeris (IGF) published by IGS as a benchmark and compares the experimental results with IGU-P. For the selected four satellites, compared with the results of the IGU-P, the accuracy of SCB prediction of the model in this paper is improved by about 50.3%, 61.7%, 60.4%, and 48.8%. In terms of PPP positioning results, we use Real-time kinematic (RTK) measurements as a benchmark in this paper. Positioning accuracy has increased by 26%, 35%, and 19% in the N, E, and U directions, respectively. The results show that the Prophet model can improve the performance of PPP."
https://openalex.org/W3098090378,"The mammalian apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3 or A3) family of cytidine deaminases restrict viral infections by mutating viral DNA and impeding reverse transcription. To overcome this antiviral activity, most lentiviruses express a viral accessory protein called the virion infectivity factor (Vif), which recruits A3 proteins to cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases such as cullin-5 (Cul5) for ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Although Vif proteins from primate lentiviruses such as HIV-1 utilize the transcription factor core-binding factor subunit beta as a noncanonical cofactor to stabilize the complex, the maedi-visna virus (MVV) Vif hijacks cyclophilin A (CypA) instead. Because core-binding factor subunit beta and CypA are both highly conserved among mammals, the requirement for two different cellular cofactors suggests that these two A3-targeting Vif proteins have different biochemical and structural properties. To investigate this topic, we used a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo A3 degradation assays to study motifs required for the MVV Vif to bind zinc ion, Cul5, and the cofactor CypA. Our results demonstrate that although some common motifs between the HIV-1 Vif and MVV Vif are involved in recruiting Cul5, different determinants in the MVV Vif are required for cofactor binding and stabilization of the E3 ligase complex, such as the zinc-binding motif and N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Results from this study advance our understanding of the mechanism of MVV Vif recruitment of cellular factors and the evolution of lentiviral Vif proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3117252415,"For most G protein-coupled receptors, the third intracellular loop (IL3) and carboxy-terminal tail (CT) are sites for G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation, leading to β-arrestin binding and agonist-specific desensitization. These regions of bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) are extremely short compared with the superfamily, and their function in desensitization is unknown. TAS2R14 expressed on human airway smooth muscle cells relax the cell, suggesting a novel target for bronchodilators. To assess IL3 and CT in agonist-promoted TAS2R14 desensitization (tachyphylaxis), we generated fusion proteins of both the WT sequence and Ala substituted for Ser/Thr in the IL3 and CT sequences. In vitro, activated GRK2 phosphorylated WT IL3 and WT CT proteins but not Ala-substituted forms. TAS2R14s with mutations in IL3 (IL-5A), CT (CT-5A), and in both regions (IL/CT-10A) were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. IL/CT-10A and CT-5A failed to undergo desensitization of the intracellular calcium response compared with WT, indicating that functional desensitization by GRK phosphorylation is at residues in the CT. Desensitization of TAS2R14 was blocked by GRK2 knockdown in human airway smooth muscle cells. Receptor:β-arrestin binding was absent in IL/CT-10A and CT-5A and reduced in IL-5A, indicating a role for IL3 phosphorylation in the β-arrestin interaction for this function. Agonist-promoted internalization of IL-5A and CT-5A receptors was impaired, and they failed to colocalize with early endosomes. Thus, agonist-promoted functional desensitization of TAS2R14 occurs by GRK phosphorylation of CT residues and β-arrestin binding. However, β-arrestin function in the internalization and trafficking of the receptor also requires GRK phosphorylation of IL3 residues."

In this paper, we examine whether engagement with an online neo-Nazi forum is associated with more one-sided, “black and white” thinking. Using naturalistic language data, we examined differences in integrative complexity, a measure of the degree to which people acknowledge and reconcile conflicting ideas and viewpoints, and contrasted it with Language Style Matching, a measure of group cohesion. In a large web scraping study ( N = 1,891), we tested whether two measures of engagement and interaction with the community are associated with less complex, balanced cognition. Using hierarchical regression modeling, we found that both individuals who had been community members for longer and those who had posted more tended to show less complexity in their language, even when accounting for mean differences between individuals. However, these differences in integrative complexity were distinct from group cohesion, which actually decreased with our measures of engagement. Despite small effect sizes, these findings indicate that ideologically extreme online communities may exacerbate the views of their members and contribute to ever-widening polarized cognitions."

The objective of this study was to investigate the change in and the variation of the proportion, density, growth, and dominance of longleaf pine across the longleaf pine ecosystems for the 1997–2018 period. We used two sets of measurements of 1,432 plots from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset covering the entire current longleaf pine range. The relationship between disturbances and longleaf pine basal area ratio and basal area growth were analyzed using linear mixed modeling. Change detection maps were produced using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. The total basal area and aboveground biomass per hectare increased in 64% and 72%, but decreased in 30% and 28% of the study area, respectively, between the first and last inventory intervals. Species richness and diversity generally decreased across the studied plots. Longleaf pine tree density and importance value percent increased during the period. However, longleaf basal area ratio and aboveground biomass ratio in the stands decreased on average by 5% during the period, although these ratios increased in some locations in southwest Georgia and near the west coast of Florida. The longleaf pine basal area ratio and aboveground biomass ratio decreased equally in 37%, and increased in 19% and 21% of the study area, respectively. There was about 79% variation in the ratio of longleaf pine basal area among plots. When compared to the natural control of no disturbance, fire disturbance was significantly associated with greater longleaf pine basal area ratio and basal area growth. Understanding the change in growth and distribution patterns of longleaf pine across its range over time is vital to restore these critical ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3122456880,"The multi-energy conversion system (MCS) plays an important role in improving the utilization of energy resources and realizing the energy transition. With the application of the new generation of information technologies, the new MCS can realize real-time information interaction, multi-energy collaboration, and real-time demand response, in which energy suppliers can intelligently motivate consumers' energy use behavior. In this paper, an MCS coupled with a cloud platform is proposed to address information explosion and data security issues. Due to the development of Internet technology, the increasing energy data, and the serious energy coupling, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to deal with the interaction between participants of the MCS. Therefore, the non-cooperative game is used to formulate the interactions between participants with the aim of maximizing the energy suppliers' profit and minimizing the customers' cost. It is proved that the game model is an ordinary game with one Nash equilibrium. The simulation was performed with a gradient projection algorithm and the results show that the proposed MCS improves energy utilization efficiency through energy conversion while ensuring consumer satisfaction, and benefits both the customers and suppliers by reducing the energy consumption cost and the peak load demand, which effectively improve the supply quality and enrich the energy consumption patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3123892943,"Autophagy is a conserved cellular process playing a role in maintenance of cellular homeostasis and response to changing nutrient conditions via degradation and recirculation of cellular redundant components. Autophagy-related proteins (Atg) play important function in autophagy pathway. Aedes albopictus mosquito is an effective vector transmitting multiple viruses which cause serious human diseases. Moreover, Aedes albopictus mosquito is becoming a serious threat to human health due to its widening distribution in recent years and thus worth of more research attention. It was reported that autophagy might play a role in viral infection in Aedes mosquito. To better understand the interaction between autophagy and arbovirus infection in mosquito system, it is necessary to identify autophagy pathway in the system. However, autophagy in Aedes albopictus mosquito is still poorly understood so far. We recently identified AaAtg8, the first Atg protein reported in Aedes albopictus mosquito. This work further identified twelve atg genes in Aedes albopictus mosquito. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the twelve atg genes were performed. Expression profiles of all the twelve Aaatg genes in different developmental stages and genders of Aedes albopictus mosquito were conducted. Effects of chemicals inhibiting or inducing autophagy on the levels of eight identified AaAtg proteins were examined. The function of two identified AaAtg proteins AaAtg6 and AaAtg16 and their response to arbovirus SINV infection were studied preliminarily. Taken together, this work systematically identified Aedes albopictus atg genes and provided basic information which might help to elucidate the autophagy pathway and the role of autophagy in arbovirus infection in Aedes mosquito system."
https://openalex.org/W3124140014,"To meet the SDG requirement of spatial disaggregation of indicators, several methods have been developed to generate estimates of under-five mortality at the sub-national level. The reliability of sub-national mortality estimates in children aged 5-14 with the available survey data has not been evaluated so far. We generate Admin-1 sub-national estimates of the risk of dying in children aged less than five ( 5 q 0 ) and those aged 5 to 14 years old ( 10 q 5 ). We use 96 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in 20 Sub-Saharan countries having at least 3 surveys designed to be representative at a sub-national level. The estimates account for the complex sample design of DHS and HIV-related biases in young children. A Bayesian space-time model previously developed for under-five mortality is used to smooth estimates across space and time in both age groups to reduce problems associated with data sparsity. The posterior distributions of the probability 10 q 5 are used to compute coefficients of variation and assess precision. Sufficiently precise estimates are retained to study the sub-national relationship between age-specific mortality rates ( 5 q 0 and 10 q 5 ), accounting for uncertainty in sub-national levels. Out of 1,132 space-time estimates, 62.3% are considered sufficiently precise with high heterogeneity across countries. Across all periods, sub-national estimates of mortality in children aged 0-4 are highly correlated with those in older children and young adolescents but this correlation is largely driven by the mortality decline. Within specific periods of time, it is often impossible to assess the relationship between mortality rates in the two age groups at the sub-national level, except in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia. As increased attention is devoted to survival after age 5, more research is needed to ensure that sub-national areas with specific interventions required for older children can be correctly identified."
https://openalex.org/W3124255980,"Background Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is proven to be a more specific and sensitive method for detecting pancreatic lesions. However, usefulness of EUS after pancreatectomy has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the observational capability of EUS for the remnant pancreas (RP) after pancreatectomy. Patient and methods This single-center, retrospective study enrolled 395 patients who underwent pancreatectomy at Onomichi General Hospital between December 2002 and March 2016, 45 patients who underwent EUS for RP were included for analysis. We evaluated the usefulness of EUS for RP using logistic regression analysis. Results Complete observation of the RP was done in 42 patients (93%). In the initial surgical procedure, 21 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and 24 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP). PD and DP were observed in 85% (18/21) and 100% (24/24) cases, respectively. A comparison of the detection capability of EUS and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that EUS was significantly superior to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI ( p &lt; 0.01). Eight of the 45 patients showed recurrence lesions in the RP. The median recurrence period was 33 months. Predictive factors for recurrence in the univariate and multivariate analyses were significantly different in space occupying lesion with EUS findings ( p &lt; 0.01) and elevated CA19-9( p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions EUS was able to observe the RP in almost all cases. In addition, the detection capability of EUS was significantly superior to those of CT or MRI. We recommend that all patients with RP should undergo EUS, and a longer follow-up must be performed."
https://openalex.org/W3124289852,"Mucins, the major components of salivary mucus, are large glycoproteins abundantly modified with O-glycans. Mucins present on the surface of oral tissues contribute greatly to the maintenance of oral hygiene by selectively adhering to the surfaces of microbes via mucin O-glycans. However, due to the complex physicochemical properties of mucins, there have been relatively few detailed analyses of the mechanisms controlling the expression of mucin genes and the glycosyltransferase genes involved in glycosylation. Analysis performed using supported molecular matrix electrophoresis, a methodology developed for mucin analysis, and knockout mice without the polycomb group protein Bmi-1 revealed that Bmi-1 regulates mucin levels in the submandibular gland by suppressing the expression of the mucin Smgc gene, and that Bmi-1 also regulates mucin O-glycosylation via suppression of the glycosyltransferase Gcnt3 gene in the submandibular gland."
https://openalex.org/W3124370186,"Background In low-resource regions, fibrinolytic therapy is often the only option for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients as primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often not available and patients are hardly transferred to a medical center with PCI capacity within the first 120 minutes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most frequently encountered complications of STEMI. However, the evidence for the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI patients with CKD is still limited. The aim of this study is to test whether CKD modifies the association between fibrinolytic therapy and short-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among patients with STEMI. Methods and findings This is a real-world study analyzing the data from 9508 STEMI patients (mean age: 64.0±12.4 years; male: 70.1%) in the third phase of Clinical Pathways in Acute Coronary Syndromes program (CPACS-3), which is a large study of the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in 101 county hospitals without PCI capacity in China. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 at the admission. The primary outcome is short-term MACEs, including all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Patients were recruited consecutively between October 2011 and November 2014. Out of them, 1282 patients (13.5%) were classified as having CKD. Compared with non-CKD patients, CKD patients were less likely to receive fibrinolytic therapy than non-CKD patients (26.4% vs. 38.9%, P &lt;0.001), more likely to experience a failed fibrinolytic therapy (32.8% vs. 16.9%), and had a higher risk of short-term MACEs (19.7% vs. 5.6%). After full adjustment, use of fibrinolytic therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of short-term MACEs in non-CKD patients (relative risk [RR] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76–0.99), but not in CKD patients ( P for interaction = 0.026). Further analysis stratified by the success of fibrinolysis showed that compared with patients who did not receive fibrinolytic therapy, patients with successful fibrinolysis had a lower risk of short-term MACEs that was similar between patients with (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55–0.82) and without CKD (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55–0.92), while patients with unsuccessful fibrinolysis had a similarly higher risk in CKD patients (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.09–1.43) and non-CKD patients (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13–1.50). Conclusions CKD reduced the likelihood of successful fibrinolysis and increased the risk of short-term MACEs in patients with STEMI. Attention should be paid to how to improve the success rate of fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI patients with CKD. Trial registration The CPACS-3 study was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01398228 )."
https://openalex.org/W3123917016,"To elucidate the relationship between chronic pain conditions with cast immobilization and autonomic function, we investigated the functional changes of the autonomic nervous system in conscious rats with chronic post-cast pain (CPCP) induced by a two-week cast immobilization of one hind limb. We telemetrically examined the time courses of systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and the middle-frequency (MF) component obtained from the power spectral analysis of SBP variability as a vasomotor sympathetic index. We also investigated the baroreflex sensitivity to phentolamine, an α-adrenoceptor antagonist, and the SBP and HR responses to a low ambient temperature (LT; 9.0 ± 0.2°C) exposure, a sympathetic stimulant. Rats exposed to cast immobilization exhibited mechanical allodynia lasting for at least 10 weeks after cast removal in the calf area (skin and muscle) of the bilateral hind limbs. Under resting conditions, the SBP, HR, and MF components were significantly increased during cast immobilization (all p &lt; 0.001). Following cast removal, these parameters gradually decreased and within 1 week reached lower than baseline levels, lasting for over 10 weeks. Phentolamine administration (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) significantly decreased the SBP before and during cast immobilization (before, p &lt; 0.001; during, p = 0.001) but did not lower the SBP after cast removal. The baroreflex gain after phentolamine administration, calculated as the HR increase divided by the SBP reduction, was significantly increased after cast removal ( p = 0.002). The SBP increase on LT exposure was significantly greater after cast removal than that before cast immobilization, suggesting hypersensitivity to sympathetic neurotransmitters. These results revealed that, in the CPCP model, sympathetic activation was augmented during cast immobilization, which then decreased after cast removal and remained below normal levels with persisting pain behaviors. Additionally, the responsiveness of the autonomic nervous system was impaired in the CPCP model."
