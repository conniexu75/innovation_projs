https://openalex.org/W2086110755,"Information processing by humans can be biased by their emotions — for example, anxious and depressed people tend to make negative judgements about events and to interpret ambiguous stimuli unfavourably1,2,3,4. Here we show that such a 'pessimistic' response bias can also be measured in rats that are housed in unpredictable conditions5,6. Our findings indicate that cognitive bias can be used as an indicator of affective state in animals, which should facilitate progress in animal-welfare studies."

TORC1 is responsible for a wide range of rapamycin-sensitive cellular activities and contains, in addition to Tor1p or Tor2p, two highly conserved proteins, Lst8p and Kog1p. By identifying proteins that co-purify with Tor1p, Tor2p, Lst8p, and Kog1p, we have characterized a comprehensive set of protein-protein interactions that define further the composition of TORC1 as well as TORC2. In particular, we have identified Tco89p (YPL180w) and Bit61p (YJL058c) as novel components of TORC1 and TORC2, respectively. Deletion of TOR1 or TCO89 results in two specific and distinct phenotypes, (i) rapamycin-hypersensitivity and (ii) decreased cellular integrity, both of which correlate with the presence of SSD1-d, an allele of SSD1 previously associated with defects in cellular integrity. Furthermore, we link Ssd1p to Tap42p, a component of the TOR pathway that is believed to act uniquely downstream of TORC1. Together, these results define a novel connection between TORC1 and Ssd1p-mediated maintenance of cellular integrity.

Rapamycin is an antifungal antibiotic that inhibits the action of the Tor (target of rapamycin) kinase, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase present in all eukaryotes examined to date, from yeast to humans (1Dennis P.B.

Two highly homologous Tor proteins exist in yeast, Tor1p and Tor2p, and both are inhibited by rapamycin (5Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 66: 579-591Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Treating yeast cells with rapamycin elicits a number of responses that mimic nutrient starvation, including cessation of protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, induction of autophagy, cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary, and entry into G0 (4Rhode J.R. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 66: 579-591Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Rapamycin also affects many nutrient-responsive cellular pathways and impinges upon gene expression at several levels, including transcription, translation, and protein trafficking and stability (4Rhode J.R. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 66: 579-591Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the Tor proteins act within an intracellular signaling network that controls cell growth according to nutrient availability. Downstream of Tor1p and Tor2p, many rapamycin-sensitive events are mediated by the type 2A phosphatases Pph21p and Pph22, the type 2A-related phosphatase Sit4p, and two regulatory proteins, Tap42p and Tip41p (6Di Como C.J.

In particular, these proteins have been shown to regulate the phosphorylation state and activity of distinct transcriptional regulators whose target genes are controlled by Tor (10Beck T. Hall M.N.

The precise mechanism by which these phosphatases and their regulators respond to Tor remains poorly understood, however, and is likely to be quite complex (9Düvel K. Santhanam A. Garrett S. Schneper L. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1467-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In addition to its rapamycin-sensitive function, Tor2p also regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics during polarized cell growth in yeast (2Schmelzle T.

This Tor2p-unique function is not inhibited by rapamycin and involves signaling to components required for proper remodeling of actin at the site of bud emergence, including the Rho1p GTPase and its regulatory partners Rom2p and Sac7p (5Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 66: 579-591Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N.

This Rho1p GTPase switch functions in part by signaling to Pkc1p, the yeast homologue of mammalian protein kinase C, an upstream regulator of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TORC, TOR complex; CFW, calcifluor white; ORF, open reading frame; ts, temperature-sensitive; IEM, immunogold electron microscopy; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TORC, TOR complex; CFW, calcifluor white; ORF, open reading frame; ts, temperature-sensitive; IEM, immunogold electron microscopy; HA, hemagglutinin. cascade that includes Mpk1, one of five MAPKs in yeast (16Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.-P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is an emerging connection between this Tor2p-unique function involving Pkc1p and what has been termed the “cell integrity pathway,” whereby cell envelope and/or cell wall stability is monitored in response to osmotic and/or thermal stress (16Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.-P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Schmelzle T. Helliwell S.B. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell.

One explanation for this convergence is that the Pkc1p/MAPK cascade is important not only for actin remodeling but also for regulated synthesis of cell wall structural components, activities essential for both cell cycle-dependent polarized cell growth as well as for maintenance of cellular integrity (15Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.-P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Schmelzle T. Helliwell S.B. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Tor1p and components downstream of rapamycin-sensitive Tor signaling, including Sit4p, have also been implicated recently in Pkc1p/MAPK-mediated maintenance of cell integrity (19Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz M. Torres J. Arino J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Torres J. Di Como C.J. Herrero E. Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43495-43502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Together, these findings raise the important question concerning the extent of potential overlap and/or cross-talk between Tor1p/Tor2p shared and Tor2p-unique activities.In addition to Pkc1p, a number of other components have been shown to influence cell integrity. In particular, results from a study by Kaeberlein and Guarente (21Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 83-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that there are at least two independent pathways that operate in parallel with Pkc1p to maintain cell viability in response to challenges to cellular integrity. One pathway is defined by Mpt5p, a protein implicated previously in a variety of cellular activities, including mating pheromone responsiveness, life span extension, and resistance to environmental stress (21Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 83-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second pathway is defined by Ssd1p, which has also been implicated in several distinct processes, including intracellular signaling, membrane trafficking, Ca2+ homeostasis, and cell growth and morphogenesis (21Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 83-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How these three different pathways function to maintain cellular integrity is presently unknown, although it has been suggested that they may collaborate to control the transcription of genes required for proper plasma membrane and/or cell wall biosynthesis, potentially by converging on the MAPK cascade, in particular Mpk1p (21Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 83-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important unanswered question raised by this study is whether Tor signaling is involved in these distinct Pkc1p-independent branches of cell integrity maintenance.In addition to downstream components involved in Tor signaling, results of recent studies demonstrate that Tor1p and Tor2p act in collaboration with a number of specific interacting proteins. In particular, Hall and co-workers (22Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar) have described two distinct Tor complexes, termed TORC1 and TORC2, that are responsible for carrying out the rapamycin-sensitive Tor1p/Tor2p shared or the rapamycin-insensitive Tor2p-unique activities, respectively. TORC1 contains, in addition to either Tor1p or Tor2p, two highly conserved proteins, Kog1p and Lst8p, where mammalian homologues of these proteins have been shown to interact with and regulate the activity of mammalian Tor (23Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 24Kim D.-H.

TORC2 contains Tor2p, Lst8p, and three additional proteins, Avo1p–Avo3p (22Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Independently, we have identified Tor2p-interacting proteins and characterized what most likely corresponds to TORC2 (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that Lst8p is an interacting partner of Tor1p and, moreover, that all three proteins localize to an internal, membranous compartment that is distinct from both the plasma membrane and the vacuole (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Kaiser and co-workers (27Chen E.J. Kiaser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1-15Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have also independently demonstrated that the Tor proteins interact physically with Lst8p. Intriguingly, these authors made the additional observation that several mutations in LST8 confer defects in cellular integrity, as defined by temperature-sensitive growth that is rescued by inclusion of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol in the growth medium (27Chen E.J. Kiaser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1-15Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whether these lst8 alleles perturb a Tor1p/Tor2p-shared and/or a Tor2p-unique activity, however, was not addressed in this study.Here we report a number of results that bear on the relationship between Tor signaling and maintenance of cellular integrity. By extending our previous biochemical approach of identifying proteins that associate with the Tor kinases, we have characterized two novel proteins, Tco89p and Bit61p, that represent new components of TORC1 and TORC2, respectively. We find that deletion of either TOR1 or TCO89 results in rapamycin hypersensitivity as well as in defects in cellular integrity, including temperature-sensitive growth that is rescued by sorbitol as well as increased sensitivity to calcifluor white (CFW). We find that both of these phenotypes correlate with the presence of the ssd1-d allele in our parental strain background, providing a novel connection between TORC1 and the SSD1 branch of the cell integrity pathway. Consistent with this conclusion, we demonstrate that Tap42p is also functionally linked to Ssd1p. Finally, we provide evidence that Tco89p may have an additional cellular role apart from TORC1, raising the possibility that the Tor kinases associate with partners that have distinct cellular functions.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, Media, and General Methods—Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables I and II, respectively. Genetic crosses of haploid strains, sporulation of diploid strains, and tetrad analysis were carried out as described (28Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in YPD (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or synthetic complete dextrose (SCD) medium (0.8% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, pH 5.5, 2% dextrose) supplemented with amino acids as described (29Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar). CFW was provided either as Fluostain I (Sigma) and used in SCD agar plates at 15 μg/ml (final concentration) or, alternatively, as fluorescent brightener 28 (Sigma) and used in YPD agar plates at 5 μg/ml (final concentration). Rapamycin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added to SCD and YPD agar plates at the final concentrations indicated. Sorbitol (Sigma) was added to media at a final concentration of 1.0 m. Yeast transformations were performed using a lithium acetate procedure (30Gietz R.D. Woods R.A.

Deletion strains using TRP1 or His3MX6 as selectable markers were constructed using forward and reverse primers that contained 50 base pairs (bp) corresponding to the 5′- or 3′-ends of the target ORF, followed by 20 bp corresponding to the 5′- or 3′-ends of the marker gene. TRP1 and His3MX6 were amplified from plasmids pFA6a-TRP1 and pFA6a-His3MX6, respectively (31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

Deletion strains using KanMX6 as a selectable marker were constructed using genomic DNA that was obtained from an appropriate deletion strain from Research Genetics (Invitrogen). Here PCR primers contained ∼200 bp of sequence corresponding to the 5′- or 3′-ends of the target ORF. All disruptions were verified by PCR. Tco89p and Bit61p were tagged at their carboxyl termini with multiple copies of the Myc epitope and Kog1p and Lst8p were tagged at their carboxyl termini with three copies of the HA epitope using a PCR-based gene tagging method, as described previously (26Wedaman K.P.

Primers were designed such the entire ORF as well as 400 bp upstream and downstream were amplified. The forward primer also contained a SacII site and the reverse primer contained an XmaI site to facilitate introduction of the PCR product into plasmids pRS315, pRS316, or pRS416 (33Sikorski R.S.

Plasmids expressing MPK1 were constructed in a similar manner except that primers were designed such that the entire ORF plus 600 bp upstream and downstream were amplified. In addition, the forward primer contained a BamHI site, and the reverse primer contained a ClaI site to facilitate the introduction of PCR fragments into different plasmids as described in Table II.Antibody Production—Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were produced by Washington Biotechnology, Inc. (Baltimore, MD). For this, the following dipeptide HA sequence was synthesized: CYPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPYAG. This dipeptide sequence consists of 10 amino acids of HA represented twice and contains an N-terminal cysteine for peptide conjugation. The synthesized peptide was conjugated to the carrier protein KLH, after which immunization of two New Zealand white rabbits was performed. Boosts and bleeds were carried out on one of the two rabbits, and then 60 ml of serum was affinity-purified against the dipeptide to yield ∼5 ml of purified polyclonal HA antibody at a concentration of ∼2 mg/ml. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer of the serum was 5.0 × 105, and that of the affinity-purified antibody was 1.0 × 108.Immunoffinity Purification of HA3-tagged Proteins—The following procedure is an adaptation of the purification strategy described previously for HA3-Tor2p (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The most significant modification is that use of new affinity purified polyclonal anti-HA antibody resulted in significant binding of HA-tagged proteins from whole cell extracts. Thus, in this study, we purified target proteins from these cell extracts directly, in contrast to our previous study, where we first employed cell fractionation and ammonium sulfate precipitation steps (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Accordingly, 4 liters of cells from strains expressing HA3-tagged versions of Tor1p, Tor2p, Lst8p, or Kog1p were grown in YPD to 0.5 A600/ml at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed with sterile H2O, pelleted again, and resuspended in yeast extract buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.1, 100 mm B-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Tween 20, and 150 mm KCl). Cells were again pelleted, resuspended 1:1 (w/v) in yeast extract buffer containing protease inhibitors (mixture tablet; Roche Applied Science), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride and frozen dropwise by transfer pipette into liquid nitrogen. The cell pellet was then transferred to a prechilled mortar and pestle containing liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder (∼150 strokes followed by the addition of liquid nitrogen, repeated three times). After the liquid nitrogen had boiled off, the powder that remained was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and thawed. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Extracts were then centrifuged twice at 20,000 × g for 20 min, transferring the supernatant to a new tube each time. From 4 liters of cells, we typically obtained ∼4 ml of clarified whole cell extract. The extract was then divided into 10 tubes containing ∼400 μl each and precleared by binding to 25 μl of protein A-coupled beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Each tube of cleared extract was then incubated with 5 μl of affinity-purified anti-HA polyclonal antibody and 25 μl of fresh protein A-coupled beads for 3 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Following this incubation, beads were washed five times with 1 ml of yeast extract buffer. HA3-tagged proteins were then eluted from the beads with HA dipeptide, precipitated, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—200 μl of whole cell extracts were prepared from appropriate strains expressing HA- and/or Myc-tagged proteins and combined with 3 μl of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Covance; Berkeley, CA), followed by overnight incubation (∼8 h) at 4 °C. 25 μl of protein G-coupled beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. Following five 1-ml washes with yeast extract buffer, 60 μlofSDS sample buffer was added to the washed beads, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged proteins were visualized using monoclonal anti-Myc or monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (HA.11) (Covance; Berkeley, CA), where appropriate.Synthetic Lethal Interactions between tor1 and tco89 Deletions— Strain PLY332 was transformed with pRS316, pNB100, or pPL092, and the resulting transformants were crossed with PLY330. The resulting diploid strains were then sporulated, and the resulting tetrads were analyzed. The presence of the His+ marker was used to infer the tco89Δ genotype, the Trp+ marker for tor1Δ phenotype, and the Ura+ marker for the presence of each plasmid. Viable His+ Trp+ colonies were obtained only from the cross that contained the pNB100 plasmid, and all of these were also Ura+, indicating they also contained the TOR2 plasmid. One of these isolates was then designated strain PLY365. Strain PLY365 was then transformed with either pJK4, pPL091, or pRS315, and cells were then streaked onto SCD agar plates lacking leucine and that either lacked or contained 1 mm 5-fluororotic acid.Immunogold Electron Microscopy (IEM)—IEM was performed on ultrathin cryosections as described previously (34Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Kohrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of Novel Tor1p- and Tor2p-interacting Proteins—To investigate further the composition of Tor1p- and Tor2p-containing protein complexes and to identify new potential interacting partners, we extended our previously successful approach of using three copies of the HA epitope (HA3) as an immunopurification tool to characterize these complexes (26Wedaman K.P. Reinke A. Anderson S. Yates J.I. McCaffery J.M. Powers T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1204-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we constructed yeast strains that expressed C-terminally tagged versions of Lst8p (LST8-HA3) or Kog1p (KOG1-HA3). Both st"

https://openalex.org/W1992159769,"The quantum Hall effect arises from the interplay between localized and extended states that form when electrons, confined to two dimensions, are subject to a perpendicular magnetic field1. The effect involves exact quantization of all the electronic transport properties owing to particle localization. In the conventional theory of the quantum Hall effect, strong-field localization is associated with a single-particle drift motion of electrons along contours of constant disorder potential2. Transport experiments that probe the extended states in the transition regions between quantum Hall phases have been used to test both the theory and its implications for quantum Hall phase transitions. Although several experiments3,4,5,6,7,8,9 on highly disordered samples have affirmed the validity of the single-particle picture, other experiments10,11,12 and some recent theories13,14,15 have found deviations from the predicted universal behaviour. Here we use a scanning single-electron transistor to probe the individual localized states, which we find to be strikingly different from the predictions of single-particle theory. The states are mainly determined by Coulomb interactions, and appear only when quantization of kinetic energy limits the screening ability of electrons. We conclude that the quantum Hall effect has a greater diversity of regimes and phase transitions than predicted by the single-particle framework. Our experiments suggest a unified picture of localization in which the single-particle model is valid only in the limit of strong disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2009925333,"In this communication, we examined the role of the MAP kinase pathway in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Activation of the Plk1 and MAP kinase pathways was initially evaluated in FT210 cells, which arrest at G2 phase at the restrictive temperature (39 degrees C), due to a mutation in the cdc2 gene. Previous studies had shown that these cells enter mitosis at the nonpermissive temperature upon incubation with okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor. We show that treatment of FT210 cells at 39 degrees C with okadaic acid activated Plk1, as shown by hyperphosphorylation and elevated protein kinase activity, and also induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The specific Mek inhibitor PD98059 antagonized the okadaic acid-induced activation of both Plk1 and MAP kinases. This suggests that activation of the MAP kinase pathway may contribute to the okadaic acid-induced activation of Plk1 in FT210 cells at 39 degrees C. We also found that PD98059 strongly attenuated progression of HeLa cells through mitosis, and active Mek colocalizes with Plk1 at mitotic structures. To study the potential function of the MAP kinase pathway during mitosis, RNAi was used to specifically deplete five members of this pathway (Raf1, Mek1/2, Erk1/2). Each of these five protein kinases is required for cell proliferation and survival, and depletion of any of these proteins eventually leads to apoptosis. Treatment with Mek inhibitors also inhibited cell proliferation and caused apoptosis. A dramatic increase of Plk1 activities and a moderate increase of Cdc2 activities in Raf1-depleted cells indicate that Raf1-depleted cells arrest in the late G2 or M phase. Mek1 and Erk1 depletion also caused cell cycle arrest at G2, suggesting that these enzymes are required for the G2/M transition, whereas the loss of Mek2 or Erk2 caused arrest at G1."

We hypothesized that amino acids might stimulate insulin secretion by unknown mechanisms, because the KATP channel-dependent pathway of insulin secretion is defective. We therefore investigated the effects of amino acids on insulin secretion and intracellular calcium in islets from normal and sulfonylurea receptor 1 knockout (SUR1–/–) mice. Even though SUR1–/– mice are euglycemic, their islets are considered a suitable model for studies of the human genetic defect. SUR1–/– islets, but not normal islets, released insulin in response to an amino acid mixture ramp. This response to amino acids was decreased by 60% when glutamine was omitted. Insulin release by SUR1–/– islets was also stimulated by a ramp of glutamine alone. Glutamine was more potent than leucine or dimethyl glutamate. Basal intracellular calcium was elevated in SUR1–/– islets and was increased further by glutamine. In normal islets, methionine sulfoximine, a glutamine synthetase inhibitor, suppressed insulin release in response to a glucose ramp. This inhibition was reversed by glutamine or by 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, a non-metabolizable glutamine analogue. High glucose doubled glutamine levels of islets. Methionine sulfoximine inhibition of glucose stimulated insulin secretion was associated with accumulation of glutamate and aspartate. We hypothesize that glutamine plays a critical role as a signaling molecule in amino acid- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and that β-cell depolarization and subsequent intracellular calcium elevation are required for this glutamine effect to occur.

The study of inherited disorders of insulin secretion expands our understanding of metabolism and stimulus secretion coupling in pancreatic β-cells. For example, the exploration of glucokinase diseases, which are due to activating or inactivating mutants of β-cell glucokinase, has confirmed basic concepts about this enzyme as the sensor for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) 1The abbreviations used are: GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; AASIS, amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion; SUR1, sulfonylurea receptor I; KATP channel, ATP-sensitive potassium channel; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; GS, glutamine synthetase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; PDG, phosphate-dependent glutaminase; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine; MSO, methionine sulfoximine; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; APE, atom % excess; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid.

Similarly, the elucidation of a novel hyperinsulinism syndrome associated with mild hyperammonemia and linked to overactivity the glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme (GDH-HI) has led to the identification of a prominent role of glutaminolysis in the regulation of insulin secretion (3Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Google Scholar, 4Gao Z.Y. Li G. Najafi H.

These successful studies in human biochemical genetics of insulin secretion motivated the present investigation to find an explanation for the striking clinical observation that the patients with hyperinsulinism caused by inactivating mutations of the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP-HI) (6Thornton P.S.

An additional and unexplained observation of relevance in this context is the lack of β-cell responsiveness in KATP-HI to pharmacological stimulation with leucine (6Thornton P.S. MacMullen C.

Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3724-3728Google Scholar). Sulfonylurea receptor 1 knockout (SUR1–/–) mice were designed to facilitate experimental studies of the human KATP-HI syndrome (12Shiota C. Larsson O. Shelton K.D. Shiota M. Efanov A.M. Hoy M. Lindner J. Kooptiwut S. Juntti-Berggren L. Gromada J. Berggren P.O. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37176-37183Google Scholar, 13Seghers V. Nakazaki M. DeMayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Byran J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Google Scholar). However, SUR1–/– mice do not share the hypoglycemia phenotype of the human KATP-HI syndrome. Nevertheless, isolated islets from these animals exhibit all the features expected to result from nonfunctional KATP channels, i.e. β-cell depolarization and elevation of intracellular calcium (12Shiota C. Larsson O. Shelton K.D. Shiota M. Efanov A.M. Hoy M. Lindner J. Kooptiwut S. Juntti-Berggren L. Gromada J. Berggren P.O. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

Thus, islets from SUR1 knockout mice provide a useful in vitro model to explore the mechanism of protein, i.e. amino acid hypersensitivity, and leucine refractoriness observed in KATP-HI. Study of this model also provides an opportunity to extend the understanding of the role of amino acids in modulating physiological glucose-dependent β-cell functions (14Dura E. Jijakli H. Zhang H.X. Oguzhan B. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 527-531Google Scholar). In the course of these studies, a prominent role for glutamine was identified in amino acid stimulated insulin secretion (AASIS) and also in GSIS. This glutamine effect emerges to be central for the understanding of fuel stimulated insulin release from the β-cell. Mouse Islets Preparation and Insulin Secretion—SUR1 knockout mice (SUR1–/–) were obtained from Dr. Mark A. Magnuson. The knockout procedure and genotyping were described by Shiota et al. (12Shiota C. Larsson O. Shelton K.D. Shiota M. Efanov A.M. Hoy M. Lindner J. Kooptiwut S. Juntti-Berggren L. Gromada J. Berggren P.O. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37176-37183Google Scholar). Both SUR1–/– mice and control mice (B6D2H1) were fed a standard rodent chow diet, maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and cultured for 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose. The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and the islets were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air-humidified incubator. Batches of 100 cultured mouse islets were loaded onto a nylon filter in a chamber and perifused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (115 mmol/liter NaCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.25% bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. The physiological mixture of 20 amino acids when used at a maximum concentration of 12 mm (about 3 times physiological concentration) had the following composition (in mm): glutamine 2.0, alanine 1.25, arginine 0.53, aspartate 0.11, citrulline 0.27, glutamate 0.35, glycine 0.85, histidine 0.22, isoleucine 0.27, leucine 0.46, lysine 1.06, methionine 0.14, ornithine 0.20, phenylalanine 0.23, proline 1.0, serine 1.62, threonine 0.77, tryptophan 0.21, valine 0.57. Samples were collected every minute for insulin assays. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Cytosolic Free Ca2+ Measurements—Mouse islets were isolated and cultured on poly-l-lysine coated glass coverslips under the same condition as described above. The perifusion procedure and cytosolic-free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) measurement were described previously (4Gao Z.Y. Li G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Google Scholar). In brief, the coverslip with attached islets was incubated with 15 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 5 mm glucose for 35 min at 37 °C. Islets were then perifused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 0.25% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, while various agents were applied. [Ca2+]i was measured with a dual wavelength fluorescence microscope as previously described. Studies with 15NH4Cl—Control mouse islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3–4 days as described above. Batches of 1,000 islets were first preincubated with glucose free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 60 min at 37 °C with or without 1 mm methionine sulfoximine (MSO), an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS). The islets were then incubated 120 min with either 300 μm15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) alone as control, or with additional 25 mm glucose or with 25 mm glucose plus 1 mm MSO in accordance with the pretreatment protocol. After 120 min the medium was assayed for total ammonia, amino acids, and insulin. The islets were then washed once with ice-cold glucose-free Hank's buffer, and the cellular amino acids were extracted with 6% perchloric acid. Assays of amino acids and ammonia were performed as described previously (5Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Google Scholar). The 15N enrichment of amino acids was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described previously (15Schwenk W.F. Berg P.J. Beaufrere B. Miles J.M. Haymond M.W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 101-109Google Scholar). ATP Assays—Control mouse islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3 days. Batches of 100 islets were first preincubated with glucose free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 60 min at 37 °C with or without 1 mm MSO. This pretreatment was followed by 60 min of incubation with 10 mm glucose with or without 1 mm MSO in accordance with the pretreatment protocol. Supernatants were sampled for insulin assays. ATP in the islet homogenate was measured as described previously (5Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Google Scholar) using an ATP assay kit (Enliten ATP assay kits, Promega). Western Blot Analysis of GS—Monoclonal anti-mouse GS from rabbit was used as the primary antibody (Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as a secondary antibody. A total of 25 μg of protein from cultured islets or from β-HC9 cells were used for Western blotting. GS Activity Measurements—Batches of at least 1,000 cultured islets were collected and washed with Hank's buffer. Islets were then homogenized with 0.1 m imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.1, containing 0.01 mm EDTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used to determine GS activity by the method of Meister (16Meister A. Meister A. Methods in Enzymology. 113. Academic Press Inc., New York1985: 185-199Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 0.5 ml: 50 mm sodium glutamate, 10 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 125 mm hydroxylamine, and 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of islet or cell extract, and the assay tube was then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.75 ml of FeCl3 solution (2.5% FeCl3 in 1.5 n HCl with 5% trichloroacetic acid). After centrifugation at 3,000 × g the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 535 nm. A tube containing 4 mm MSO was considered as blank. One unit of GS activity was defined as 1 μmol of l-glutamate γ-monohydroxamate formed per minute. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma except where indicated otherwise. Data Analysis—All the data are presented as mean ± S.E. The Student's t test was performed when two groups were compared. One way analysis of variances were used when multiple groups were compared. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. To determine the threshold concentration of agents for insulin secretion in ramp perifusion studies, a Student's t test was used to compare the rates of each time point with the baseline insulin secretion rates. The first point that was significantly different from baseline was considered the threshold. AASIS of SUR–/– and Control Islets—We studied the molecular basis of pancreatic β-cell hypersensitivity to amino acids that had been observed in patients with loss of function mutations of the KATP channel by perifusing isolated and cultured islets of SUR1–/– and control mice with an amino acid mixture. As shown in Fig. 1 (panel A), SUR1–/– islets responded to ramp stimulation by a physiological mixture of 20 amino acids (using an increment of 0.04 mm/min for glutamine and 0.2 mm/min for the other amino acids). Baseline insulin secretion in SUR1–/– islets was twice that of control islets. The amino acid mixture increased insulin release nearly 3-fold in SUR1–/– islets, while normal islets were not affected by this stimulus. The threshold concentrations at which amino acids induced insulin secretion in SUR1–/– islets were about 0.5 mm for glutamine and 3 mm for the 19 other amino acids, i.e. close to the physiological concentrations. The presence of 10 mm glucose did not change the response of SUR1–/– islets to the amino acid mixture (data not shown). The effects of the amino acid were also tested in the absence of glutamine, because glutaminolysis is known to increase insulin secretion. Omitting glutamine reduced the effect of the mixture by 60% (Fig. 1, panel A). As shown in panel B of Fig. 1, in the presence of 10 mm glucose, control islets showed a very sensitive concentration dependent response when stimulated with a ramp of amino acids. The threshold concentrations of amino acids were about 0.2 mm for glutamine and 1.0 mm for the other 19 amino acids when infused as a complete mixture. When glutamine was omitted, the secretory response to the remaining amino acid mixture was delayed by 10 min, and the maximum insulin release was reduced by 60% or more. These results in SUR1–/– and control mouse islets suggested a predominant role for glutamine in both AASIS and GSIS. Effects of Glutamine on Insulin Secretion of SUR1–/– and Control Islets—SUR1–/– and control islets showed striking qualitative and quantitative differences in fuel responsiveness (Fig. 2, A–D). SUR1–/–, but not control islets responded to glutamine ramp stimulation (increasing 0.5 mm/min) with a threshold of about 5 mm (Fig. 2A). A glucose ramp (increasing 0.5 mm/min) was totally ineffective in the SUR1–/– islets, but produced the expected stimulation in control islets with a threshold of 5–6 mm (Fig. 2B). A leucine ramp (increasing 0.5 mm/min) superimposed on 2 mm glutamine caused a 10-fold increase of insulin secretion in control islets, but a much less pronounced response in SUR1–/– islets (Fig. 2C). The secretion profile showed an initial dip, i.e. insulin secretion first declined but then recovered back to or slightly above baseline (difference not significant statistically). It is noteworthy that baseline insulin secretion of SUR1–/– islets was elevated in all experiments and that 2 mm glutamine augmented basal insulin release even further (2.3 ± 0.06 versus 1.7 ± 0.07 ng/100 islets/min, p < 0.01), consistent with the results of glutamine ramp stimulation. These observations were interpreted to indicate that the apparent activation of SUR1–/– islets did not reflect increased glutamine metabolism, but was a direct response to glutamine itself. This conclusion is supported by the greatly reduced leucine sensitivity. This interpretation was further strengthened by the results with a dimethyl-glutamate ramp (increasing 0.5 mm/min) as we noted an initial shallow dip of insulin secretion followed by a slight increase over baseline in SUR1–/– islets, but virtually no response in control islets (Fig. 2D). The insulin release profile of dimethyl-glutamate stimulation in SUR1–/– islets was comparable to that seen during leucine stimulation: both showed the “dip” phenomenon, apparently an expression of inhibited secretion. These results with glutamine, complemented by the lack of responsiveness to the other fuels suggested that the remarkable effects of glutamine in SUR1–/– islets were mediated neither by enhanced glutaminolysis nor via increased glutamate. Instead, the effect appeared to be the direct result of a glutamine-induced signal. A Role for Elevated [Ca2+]i in Glutamine-stimulated Insulin Secretion—SUR1–/– islets characteristically showed markedly elevated basal [Ca2+]i compared with controls (Fig. 3, panels A–D). Glutamine (10 mm) caused a transient [Ca2+]i rise in SUR1–/– but not in control islets (Fig. 3A). Glucose induced a persistent [Ca2+]i rise in control islets, and a dip in [Ca2+]i in SUR1–/– islets (Fig. 3B). Leucine (10 mm), superimposed on 10 mm basal glutamine similar with glucose caused a sustained [Ca2+]i rise in control, but not in SUR1–/– islets (data not shown). Instead, leucine caused a transient dip of the [Ca2+]i levels in SUR1–/– islets, analogous to the dip in the insulin secretion profile produced by leucine plus glutamine (Fig. 2C). These results again suggested that the glutamine effect might not depend on its metabolism. In order to further test this concept we performed studies with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), an inhibitor of glutaminase. DON (40 μm) did not affect the transient [Ca2+]i rise induced by glutamine in SUR1–/– islets (Fig. 3C). As shown in panel D of Fig. 3, in the absence of DON, the combination of glutamine and the leucine analogue 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) caused a sustained [Ca2+]i increase in control islets. This effect was completely abolished by 40 μm DON, indicating that this concentration of the inhibitor was sufficient to block the flux from glutamine to glutamate and, thus, limited the substrate for the GDH reaction. These results support the concept that glutamine can directly affect insulin release without being metabolized via glutamate. Possible Mechanism of Glutamine Effects—Further experiments were performed to understand the molecular basis of the apparently direct glutamine effect on SUR1–/– islets. Fig. 4 (panel A) shows that the mitochondrial poison, sodium azide (4 mm), did not block the glutamine induced elevation of [Ca2+]i, suggesting that the action of glutamine is independent of ATP and does not require glutamine metabolism. Thapsigargin (1 μm), which inhibits sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA), increased the basal [Ca2+]i levels in SUR1–/– islets even further, but did not interfere with the glutamine effect (Fig. 4, panel B). The calcium channel blocker verapamil (50 μm) lowered [Ca2+]i in SUR1–/– islets and inhibited the glutamine effect on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4, panel C). The glutamine effect is thus conditional: it requires functional calcium channels as well as depolarization of the β-cell. Glyburide Increases Glutamine Sensitivity of Normal β-Cells—In order to test the role of glutamine after acute depolarization, glyburide (300 nm) was used to mimic the SUR1–/– condition (Fig. 5). Glyburide depolarized β-cells and caused elevation of [Ca2+]i in control islets, as expected. Following glyburide treatment, the effects on [Ca2+]i of glutamine, the glutamine/leucine combination, and also glucose were similar to those observed in SUR1–/– islets (Fig. 5, panels A and B). Insulin secretion studies confirmed these observations (Fig. 5, panel C): glutamine augmented insulin release, whereas glucose caused a transient dip in the release profile as seen in Ca2+ studies. The glutamine effects in glyburide-depolarized islets were inhibited by the calcium channel blocker nimodipine (5 μm). These results confirmed that β-cell depolarization and elevation of [Ca2+]i are required for the direct effects of glutamine on insulin secretion to occur. Role of Glutamine in GSIS—Since elevated intracellular calcium appeared to be the critical permissive factor, sensitizing the β-cell to glutamine stimulation, exposure of islets to high glucose should also induce a glutamine responsive state. Fig. 6 shows the response of normal islets to a glutamine ramp superimposed on a sustained 10 mm glucose stimulus. Glutamine amplified the second phase of glucose stimulated insulin release about 3-fold. The threshold concentration for glutamine-induced insulin secretion was about 2 mm, which was higher than the threshold for glutamine when the other 19 amino acids were present (compare Fig. 1B and Fig. 6). We speculated that glutamine, generated endogenously in the β-cell, might play a role as a physiological co-factor in GSIS, because it could be synthesized by the enzyme GS under conditions where high glucose provides ample glutamate and ATP as substrates. To test this hypothesis we used the GS inhibitor MSO. As shown in Fig. 7 (panel A), 1 mm MSO decreased the maximal islet responsiveness to a glucose ramp (increasing 0.5 mm/min) by 70%. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a noninhibitory analogue of MSO, caused no inhibition of insulin secretion. The threshold concentration for glucose stimulation was the same for MSO treated and control islets. If the inhibitory effect of MSO on GSIS was due to decreased generation of glutamine, glutamine added back to the perifusate should reverse this inhibition. As shown in Fig. 7 (panel B), 2 and 5 mm glutamine completely reversed the MSO induced inhibition. Finally, an experiment was performed to test whether the non-metabolizable glutamine analogue DON could substitute for glutamine in reversing the MSO inhibition of GSIS. DON (40 μm) was indeed at least as effective as 5 mm glutamine. MSO did not appear to interfere with glucose metabolism, because the islet ATP content was identical after 1 h incubation with glucose (10 mm) and with or without MSO (1 mm) (Table I). However, insulin release was inhibited about 40% by MSO.Table IATP production and insulin secretionATPInsulinpmol/isletμg/100 islets/hTime 03.0 ± 0.10.03 ± 0.01G106.6 ± 1.0aCompared with time 0, p < 0.01.0.84 ± 0.09aCompared with time 0, p < 0.01.G10/MSO15.8 ± 0.70.51 ± 0.11bCompared with G10, p < 0.05.a Compared with time 0, p < 0.01.b Compared with G10, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Islets Contain Glutamine Synthetase—These studies suggested that the enzyme GS might be important for GSIS. Western blot analysis and measurement of catalytic activity of GS were performed in cultured control mouse islets, as well as β-HC9 cells. GS was clearly expressed in mouse islets and β-HC9 cells (Fig. 8). The enzyme activity in cultured mouse islets was 1.9 ± 0.2 units/mg islet protein and 3.3 ± 0.5 units/mg protein in β-HC9 cells (p < 0.01). For comparison, using the same assay, mouse brain had GS activity of 5.4 ± 0.5 units/mg protein. 15NH4Cl Flux Studies in Control Mouse Islets—Flux through GS was measured using 15NH4Cl as tracer. Batches of 1,000 control mouse islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3 days and then incubated with 15NH4Cl (300 μm) alone or with 25 mm glucose in the presence or absence of 1 mm MSO. Insulin secretion was inhibited by about 40% with 1 mm MSO present, in agreement with the perifusion studies (Table II). After 2 h of incubation, ammonia in the medium was slightly but significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by glucose, and this decrement was abolished by MSO. These results implied that during GSIS islets consumed ammonia, which probably was incorporated into glutamine. Measurements of critical amino acids in islets supported this interpretation (Table III). In the presence of high glucose cellular aspartate was decreased by 60%. In contrast, glutamine and alanine were elevated, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was lowered. Cellular glutamate remained constant. The cellular glutamine pool was small, only 1–3% of the total amino acid pool.Table IIEffects of glucose and MSO on insulin secretion and media ammonia concentrationInsulin secretionMedia ammoniaμg/1000 islets/2 hnmol/mlControl0.16 ± 0.03269 ± 6G255.41 ± 0.65ap < 0.01, compared with control.248 ± 5bp < 0.05, compared with control.(-21 ± 5)G25/MSO 13.46 ± 0.21cp < 0.05, compared with G25.272 ± 6cp < 0.05, compared with G25.(+24 ± 7)a p < 0.01, compared with control.b p < 0.05, compared with control.c p < 0.05, compared with G25.

TRP channels are implicated in a variety of physiological processes, ranging from phospholipase C- and/or store-dependent Ca2+ influx in most cell types to reabsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in kidney and intestine, and detection of chemical and thermal signals in the sensory system (1Nilius B.

This functional diversity is reflected in a wide variety of biophysical properties and gating mechanisms among the different TRP family members and subfamilies.Like voltage-gated K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, functional TRP channels are homo- and/or heteromers of four subunits, each containing six transmembrane (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium; MTSES, methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; WT, wild type; MA+, methylammonium; DMA+, dimethylammonium; NMDG+, N-methyl-d-glucamine; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; DVF, divalent cation-free; TriMA+, trimethylammonium; TetMA+, tetramethylammonium. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium; MTSES, methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; WT, wild type; MA+, methylammonium; DMA+, dimethylammonium; NMDG+, N-methyl-d-glucamine; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; DVF, divalent cation-free; TriMA+, trimethylammonium; TetMA+, tetramethylammonium. domains, cytoplasmic N and C termini, and a putative pore region between TM5 and TM6 (7Hoenderop J.G.

However, in comparison with most other ion channel families, little is known about the structure of TRP channels, and the structural organization of their cation-selective pores is still poorly understood (8Voets T. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is a striking variability in the permeation properties within the TRP superfamily, which includes channels that are rather non-selective for mono- and divalent cations (e.g. TRPV1) (9Caterina M.J.

This variability contrasts with most other families of ion channels, where the differences in permeation properties within one family are generally small (15Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). At present, the origin of these large differences in pore properties within the TRP superfamily is fully unknown.The present study provides the first systematic analysis of the pore region of a member of the TRP superfamily. We focused on TRPV6, a channel that has been implicated in Ca2+ reabsorption in the intestine and kidney (16Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 729-740Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which is an especially interesting model channel for two reasons. First, together with the highly homologous TRPV5, it displays by far the highest Ca2+ selectivity reported for a TRP channel (12Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H.

(Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The permeability ratio for Ca2+ over Na+ of >100 reported for TRPV5 and TRPV6 is comparable only to that of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and the calcium release-activated calcium channel (CRAC) (15Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 17Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Second, a stretch of 20 amino acids between TM5 and TM6 of TRPV6 displays ∼40% sequence identity with a region in the bacterial K+ channel KcsA that, based on the KcsA crystal structure (18Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5688) Google Scholar), forms the pore helix and selectivity filter. Such a high degree of sequence identity with K+-selective pores is only seen for members of the TRPV subfamily (8Voets T. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and might point toward similarities in the structure of TRP and K+ channels. Two distinct approaches were used to obtain insight in the TRPV6 pore. First, we measured the permeability of the channel to cations of increasing size to estimate of the diameter of the channel pore at its narrowest point, and we identified mutants with altered pore diameter. Second, we made use of the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (19Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) to identify pore-lining residues. Based on our findings, we propose a structural model that encompasses the position of residues determining the cation, size, and Ca2+ selectivity of the TRPV6 pore.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Mutagenesis—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. They were transiently transfected with the pCINeo/IRES-GFP/mCaT1 vector (14Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol.

Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and electrophysiological recordings were performed between 8 and 24 h after transfection. Single amino acids in the pore region of TRPV6 were mutated to cysteines using the standard PCR overlap extension technique (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar), and the nucleotide sequences of all mutants were verified by sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs.Coexpression of mutant and WT TRPV6 was obtained by mixing the corresponding vector DNAs in a 3 to 1 ratio. Assuming a random assembly of WT and mutant subunits, we predict that >99% of the tetrameric channels that are formed under these conditions contain at least one mutant subunit (7Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As under this condition no functional expression could be obtained for mutants L537C, D541C, and Y546C, we also tried other ratios of WT and mutant vector DNAs (1 to 1 and 1 to 3). However, this also did not yield any evidence for the incorporation of these three mutant subunits into a functional channel.Electrophysiology—Transfected cells were identified by their green fluorescence when illuminated at 480 nm using the polychrome IV monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics, GmbH). Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature (20–25 °C), using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronics). Patch pipettes had DC resistances of 2–4 megohms when filled with intracellular solution. Series resistances were between 3 and 10 megohms and were compensated 60–80%. Residual voltage errors due to uncompensated series resistances were generally <10 mV, and cells with larger voltage errors were omitted from the analysis. All potentials were corrected for possible liquid junction potentials, which were calculated according to Barry (22Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). A 200-ms voltage ramp ranging from -150 to +100 mV was applied at a frequency of 0.5 Hz from a holding potential of 0 mV. Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2.9 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter. The time course of the whole-cell current was obtained by averaging the inward current in a narrow voltage window around -80 mV. Current amplitudes in divalent cation-free solution (see below) measured in cells expressing WT TRPV6 or the different functional mutants used in this study were on average approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger (between 3 and 30 nA at -80 mV) than the background current in non-transfected cells (-73 ± 8pAat -80 mV; n = 9). For that reason, background currents were not taken into account during analysis.Solutions—The standard divalent cation-free (DVF) extracellular solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 10 EDTA and 10 Hepes, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The permeability of ammonium and its mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramethyl substituents was tested using DVF solutions in which all Na+ was substituted by the respective cations. In these permeation experiments, the standard DVF solution was used as intracellular solution. To test the accessibility of substituted cysteines, MTSEA, MTSET, or MTSES (Toronto Research Chemicals) was added to the standard DVF solution from 100 mm stocks, which were prepared daily and kept on ice until usage. Because of the low solubility of AgCl, modification by Ag+ was tested in a modified, Cl--free DVF solution, which contained 150 mm NaNO3 instead of NaCl. AgNO3 was added to this solution at concentrations of 1 or 10 μm, which yields free Ag+ concentrations of 20 or 200 nm, respectively, taking into account the chelating action of EDTA. The intracellular solution for the cysteine modification experiments contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 EGTA and 10 Hepes, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. When indicated, this solution was supplemented with 10 mm cysteine.Data Analysis—Data analysis and display were done by using Microcal Origin software version 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation). Data are shown as mean ± S.E. from at least four cells.RESULTSDetermination of the Pore Diameter of WT TRPV6 and Location of the Narrowest Part of the Pore—To estimate the diameter of the TRPV6 permeation pore, we measured the relative permeability of organic monovalent cations of increasing size. These experiments were performed with EDTA-buffered divalent-free intra- and extracellular solutions to avoid the potent blocking of monovalent currents by Mg2+ and Ca2+ (14Hoenderop J.G.

Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which would complicate accurate measurement of the reversal potential. With Na+ as the sole intra- and extracellular cation, TRPV6 currents reversed close to 0 mV and showed significant inward rectification, which has been shown previously to be an intrinsic property of the pore (24Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Subsequently, all Na+ in the extracellular solution was replaced by ammonium or its mono-, di-, tri-, or tetramethyl substituents (Fig. 1A). Clear inward currents were recorded with ammonium (A+; diameter (a) = 3.4 Å), monomethylammonium (MA+; a = 3.6 Å), and dimethylammonium (DMA+; a = 4.6 Å). We determined permeability ratios relative to Na+ (PX/PNa) from the biionic reversal potentials (15Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar), which yielded values of 1.63 ± 0.07, 0.49 ± 0.03, and 0.09 ± 0.01 for A+, MA+, and DMA+, respectively. Trimethylammonium (TriMA+; a = 5.2 Å) and tetramethylammonium (TetMA+; a = 5.8 Å) failed to carry significant inward current and shifted the reversal potential to voltages more negative than -120 mV, indicating that the permeability of the channel to these cations is extremely low or zero (PX/PNa < 0.01). A similar negative reversal potential was obtained with the even larger N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+; a = 6.8 Å) as the sole extracellular cation.It has been shown previously that the high Ca2+ and Mg2+ sensitivity of TRPV5 and TRPV6 is determined by a single aspartate residue (Asp542 in TRPV5 and Asp541 in TRPV6) in the pore region between TM5 and TM6 (24Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1020-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As this negatively charged residue is most likely part of the selectivity filter, we tested whether mutations at this site influence the permeability of TRPV6 for large organic cations. Fig. 1B shows current-voltage relations with different extracellular monovalent cations for a mutant channel in which Asp541 was substituted by an alanine (D541A). In contrast to wild type TRPV6, the D541A mutant supported clear inward currents carried by TriMA+ and TetMA+. From the reversal potentials, we obtained PX/PNa values of 0.22 ± 0.02 and 0.08 ± 0.01 for TriMA+ and TetMA+, respectively. Likewise, introducing a glycine at this position (mutant D541G) also made the pore permeable to TriMA+ and TetMA+, with PX/PNa values of 0.27 ± 0.03 and 0.15 ± 0.02, respectively. Both D541A and D541G displayed negligible permeability to NMDG+ (PNMDG/PNa < 0.01). Introduction of an asparagine at this position (mutant D541N) did not significantly alter the permeability of the channel to the ammonium derivatives; TriMA+ and TetMA+ did not display measurable permeability, whereas the PX/PNa values for A+, MA+, and DMA+ were not significantly different from WT TRPV6 (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1D plots the permeability ratios of the different cations versus their estimated diameter for WT TRPV6 and the D541A, D541G, and D541N mutants. Data points were fitted using the excluded volume Equation 1 (26Dwyer T.M. Adams D.J. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1980; 75: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), PX/PNa=k(1-a/d)2/a(Eq. 1) where a is the cation diameter, and d the minimal pore diameter. The fit yielded a pore diameter of 5.4 Å for WT TRPV6. The same value was found for the D541N mutant, whereas significantly larger pore diameter estimates of 6.4 and 6.6 Å were obtained for the D541A and D541G mutants, respectively. Thus, replacement of Asp541 by an alanine or glycine, which have a shorter side chain, induces an apparent enlargement of the pore diameter by ∼1 Å. Replacement by an asparagine, whose side chain is of similar length as that of an aspartate, does not influence the pore diameter. These data demonstrate that Asp541 is an important determinant of the molecular sieving properties of TRPV6 and indicate that the amino acid side chain at this position contributes to the narrowest part of the selectivity filter.Accessibility of the Pore Region to Ag+—Next, we performed a SCAM analysis to identify amino acids accessible to extracellularly applied water-soluble cysteine reagents. We concentrated on residues Pro526 to Ala547 in the TM5-TM6 linker (Fig. 2), as this stretch of amino acids displays the highest degree of sequence homology with the bacterial K+ channel KcsA, in a region that forms the pore helix and selectivity filter. Cysteine substitutions were well tolerated in the region between Pro526 and Ile539; with the exception of L537C, all mutants in this region functionally expressed as Ca2+-selective channels and became permeable to monovalent cations upon omission of extracellular divalent cations. Mutants N545C and N547C also expressed as a functional cation channel. In contrast, mutants with cysteines introduced at positions 540–544 and 546 were non-functional.Fig. 2Alignment of the putative pore region of TRPV6 with the pore region of the K+ channel KcsA. Identical and conserved residues are marked with asterisks or dots, respectively. Regions that constitute the pore helix and selectivity filter in the KcsA crystal structure (18Doyle D.A.

Accession numbers for mouse TRPV6 and KcsA (from Streptomyces lividans) are CAD62684 and S60172, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We first tested the functional cysteine mutants for their sensitivity to extracellularly applied Ag+. Chemically, Ag+ is a soft Lewis acid that reacts rapidly with the thiolate group of the cysteine side chain to form a strong covalent S–Ag bond (27Dance I.G. Polyhedron. 1986; 8: 1037-1104Crossref Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The diameter of Ag+ (a = 2.52 Å) is between that of Na+ (a = 1.90 Å) and K+ (a = 2.66 Å), two cations that readily permeate TRPV6 in the absence of extracellular divalent cations, suggesting that Ag+ can access the narrowest parts of the pore. We could discriminate four different types of Ag+ sensitivity. First, monovalent currents through wild type TRPV6 (Fig. 3A) and certain mutants (e.g. F536C; Fig. 3B) were virtually insensitive, showing less than 5% change in current amplitude after 200 s of treatment with 200 nm Ag+. Second, mutants such as S531C (Fig. 3C) reacted rapidly with Ag+ at a concentration of only 20 nm, resulting in a full block of monovalent currents within 10 s. Third, mutants such as L535C (Fig. 3D) clearly reacted with Ag+ but at a much slower rate. Finally, mutants P526C and M527C (Fig. 3E) displayed a clear biphasic response to Ag+.Fig. 3Effect of extracellular Ag+ on WT TRPV6 and cysteine mutants. A–F, time course of the inward current at -80 mV showing the effect of the indicated concentrations of free Ag+ on the whole-cell current through WT TRPV6 and the indicated cysteine mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to obtain functional expression of the silent cysteine mutants, we coexpressed them together with WT TRPV6. This approach has previously been successfully used to obtain functional Shaker K+ channels with cysteines introduced at critical sites in the pore (28Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). No sizeable currents could be measured from cells coexpressing WT TRPV6 and either L537C, D541C, or Y546C, indicating that cysteines introduced at these positions have a dominant negative effect on channel activity. Alternatively, these mutants might somehow interfere with the targeting of functional channels to the plasma membrane. In contrast, robust currents could be measured from cells expressing WT TRPV6 together with the four other silent mutants (I540C, G542C, P543C, and A544C). In all four cases, these currents were sensitive to Ag+ (e.g. A544C; Fig. 3F), demonstrating the reaction between Ag+ and cysteine residues in the context of a functional heterotetrameric channel consisting of both WT and mutant subunits.Fig. 4A summarizes the inhibitory effects of Ag+ on whole-cell currents through WT TRPV6 and the different mutant channels. To further quantify the reactivity of the introduced cysteines, we calculated the second-order reaction rate constant for inhibition by Ag+ according to Equation 2, kAg=1/([Ag+]×τ)(Eq. 2) where τ is the time constant obtained by fitting an exponential function to the time course of current inhibition by Ag+ (Fig. 4B). Two kAg values are shown for P526C and M527C, corresponding to the fast and slow phase of Ag+ inhibition. For mutants that did not show significant inhibition after treatment with 200 nm Ag+ for 200 s, kAg was set to zero. Note that the fastest rates (>107m-1 s-1) may be an underestimate of the actual reaction speed, as ∼1 s was needed to fully replace the bathing solution surrounding the patch-clamped cell with Ag+-containing solution.Fig. 4Summary of the Ag+ reactivity of TRPV6 cysteine mutants. A, percentage inhibition of the inward Na+ current through WT TRPV6 and the indicated mutants after exposure to 200 nm free Ag+ for 200 s. Dashed bars indicate mutants that only yielded currents when coexpressed with WT TRPV6. Question marks indicate cysteine mutants that failed to express as functional ion channels. Inhibition by Ag+ was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in all cases, except for WT, L529C, T532C, and F536C. B, reaction rates for the modification of the different mutant channels by Ag+. Two reaction rates are indicated for mutants P526C and M527C, reflecting the double exponential time course of Ag+ block. C, helical wheel representation of residues Pro526 to Thr538, assuming a classical α-helix with 3.6 residues per turn. Filled circles correspond to residues at which substituted cysteine reacts rapidly with Ag+ (reaction rate >5 × 106m-1 s-1); half-open circles correspond to less reactive substituted cysteines (reaction rate <5 × 106m-1 s-1), and open circles correspond to non-reactive substituted cysteines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the crystal structure of KcsA, residues 63–75 form an α-helical structure, which constitutes the pore helix (18Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5688) Google Scholar). Fig. 4C shows a helical wheel representation of the corresponding residues in TRPV6 (Pro526 to Thr538), assuming a classical α-helical structure with 3.6 amino acids per turn. Strikingly, all residues that rapidly react with Ag+ are on the same side of the helix, whereas the non-exposed residues are clustered on the opposite side. From these data we infer that residues Pro526 to Thr538 form an α-helical pore helix.Accessibility of the Pore Region to Cationic MTS Reagents— The positively charged MTSEA and MTSET attach, respectively, -SCH2CH2NH)3+ or -SCH2CH2N(CH3)3+ groups to free sulfhydryls (19Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). MTSEA and MTSET have a more or less cylindrical shape and contain polar heads that are 3.6 and 5.8 Å in diameter, respectively. To investigate the accessibility of substituted cysteines residues in the pore region to these larger modifying agents, we applied MTSEA and MTSET to the bath solution and looked for modification of the monovalent current through WT TRPV6 and the different cysteine mutants.Currents through WT TRPV6 (not shown) and certain mutants (e.g. F536C; Fig. 5A) were virtually insensitive to MTSEA or MTSET, showing less than 5% change in current amplitude after 200 s of treatment with 1 mm of these reagents. Other mutants (e.g. F530C; Fig. 5B) reacted rapidly with both MTSEA and MTSET, resulting in a complete and irreversible block of the current. Fig. 5E"

We performed a systematic investigation of the effect of urea-induced structural perturbations on the mechanism of fibrillation of insulin. The addition of as little as 0.5 m urea to zinc-bound hexameric insulin led to dissociation into dimers. Moderate concentrations of urea led to accumulation of a partially unfolded dimer state, which dissociates into an expanded, partially folded monomeric state. Very high concentrations of urea resulted in an unfolded monomer with some residual structure. The addition of even very low concentrations of urea resulted in increased fibrillation. Accelerated fibrillation correlated with population of the partially folded intermediates, which existed at up to 8 m urea, accounting for the formation of substantial amounts of fibrils under such conditions. Under monomeric conditions the addition of low concentrations of urea slowed down the rate of fibrillation, e.g. 5-fold at 0.75 m urea. The decreased fibrillation of the monomer was due to an induced non-native conformation with significantly increased α-helical content compared with the native conformation. The data indicate a close-knit relationship between insulin conformation and propensity to fibrillate. The correlation between fibrillation and the partially unfolded monomer indicates that the latter is a critical amyloidogenic intermediate in insulin fibrillation.

Insulin fibrillation is accelerated by low to moderate concentrations of Gdn·HCl 1The abbreviations used are: Gdn·HCl, guanidine hydrochloride; CD, circular dichroism; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; ThT, thioflavin T; SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering. at physiological pH due to hexamer dissociation (38Ahmad A. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The predominant species under these conditions was a partially folded monomer, which was present to >6 m Gdn·HCl. Similar effects are observed when starting from monomeric insulin, due to the presence of a partially folded conformation. Thus a minimum pathway for insulin fibrillation is hexamer → monomer → partially unfolded monomer → fibrils (38Ahmad A. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the relationship between conformation of insulin induced by urea and the propensity to fibrillate, starting both from hexamer (pH 7.4) and monomer. Fibril formation was followed with a Thioflavin T binding fluorescence assay (39Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and structural changes were observed using optical spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and small angle x-ray scattering. The results show a strong correlation between the association and conformational states of insulin and its propensity to fibrillate, and significant differences to the effects of Gdn·HCl. The results, in conjunction with earlier studies on insulin fibrillation (38Ahmad A. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), enhance our understanding of the relationship between conformational change and fibrillation of insulin. Human insulin with zinc was kindly provided by Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark. All chemicals were analytical grade, and were from EM Sciences or Sigma. Thioflavin T was obtained from Fluka. Stock solutions of human insulin, 2–10 mg/ml, were prepared fresh before use in 0.025 m HCl, pH 1.6. For experiments starting with hexameric insulin, aliquots of 1 m HEPES buffer were added to obtain a final concentration of 50 mm HEPES and adjusted to pH 7.4 using NaOH. For studies of monomeric insulin, a stock solution was freshly prepared by dissolving human insulin in 20% acetic acid (pH 2.0). The concentration of insulin was checked by using an extinction coefficient of 1.0 for 1 mg/ml at 276 nm (30Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The concentration of urea solutions was obtained by refractive index measurement. Stock (1 mm) solutions of Thioflavin T were prepared by dissolving ThT in double-distilled water, and the concentration determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 24,420 at 420 nm. ThT was stored at 4 °C, protected from light. The effect of urea on conformation and fibrillation was studied by mixing aliquots from the insulin stock solutions to final concentrations of 2 mg/ml protein, 50 mm HEPES, 20 μm ThT, and urea concentration from 0–6 m. In the case of the studies at pH 2, aliquots were added to each sample to reach a final concentration of 20% acetic acid, 2 mg/ml human insulin, 20 μm ThT, and urea varying from 0–6 m. Kinetics of Fibrillation—ThT fluorescence was monitored for each sample in a 96-well plate in a Fluoroskan Ascent CF fluorescence plate reader (Lab Systems) at 37 or 40 °C and shaking at 760 rpm. The plate was sealed with Mylar plate sealer (Thermo Labsystems). The excitation wavelength was 444 nm and the emission measured at 485 nm. Plates were continuously shaken for the entire period of study at a rotation diameter of 1 mm, and the integration period was fixed at 20 ms for each well. Five replicates, corresponding to five wells for each sample, were used to minimize well-to-well variation. Results from >3 similar profiles were averaged for the final results at each urea concentration. The kinetic profiles were analyzed by curve-fitted using SigmaPlot software (30Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were taken at 25 °C on an AVIV 60DS circular dichroism spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Aliquots from stock solutions were mixed to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml protein, and urea varying from 0–6 m. To eliminate contributions from buffer, solutions without protein were prepared in the same manner as above, and their spectra subtracted from the protein spectra. Samples were incubated for 2 h before collecting the spectra. Both near- and far-UV spectra were recorded using a step size of 0.5 nm and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm. In the far-UV region spectra were recorded in a 0.01-cm cell, and for the near-UV experiments a cell of 0.5-cm path length was used. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data (Phase Diagrams)—The phase diagram method analysis of spectroscopic data is extremely sensitive for the detection of intermediate states (40Burstein E.A. Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence: Origin and Applications. VINITI, Moscow1976Google Scholar, 41Permyakov E.A. Yarmolenko V.V. Emelyanenko V.I. Burstein E.A. Closset J. Gerday C. Eur.

Acta. 2002; 1596: 138-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The essence of the phase diagram method is to build up the diagram of Iλ1 versus Iλ2, where Iλ1 and Iλ2 are the spectral intensity values measured at wavelengths λ1 and λ2 under different experimental conditions for a protein undergoing structural transformations. The non-linearity of this function reflects the sequential character of structural transformations, where each linear portion of the I(λ1) = f(I(λ2)) plot describes an individual all-or-none transition. Small Angle X-ray Scattering—Small angle x-ray scattering measurements were made using the SAXS setup on Beam Line 4–2 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, as described previously (38Ahmad A. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The values of radii of gyration (Rg) were calculated according to the Guinier approximation (44Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London, New York1982Google Scholar): ln I(Q) = ln I(0) - Rg2 Q2/3 where Q is the scattering vector given by Q = (4πλ sin 2θ)/λ (2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of x-ray). The value of I(0), the forward scattering amplitude I(Q) Q → 0, is proportional to the square of the molecular weight of the molecule (44Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London, New York1982Google Scholar). I(0) for a pure dimer sample will therefore be twice that for a sample with the same number of monomers since each dimer will scatter four times as strongly, but there will be half as many as in the pure monomer sample. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column from Amersham Biosciences (exclusion limit 2 × 106 Mr). The column was run on an FPLC GP 250-P500 (Amersham Biosciences) instrument at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with detection at 280 nm. Human insulin, 2 mg/ml was incubated in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, with and without urea for 2 h at 25 °C. Aliquots of 200 μl of each sample were loaded on the column, which was equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer containing the desired concentration of urea prior to the loading of sample. For experiments involving variation in insulin concentration, 0.5–10 mg/ml of insulin was incubated in 2.0 m urea, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 for two hours at 25 °C, and 200-μl aliquots of this solution were loaded on the column pre-equilibrated with 2.0 m urea, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4. Aprotonin (Mr 6.5 kDa) and cytochrome c (Mr 12.3 kDa) were run as markers in the presence of 0.5 m urea, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4. Since no significant changes in these proteins have been observed in 0.5 m urea, these markers were assumed to be globular under these conditions. The observed elution volume of 15.0 and 14.0 ml (data not shown) for aprotonin and cytochrome c is consistent with their size. UV Absorbance Studies—Human insulin, 2 mg/ml, was prepared and incubated in wells in the fluorescence plate reader as discussed above, however, ThT with a final concentration of 20 μm was added to only one of the five wells and was taken as a reference to monitor formation of fibrils. Once the transition into fibrils was complete the contents from each of the wells were transferred to 0.5-ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the absorbance for protein or ThT measured. For protein, 50 μl of the supernatant was dissolved in 950 μl of 25 mm HCl, 0.1 m NaCl pH 2.0. The percentage of protein left in the supernatant was calculated by taking the absorbance of 2.0 mg/ml protein in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, processed in a similar manner (50 μl in buffer), as 100%. For samples in 20% acetic acid the pellet obtained as above was dissolved in 600 mm NaOH and the absorbance read at 290 nm. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Aliquots of 5 μl of insulin fibrils grown in microtiter plates without ThT at 2 mg/ml insulin were diluted once and 5 μl of resulting solution placed onto carbon grids coated with Formvar (Ted Pella Inc.) and left for 1–5 min. The grid was washed five times with nano-pure water and five times with 1% uranyl acetate for negative staining and left to dry at room temperature. The specimens were viewed and images recorded with a Philips 208 electron microscope operated at 80 kV using Gatan digital micrography software. Acrylamide Quenching—Tyrosine fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out on insulin solutions at 25 °C. Insulin stock solution of 2 mg/ml was prepared in 20% acetic acid. Aliquots to give a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (∼1 μm) were added to the solutions containing varying urea concentration. Samples were incubated for 2 h before taking the fluorescence measurements. For each sample aliquots from an acrylamide stock (4.0 m) were added with a Hamilton syringe to reach a final concentration of acrylamide varying from 0–175 mm and the fluorescence measured immediately. The samples were excited at 276 nm, and emission was monitored at 301 nm. Insulin fibrillation has been shown to be very sensitive to environmental conditions (30Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8397-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Various biophysical methods were applied to study changes in the conformation induced by urea both for hexameric insulin at pH 7.4 and monomeric insulin in 20% acetic acid. Urea-induced Quaternary, Tertiary, and Secondary Structure Changes in Insulin at pH 7.4 —Information about the quaternary and tertiary structure of insulin were obtained by monitoring changes in the near-UV CD region (46Uversky V.N. Garriques L.N. Millett I.S. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Doniach S. Fink A.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A broad negative peak centered at 276 nm was observed for native hexameric protein. Since there are no tryptophan residues in insulin, the peak reflects the contributions of tyrosine. Fig. 1A represents some typical spectra depicting changes in the shape and intensity of the profiles upon addition of varying concentration of urea. Insignificant changes between 0 and 2 m urea were apparent followed by a major transition between 2 and 4.75 m urea (midpoint ∼3.5 m). Above 5 m gradual changes were observed up to 7.5 m urea. The spectrum for 7.75 m urea exhibits residual tertiary structure. These observations reflect a constantly changing environment of tyrosines with increasing urea concentration, with a broad transition centered at ∼3.5 m urea (Fig. 1C). Far-UV CD spectra obtained with various urea concentrations are shown in Fig. 1B. For native insulin, minima at 222 nm and 209 nm, characteristic of α-helix, were observed. The changes in the secondary structure of insulin upon addition of increasing concentrations of urea were reflected as marked changes in the shape and intensity of the spectra. However, up to 3.0 m urea significant changes were observed only in the vicinity of 209 nm; large changes around 222 nm region were observed only after the addition of 4.0 m and higher urea concentrations. The spectrum obtained at 7.0 m urea does not resemble that of an extensively unfolded protein, and can be attributed largely to the weak chaotropic effect of urea and also to the resistant super-secondary structure of the insulin B chain (45Nielsen L. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8397-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 53Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Hu S.Q. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12299-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ellipticity at 222 nm shows a broad transition beginning at 3.0 m urea and extended above 7 m (Fig. 1C). This transition is at significantly higher urea concentrations than that observed at θ276 indicating that the changes in the quaternary and tertiary structure are uncoupled from those of the secondary structure, and reflecting the buildup of partially unfolded intermediate conformations. CD data have been traditionally analyzed in terms of fraction folded/unfolded or θx nm versus denaturant concentration (as in Fig. 1C), but phase diagrams can be very informative in data analysis, and have been used to resolve complex structural changes from both fluorescence and CD data (42Bushmarina N.A. Kuznetsova I.M. Biktashev A.G. Turoverov K.K. Uversky V.N. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 43Kuznetsova I.M. Stepanenko O.V. Turoverov K.K. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Fink A.L. Uversky V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 138-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A represents the phase diagram obtained by plotting the ellipticity at 276 nm against that at 251 nm. These wavelengths were chosen based on the large variations of ellipticity in their vicinity (Fig. 1A). The phase diagram shows four linear segments from 0–0.75, 0.75–1.75, 1.75–4.25, and 4.25–7.25 m urea. Each linear segment represents an all-or-none transition between two different conformations (42Bushmarina N.A. Kuznetsova I.M. Biktashev A.G. Turoverov K.K. Uversky V.N. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 43Kuznetsova I.M. Stepanenko O.V. Turoverov K.K. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Fink A.L. Uversky V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 138-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and thus there are at least five structurally distinct species that become populated as a function of increasing urea concentration. For far-UV CD, the phase diagram was obtained by plotting ellipticity at 222 nm versus that at 210 nm and is shown in Fig. 2B. Five sets of different conformational species were observed as indicated by the linear segments, ranging from 0–1.0, 1.0–3.0, 3.0–4.0, and 4.0–7.0 m urea. This implies the existence of five species with differing secondary structure over the range of 0–7.0 m urea. From comparison of the two phase diagrams, the regions of 0–1.0 and 4.25–7.5 m urea represent conditions under which there are simultaneous changes in both secondary and tertiary structure. The two other conformations at intermediate urea concentrations seem to exhibit independent secondary and tertiary structural rearrangements. Changes in the Association State of Insulin Induced by Urea at pH 7.4 —Insulin samples were incubated in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of urea for 2 h before injection onto a Superose S12 column pre-equilibrated with the corresponding concentration of urea. The results from SEC are summarized in Fig. 3A. For native insulin, an elution volume of 6.1 ml, corresponding to the hexamer was observed. The addition of 0.5 m urea to insulin led to a broad elution peak spanning 12.4–14.2 ml. The position of this peak lies between those of the insulin hexamer and dimer: the broadness of this peak indicates the presence of more than one oligomeric species existing in an equilibrium mixture with a significantly faster dissociation/association compared with the time of chromatographic separation. Only small shifts were observed in the elution peak of insulin as higher urea concentrations were added, indicating that the dissociation process or oligomeric state of insulin was not significantly influenced by urea. The maximum of intensity of the elution peak was at 12.4 ml in the case of 0.5 m urea and was observed to undergo a small shift to 13.5 ml at 7.5 m urea. Thus the data suggest a rapid (on the time scale of the chromatography) equilibrium between two or more species; from what is known about the assembly process of insulin (see below) the simplest situation would be an equilibrium between hexamer and dimer, heavily weighted in favor of the dimer. The elution volume for the unfolded monomer is around 14.5 ml, and for the native (compact) dimer it is 13.4 ml. At high urea concentrations the unfolded monomer will be present (see below) and appears to have an elution volume similar to that for the compact dimer. The elution profiles obtained with varying concentrations of insulin at constant 2.0 m urea (Fig. 3B) failed to resolve the broad peak into components and resulted only in a change in the elution volume. This is consistent with a shift in the equilibrium toward the hexamer with increase in insulin concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2052112748,"Geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitors (GGTIs) represent a new class of anticancer drugs. However, the mechanism by which GGTIs inhibit tumor cell growth is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GGTI-298 and GGTI-2166 induce apoptosis in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human ovarian epithelial cancer cells by inhibition of PI3K/AKT and survivin pathways. Following GGTI-298 or GGTI-2166 treatment, kinase levels of PI3K and AKT were decreased and survivin expression was significantly reduced. Ectopic expression of constitutively active AKT2 and/or survivin significantly rescue human cancer cells from GGTI-298-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that Akt mediates growth factor-induced survivin, whereas p53 inhibits survivin expression. However, constitutively active AKT2 failed to rescue the GGTIs downregulation of survivin. Further, GGTIs suppress survivin expression and induce programmed cell death in both wild-type p53 and p53-deficient ovarian cancer cell lines. These data indicate that GGTI-298 and GGTI-2166 induce apoptosis by targeting PI3K/AKT and survivin parallel pathways independent of p53. Owing to the fact that upregulation of Akt and survivin as well as inactivation of p53 are frequently associated with chemoresistance, GGTIs could be valuable agents to overcome antitumor drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1989676756,"The absence of functional p53 has complex consequences on the cellular responses to cytotoxic drugs. Here, we have examined the role of p53 in the response to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC or decitabine). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for p53 undergo apoptosis after treatment with 5-aza-dC. When compared with other demethylating drugs or chemotherapeutic treatments, 5-aza-dC showed the highest selectivity ratio for triggering apoptosis in p53-deficient cells relative to wild-type cells. Moreover, the apoptotic efficacy of 5-aza-dC is proprietary of p53-deficient cells, not being observed in cells lacking other cell-cycle regulators, such as p19ARF, p16INK4a, p21CIP1/WAF1, E2F-1, or E2F-2. Interestingly, treatment with 5-aza-dC results in the same degree of global genomic hypomethylation in wild-type and p53-null cells. However, wild-type cells activate p53 and arrest at G2/M, whereas p53-null cells accumulate severe chromosomal aberrations and undergo apoptosis. Significantly, the impact of p53-deficiency on the response to 5-aza-dC is not exclusive of primary non-neoplastic cells, but it is also present in neoplastically transformed cells. Finally, treatment of mice bearing genetically defined tumors with nontoxic doses of 5-aza-dC results in therapeutical responses only on tumors lacking p53, but not on tumors lacking p19ARF. Together, our results put forward the hypothesis that the absence of p53 may determine a higher chemotherapeutic index for 5-aza-dC."
https://openalex.org/W2075814472,"An NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase and the corresponding gene were identified from the yeast Ambrosiozyma monospora. The enzyme is part of the yeast pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A fungal pathway for l-arabinose utilization has been described previously for molds. In this pathway l-arabinose is sequentially converted to l-arabinitol, l-xylulose, xylitol, and d-xylulose and enters the pentose phosphate pathway as d-xylulose 5-phosphate. In molds the reductions are NADPH-linked, and the oxidations are NAD+-linked. Here we show that in A. monospora the pathway is similar, i.e. it has the same two reduction and two oxidation reactions, but the reduction by l-xylulose reductase is not performed by a strictly NADPH-dependent enzyme as in molds but by a strictly NADH-dependent enzyme. The ALX1 gene encoding the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase is strongly expressed during growth on l-arabinose as shown by Northern analysis. The gene was functionally overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the purified His-tagged protein characterized. The reversible enzyme converts l-xylulose to xylitol. It also converts d-ribulose to d-arabinitol but has no activity with l-arabinitol or adonitol, i.e. it is specific for sugar alcohols where, in a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl group of the C-2 is in the l-configuration and the hydroxyl group of C-3 is in the d-configuration. It also has no activity with C-6 sugars or sugar alcohols. The Km values for l-xylulose and d-ribulose are 9.6 and 4.7 mm, respectively.

To our knowledge this is the first report of an NADH-linked l-xylulose reductase. l-Arabinose is a major constituent of plant material so that l-arabinose catabolism is relevant for microorganisms living on decaying plant material. For the catabolism of l-arabinose two distinctly different pathways are known, a bacterial pathway and a fungal pathway. In the bacterial pathway the three enzymes l-arabinose isomerase, l-ribulokinase, and l-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase convert l-arabinose to d-xylulose 5-phosphate. A fungal pathway was described for molds but not for yeasts. It was first described by Chiang and Knight (1Chiang C. Knight S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1960; 3: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for the mold Penicillium chrysogenum, in which l-arabinose is converted to d-xylulose 5-phosphate, as in bacteria, but through the enzymes aldose reductase, l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase, l-xylulose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulokinase. In this pathway the aldose reductase and the l-xylulose reductase use NADPH as cofactor, whereas l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase and xylitol dehydrogenase use NAD+ as cofactor (Fig. 1). The same pathway was described for the mold Aspergillus niger (2Witteveen C.F.B. Busink R. van de Vondervoort P. Dijkema C. Swart K. Visser J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2163-2171Google Scholar). The pathway was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using genes from the mold Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) and other fungal sources and shown to be functional, i.e. the resulting strain could grow on and ferment l-arabinose, however, at very low rates (3Richard P.

In a mutant of Pichia stipitis, which was unable to grow on l-arabinose, overexpression of a xylitol dehydrogenase could restore growth on l-arabinose. Dien et al. (7Dien B.S. Kurtzman C.P. Saha B.C. Bothast R.J. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1996; 57: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) tested more than 100 yeast species for l-arabinose fermentation. Most of them produced arabinitol and xylitol indicating that the yeast pathway is similar to the pathway of molds and not to the bacterial pathway. However, there is only limited knowledge about the enzymes of this pathway in yeast. Aldose reductases, which are active with l-arabinose and d-xylose, were described for the yeasts S. cerevisiae (8Kuhn A. van Zyl C. van Tonder A. Prior B.A. Appl. Environ.

J. 1985; 226: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The enzymes have similar affinity toward d-xylose and l-arabinose and convert both sugars with a similar rate. The S. cerevisiae enzyme, however, is strictly NADPH-dependent, whereas the P. stipitis enzyme can use both NADH and NADPH but has a preference for NADPH. For the yeast Candida parapsilosis an aldose reductase with a preference for NADH was described (10Lee J.-K. Koo B.-S. Kim S.-Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). There are no reports about l-arabinitol-4-dehydrogenases or l-xylulose reductases in yeast. Xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase were characterized in S. cerevisiae (11Richard P. Toivari M.H. Penttilä M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Richard P. Toivari M.H. Penttilä M. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2000; 190: 39-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and P. stipitis (13Rizzi M. Harwart K. Erlemann P. Bui-Thanh N.-A. Dellweg H. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1989; 67: 20-24Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Jin Y.S. Jones S. Shi N.Q. Jeffries T.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The xylitol dehydrogenases are strictly NAD+-linked similar to the enzymes in mold.l-Xylulose reductases are not only described for molds but also for higher animals. The activity was found in guinea pig liver (15Hickman J. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 758-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partly purified protein from pigeon liver is commercially available (Sigma). From hamster liver a gene was identified, which coded for a diacetyl reductase that had also l-xylulose reductase activity (16Ishikura S. Isaji T. Usami N. Kitahara K. Nakagawa J. Hara A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All these l-xylulose reductase activities have in common that they are strictly coupled to NADPH. To our knowledge there is no report about l-xylulose reductase activity coupled to NADH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used in the cloning procedures. The Ambrosiozyma monospora strain NRRL Y-1484 was used for cDNA synthesis and Northern blot analysis. The S. cerevisiae strain H2651 (4Richard P. Putkonen M. Väänänen R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6432-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was used in the screening for improved growth on l-arabinose. The H2651 has the P. stipitis XYL1 and XYL2 genes encoding xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase, respectively, expressed from the PGK1 and modified ADH1 (17Ruohonen L. Aalto M.K. Keränen S. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 39: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) promoters, respectively, integrated into the URA3 locus. The endogenous XKS1 gene encoding xylulokinase under the modified ADH1 promoter is integrated into the HIS3 locus. The lad1 and lxr1 genes coding for l-arabinitol dehydrogenase and l-xylulose reductase from H. jecorina (T. reesei) are carried on separate multicopy expression vectors with LEU2 and URA3 marker genes.The S. cerevisiae strain H1346 (CEN.PK2) was used to produce the histidine-tagged enzyme. All S. cerevisiae strains were cultured in synthetic complete (SC) medium (18Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 62Google Scholar) lacking uracil, leucine, and/or tryptophan when the strains were carrying plasmids.Construction of the cDNA Library—A. monospora (NRRL Y-1484) was cultured in Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) with 4% l-arabinose as the carbon source. The cells were grown overnight at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation when the l-arabinose concentration was about 2%. Total RNA was extracted from the cells with the Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA was isolated from the total RNA with Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was synthesized by the SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and the fractions containing cDNA were pooled and ligated into the SalI-NotI cut pEXP-AD502 vector (Invitrogen). This plasmid is a centromeric expression vector that has the ADH1 promoter and N-terminal GAL4 fusion fragment in front of the insert.The ligation mixture was transformed into the E. coli DH5α strain by electroporation following the manufacturer's (Bio-Rad) instructions. After overnight incubation about 100,000 independent colonies were pooled from ampicillin plates and stored in –80 °C in 50% glycerol + 0.9% NaCl. Before extracting plasmids from the transformants, the library was amplified by growing it in LB medium for 4 h of shaking at 37 °C.Screening the cDNA Library for Growth on l-Arabinose—The S. cerevisiae strain H2651 was transformed with the cDNA library using the Gietz Lab transformation kit (Molecular Research Reagents Inc.). The transformants were plated on SC medium (18Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 62Google Scholar) lacking uracil, leucine, and tryptophan and having 2% glucose. After 2 days of cultivation the yeast colonies were replicated to plates with selective medium containing 1% l-arabinose as the sole carbon source. From the first colonies that appeared, plasmids were rescued and transformed into the E. coli strain DH5α. The plasmids contained the lad1 or lxr1 gene or genes from the cDNA library. The colonies that carried a plasmid from the library were identified by PCR with specific primers for the pEXP-AD502 vector f2, 5′-TATAACGCGTTTGGAATCACT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAAATTTCTGGCAAGGTAGAC-3′. Plasmids were extracted and sequenced with the same primers.Overexpression of the l-Xylulose Reductase in S. cerevisiae—The gene coding for the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase was transferred with SalI-NotI digestion from the centromeric library vector into a multicopy yeast expression vector having the PGK1 promoter, derived from the pFL60 (19Minet M. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by adding the restriction sites SalI and NotI to the multiple cloning site. The plasmid was then transformed to the S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2, and the enzymatic activity toward various substrates was tested from the cell extract. For the enzyme assays, yeast cells were cultured overnight, and cell extract was prepared with Y-PER reagent (Pierce). 0.5 ml of the reagent was used to lyse 0.1 g of cells. Before the lysis “Complete Protease Inhibitors without EDTA” (Roche Applied Science) were added into the cell suspension.l-Xylulose Reductase Assay—The activity in the forward direction was measured in a reaction mixture containing 200 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm NADH. 50 mm pentuloses were used as the start reagents if not otherwise indicated. All measurements were carried out in the Cobas Mira automated analyzer (Roche Applied Science) at 30 °C.The reverse reaction was measured in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm NAD+ or 2 mm NADP+. The reaction was started by adding xylitol or other sugar alcohols at a final concentration of 100 mm if not otherwise indicated.Purification of the Histidine-tagged Protein—A His tag containing 6 histidines was added to the N terminus of the protein by amplifying the gene with primers 5′-GACTGGATCCATCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATATGACTGACTACATTCCAAC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGATCCCTATATATACCGGAAAATCGAC-3′. Both primers have BamHI sites to facilitate cloning. The gene was ligated into a yeast multicopy expression vector B1181 with the PGK1 promoter (20Verho R. Richard P. Jonson P.H. Sundqvist L. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13833-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The gene was expressed in the S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2, and the activity of the His-tagged protein was confirmed with enzyme activity measurements. For the purification of the protein, the yeast strain expressing the His-tagged construct was cultured overnight in 500 ml of SC-ura + 2% glucose. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with Y-PER reagent as described above. The lysate was then applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and eluted according to the manufacturer's descriptions. The purified protein was used to determine the Michaelis-Menten constants and the substrate specificities.Product Identification by HPLC 1The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. —The purified enzyme was used in enzyme assays where the products of the reactions were determined. For the forward direction a mixture of 200 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NADH, 2 mm pentulose was used. 6 nanokatals of enzyme was added into the reactions, and the reactions were incubated for 3 h at room temperature.The products were identified by HPLC analysis. An Aminex Pb column (Bio-Rad) at 85 °C was used with water at a flow rate 0.6 ml/min. The polyols and pentuloses were detected with a Waters 410 RI detector.Northern Blot Analysis—A. monospora (NRRL Y-1484) was cultured overnight in 50 ml of YNB medium with 2% d-fructose, glycerol, d-glucose, l-arabinose, or d-xylose as the carbon source. An S. cerevisiae strain carrying the ALX1 gene in a multicopy expression vector and an S. cerevisiae strain with an empty vector were cultured overnight in SC-ura + 2% glucose medium. All cultures were done in duplicate. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen). 4 μg of the total RNA was used as sample in the gel electrophoresis. The RNA amount loaded on the gel was checked by staining (Fig. 4, lower panel) with the SYBR Green II RNA gel stain (BMA Biomedicals). The Northern blot analysis was carried out using standard procedures.The probe for the Northern blot analysis was an 800-bp fragment that was obtained with EcoRV-BamHI digestion from a TOPO vector carrying the His-tagged construct. The digestion releases the tag from the probe. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a commercial kit for DNA labeling (Roche Applied Science).RESULTSScreening and Identification of the l-Xylulose Reductase— We constructed a cDNA library from l-arabinose grown A. monospora, one of the rare yeast species able to ferment l-arabinose to ethanol. In order to clone genes that would be involved or would enhance l-arabinose utilization, the cDNA library was transformed to a recombinant S. cerevisiae strain that already contained the l-arabinose utilization pathway, i.e. the genes for aldose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulokinase and also mold (H. jecorina) genes for l-arabinitol dehydrogenase and l-xylulose reductase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although this strain can utilize l-arabinose, it grows so slowly on l-arabinose that we were able to select for improved growth on this carbon source. The transformants were first plated on glucose plates and then replicated on plates that had l-arabinose as the sole carbon source. After about 2 weeks of cultivation, colonies were picked and plasmids extracted from them. One of the clones contained a plasmid that carried an open reading frame coding for a 272-amino acid product with a molecular mass of 29,495 Da. The open reading frame coded for a protein of the family of short chain alcohol dehydrogenases with high amino acid similarity to d-arabinitol dehydrogenases found from P. stipitis, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. In addition it had lower similarities to the lxr1 gene of H. jecorina that codes for l-xylulose reductase. The gene was named ALX1 for A. monospora l-xylulose reductase. The sequence was submitted into the GenBank™ and has the accession number AJ583159.Overexpression in S. cerevisiae and Purification of the Histidine-tagged l-Xylulose Reductase—The open reading frame of the ALX1 gene was ligated to a yeast expression vector with the strong PGK1 promoter. The plasmid was then transformed to a yeast strain where no other enzymes of the l-arabinose pathway were expressed. In the crude yeast extract we found enzyme activity with xylitol (about 31 nanokatals/mg) and d-arabinitol (about 30 nanokatals/mg) when NAD+ was used as a cofactor, but no activity was observed with NADP+ as cofactor. The NAD+-linked xylitol and d-arabinitol dehydrogenase activities were absent in the control strain lacking the ALX1 gene.For a more detailed analysis of the kinetic properties, we used a purified enzyme. To facilitate the purification a histidine tag was added. Because our previous studies showed that a C-terminal histidine tag in an enzyme belonging to the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase family may lead to an inactive enzyme (4Richard P. Putkonen M. Väänänen R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6432-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we added the histidine tag to the N terminus of the protein. The activity of the histidine-tagged protein was confirmed by measuring the activity from yeast cell lysates. The activity levels were similar in the strains expressing the histidine-tagged or unmodified protein, about 85 nanokatals/mg with xylitol and 87 nanokatals/mg with d-arabinitol. Fig. 2 shows the SDS-PAGE of the His-tagged protein, eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The molecular mass was about 32 kDa.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE of the histidine-tagged protein. The right lane shows 10 μg of the l-xylulose reductase with an N-terminal histidine tag after purification. In the left lane are molecular mass standards with their molecular masses indicated. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic Characterization—The purified His-tagged protein was used to determine the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. The Michaelis-Menten constants were derived from an Eadie-Hofstee plot. All measurements were done at least in triplicate. The Km for d-ribulose was 4.7 ± 0.8 mm, and the Km for l-xylulose was 9.6 ± 0.7 mm. The Vmax values were 2700 ± 300 nanokatals/mg for d-ribulose and 1700 ± 300 nanokatals/mg for l-xylulose. The kinetic parameters of the reverse reactions were Km 2.7 ± 0.3 mm and Vmax 600 ± 50 nanokatals/mg for d-arabinitol and Km 7.2 ± 1 and Vmax 630 ± 50 nanokatals/mg for xylitol. The results are summarized in the Fig. 3.Fig. 3Kinetics of the purified histidine-tagged protein. A, the pH is 7.0 and NADH is 0.2 mm. B, the pH is 9.0 and NAD+ is 2 mm. The curves are calculated Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the constants as indicated. l-Xylulose, Km = 9.6 mm, Vmax = 1700 nanokatals/mg. d-Ribulose, Km = 4.7 mm, Vmax = 2700 nanokatals/mg. Xylitol, Km = 7.2 mm, Vmax = 630 nanokatals/mg. d-Arabinitol, Km = 2.7 mm, Vmax = 600 nanokatals/mg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Substrate Specificities—Activity was observed with the sugar alcohols xylitol and d-arabinitol by using as cofactor NAD+. No activity was observed with the C-5 sugar alcohols l-arabinitol and adonitol (ribitol) and the C-6 sugar alcohols dulcitol (galactitol), d-mannitol, and d-sorbitol. No activity with xylitol or d-arabinitol was found when NAD+ was replaced by NADP+.By using sugar and NADH as substrates (forward reaction), activity was observed with l-xylulose and d-ribulose. An ∼100-fold lower activity was observed with the other pentulose sugar d-xylulose. No activity was seen with the hexulose sugars d-sorbose, l-sorbose, d-psicose, and d-fructose.Product Identification by HPLC—The largest activities were observed with d-ribulose and l-xylulose in the reducing reaction and with xylitol and d-arabinitol in the oxidizing reaction. To identify the reaction products we used HPLC. From l-xylulose xylitol was formed, but not arabinitol or adonitol (ribitol). From d-ribulose and from d-xylulose arabinitol was formed but not adonitol (ribitol) or xylitol. The HPLC method that was used does not distinguish between l- and d-arabinitol. In the reverse direction xylulose was formed from xylitol. In a reaction with d-arabinitol as the substrate both ribulose and xylulose were produced. Also here the method does not distinguish between the l and d forms.Northern Analysis—To study the role of the l-xylulose reductase in A. monospora, the expression of the gene on different carbon sources was studied by Northern analysis. A. monospora was grown on the carbon sources d-glucose, glycerol, d-fructose, l-arabinose, and d-xylose. The results are shown in the Fig. 4. The gene was expressed on all carbon sources that were studied. However, the strongest expression of the ALX1 gene was seen on l-arabinose. The size of the messenger RNA is ∼1250 bp. As controls S. cerevisiae strains were used, one strain having the ALX1 in a multicopy expression vector and the other strain carrying an empty vector.DISCUSSIONAs described in the Introduction there are indications that yeasts and molds share the same fungal pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A. monospora NRRL Y-1484 was identified as one of the best l-arabinose fermenting yeast strains according to Dien et al. (7Dien B.S. Kurtzman C.P. Saha B.C. Bothast R.J. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1996; 57: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have screened an A. monospora cDNA library in a yeast expression vector in a recombinant S. cerevisiae strain for improved growth of l-arabinose. The recombinant S. cerevisiae strain contained all the genes of a fungal l-arabinose pathway, i.e. the XYL1 and XYL2 from the yeast P. stipitis coding for a d-xylose reductase with l-arabinose reductase activity and xylitol dehydrogenase, respectively, the lad1 and lxr1 from the mold H. jecorina coding for l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase and l-xylulose reductase, respectively, and the XKS1 from S. cerevisiae coding for xylulokinase. This strain is able to grow on l-arabinose, but slowly. In the screen we found transformants with improved growth. Some of them contained an A. monospora gene encoding a protein from the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase family. Compared with other proteins in public data bases, it had highest similarity to the d-arabinitol dehydrogenases of the yeasts C. albicans (21Wong B. Murray J.S. Castellanos M. Croen K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6314-6320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C. tropicalis (22Murray J.S. Wong M.L. Miyada C.G. Switchenko A.C. Goodman T.C. Wong B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and P. stipitis (23Hallborn J. Walfridsson M. Penttilä M. Keränen S. Hahn-Hägerdal B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It had also similarity, however, to a lower degree to the l-xylulose reductase of the mold H. jecorina (4Richard P. Putkonen M. Väänänen R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6432-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The purified His-tagged protein was an l-xylulose reductase that is specific for NAD+/NADH. No activity was observed with NADP+/NADPH, i.e. it is distinctly different from the l-xylulose reductase of H. jecorina and all other known l-xylulose reductases, which are all specific for NADP+/NADPH. The H. jecorina enzyme also catalyzed the reaction from d-mannitol to d-fructose. This activity was not observed with the A. monospora enzyme.The enzyme reversibly converts l-xylulose to xylitol and d-ribulose to d-arabinitol (Fig. 5). It has a much lower activity with d-xylulose. This means that the enzyme has a preference for 2-ketose sugars where the hydroxyl group of the C-3 is in the d-configuration. Sugar alcohols can serve as a substrate when the hydroxyl group of C-2 is in the l- and the hydroxyl group of the C-3 is in the d-configuration in any of the possible Fischer projections. The enzyme does not have activity with sugar alcohols that do not have such a configuration, such as adonitol (ribitol) and l-arabinitol. The enzyme seemed to be specific for sugar alcohols that have not more than 5 carbons, because no activity was observed with dulcitol (galactitol), which has the hydroxyl group of C-2 in l- and of C-3 in d-configuration, but is a six-carbon sugar alcohol. Also, no activity was observed with the C-6 sugars d-mannitol and l-gulitol (d-sorbitol) where the hydroxyl group of C-2 is in the l-configuration. The l-xylulose reductase of H. jecorina was less specific; it only required a hydroxyl group at C-2 in the l-configuration in the sugar alcohol, and was active with C-6 sugar alcohols. In the reverse direction, activity with the 2-ketose sugar was preferred when the hydroxyl group of C-3 was in the d-configuration. We saw highest activity with l-xylulose and d-ribulose but only low activity with d-xylulose. Also in this direction the enzyme seemed to be specific for sugars with not more than 5 carbons, because no activity was observed with d-sorbose and d-psicose, both 2-keto sugars with the hydroxyl group in C-3 in d-configuration but with 6 carbons.Fig. 5Fischer projections of the sugar/sugar alcohol couples that can react with the l-xylulose reductase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This is another difference to the l-xylulose reductase from mold H. jecorina. The mold enzyme also converted sugar alcohols where the C-2 is in l-configuration but the hydroxyl of C-3 can be either l or d (4Richard P. Putkonen M. Väänänen R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6432-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), i.e. the H. jecorina enzyme is less specific also in this direction.The kinetic properties of the l-xylulose reductase from A. monospora were more similar to the properties of the d-arabinitol dehydrogenases of the yeasts P. stipitis (23Hallborn J. Walfridsson M. Penttilä M. Keränen S. Hahn-Hägerdal B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and C. tropicalis (22Murray J.S. Wong M.L. Miyada C.G. Switchenko A.C. Goodman T.C. Wong B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) than to the l-xylulose reductase of H. jecorina (4Richard P. Putkonen M. Väänänen R. Londesborough J. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6432-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The yeast enzymes are NADH-specific and have activity with d-arabinitol. The A. monospora enzyme, however, is different from the d-arabinitol dehydrogenases because it has high activity with xylitol. The activities of the d-arabinitol dehydrogenases with xylitol were less than 10% of the activities with d-arabinitol.According to Hallborn et al. (23Hallborn J. Walfridsson M. Penttilä M. Keränen S. Hahn-Hägerdal B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) the P. stip"
https://openalex.org/W2116477752,"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is an essential molecule for intracellular signaling of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and insulin, both of which are potent anabolic regulators of bone and cartilage metabolism. To investigate the role of IRS-1 in bone regeneration, fracture was introduced in the tibia, and its healing was compared between wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the IRS-1 gene (IRS-1-/- mice). Among 15 IRS-1-/- mice, 12 remained in a non-union state even at 10 weeks after the operation, whereas all 15 WT mice showed a rigid bone union at 3 weeks. This impairment was because of the suppression of callus formation with a decrease in chondrocyte proliferation and increases in hypertrophic differentiation and apoptosis. Reintroduction of IRS-1 to the IRS-1-/- fractured site using an adenovirus vector significantly restored the callus formation. In the culture of chondrocytes isolated from the mouse growth plate, IRS-1-/- chondrocytes showed less mitogenic ability and Akt phosphorylation than WT chondrocytes. An Akt inhibitor decreased the IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis of chondrocytes more potently in the WT culture than in the IRS-1-/- culture. We therefore conclude that IRS-1 deficiency impairs bone healing at least partly by inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, and we propose that IRS-1 can be a target molecule for bone regenerative medicine.

In efforts to develop more advanced skeletal regenerative medicine through genetic manipulation, we have been attempting to identify genes implicated in bone and cartilage formation in vivo. Healing of bone fracture is composed of complex multistep processes involving a variety of cellular events for bone and cartilage regeneration (1Bolander M.E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 200: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 2Kawaguchi H. Kurokawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Under the periosteum adjacent to the fracture gap, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells start differentiation directly to cells of osteoblastic lineage for the membranous ossification, whereas in granulation tissue inside the fracture gap, these mesenchymal cells undergo endochondral bone formation; they differentiate first into chondrocytes to form cartilage which is subsequently replaced by calcified tissues. The size and quality of fracture callus that determine the mechanical property of the fracture site are mostly dependent on the latter process. Because the endochondral bone formation also takes place in embryonic development and in skeletal growth after birth, understanding the molecular mechanism of fracture healing may not only help treat non-union and delayed union of fracture itself but also help advance bone regenerative medicine.Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; WT, wild-type; BMC, bone mineral content; HE, hematoxylin-eosin; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling; AxLacZ, adenovirus vector carrying β-galactosidase gene; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IGF-IR, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor; SHC, Src homology collagen; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TdR, [3H]thymidine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; WT, wild-type; BMC, bone mineral content; HE, hematoxylin-eosin; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TUNEL, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling; AxLacZ, adenovirus vector carrying β-galactosidase gene; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IGF-IR, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor; SHC, Src homology collagen; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TdR, [3H]thymidine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. plays important roles in the anabolic regulation of bone and cartilage metabolism (3Canalis E.

IGF-I appears essential for normal bone development because deletion of IGF-I or its receptor leads to a reduction in bone size at birth (5Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J.

Clinically, patients with Laron syndrome caused by IGF-I deficiency exhibit growth retardation and osteoporosis (7Laron Z. Klinger B. Silbergeld A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 156-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). IGF-I is also reported to be expressed during fracture healing and to stimulate it, suggesting a role as an autocrine/paracrine factor potentiating bone regeneration (8Trippel S.B. Clin. Orthop.

Rogers S.D. Ng K.W. Best J.D. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin North Am. 1997; 4: 5-17Google Scholar). Although the anabolic effect of insulin on bone may be primarily related to its ability to stimulate osteoblast proliferation, that on cartilage may involve the acceleration of chondrocyte differentiation (11Shukunami C.

Cell Physiol. 1984; 120: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Patients with insulin deficiency as exemplified by type 1 diabetes mellitus are associated with osteoporosis (13Krakauer J.C. McKenna M.J. Rao D.S. Whitehouse F.W.

Res. 1997; 29: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Diabetes has also been shown to impair fracture healing, which is restored by treatment with insulin in both humans and animals (2Kawaguchi H. Kurokawa T. Hanada K. Hiyama Y. Tamura M. Ogata E.

Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are essential substrates of the receptor tyrosine kinases, which integrate the pleiotropic effects of IGF-I and insulin on cellular function (17Burks D.J. White M.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 140-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Honda-Yamamoto R. Tamemoto H. Kaburagi Y. Momomura K. Ueki K. Takahashi Y. Yamauchi T. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Endocr. J. 1996; 43 (suppl.): 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian IRS family contains at least four members: ubiquitous IRS-1 and IRS-2, adipose tissue-predominant IRS-3, and IRS-4 which is expressed in the thymus, brain, and kidney. We reported previously that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are expressed in bone (19Ogata N. Chikazu D. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Azuma Y. Ohta T. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Akune T. Ogata N. Hoshi K. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Azuma Y. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our further studies on bone metabolism of mice lacking the IRS-1 gene (IRS-1-/- mice) or the IRS-2 gene (IRS-2-/- mice) revealed that IRS-1 is important for maintaining bone turnover (19Ogata N. Chikazu D. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Azuma Y. Ohta T. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas IRS-2 is important for maintaining predominance of anabolic function over catabolic function of osteoblasts (20Akune T. Ogata N. Hoshi K. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Tobe K. Azuma Y. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Regarding the role of these molecules on bone growth, IRS-1, but not IRS-2, seems to play an important role in the growth plate function, because IRS-1-/- mice were about 20-30% shorter in limbs and trunk, whereas IRS-2-/- mice were normal in size as compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (19Ogata N.

These data raise an interesting possibility that IRS-1 may be essential for endochondral ossification. To assess this possibility, the present study investigated the role of IRS-1 in bone healing and its mechanism by an in vivo fracture model and an in vitro culture system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Mice in a C57BL6/CBA hybrid background were generated and maintained as reported previously (21Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka Y. Horikoshi H. Furuta Y. Ikawa Y. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Aizawa S. Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). WT and IRS-1-/- male littermates generated from the intercross between heterozygous IRS-1+/- mice were compared. All experiments were performed according to the protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tokyo.Fracture Model—Twenty five male mice at 8 weeks of age were used in each group. Under general anesthesia with pentobarbiturate (0.5 mg/10 g body weight, Sigma), the bilateral hind limbs were shaved and sterilized. A 15-mm incision was made longitudinally over the right leg, and a blunt dissection of the muscle was made to expose the tibia. The middle point of the tibia was marked with a surgical marker, and a transverse osteotomy was performed using a bone saw (Volvere GX, NSK Nakanishi Inc., Tochigi, Japan). The fracture was repositioned, and then the full-length of the bone marrow cavity was internally stabilized with an intramedullary nail using the inner pin of a spinal needle of 22- or 23-gauge diameter depending on the size of the cavity. After irrigation with saline, the skin was sutured. The left tibia (unfractured side) was sham-operated and an intramedullary nail of the same size as the control was inserted. No external fixation was used, and the animals were allowed unrestricted activity as well as diet and water ad libitum. For histological analyses, animals were killed at 1 (n = 4/group), 3 (n = 3/group), and 6 weeks (n = 3/group) after the operation by diethyl ether, and bilateral tibiae were excised. After extracting the intramedullary nail gently so as not to injure the fracture site, the soft tissue surrounding the tibiae, except for the soft callus around the fracture site, was removed.Radiological Analysis—X-ray pictures of the right tibiae of WT and IRS-1-/- mice (n = 15 each) were taken at 0 (immediately after the operation), 1-3, 6, and 10 weeks after the operation under general anesthesia using a soft x-ray apparatus (CMB-2; Softex Co., Tokyo, Japan). To determine whether there was bone union, bony bridging on radiographs was evaluated by individuals who were blinded with regard to the genotype of mice.Measurement of Callus Area and Bone Mineral Content (BMC)—Area and BMC of the entire bilateral tibia were measured by a single energy x-ray absorptiometry utilizing a bone mineral analyzer for small animals (PIXIMUS, Lunar Co., Ltd., WI) at 0 (immediately after the operation), 1-4, and 6 weeks after the operation. A preliminary experiment revealed that the intramedullary nail did not affect the BMC value. The gain of area and the % gain of BMC during observation periods as compared with those at time 0 were calculated for both fractured and unfractured sides, and the differences were compared between WT and IRS-1-/-.Histological Analysis—Specimens of the harvested tibiae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight. After decalcification with 4.13% EDTA at 4 °C for 14 days, the tibiae were dehydrated with an increasing concentration of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm-thick sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) or toluidine blue.Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical localizations of IRS-1, IRS-2, type X collagen, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were examined in 4-μm dewaxed paraffin sections. After dehydration, the sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking by PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, the sections were incubated in polyclonal rabbit antibody against IRS-1, IRS-2, or type X collagen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal mouse antibody against PCNA (PC10, Sigma) (23Smink J.J. Gresnigt M.G. Hamers N. Koedam J.A. Berger R. Van Buul-Offers S.C. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 177: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), at a dilution of 1:100 for 24 h at 4 °C. As negative controls, we used non-immune rabbit IgG and mouse IgG of the same dilution instead of the primary antibodies. Then the sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit IgG (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) for immunohistochemistry of IRS-1, IRS-2, and type X collagen, and with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody against mouse IgG (EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) for that of PCNA, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the sections were immersed in a diaminobenzidine solution for 10 min at room temperature to visualize immunoreactivity. Terminal transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using an Apoptosis in Situ Detection kit (Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Generation of Adenoviruses and Gene Transfer—The recombinant adenovirus vector carrying human IRS-1 gene engineered to express hemagglutinin tag at its N terminus was constructed using an Adenovirus Expression Vector kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan) following the manufacturer's protocol. The adenovirus vector carrying β-galactosidase gene (AxLacZ) was kindly provided by Dr. I. Saito (University of Tokyo). Two days after the operation, a 1 × 1012 plaque-forming units suspension of AxIRS-1 or AxLacZ was injected into the fracture site of IRS-1-/- mice as described previously (24van Griensven M.

Lefebvre V. Harley V. Kahari V.M. Vuorio E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1837-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The same dose of AxLacZ was also injected to WT mice as a positive control. Animals were sacrificed at 1 week (n = 3/group) and 3 weeks (n = 3/group) after the injection. To confirm the infection efficiency, expression of lacZ was examined by histochemical staining by X-gal staining buffer (1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 5 mm potassium ferricyanide) (Wako).Isolation and Culture of Mouse Growth Plate Chondrocytes—Chondrocytes were isolated from epiphyseal growth plates of WT and IRS-1-/- mice at 3.5 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed, and tibiae were harvested and cleaned of perichondrium in an aseptic manner. Tibiae were pretreated with 0.3% collagenase in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove residual tissue. By washing the tibiae with PBS, all soft tissues were detached. Growth plates were dissected microscopically by inserting a 26-gauge needle. Subsequently, tibiae were digested with 0.3% collagenase in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 5 h, and matrix debris was removed by filtering through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Chondrocytes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. Cells were plated in 6-multiwell dishes at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 and grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics in a humidified CO2 incubator.X-gal Staining of Chondrocytes Isolated from Transgenic Mice with Type I Collagen Promoter or Type II Collagen Promoter Driving the lacZ Gene—To confirm the purity of chondrocytes isolated by the method above, transgenic mice expressing osteoblast- or chondrocyte-specific marker gene construct (the 2.3-kb fragment of the α1(I) collagen gene promoter or the 1.0-kb fragment of α1(II) collagen promoter and 0.6-kb enhancer) linked to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene were used (26Liu W. Toyosawa S. Furuichi T. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M. Narai S. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 27Ueta C. Iwamoto M.

Expression of lacZ was examined by histochemical staining with X-gal. Cells were isolated from the growth plates of transgenic mice by the method above and were cultured for 2 days. They were rinsed in PBS twice and fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS on ice for 10 min. After fixed samples were washed in PBS, staining was carried out by the X-gal staining buffer described above at 37 °C overnight.Western Blot Analysis—To examine the IRS-1 and IRS-2 protein levels, chondrocytes isolated from WT and IRS-1-/- growth plates described above were plated in 6-multiwell plates at a density of 105 cells/well and incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. For comparison, we also examined the protein levels in primary osteoblasts that were isolated from neonatal mouse calvariae and cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS as described previously (28Shimoaka T. Ogasawara T. Yonamine A. Chikazu D. Kawano H. Nakamura K. Itoh N. Kawaguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7493-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To investigate the signaling pathways through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), primary chondrocytes were pre-incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h, and treated with IGF-I (10 nm) in the presence and absence of LY294002 (10 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), and SB203580 (10 μm) (all from Calbiochem-Novabiochem) for 30 min. Cells were lysed with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured using a Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts (20 μg) of cell lysates were electrophoresed by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against IRS-1 and IRS-2 as described above, Akt, phospho-Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospho-ERK, p38, phospho-p38 MAPK (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA) and against actin (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were quantified by densitometry (Bio-Rad).DNA Synthesis and Proliferation Assays—DNA synthesis and proliferation of isolated chondrocytes were determined by the [3H]thymidine (TdR) uptake and the growth curve, respectively. For the former assay, primary chondrocytes from WT or IRS-1-/- mice were inoculated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-multiwell plate and cultured to confluency in DMEM, 10% FBS for 2 days. Serum was withheld for 12 h before adding the experimental medium with or without IGF-I (10 nm), LY294002 (1, 3, and 10 μm), PD98059 (1, 3, and 10 μm), and SB203580 (1, 3, and 10 μm). Uptake of [3H]TdR (1 μCi/ml in the medium) added for the final 2 h was measured at 18 h. For the growth curve assay, primary chondrocytes from WT or IRS-1-/- mice were inoculated at a density of 105 cells/well in 6-multiwell plates in DMEM, 10% FBS and cultured with or without IGF-I (10 nm). The number of cells/well was counted 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after the seeding.Statistical Analysis—Means of groups were compared by analysis of variance, and significance of differences was determined by post-hoc testing using Bonferroni's method.RESULTSRadiological Findings—Fig. 1A shows an x-ray feature of the fracture model that we used in this study. This model was confirmed to show the bone healing process similar to that in humans in a definite temporal sequence by the time course of x-ray examination in WT mice (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Callus formation could be detected at 1 week, and bony bridging at the fracture site was completed 2 or 3 weeks after the fracture. After the callus size and density reached maximum around 3 weeks, they decreased gradually due to bone remodeling up to 10 weeks. In IRS-1-/- mice, however, neither callus formation nor bridging between the fracture stumps was seen at the early stage, and the fracture site became atrophic without bone union at 10 weeks. Fig. 1C shows x-ray features of the fracture site of all 15 mice in each of WT and IRS-1-/- groups at 3 weeks after fracture. In WT mice, bone union with substantial hard callus formation was observed in all 15 animals. In IRS-1-/- mice, however, fracture healing was extremely impaired, and 12 out of 15 mice showed no bone union (the 12 panels at left). Although bone union was seen in 3 IRS-1-/- mice (the 3 panels at right), the callus looked much smaller and fainter than that of WT mice.The time course of the number of animals with fracture union determined by bony bridging on x-ray revealed that 4 WT mice achieved bone union at 2 weeks after the operation, and all 15 mice did so at 3 weeks. However, only 3 IRS-1-/- mice showed bone union at 3 weeks, but the other 12 animals remained in a non-union state even at 10 weeks (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Time course of the number of mice with bone union (A), the gain of area (B), and the % gain of BMC (C) at the fracture sites of WT and IRS-1-/- mice. To determine the bone union, the bony bridging at the fracture site on x-rays was judged by individuals blinded with regard to the genotype. The gain of area and the % gain of BMC during observation periods as compared with those at time 0 were calculated for the entire tibiae of fractured and unfractured sides, and the differences were compared between WT and IRS-1-/- callus. Because the fracture site became too displaced to measure these parameters correctly at the later stage in IRS-1-/- mice, the number of mice was decreased as shown in parentheses. Data in B and C are expressed as the mean (symbols) ± S.E. (error bars) for 15 WT mice, and the number shown in parentheses for IRS-1-/- mice. #, p < 0.05; *, p < 0.01 versus WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Callus Area and BMC—To quantify the callus formation, differences in the gain of area and the % gain of BMC between the fractured and unfractured tibiae were measured by a bone densitometer (Fig. 2, B and C). Significant differences between WT and IRS-1-/- mice were seen from 1 to 4 weeks in the callus area, and from 2 weeks to the end in the BMC. In WT mice, both parameters were increased at the early stage of healing due to the acceleration of the modeling process and decreased thereafter due to remodeling. In IRS-1-/- mice, these parameters remained at low levels throughout the observation period. At the later stage in the IRS-1-/- mice, the fracture site became displaced due to non-union, and at 10 weeks more than half the IRS-1-/- mice showed severe displacement which was beyond evaluation. To exclude the possibility of other parts of tibiae outside the fracture site affecting BMC, BMC at the bilateral femurs and distal third tibiae was measured at 3 and 6 weeks. Because there were no differences between the fractured and unfractured sides (data not shown), the BMC decrease in IRS-1-/- mice was caused by the decrease in that of the callus itself.Histological Findings—To assess the involvement of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in bone healing, we examined the localizations of these proteins at the fracture site in WT and IRS-1-/- mice at 3 weeks after fracture (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemical analysis of WT callus revealed that IRS-1 was localized at various cells including chondrocytes and fibroblasts, although IRS-2 immunoactivity was very faint. In IRS-1-/- mice, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins were barely detectable at the fracture site, suggesting that there was no compensatory up-regulation of IRS-2 by IRS-1 deficiency.Fig. 3Immunolocalization of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (A) and time course of histological findings (B) at the fracture sites of WT and IRS-1-/- mice. A, immunohistochemical stainings with an anti-IRS-1 antibody (α-IRS-1, left) and an anti-IRS-2 antibody (α-IRS-2, right) were performed on the fracture callus of WT and IRS-1-/- mice at 3 weeks. Positive and specific stainings by α-IRS-1 shown in brown are seen in fibroblasts and chondrocytes of the WT callus. No immunostaining was observed by the respective non-immune rabbit IgGs as negative controls (data not shown). Bar, 100 μm. B, 1, 3, and 6 weeks after the fracture, specimens of the harvested tibiae were stained with HE. At 1 week after fracture, the soft callus outlined by arrowheads is much larger in the WT fracture site than in IRS-1-/-. At 3 weeks, the WT callus was mineralized as outlined by arrowheads, which was hardly seen in the IRS-1-/- specimen.

https://openalex.org/W2048537883,"High-mobility group (HMG) A1 proteins are gene regulatory factors whose overexpression is frequently observed in naturally occurring human cancers. The overexpression of transgenic HMGA1 proteins in cells results in neoplastic transformation and promotes progression to malignant cellular phenotypes. To understand the underlying molecular and biological events involved in these phenomena, we used oligonucleotide microarray analyses to generate an HMGA1a-induced expression profile for approximately 22,000 genes. This gene expression profile was generated using a well-characterized transgenic human MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line in which overexpression of transgenic HMGA1 promotes a transition to a more malignant and metastatic phenotype. Microarray expression analyses, together with independent quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results, indicate that HMGA1a regulates genes involved in the Ras-extracellular signal-related kinase (Ras/ERK) mitogenic signaling pathway, including KIT ligand and caveolins 1 and 2. We also found that many cholesterol biosynthesis genes were decreased in cells overexpressing HMGA1a. Cholesterol depletion, decreased caveolin, and increased KIT ligand expression, are all independently associated with the activation of Ras/ERK signaling. Upon further analysis, we found that sensitivity to epidermal growth factor activation of ERK phosphorylation was significantly higher, and that cholesterol was significantly depleted, in cells overexpressing HMGA1a. The cumulative evidence indicates that one likely mechanism by which the HMGA1a protein promotes malignant changes in cells is through increased sensitivity to the activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2012992842,"We recently reported that two Chinese hamster mutants deficient in the RAD51 paralogs XRCC2 and XRCC3 show reduced radiosensitization after treatment with caffeine, thus implicating homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the mechanism of caffeine radiosensitization. Here, we investigate directly the effect of caffeine on HDR initiated by DSBs induced by a rare cutting endonuclease (I-SceI) into one of two direct DNA repeats. The results demonstrate a strong inhibition by caffeine of HDR in wild-type cells, and a substantial reduction of this effect in HDR-deficient XRCC3 mutant cells. Inhibition of HDR and cell radiosensitization to killing shows similar dependence on caffeine concentration suggesting a cause–effect relationship between these effects. UCN-01, a kinase inhibitor that effectively abrogates checkpoint activation in irradiated cells, has only a small effect on HDR, indicating that similar to radiosensitization, inhibition of checkpoint signaling is not sufficient for HDR inhibition. Recombination events occurring during treatment with caffeine are characterized by rearrangements reminiscent to those previously reported for the XRCC3 mutant, and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates significantly reduced formation of IR-specific RAD51 foci after caffeine treatment. In summary, our results identify inhibition of HDR as a significant contributor to caffeine radiosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2036945014,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family proteins are transcription factors critical in mediating cytokine signaling. Among them, STAT3 is frequently activated in a number of human cancers and transformed cell lines and is implicated in tumorigenesis. However, although constitutively activated STAT3 mutant (STAT3C) leads to cellular transformation, its transformation potential such as colony-forming activity in soft-agar is much weaker than that of v-src. To identify tumorigenic factors that cooperatively induce cellular transformation with STAT3C, we screened the retroviral cDNA library. We found that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), an essential transcription factor for melanocyte development and pigmentation, induces anchorage-independent growth of NIH-3T3 cells in cooperation with STAT3C. Microarray analysis revealed that c-fos is highly expressed in transformants expressing STAT3C and MITF. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay suggested that both STAT3 and MITF can cooperatively upregulate the c-fos gene. In addition, the transformation of NIH-3T3 cells by both MITF and STAT3C was significantly suppressed by a dominant-negative AP-1 retrovirus. These data indicate that MITF and STAT3 cooperatively induce c-fos, resulting in cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1986025763,"In recent years, most cDNA microarray studies of chemotherapeutic drug resistance have not considered the temporal pattern of gene expression. The objective of this study was to examine systematically changes in gene expression of NCI-H226 and NCI-H2170 lung cancer cells treated weekly with IC10 doses of cisplatin. NCI-H226 lung cancer cells were treated weekly with an IC10 dose of cisplatin. Candidate genes with a fold change of 2.0 or more were identified from this study. A second experiment was conducted by exposing NCI-H2170 cells to cisplatin doses that were increased in week 4 and decreased in week 5. Overall, 44 genes were differentially expressed in both the NCI-H226 and NCI-H2170 cell lines. In the NCI-H2170 cell line, 24 genes had a twofold gene expression change from weeks 3 to 4. Real-time PCR found a significant correlation of the gene expression changes for seven genes of interest. This small time-ordered series identified novel genes associated with cisplatin resistance. This kind of analysis should be viewed as a first step towards building gene-regulatory networks."

https://openalex.org/W1995822707,"Chromosomal rearrangements in non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma implicate BCL-6 as an oncogene, yet direct evidence for BCL-6 acting as an oncogene in B cells has been lacking. Here, we show that BCL-6 can immortalize primary B cells, but only in the absence of p53 tumor suppressor function. The expression of BCL-6 led to greatly increased B-cell proliferation, particularly in response to CD40 stimulation. Furthermore, BCL-6-infected p53-deficient B cells gave rise to immortalized cell lines that could be maintained by CD40 stimulation. We found that in primary mouse B cells, BCL-6 repressed expression of the Blimp-1, p27kip1, and cyclin D2 target genes. BCL-6 did not markedly repress the PDCD2 and BCL-XL target genes. The BCL-6 immortalized cell lines had a phenotype consistent with germinal center B cells, they expressed the germinal center-specific M17 gene, and a significant fraction of the cells stained positive with PNA. Our data indicate that BCL-6 may act to maintain B cells in a germinal center-like state, and repression of Blimp-1 by BCL-6 may be particularly crucial for stabilization of the germinal center phenotype. Our data also suggest that disruption of the p53 pathway may be crucial for the development of BCL-6-expressing B-cell lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2087221215,"The <i>Autographa californica</i> multiple nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) alkaline nuclease (AN) likely participates in the maturation of virus genomes and in DNA recombination. AcMNPV AN was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus as a His -tagged fusion and obtained in pure form (*AN) or as a <sup>6</sup>complex with the baculoviral single-stranded DNA-binding protein LEF-3 (*AN/L3). Both AN preparations possessed potent 5′ → 3′-exonuclease and weak endonuclease activities. Mutant *AN(S146A)/L3 with a change from serine to alanine at position 146 in a conservative motif was impaired in both activities. This proved that the endonuclease is an intrinsic activity of baculovirus AN. The AN endonuclease showed specificity for single-stranded DNA and converted supercoiled plasmid DNA (replicative form I, RFI) into the open circular form (RFII) by a single strand break. Plasmid DNA relaxed with topoisomerase I was resistant to *AN/L3 indicating that the partially single-stranded regions in negatively supercoiled molecules served as targets for the endonuclease. Unwinding the supercoiled DNA with ethidium bromide also made DNA resistant to AN/L3. In reactions with nicked circular DNA (RFII), AN and AN/L3 hydrolyzed exonucleolytically the broken strand or cut endonucleolytically the intact strand at the position opposite the nick (gap). When LEF-3 was added to the assay, the balance between the exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic modes of hydrolysis shifted in favor of the exonuclease. The data suggest that the AN endonuclease may digest the intermediates in replication and recombination at positions of structural irregularities in DNA duplexes, whereas LEF-3 may further regulate processing of the intermediates by AN via the endonuclease and exonuclease pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1997991983,"Oncogenic transformation of cells can induce the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16, which leads to hypophosphorylation and activation of retinoblastoma (Rb). Rb is capable of causing permanent growth arrest, which may underlie its role as a tumor suppressor. We show that repression by Rb at E2F target gene promoters involves the establishment of a stable repressor complex that is not displaced by the overexpression of E2F-1. Rather than displacing Rb, excess E2F-1 instead recruits more Rb, leading to direct transcriptional repression. In contrast, the Rb family members, p130 and p107, which have not been demonstrated to be tumor suppressors, bind preferentially to target promoters in the absence of growth factors and in proliferating cells, respectively, and these repressor complexes are displaceable by E2F-1. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which interacts with Rb, is associated with these distinct repressor complexes and follows a similar pattern of stability/displaceability. Efficient growth arrest by p16/Rb is dependent on histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, which provides a binding site for HP1. We propose that these differences in the stability of repressor complexes at promoters may, in part, underlie the different roles of Rb vs p130 and p107 in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression."

Western, developed countries, especially the United States and Britain, have a disproportionately larger share of funds, both in the public and private sector. As a result, they can attract scientists from parts of the world that have fewer resources or opportunities. There are long- and short-term views of the ramifications of this brain drain from poorer nations — and short- and long-term ways to deal with it."
