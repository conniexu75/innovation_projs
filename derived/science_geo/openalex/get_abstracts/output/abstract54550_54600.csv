https://openalex.org/W2141449078,"The partial purification and characterization of a factor from skeletal muscle which inhibits the activity of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinases from skeletal muscle, heart, liver, adipose tissue, and brain is described. The inhibitor is stable to heating at 96° and to precipitation with 5%, w/v, of trichloracetic acid, but is assumed to be a protein since it is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. It has a molecular weight of 26,000 by gel exclusion and an S20,w of 1.5 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A kinetic analysis of the effect of the inhibitor on the phosphorylation of casein by skeletal muscle protein kinase indicates that it interacts noncompetitively with respect to ATP, the protein substrate, and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The inhibitor promotes a 5-fold increase in the binding constant of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate to the protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1841822105,"Abstract A modified procedure for purification of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent (cyclic AMP-dependent) protein kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle is described. This procedure results in the separation of the enzyme into two peaks of activity on diethylaminoethylcellulose. No interconversion of these two peaks was observed. Both peaks exhibit dependence on cyclic AMP, but under certain conditions the dependence of Peak I on cyclic AMP can be reduced. The concentration of cyclic AMP needed for half-maximal stimulation is 3 x 10-8 m for Peak I and 1.5 x 10-8 m for Peak II. The binding of cyclic AMP to the protein kinase can be reversed by a number of mild chemical treatments and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. The apparent Km for ATP in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ is approximately 1.5 x 10-5 m in the presence or absence of cyclic AMP for either Peak I or Peak II. For Peak II the apparent Km for casein is 0.9 and 0.6 mg per ml in the presence and absence of cyclic AMP, respectively. This apparent Km is increased to 8 mg per ml when 0.1 m NaCl is present in the reaction mixture. The pH optimum is 6.0 for casein and 6.5 for histone phosphorylation for both enzymes. Peak I contains two components which are dependent on cyclic AMP and separable by sucrose density gradient centrifugation; the sedimentation coefficients of these components are 6.8 S and 4.9 S. Peak II activity sediments as a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.8 S. In the presence of cyclic AMP the protein kinase activity of Peak I sediments as a single component with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.4 S. The protein kinase activity of Peak II also exhibits a much lower sedimentation coefficient in the presence of cyclic AMP than that shown in the absence of this nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1574870728,"Abstract Purification of cyclic 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase of bovine brain cerebrum resulted in partial loss of activity, due to dissociation of an activator (or cofactor) from the enzyme. A systematic study showed that as purification proceeded, the activator was removed from phosphodiesterase in a stepwise fashion. Fractions representing phosphodiesterase at different stages of purification contained different concentrations of the activator in relation to phosphodiesterase. The fractions obtained in the initial stages contained excess or sufficient activator relative to the enzyme, and they required no exogenous cofactor for optimal activity. The fraction obtained in the last stage of purification was deficient in the cofactor, and phosphodiesterase was relatively inactive unless supplemented with an exogenous activator. The activator was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, but not to RNase or DNase, indicating that it was a protein. The protein was resistant to 8 m urea, and to boiling at pH 1.7. Boiling at pH 12.3 obliterated all activity. Gel filtration indicated that the protein had a molecular weight of 40,000. Kinetic analysis showed that stimulation was independent of the time of preliminary incubation with the activator, but dependent on its concentration in the reaction mixture. In contrast, stimulation of the enzyme by trypsin was a catalytic process. Although mechanistically different, both agents increased the Vmax of the enzyme and decreased its Km for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. An activator and a relatively inactive phosphodiesterase were also isolated from human brain, porcine brain, and rat brain as well as from bovine heart. An activator from one tissue cross-activated effectively a purified phosphodiesterase from another tissue, indicating a lack of tissue specificity. However, the effect of the activator was specific; none of a variety of proteins mimicked its action. A heated purified preparation lost its enzymic activity, but was capable of stimulating another preparation which had not been heated. It was concluded that the residual activity associated with the purified enzyme was due to an incomplete removal of the activator from the enzyme"
https://openalex.org/W1566087596,"Abstract A general method is described for the radioactive labeling of proteins containing terminal sialic acid in the carbohydrate moieties. Quantitative conversion of these residues to a radioactive 7-carbon analogue of sialic acid was achieved by sequential periodate oxidation and tritiated borohydride reduction. Evidence is presented to establish the identity of the radioactive derivative as 5-acetamido-3, 5-dideoxy-l-arabino-2-heptulosonic acid and to indicate it as the sole site of tritium incorporation in the carbohydrate chain. Upon injection into rats, labeled preparations of ceruloplasmin and orosomucoid exhibited a normal half-life in the plasma and proved suitable for metabolic studies. The data indicate that the 7-carbon sialic acid analogue mimics sialic acid with respect to hydrolysis by neuraminidase and in regulating survival of glycoproteins in the circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2020690996,"The rate of liberation of free acetylcholine from the surface of prostigmin-treated cerebral cortex in the freely moving cat has been determined in states of slow wave sleep, paradoxical or activated sleep, and waking. The average rate during slow wave sleep (1.2 nanograms per minute per square centimeter of cortical surface) increased during paradoxical sleep (2.2 nanograms per minute) and during waking (2.1 nanograms per minute). The rate of acetylcholine release is thus related to the electroencephalogram pattern of desynchronized activatin of the cortex rahter than to the behavioral responsiveness of the animals."

https://openalex.org/W1536204744,"Abstract The pH dependence of the steady state parameters of the glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4, from Aspergillus niger) reaction was determined by O2-monitored experiments over the entire pH range from 3 to 10 at 25°, with d-glucose as substrate. The data were fitted to a three-parameter steady state rate equation and the significance of the steady state parameters was examined by stopped flow half-reaction and turnover measurements at the extremes of the pH range used. The major conclusions from these studies can be summarized as follows. 1. At low pH, in the presence of halide, the maximum turn-over number (kcat) is determined entirely by the rate of flavin reduction (k2) in the reductive half-reaction. Furthermore, substrate combines only with an unprotonated form of the oxidized enzyme and the reductive half-reaction can be represented as follows. H+ E0 (K1)/⇄/(H+) E0 + S (k1)/⇄/(k-1) E0 - S (k2)/→ Er + δ-lactone Since kcat and k2 are both specifically decreased by halides at low pH values, it is probable that the turnover rate in the low pH range is also limited by k2 in the absence of halide. The steady state absorption spectrum of E0 - S is indistinguishable from the spectrum of E0. This finding, together with the fact that removal of the 1-hydrogen from d-glucose is a ratelimiting process in flavin reduction is consistent with both a hydride transfer mechanism and with a flavin-glucose adduct mechanism in which this adduct is relatively unstable and never accumulates significantly as a kinetic intermediate. 2. The importance of k2 as a limiting first order process in turnover diminishes as the pH is raised. Thus, at pH 10 the major first order process in turnover is the breakdown of a species of oxidized enzyme, E'0, in the oxidative half-reaction. The rate of this process at pH 10.0 is 214 sec-1, whereas k2 has a value of 800 sec-1. 3. The reduced enzyme exists in two kinetically significant states of ionization, Er and Er-. The rapid reoxidation of Er with O2, to regenerate E0, is predominant at pH values less than 7. At pH values greater than 7, a much less rapid reaction of Er- with O2, leading to the formation of E'0-, becomes increasingly important. The species E'0- is unreactive with glucose and it is the conversion of a protonated form of E'0- to E0 which principally governs kcat at pH values greater than 7. We present a complete kinetic scheme describing the effects of pH and discuss the possible chemical significance of the species E'0."
https://openalex.org/W1587835570,"Abstract Activation of skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase, which occurs when the purified enzyme is incubated with ATP, Mg2+, and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), has been shown to involve two catalytic components. One of the catalysts is a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the other is phosphorylase kinase itself. The process was elucidated in part through a study of the effects of inhibitors on the activation process. One of the inhibitors that was used is a heat-stable protein from skeletal muscle which was shown to block the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase component of the reaction, and the other inhibitor was ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetate which inhibits phosphorylase kinase. Clarification of the mechanisms operating at the phosphorylase kinase activation step makes it possible to describe more precisely how glycogenolysis is regulated by hormones, and for the first time to identify a specific site of action of cyclic AMP in a physiological process."

The enzyme consists of two subunits of identical molecular weight held together by disulfide bonds. Superoxide dismutase has been purified from bovine heart by a procedure which was previously developed for the isolation of this enzyme from bovine erythrocytes. The heart enzyme is judged to be identical with the erythrocyte enzyme on the basis of response to an unusual purification procedure, specific enzymatic activity, content of copper and zinc, molecular weight, amino acid composition, ultraviolet absorption spectrum, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. The widespread distribution of superoxide dismutase in mammalian tissues is taken as one indication of its importance to the survival of the cells which constitute these diverse tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1590115463,"Abstract Glucagon and fluoride ion stimulate the activity of a common adenyl cyclase system in plasma membranes isolated from rat liver. Their actions are noncompetitive indicating that they act at separate sites in this system. Manganous ion, above 5.0 mm, inhibited selectively the response of the enzyme to glucagon. Inorganic pyrophosphate (1.5 mm), on the other hand, inhibited the response of the enzyme to fluoride but enhanced the response to glucagon. The inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate was noncompetitive with fluoride ion. Highly purified phospholipase A caused a selective loss of the glucagon response and enhanced the stimulatory effect of fluoride ion. Treatment of liver membranes with digitonin also caused a selective loss of hormone response. Inactivation of glucagon response by digitonin was not restricted to the liver membrane adenyl cyclase system; incubation of ghosts of fat cells with digitonin resulted in loss of response of the adenyl cyclase system to glucagon, adrenocorticotropin, secretin, and epinephrine at very low concentrations of the detergent. Digitonin enhanced the response of the fat cell system to fluoride ion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, over a narrow range of concentrations, inhibited the response of liver membrane adenyl cyclase to glucagon, and enhanced the enzyme's response to fluoride ion. Other detergents caused a parallel loss of the response to both fluoride ion and glucagon. The present findings suggest that glucagon and fluoride ion activate adenyl cyclase by different mechanisms. It is possible that these agents react through different molecular entities in this complex enzyme system."

https://openalex.org/W1515830729,"Abstract Adenosine diphosphate was found to be a powerful competitive inhibitor of 5'-nucleotidase partially purified from rat heart, with a greater apparent affinity for the enzyme than ATP. The inhibition imposed by either nucleotide was not relieved by a number of metabolic intermediates known to accumulate in the hypoxic heart. The enzyme required divalent cations for activity. Magnesium relieved the nucleotide-induced inhibition completely. This relief was in part caused by the formation of nucleotide-magnesium complexes which were less inhibitory. Further increases in magnesium could relieve the inhibition imposed by the complexes. It is proposed that the regulation of this enzyme in vivo may depend on the deinhibition by magnesium."

Glycosyltransferase activities in the polyoma-transformed cells were generally reduced to between 36 and 87% of those of normal cells; however, the activity of the sialyltransferase catalyzing the formation of hematoside (N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide) from lactosylceramide and cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NAN) was reduced to about 15%. Activity of this sialyltransferase from normal cells was considerably enhanced by the addition of phosphatidyl-glycerol or cardiolipin to the incubation medium, whereas these lipids showed little or no effect on the sialyltransferase from transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561652508,"Abstract An analysis of the kinetic mechanism of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase has been carried out with highly purified preparations of the enzyme from Salmonella typhimurium. The enzyme requires both MgATP2- as a substrate and free Mg2+ ion as an essential activator. This conclusion is supported by kinetic analysis and by studies of partial inhibition of PRPP synthetase by low concentrations of Ca2+ ions in the presence of excess MgCl2. The kinetics of Mg2+ and MgATP2- interaction with PRPP synthetase in the presence of saturating concentrations of ribose 5-phosphate is consistent with random, rapid equilibrium binding of Mg2+ and MgATP2- prior to rate-limiting breakdown of the central complex to yield products. The analysis of the kinetics was greatly facilitated by a computer program which calculated free Mg2+ concentration and the concentration of three Mg2+ complexes in a system in which Mg2+ is in equilibrium with three ligands. The results of initial velocity studies of the PRPP synthesis (forward) and ATP synthesis (reverse) reactions and product inhibition studies are consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which MgATP2- binds to the enzyme first and PRPP dissociates last. A previous study of partial exchange reactions catalyzed by PRPP synthetase (Switzer, R. L., J. Biol. Chem., 245, 483 (1970)) suggested an enzyme-pyrophosphate intermediate in the reaction. However, the characteristics of the over-all exchange reactions catalyzed by the enzyme indicated that such a derivative, if it participates in the over-all reaction, is not kinetically significant as a free intermediate. The present studies confirm this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W1535964002,"Abstract Two protein phosphokinases (I and II) which show a high degree of substrate specificity for histones have been partially purified from rat mammary gland. Both enzymes are present in the cytosol, since 98% of the phosphoprotein kinase activity was recovered in the soluble fraction of mammary gland homogenates. Each enzyme incorporated the terminal phosphate of ATP into seryl and threonyl residues of all the histone fractions. The activity of protein kinase II was markedly stimulated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and the apparent Km of the enzyme was 0.03 µm for this cyclic nucleotide. The enzyme was also activated by other cyclic nucleotides with apparent Km values in the range of 1 to 3 µm. Mammary protein kinase I was not activated by cyclic nucleotides. The sedimentation constant s20,w of protein kinase I was 2.3 S, whereas that of protein kinase II was 3.2 S, as determined in isokinetic sucrose density gradients. Analysis of the 32P-histone products by amino acid analysis, tryptic peptide mapping, and electrophoretic fractionation revealed that the reactivities of the two enzymes with histones were nearly identical. Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate increased coordinately the rates of phosphorylation of all the major histone fractions by protein kinase II. This increase involved the increased rate of phosphorylation of the major phosphopeptide residues, and no new sites of phosphorylation were observed as a result of activation by this cyclic nucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W1566300810,"Abstract The effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate) on protein synthesis and release has been studied in rat anterior pituitary gland. In unstimulated pituitary halves, incorporation of radioactive amino acids is maintained at a constant level for at least 5 hours. In response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (5 mm), there is a 50 to 80% increase in the rate of incorporation into trichloracetic acid-insoluble proteins after 2 to 3 hours of incubation of male adenohypophyseal tissue. Concurrently, up to 30 min after addition of the cyclic nucleotide, there is a 275% stimulation of newly synthesized protein released into the medium, the effect being already maximal at 4 min. Actinomycin D, at a dose which inhibits RNA synthesis to less than 10% of the control rate, is without effect on the stimulatory action of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on either total protein synthesis or release. It is concluded that dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulates both protein synthesis and release in the anterior pituitary gland, the effect on protein synthesis being probably exerted at the level of translation."

https://openalex.org/W1588010863,"Abstract Rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid) inhibits the mitochondrial oxidation of reduced nicotamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) but not of succinate. The inhibition is competitive with respect to substrate and involves a block between NADH and the flavin of NADH dehydrogenase. The Ki is about 2 µm at 30°. Evidence for this localization has come from kinetic analysis of the effect of rhein on the transhydrogenation and oxidation of NADH by purified NADH dehydrogenase. Rhein inhibits at similar concentrations the NADH-ferricyanide reaction and energy-linked NAD reduction in submitochondrial particles, but in these instances a secondary, noncompetitive inhibition is also apparent. Rhein has a pronounced tendency to combine with proteins, resulting in shifts of its absorption spectrum. These spectral changes may be used to monitor the combination of rhein with submitochondrial particles and the release of rhein from NADH dehydrogenase by NAD. The displacement of rhein by NAD suggests that this inhibitor may be used as a selective probe of the active site of NADH dehydrogenase. Combination of rhein with bovine serum albumin may be used to prevent or reverse the inhibition of NADH dehydrogenase. Combination with other proteins may mask the inhibition of respiratory chain-linked NADH dehydrogenase in tissues or mitochondria having a relatively low content of NADH dehydrogenase, e.g. liver. Rhein is not entirely specific for NADH dehydrogenase; at similar concentrations it also inhibits mitochondrial transhydrogenation and DT-diaphorase and at somewhat higher concentrations lactate and malate dehydrogenases from heart muscle but is without effect on a number of other pyridine nucleotide-linked enzymes, flavoproteins, and membrane-bound enzymes tested."
https://openalex.org/W1529127010,"Abstract The effect of exogenous guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) were compared in the isolated rat liver perfused with buffer containing blood cells and albumin. Cyclic GMP was ⅓ to ½ as potent as cyclic AMP in stimulating glucose production, net glycogenolysis, glyconeogenesis from lactate, and release of K+. Cyclic GMP activated glycogen phosphorylase and inhibited the incorporation of 14C from lactate into glycogen. The effectiveness of cyclic GMP in the perfused liver was unexpected in view of its relatively weak ability to mimic cyclic AMP in broken cell preparations. Cyclic GMP did not act by raising the tissue level of cyclic AMP nor did it promote the release of cyclic AMP into the medium as did glucagon or epinephrine. Cyclic GMP was observed to accumulate in the liver to a much greater extent than cyclic AMP, and this probably accounts for its unexpected potency. The two nucleotides were removed by the liver at similar rates. Insulin inhibited the effects of submaximal concentrations of cyclic AMP on hepatic glycogenolysis, but did not alter the effects of cyclic GMP."
https://openalex.org/W1671290015,"Abstract Galactokinase has been synthesized in vitro in a coupled system for transcription and translation containing λpgal DNA and a cell-free extract prepared from a gal deletion strain of E. coli. Galactokinase synthesis requires gal operon DNA, and is stimulated 2- to 12-fold by 10-4 m cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The action of cyclic AMP requires cyclic AMP receptor protein and is completely reversed by 10-3 m cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Synthesis of galactokinase is partially inhibited by 10-4 m guanosine 3'-diphosphate, 5'-diphosphate. Galactokinase synthesis begins after a 15-min lag and is linear for 45 to 60 min at 30° and 37°. No enzyme synthesis is detected at 23°, and no enzyme is made in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, or chloramphenicol.

Appreciable amounts of alk-1-enyl-acyl and alkyl-acyl analogues of phosphoglycerides are present in both membranes. The individual phosphoglycerides show distinct patterns of ether analogues. The proportion of ether analogues is not different in nuclear membranes and plasma membranes. Similar characteristics are found in the fatty acid residues of the phosphoglycerides. Quantitative evaluation of the lipid data for whole cells, nuclear membranes, and plasma membranes is in correspondence with the 1:1 surface ratio of both membrane classes in this cell."

The particulate form of the enzyme may be attached to fragments of the cell envelope. PR transferase activity of the particulate enzyme aggregate is partly masked. Other properties of the two forms are similar. The particulate enzyme was solubilized by repeated washing or by treatment with trypsin or crude lipase. Lipase- and trypsin-treated enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and appeared to be similar. Both lacked PR transferase activity. The molecular weights of the lipase- and trypsintreated enzymes were approximately 141,000 compared with approximately 261,000 for the untreated enzyme aggregate. This decrease is accounted for by digestion of PR transferase chains of molecular weight approximately 62,000 to molecular weight of about 15,000 to 19,000. The digested PR transferase polypeptide chain of molecular weight approximately 15,000 to 19,000 contains a functional glutamine site and interacts with anthranilate synthetase Component I to give a functional glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthetase activity that is indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W17959007,DNA-RNA hybridization experiments show that transcription of the gal operon is regulated by cyclic AMP as well as inducer.

The molecular weight of the fused enzyme subunit is the sum of the weights of the wild type aminotransferase subunit and of the wild type dehydrogenase subunit as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. All three proteins are isolated primarily as dimers, with molecular weights of 59,000 (aminotransferase), 84,000 (dehydrogenase), and 140,000 (fused enzyme). With respect to its aminotransferase activity, the fused enzyme does not differ significantly from the wild type enzyme in stability to heat, Vmax, Km for substrates histidinol phosphate and α-ketoglutarate, and absorption spectrum. With respect to its dehydrogenase activity, the fused enzyme is more labile to heat than is the wild type enzyme, and has a 7-fold higher Km for l-histidinol. Its Km for NAD is not altered. The remarkable functional integrity of both dehydrogenase and aminotransferase catalytic activities in the fused enzyme and the retention of dimeric structure suggest that the information for normal folding of the two single proteins is preserved when the two polypeptide chains are covalently fused."

The reaction is experimentally irreversible. Initial velocity studies with DPN and two different aldehyde substrates, and equilibrium dialysis experiments with DPN, indicate that the substrates bind in a compulsory order; aldehyde and enzyme interact to make a binary complex which, in turn, forms a ternary complex with DPN. The equilibrium dialysis experiments were complicated by the ubiquitous presence of contaminating aldehydes and were made possible by the inclusion of a DPN-regenerating system. DPNH behaves as a competitive inhibitor of DPN and combines only with the enzyme aldehyde complex. Since neither of the pyridine nucleotides forms a binary complex with enzyme, the data fit a model in which aldehyde binds first while acid dissociates last."

This material was compared to native nuclease-T', the complex of native fragments nuclease-T-(6–48) and nuclease-T-(49–149). The semisynthetic enzyme derivative has about 90% of the enzymic activity of the native complex against both natural and synthetic substrates, including yeast RNA, heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, and deoxythymidine 3'-phosphate-5'-p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The Km at 24.3° for this last substrate is 2.2 x 10-4 m for the semisynthetic complex, as compared to 2.1 x 10-4 m for the native. In addition, semisynthetic nuclease-T' is closely similar to native nuclease-T' in tryptophanyl fluorescence emission spectral characteristics, temperature dependence of enzymic activity, and stabilization against proteolytic digestion by the ligands deoxythymidine-3',5'-diphosphate (an inhibitor) and Ca++ (essential for activity). All of the catalytic and structural properties thus show the essential identity of semisynthetic nuclease-T' with the native enzyme derivative."
https://openalex.org/W1505500482,"Abstract Uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase, upon incubation with uridine diphosphate glucose or uridine triphosphate, forms a complex which is stable to Sephadex chromatography. Both the uridine portion of uridine triphosphate or uridine diphosphate glucose and the inorganic pyrophosphate or glucose portion of each molecule migrate with the enzyme and cannot be separated by Sephadex chromatography. The amount of substrate bound to the enzyme appears to be dependent upon the stage of aggregation of the protein and has varied experimentally from 5.5 to 10.7 moles per mole of enzyme. Since there are 8 subunits per mole of enzyme, it is likely that 1 mole of substrate is bound per subunit. Uridine monophosphate, inorganic pyrophosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate do not migrate with the enzyme under the same conditions. Glucose 1-phosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate will, however, react with the uridine triphosphate or uridine diphosphate glucose complex and migrate with the enzyme on Sephadex, suggesting the formation of a complex by an exchange reaction. Thus, a compulsory order of substrate binding appears likely. Calf liver pyrophosphorylase has been shown to exist in solution as a complex-polymerizing system of protomers. The environmental factors which control the state of aggregation of the enzyme have not been well defined, but important parameters seem to be specific ions, ionic strength, pH, and concentration of protein.

https://openalex.org/W188365039,"A wild strain of Escherichia coli utilizes glucose 1-phosphate by hydrolysis of the ester at the cell surface, after which the glucose moiety but not the phosphate group enters the cell. However, when these cells are induced by treatment with glucose 6-phosphate, they are able to take up both glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate without preliminary hydrolysis. Mutant strains of E. coli that lack Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system are unable to grow in the presence of glucose or glucose 1-phosphate as a carbon source. These strains show uptake of 14C-glucose 1-phosphate after being induced with glucose 6-phosphate. Mutant strains have been isolated that lack Enzyme I and are constitutive for the hexose phosphate transport system. They can grow on glucose 6-phosphate or glucose 1-phosphate, but not on glucose as carbon source. In these strains the uptake of 14C-glucose 1-phosphate involves entry of the entire molecule, and uptake is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. It is concluded that glucose 1-phosphate may be used by E. coli after preliminary hydrolysis by a surface phosphatase which is effective at neutral pH. In addition, glucose 1-phosphate is a substrate, but not an inducer, for the hexose phosphate transport system that is active with glucose 6-phosphate and related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2013812419,"Determination of dissociation constants by two different methods yield the following mean values in 20 millimolar phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 degrees C: 0.27 micromolar for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH); 0.29 micromolar for NADH with deuterium in the nicotinamide 4-B position (B-NADD); and 0.46 micromolar for NADH with deuterium in the nicotinamide 4-A position (A-NADD). These results indicate that dehydrogenases are capable of recognizing and distinguishing the appropriate hydrogen in the coenzyme already in the initial binding reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1895451657,"Complete pancreatic RNase digestion was carried out on twice purified nucleolar 28 S RNA of Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells which were highly labeled in vitro with 32P-orthophosphate. The resultant oligonucleotides of the digests were separated into well defined peaks by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 at pH 7.6. Peak 8 containing octanucleotides and Peak 7 containing heptanucleotides were rechromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 at pH 3.3. By this procedure, octanucleotides and heptanucleotides were resolved into seven and eight major peaks, respectively. The hexanucleotides were separated into 12 spots by two-dimensional paper electrophoresis. On the basis of an estimated chain length of 4500 nucleotides for nucleolar 28 S, the calculated numbers of isopliths were in close agreement with the numbers of components isolated at acid pH. Sequence studies were carried out on the octa-, hepta-, and hexanucleotides by means of nucleotide analysis, complete digestion with T1 RNase and partial digestion with spleen phosphodiesterase. The polypurine sequences in nucleolar 28 S RNA defined thus far are the octanucleotides: G-A-A-A-A-G-A-Cp, G-A-A-G-A-A-G-Cp, G-A-G-G-A-A-G-Cp, and G-A-A-A-G-A-G-Up; the heptanucleotides A-A-G-A-A-G-Cp and G-G-G-G-G-G-Up; and the hexanucleotides G-G-G-G-G-Up, A-A-A-A-G-Cp and A-A-G-A-A-Cp. The octanucleotide G-A-G-G-A-A-G-Cp appears three times in the molecule. Interestingly, none of the sequences found are identical with those reported to be present in bacterial or viral RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1502485930,"Abstract ATP and ADP inactivate rabbit liver fructose 1, 6-diphosphatase and change the nature of inhibition by AMP from sigmoidal to hyperbolic, with a concomitant increase in sensitivity to the inhibitor. 3-Phosphoglycerate both prevents and reverses the inactivation and restores the sigmoidal inhibition characteristics. The above kinetic behavior, which was observed with physiological concentrations of liver metabolites, together with the known upward flux in 3-phosphoglycerate concentration during gluconeogenesis may provide a possible physiological mechanism for regulation of liver fructose 1, 6-diphosphatase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1669048840,"Abstract A nucleotidyltransferase associated with the chromatinrich fraction of sugar beet tissue has been isolated. The product of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is a ribohomopolymer. The reaction requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. In the presence of Mg2+ only CTP is utilized as substrate, however, in the presence of Mn2+, ATP, GTP, and UTP are also utilized but much less than CTP. When Mg2+ is present at optimal concentration (37.5 mm) the addition of Mn2+ to the reaction inhibits CMP incorporation. Incorporation of CMP is inhibited by DNase I, trypsin, other nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, GTP, and UTP), and inorganic pyrophosphate, but not by pancreatic RNase and actinomycin D. It is concluded that the enzyme activity can be classified as a CTP-polymerase."
