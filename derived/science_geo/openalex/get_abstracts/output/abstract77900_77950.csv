https://openalex.org/W1974727605,"RECENT developments in the preparation, of polyamide layers in our laboratory have facilitated the application of polyamide layer chromatography to many kinds of compounds besides phenolic compounds; for example, DNP amino-acids1, oestrogens2, chloramphenicol derivatives3, sulphonamides4 and indole derivatives5 have been successfully separated. Here I shall describe its application to the analysis of certain synthetic food colours. All of them have functional groups which form hydrogen bonds with polyamide."

https://openalex.org/W2090927588,"PHAGOCYTOSIS and intracellular digestion of bacteria have been investigated primarily with blood leucocyte or peritoneal macrophages derived from experimental animals. Many attempts have been made to isolate the intracellular events by the addition of bactericidal concentrations of streptomycin to the extracellular menstruum after the phagocytic cells have ingested the bacterial particles. The assumption made is that streptomycin by virtue of its relative impermeability exerts no bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect on those bacteria which are established intracellularly. Data concerning penetration of streptomycin into mammalian cells, however, are not consistent and seem to depend on the types of cell and the methods of assay for streptomycin which are used. The general conclusion is that the antibiotic is not concentrated intracellularly in quantities large enough to be bactericidal1–3. A critical examination of the data, however, shows that such a conclusion may not be entirely warranted in all cases4–7, and consequently the extent of bactericidal activity which streptomycin exhibits for intracellular bacteria remains conjectural."

https://openalex.org/W1994667403,"THE “giant micro-organism” Caryophanon latum was first described by Peshkoff as the “missing link” between the blue-green algae and the bacteria. He isolated the microorganism from cow manure near Moscow, noting its unusual morphology including “its long rod forms containing a varying number of nuclei”1. Others have since isolated this organism in England and in the United States2,3. Pringsheim and Robinow have described this micro-organism. Caryophanon latum Peshkoff as “a very large Gram negative, peritrichously flagellated bacterium of unusual structural complexity”2. On the other hand, Provost and Doetsch reported the organism to be a Gram positive bacterium, susceptible to egg-white lysozyme and able to form protoplasts readily4. The work described here was designed to obtain further evidence as to the bacterial nature of the micro-organism by analysing the isolated and purified cell walls of Caryophanon latum for its constituent amino sugars, amino acids and monosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W2009810408,THE insecticidal activity of certain N-acyl N-methyl-carbamate insecticides has been reported recently by Fraser et al.1. Reay and Lewis2 showed that the N-acetyl derivative of 1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate (carbaryl) was nearly 100 times less inhibitory towards honeybee head cholinesterase (ChE) in vitro than the parent compound (see also Table 1). It is the purpose of this communication to report that the N-acylation of several other N-methylcarbamates leads to a marked reduction in in vitro anticholinesterase activity against honeybee head ChE.

https://openalex.org/W2051115622,"STUDIES have been reported of a bacteriogenic transfusion reaction1 in which the recipient's red cells became poly-agglutinable, apparently as a result of the presence of a species of Bacillus in the donor bottle which was capable of altering erythrocytes in vitro in a similar way. It was suggested that modification of the cells by bacterial antigen with subsequent haemolysis by “normal” anti-bacterial antibody might provide the mechanism for such reactions. In further investigations2, heterogenetic antigens from various genera and species of Gram-positive bacteria were examined, some prepared by the methods of Rantz3 and Neter4, and were shown to react with anti-bacterial antibodies found in normal human sera. Crude preparations of at least two such antigens, present in bacilli and in Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a third, found only in Streptococcus, reacted with antibodies in sera of practically 100 per cent of apparently normal persons. Whether this high frequency of reactivity resulted from the cumulative effect of several antibody specificities or from a single specificity was re-examined with purified antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2063347693,"WHEN small insects are injected with labelled metabolites trouble is caused by mechanical damage, excessive bleeding, clogging of the needle, and the serious distortion of metabolism which results from the sudden administration of up to 20 per cent of the insect's weight of water plus 10–60 µmoles of metabolite/g of live weight. One way to overcome these difficulties would be to make a fat-soluble acetate precursor which could be applied directly to the cuticle in the same way as an insecticide. The use of n-decyl 1-14C-acetate prepared by direct esterification of n-decyl alcohol has been investigated. No effect on mortality, pupation or emergence was found to result from topical application of acetone solutions, or even up to 1 µl. of undiluted n-decyl acetate, to larvae of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala."
