https://openalex.org/W2905851496,"We present sample transfer instrumentation and integrated protocols for the preparation and atom probe characterization of environmentally-sensitive materials. Ultra-high vacuum cryogenic suitcases allow specimen transfer between preparation, processing and several imaging platforms without exposure to atmospheric contamination. For expedient transfers, we installed a fast-docking station equipped with a cryogenic pump upon three systems; two atom probes, a scanning electron microscope / Xe-plasma focused ion beam and a N2-atmosphere glovebox. We also installed a plasma FIB with a solid-state cooling stage to reduce beam damage and contamination, through reducing chemical activity and with the cryogenic components as passive cryogenic traps. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new laboratory protocols by the successful preparation and transfer of two highly contamination- and temperature-sensitive samples—water and ice. Analysing pure magnesium atom probe data, we show that surface oxidation can be effectively suppressed using an entirely cryogenic protocol (during specimen preparation and during transfer). Starting with the cryogenically-cooled plasma FIB, we also prepared and transferred frozen ice samples while avoiding significant melting or sublimation, suggesting that we may be able to measure the nanostructure of other normally-liquid or soft materials. Isolated cryogenic protocols within the N2 glove box demonstrate the absence of ice condensation suggesting that environmental control can commence from fabrication until atom probe analysis."

Vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs) are among the most common and severe neonatal brain arterio-venous malformations, shunting arterial blood into the brain's deep venous system through aberrant direct connections. Exome sequencing of 55 VOGM probands, including 52 parent-offspring trios, revealed enrichment of rare damaging de novo mutations in chromatin modifier genes that play essential roles in brain and vascular development. Other VOGM probands harbored rare inherited damaging mutations in Ephrin signaling genes, including a genome-wide significant mutation burden in EPHB4. Inherited mutations showed incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, with mutation carriers often exhibiting cutaneous vascular abnormalities, suggesting a two-hit mechanism. The identified mutations collectively account for ∼30% of studied VOGM cases. These findings provide insight into disease biology and may have clinical implications for risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2905667956,"Background There has been a notable expansion in routine health care in sub-Saharan Africa. While heath care is nominally free in many contexts, the time required to access services reflects an opportunity cost that may be substantial and highly gendered, reflecting the gendered nature of health care guidelines and patterns of use. The time costs of health care use, however, have rarely been systematically assessed at the population-level. Methods Data come from the 2015 wave of a population-based cohort study of young adults in southern Malawi during which 1,453 women and 407 men between the ages of 21 and 31 were interviewed. We calculated the time spent seeking health care over a two-month period, disaggregating findings by men, recently-pregnant women, mothers with children under two years old, and “other women”. We then extrapolated the time required for specific services to estimate the time that would be needed for each subpopulation to meet government recommendations for routine health services over the course of a year. Results Approximately 60% of women and 22% of men attended at least one health care visit during the preceding two months. Women spent six times as long seeking care as did men (t = -4.414, p<0.001), with an average 6.4 hours seeking care over a two-month period compared to 1 hour for men. In order to meet government recommendations for routine health services, HIV-negative women would need to spend between 19 and 63 hours annually seeking health care compared to only three hours for men. An additional 40 hours would be required of HIV-positive individuals initiating antiretroviral care. Conclusions Women in Malawi spend a considerable amount of time seeking routine health care services, while men spend almost none. The substantial time women spend seeking health care exacerbates their time poverty and constrains opportunities for other meaningful activities. At the same time, few health care guidelines pertain to men who thus have little interaction with the health care system. Additional public health strategies such as integration of services for those services frequently used by women and specific guidelines and outreach for men are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2906122346,"The burden of liver disease continues to increase in the UK, with liver cirrhosis reported to be the third most common cause of premature death. Iron overload, a condition that impacts liver health, was traditionally associated with genetic disorders such as hereditary haemochromatosis, however, it is now increasingly associated with obesity, type-2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of elevated levels of liver iron within the UK Biobank imaging study in a cohort of 9108 individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken at the UK Biobank imaging centre, acquiring a multi-echo spoiled gradient-echo single-breath-hold MRI sequence from the liver. All images were analysed for liver iron and fat (expressed as proton density fat fraction or PDFF) content using LiverMultiScan. Liver iron was measured in 97.3% of the cohort. The mean liver iron content was 1.32 ± 0.32 mg/g while the median was 1.25 mg/g (min: 0.85 max: 6.44 mg/g). Overall 4.82% of the population were defined as having elevated liver iron, above commonly accepted 1.8 mg/g threshold based on biochemical iron measurements in liver specimens obtained by biopsy. Further analysis using univariate models showed elevated liver iron to be related to male sex (p 5.6% PDFF) was associated with a slight increase in prevalence of elevated liver iron (4.4% vs 6.3%, p = 0.0007). This study shows that population studies including measurement of liver iron concentration are feasible, which may in future be used to better inform patient stratification and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2906356083,"Background The long-term trajectories of prolonged grief are poorly understood. The aims were to examine the course of grief among bereaved disaster survivors up to six years post loss and factors predicting worse bereavement outcome. A third aim was to explore differences in grief indicators between trajectories. Methods Bereaved Swedish tourists who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis responded to surveys including the Inventory of Complicated Grief 1 to 6 years after the disaster. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify longitudinal trajectories of grief. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of class membership. Results Three trajectories were identified: resilient (41% of the sample), recovering (48%), and chronic (11%). The strongest predictor of chronic grief was the loss of one’s child. When examining grief indicators, the chronic trajectory was characterized by not accepting the loss, while yearning was common in all trajectories. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering how traumatically bereaved individuals can be affected by loss for several years after a disaster, especially after losing one’s child. An inability to accept the loss, more so than yearning, appears to characterize bereaved survivors at risk of a chronic trajectory of grief."
https://openalex.org/W2906492750,"Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is a complex component of air pollution that is a composed of inorganic and organic constituents. The chemically-extracted organic fraction (OF) of PM excludes inorganics but retains most organic constituents like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are ubiquitous environmental toxicants and known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. The AHR is a ligand activated transcription factor that responds to endogenous ligands and exogenous ligands including PAHs. Activation of the AHR leads to upregulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolizing enzymes which are important for the biotransformation of toxicants to less toxic, or in the case of PAHs, more toxic intermediates. Additionally, the AHR plays an important role in balancing regulatory and effector T cell responses. This study aimed to determine whether PAHs present in PM aggravate inflammation by driving inflammatory T cell and dendritic cell (DC) responses and their mechanism of action. This study tests the hypothesis that PAHs present in PM activate the AHR and alter the immune balance shifting from regulation to inflammation. To test this, the effects of SRM1649b OF on T cell differentiation and DC function were measured in vitro. SRM1649b OF enhanced Th17 differentiation in an AHR and CYP-dependent manner and increased the percent of IFNγ positive DCs in an AHR-dependent manner. SRM1649b PAH mixtures enhanced Th17 differentiation in an AHR-dependent but CYP-independent manner and increased the percent of IFNγ positive DCs. Cumulatively, these results suggest that PAHs present in PM are active components that contribute to immune responses in both T cells and BMDCs through the AHR and CYP metabolism. Understanding the role of AHR and CYP metabolism of PAHs in immune cells after PM exposure will shed light on new targets that will shift the immune balance from inflammation to regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2906155862,"Analysing the effect water temperature has on Daphnia magna is essential in anticipating the impact climate change will have on this freshwater zooplanktonic keystone species. While many authors have followed this line of research, few have covered an extensive temperature range or complex temperature change scenarios. Global warming is mostly associated with increased extreme temperature events, such as heat waves, as well as earlier and more intense thermal stratification. Both of these events may directly influence D. magna fitness, especially in those populations performing diel vertical migration (DVM). We analysed the effect water temperatures, ranging from 11 to 29°C, have on the filtration capacity (FC) of D. magna, to anticipate the effects of acclimation, temperature change rate (TCR) and potential reversibility of responses to such conditions. Results show that sudden temperature changes have an immediate negative impact on the FC of D. magna and is more severe at higher temperatures and higher TCRs. However, D. magna individuals have shown themselves to be capable of quasi-acclimating to temperatures ranging from 11 to 25°C in around a week and achieving much higher FCs; albeit never reaching the optimal FC achieved at 20°C. That said, 29°C is lethal for D. magna individuals within approximately five days. Finally, non-optimal temperature acclimated individuals can recover maximal FC within 2-4 days of the optimal long-term acclimation temperature (20°C) being re-established, thus proving temperature responses to be reversible."

Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to determine the factor structure of the Grit-S. The resulting model was tested by multi-group CFA for the factorial invariance of the Grit-S across genders and age groups. Results showed that the Grit-S could be best explained by a two-factor model containing consistency of interest (α = .70) and perseverance of effort (α = .75). The factor model was equivalent across genders and age groups. The scores of the Grit-S were significantly correlated with external criteria variables including mental wellbeing and job performance. Overall, our findings suggested that the Grit-S can be a promising assessment of the grit trait in Chinese employees."
https://openalex.org/W2905638509,"Aim We comprehensively analyzed how hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication by interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting-antiviral-agents (DAAs) affects liver steatosis and atherogenic risk. Methods Patients treated with IFN-free-DAAs who underwent transient elastography before and at 24-weeks post-treatment, including controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and achieved sustained viral response (SVR) were enrolled. The association between changes in liver steatosis, lipid-metabolism, and genetic and clinical factors was analyzed. Results A total of 117 patients were included. The mean CAP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly elevated at SVR24. However, baseline LDL-C and CAP values were significantly negatively correlated with changes in these values after HCV eradication, indicating that in patients with high baseline values, the values generally decreased after HCV eradication. Mean small-dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), which has greater atherogenic potential, was significantly elevated only in patients with both dyslipidemia (LDL-C >140 mg/dL) and liver steatosis (CAP >248 dB/m) at SVR24. Those patients had significant higher baseline BMI, LDL-C, and total-cholesterol levels. Conclusions Generally, successful HCV eradication by IFN-free-DAAs decreases CAP and LDL-C in patients with high baseline values. However, elevated LDL-C was accompanied with elevated sdLDL-C only in patients with liver steatosis and dyslipidemia at SVR24; therefore, those patients may require closer monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2905685521,"Maternal lipid profiles during pregnancy are associated with risk for preterm birth. This study investigates the association between maternal dyslipidemia and subsequent preterm birth among pregnant women in the state of California. Births were identified from California birth certificate and hospital discharge records from 2007-2012 (N = 2,865,987). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks completed gestation and dyslipidemia was defined by diagnostic codes. Subtypes of preterm birth were classified as preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), spontaneous labor, and medically indicated, according to birth certificate data and diagnostic codes. The association between dyslipidemia and preterm birth was tested with logistic regression. Models were adjusted for maternal age at delivery, race/ethnicity, hypertension, pre-pregnancy body mass index, insurance type, and education. Maternal dyslipidemia was significantly associated with increased odds of preterm birth (adjusted OR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.39, 1.59). This finding was consistent across all subtypes of preterm birth, including PPROM (adjusted OR: 1.54, 95%CI: 1.34, 1.76), spontaneous (adjusted OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.39, 1.65), and medically indicated (adjusted OR: 1.454, 95%CI: 1.282, 1.649). This study suggests that maternal dyslipidemia is associated with increased risk for all types of preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W2905889599,"We recently identified a novel vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) clone ST736 with reduced daptomycin susceptibility. The objectives of this study were to assess the population dynamics of local VREfm strains and genetic alterations predisposing to daptomycin resistance in VREfm ST736 strains. Multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide variant data were derived from whole-genome sequencing of 250 E. faecium isolates from 1994-1995 (n = 43), 2009-2012 (n = 115) and 2013 (n = 92). A remarkable change was noticed in the clonality and antimicrobial resistance profiles of E. faecium strains between 1994-1995 and 2013. VREfm sequence type 17 (ST17), the prototype strain of clade A1, was the dominant clone (76.7%) recognized in 1994-1995. By contrast, clone ST736 accounted for 46.7% of VREfm isolates, followed by ST18 (26.1%) and ST412 (20.7%) in 2013. Bayesian evolutionary analysis suggested that clone ST736 emerged between 1996 and 2009. Co-mutations (liaR.W73C and liaS.T120A) of the liaFSR system were identified in all ST736 isolates (n = 111, 100%) examined. Thirty-eight (34.2%) ST736 isolates exhibited daptomycin-resistant phenotype, of which 13 isolates had mutations in both the liaFSR and cardiolipin synthase (cls) genes and showed high level of resistance with a daptomycin MIC50 of 32 μg/mL. The emergence of ST736 strains with mutations predisposing to daptomycin resistance and subsequent clonal spread among inpatients contributed to the observed high occurrence of daptomycin resistance in VREfm at our institution. The expanding geographic distribution of ST736 strains in other states and countries raises concerns about its global dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2906233906,"Cognitive decline is a common occurrence of the natural aging process in animals and studying age-related changes in gene expression in the brain might shed light on disrupted molecular pathways that play a role in this decline. The fruit fly is a useful neurobiological model for studying aging due to its short generational time and relatively small brain size. We investigated age-dependent changes in the Drosophila melanogaster whole-brain transcriptome by comparing 5-, 20-, 30- and 40-day-old flies of both sexes. We used RNA-Sequencing of dissected brain samples followed by differential expression, temporal clustering, co-expression network and gene ontology enrichment analyses. We found an overall decline in expression of genes from the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway that occurred as part of aging. We also detected, in females, a pattern of continuously declining expression for many neuronal function genes, which was unexpectedly reversed later in life. This group of genes was highly enriched in memory-impairing genes previously identified through an RNAi screen. We also identified deficits in short-term olfactory memory performance in older flies of both sexes, some of which matched the timing of certain changes in the brain transcriptome. Our study provides the first transcriptome profile of aging brains from fruit flies of both sexes, and it will serve as an important resource for those who study aging and cognitive decline in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2906601918,"Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance accelerate atherosclerosis by an unclear mechanism. The two factors down-regulate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), an intermediary of the insulin/IGF-I signaling system. We previously reported that IRS-1 down-regulation leads to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation and that IRS-1 deletion from VSMCs in normoglycemic mice replicates this response. However, we did not determine IRS-1’s role in mediating differentiation. Here, we sought to define the mechanism by which IRS-1 maintains VSMC differentiation. High glucose or IRS-1 knockdown decreased p53 levels by enhancing MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2)-mediated ubiquitination, resulting in decreased binding of p53 to Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). Exposure to nutlin-3, which dissociates MDM2/p53, decreased p53 ubiquitination and enhanced the p53/KLF4 association and differentiation marker protein expression. IRS-1 overexpression in high glucose inhibited the MDM2/p53 association, leading to increased p53 and p53/KLF4 levels, thereby increasing differentiation. Nutlin-3 treatment of diabetic or Irs1−/− mice enhanced p53/KLF4 and the expression of p21, smooth muscle protein 22 (SM22), and myocardin and inhibited aortic VSMC proliferation. Injecting normoglycemic mice with a peptide disrupting the IRS-1/p53 association reduced p53, p53/KLF4, and differentiation. Analyzing atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic, diabetic pigs, we found that p53, IRS-1, SM22, myocardin, and KLF4/p53 levels are significantly decreased compared with their expression in nondiabetic pigs. We conclude that IRS-1 is critical for maintaining VSMC differentiation. Hyperglycemia- or insulin resistance–induced IRS-1 down-regulation decreases the p53/KLF4 association and enhances dedifferentiation and proliferation. Our results suggest that enhancing IRS-1–dependent p53 stabilization could attenuate the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hyperglycemia and insulin-resistance states.

https://openalex.org/W2905678533,"Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are helical repeat proteins that bind specific RNA sequences via modular 1-repeat:1-nucleotide interactions. Binding specificity is dictated, in part, by hydrogen bonds between the amino acids at two positions in each PPR motif and the Watson-Crick face of the aligned nucleobase. There is evidence that PPR-RNA interactions can compete with RNA-RNA interactions in vivo, and that this competition underlies some effects of PPR proteins on gene expression. Conversely, RNA secondary structure can inhibit the binding of a PPR protein to its specific binding site. The parameters that influence whether PPR-RNA or RNA-RNA interactions prevail are unknown. Understanding these parameters will be important for understanding the functions of natural PPR proteins and for the design of engineered PPR proteins for synthetic biology purposes. We addressed this question by analyzing the effects of RNA structures of varying stability and position on the binding of the model protein PPR10 to its atpH RNA ligand. Our results show that even very weak RNA structures (ΔG° ~ 0 kcal/mol) involving only one nucleotide at either end of the minimal binding site impede PPR10 binding. Analysis of binding kinetics using Surface Plasmon Resonance showed that RNA structures reduce PPR10’s on-rate and increase its off-rate. Complexes between the PPR proteins PPR10 and HCF152 and their respective RNA ligands have long half-lives (one hour or more), correlating with their functions as barriers to exonucleolytic RNA decay in vivo. The effects of salt concentration on PPR10-RNA binding kinetics showed that electrostatic interactions play an important role in establishing PPR10-RNA interactions but play a relatively small role in maintaining specific interactions once established."

A large amount of evidence demonstrates that miRNAs play important roles in vertebrate development and the expression of miRNAs is genetically programmed in spatially and temporally dependent patterns (31Sokol N.S. Small temporal RNAs in animal development.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2012; 22 (22578317): 368-37310.1016/j.gde.2012.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Pauli A. Rinn J.L. Schier A.F.

Therefore, expression profiling of miRNAs is extremely necessary to reveal the biological roles of miRNAs and miRNA-associated gene regulatory networks. However, the detection of expression patterns of miRNA in situ was technically challenging because of their small size, until development of the locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based technique (33Kloosterman W.P. Wienholds E. de Bruijn E. Kauppinen S. Plasterk R.H. In situ detection of miRNAs in animal embryos using LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes.Nat.

Protoc. 2007; 2 (17947994): 2520-252810.1038/nprot.2007.313Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The present study used LNA-modified probes of miRNAs to screen the expression of 279 miRNAs in E12.5 and E16.5 mouse embryos. By analyzing the spatiotemporal expression patterns and cellular localizations of these 279 miRNAs at different developmental stages, it revealed that many miRNAs exhibited specific expression in different anatomical structures, such as in different subtypes of neurons or brain regions, in the choroid plexus or arachnoids, as well as that restricted expression in non-nervous system tissues miRNAs. These data provide an entry point for subsequent investigations of the function of miRNAs in neural development processes. Our initial plan was to systematically examine the expression and function of miRNAs that regulate cerebral cortex development. We first performed microarray analyses of RNAs isolated from the embryonic dorsal forebrains at different stages (E12.5 and E16.5) based on the miRBase Database Release 10.0 (http://www.mirbase.org/) 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. (56Kozomara A. Griffiths-Jones S. miRBase: annotating high confidence microRNAs using deep sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24275495): D68-D7310.1093/nar/gkt1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We repeated it again through the updated miRBase Database Release 19.0 six years later and analyzed the newly discovered miRNAs (Table S1). However, microarray analysis did not provide sufficient spatial and temporal details to determine the timing and location of the miRNAs expression. Therefore, we performed further ISH analyses to ascertain the expression of the miRNAs in the developing mouse brain. We selected 279 miRNAs that exhibited signal intensities at each stage that were higher than 500 or exhibited ascending or descending expression dynamics during the process of cerebral cortex development for further ISH analysis. We first examined the accuracy of the LNA probes in the detection of specific miRNA expression in ISH experiments. We found the miR-128, miR-9, and several members of the let-7 family were abundantly expressed in the developing neocortex. When mutated, 2, 3, and 4 nucleotides of the probes for let-7b, miR-128, and miR-9, respectively, and the resultant probes did not detect any specific ISH signals (Fig. S1, A–D). Moreover, when transiently overexpressed, miRNAs in mouse embryos and the LNA probes could recognize their exogenous miRNAs, respectively. Also, the let-7a LNA probe only detected exogenous let-7a, but not let-7b, and vice versa, although let-7a and let-7b only differ in two nucleotides (Fig. S1, F–K). Additionally, when using probes generated by two different companies and with different LNA-modified sites of the same miRNA, their signal distributions were also consistent (Fig. S1E). These findings confirmed that the LNA probes for ISH could be used to examine the spatial and temporal expression patterns of miRNAs. We then proceeded to perform ISH studies using LNA-modified probes (34Obernosterer G. Martinez J. Alenius M. Locked nucleic acid-based in situ detection of microRNAs in mouse tissue sections.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 (17571058): 1508-151410.1038/nprot.2007.153Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) for different miRNAs and selected coronal head and transverse body sections (to include the brain and spinal cord, respectively) at E12.5 and coronal sections at E16.5 for the initial screening. Most miRNAs either showed ubiquitous or no detectable expression in the nervous system. For those showing specific patterns of expression, we performed a secondary screen using additional sections from other developmental stages. Overall, a total of 392 probes for 279 miRNAs and 21 control probes (randomized sequence or for mutant miRNAs) were generated and analyzed (Table S2). Neural progenitor cells in the embryonic nervous system, which include stem cells and precursors with more limited self-renewal capability and differentiation potential, mostly reside in the ventricular zones (VZ). Radial glial cells are stem cells responsible for producing most neurons for the neocortex, which arise from the dorsal telencephalon, and express a transcription factor called Pax6 (Fig. 1). We also used miR-124, a neuron-specific miRNA not expressed in the progenitor cells, to mark both the migrating neurons in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) and the mature neurons in the cortical plate (CP) (Fig. S2, A and B). Multiple miRNAs were highly expressed in the VZ of the dorsal forebrain during neurogenesis (E12.5–E16.5), including the miRNAs that were exclusively expressed in the VZ, and miRNAs that were expressed in the VZ and the CP (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Particularly, some miRNAs exhibited temporal-gradient expression patterns during neocortical development, such as miR-92a and miR-92b, which exhibited similar patterns in the microarray data (Table S1). Notably, miR-5130 was specifically expressed in the VZ. As expected, the ISH signal of miR-5130 is co-localized with Sox2, a marker for VZ neural progenitor cells, but not with intermediate progenitor cell marker Tbr2 in VZ and SVZ (Fig. S2, F–K). The neural progenitors in the VZ exhibit a remarkable feature termed interkinetic nuclear migration, in which their nuclei migrate between the apical surface and the basal part of the VZ as cell cycle progresses. S phase (DNA synthesis) nuclei are located in the basal half of the VZ, and M phase (mitotic) nuclei are largely restricted to the apical surface (36Spear P.C. Erickson C.A. Interkinetic nuclear migration: a mysterious process in search of a function.Dev.

These results indicate that the miR-5130 is specifically expressed in the VZ progenitor cells. miR-712 is another miRNA that is enriched in the germinal region throughout the entire central nervous system, and it is highly expressed in precursor cells from E11.5 to E16.5 (Fig. 1, M–O, and Fig. S2, L and M). Unlike most other miRNAs, miR-712 is derived from pre-rRNA (38Son D.J. Kumar S. Takabe W. Kim C.W. Ni C.W. Alberts-Grill N. Jang I.H. Kim S. Kim W. Won Kang S. Baker A.H. Woong Seo J. Ferrara K.W. Jo H. The atypical mechanosensitive microRNA-712 derived from pre-ribosomal RNA induces endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (24346612)300010.1038/ncomms4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and its intracellular localization is concentrated in dots, which likely exist in the nuclei rather than throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1P). miR-712 signals also existed in cortical neurons, with enrichment in layer-V of the neocortex, at E18.5 and postnatal day 1 (P1), after comparing with the markers of each layer of the neocortex (Fig. S2, L and M, and data not shown). Among the 279 screened miRNAs exhibited, differential regional enrichment in expression across the brain could be categorized using anatomical regions. miR-129-3p and miR-181b were enriched in the subpallial structures of the brain. miR-129-3p was abundantly expressed in the caudate-putamen complex (CPu) of the basal ganglia in the coronal section of E16.5 to P3 mouse telencephalon (Fig. 2, A–D). Notably, miR-129-3p was not expressed in all of the cells in the area, but rather in bundles of subpopulation cells during perinatal or early postnatal stages (Fig. 2, B and C). This result indicates the presence of cytoarchitectural differences or subdivisions in the caudate-putamen domain. miR-129-3p was also expressed in the cerebral cortex, but it was relatively weak during cortical development. miR-181b was primarily expressed in the ventral SVZ and weakly expressed in the dorsal germinal area (Fig. 2, E and F, and E′ and F′). miR-541 is another miRNA that was majorly expressed in the ventral subpallial structures, predominantly in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus of the diencephalon during E12.5 to E18.5 (Fig. 4, O and P).Figure 4miRNAs are enriched in the developing mouse hypothalamus.

Weak ISH signals of miR-708 were detected in layer VI of the neocortex (Fig. 3I). Layer VI of the cerebral cortex sends out connections to dorsal thalamus nuclei, and these results may reflect information flow within the brain. Some miRNAs were abundantly expressed in the developing thalamus, and some miRNAs were abundantly and selectively expressed in the developing hypothalamus. Coronal sections of P0 brains revealed the specific expression of miR-7a and miR-7b in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the mouse hypothalamus (Fig. 4, D and H, and Fig. S4). miR-7a was expressed in the pallidal differentiating zone and anterobasal nucleus at E12.5 (Fig. 4A). Transverse sections of E14.5 embryos revealed limited expression of miR-7a in the ventral part of the hypothalamus (Fig. 4B). Frontal and horizontal sections through the telencephalon of E16.5 mouse embryos revealed the selective expression of miR-7a in supraventricular and paraventricular nuclei (Fig. 4C and Fig. S4), according to the updated anatomic reference atlas redrawn from the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/).4miR-7b exhibited an expression pattern similar to miR-7a. Sagittal sections of E16.5 mouse brains revealed heavily enriched miR-7b in the hypothalamus region (Fig. 4G). miR-335 was primarily expressed in the posterior hypothalamic and paraventricular nucleus in E12.5, E14.5 and E16.5, and it is more obvious in the paraventricular nucleus at E18.5 (Fig. 4, I–L). Some miRNAs were expressed in special types of neurons. For example, miR-137 was enriched in the dorsolateral nucleus and the ventral posterolate"
https://openalex.org/W2905760140,"A new method is presented for describing the rate of oxygen consumption in response to progressive hypoxia. The method consists of screening candidate functions describing the relationship between Vo2 (oxygen consumption rate) and Po2 (ambient oxygen concentration) by testing each for fit to observed data for a single curve and the function that best fits is chosen using lowest AICc value as the criterion. Descriptive statistics are then extracted from the selected function that best describes the pattern present in the curve. Several new descriptive statistics for the pattern of response are proposed which are based on the null model of simple diffusion and no regulation. The method quantifies deviation from the null model at each point on the curve and measures both positive and negative deviation which occur when the curve changes more slowly or more rapidly than the null model predicts, respectively. The new descriptive statistics generalize the traditional one used in the past, the critical oxygen tension (Pc), and allow interpretation of a variety of shapes of curves which cannot be analyzed with conventional methods. Because the method is descriptive, it does not implicate any specific mechanisms in generating the response. The method is applied to data from 68 animals in 14 different species groups reported in the literature. The overall results suggest the existence of substantial diversity in response types among animals, which requires a more complex description than has traditionally been used."
https://openalex.org/W2906166748,"Global dissemination of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-producing bacteria has become a major health threat. However, there are few reports regarding the identification and characterisation of NDM-producing bacteria from West Africa, including Ghana. An Escherichia coli strain with resistance to meropenem was isolated from the Tamale Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Its identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility profile were carried out using commercial systems. The antibiotic resistance mechanism was analysed by phenotypic detection kits, PCR, and DNA sequencing. Conjugation experiments, S1 nuclease pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting were performed. Finally, the NDM-1-harbouring plasmid was characterised using next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The meropenem-resistant Escherichia coli strain EC2189 harboured blaNDM-1 and belonged to sequence type 410. blaNDM-1 was located on the IncHI type transferrable plasmid p2189-NDM (248,807 bp long), which co-carried multiple resistance genes, such as blaCTX-M-15, aadA1, aac(6')-Ib, sul3, dfrA12, and cmlA1. p2189-NDM phylogenetically differed from previously identified blaNDM-1-positive IncHI type plasmids. A truncated Tn125 containing blaNDM-1 was bracketed by an ISSm-1-like insertion sequence upstream and by a site-specific integrase downstream. To the best of our knowledge, we have, for the first time identified and molecularly characterised an NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae strain in Ghana with blaNDM-1 that had a novel genetic structure. Our findings indicate a possibility of NDM-1 dissemination in Ghana and underscore the need for constant monitoring of carbapenemase-producing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2906266456,"The peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and controls metabolism by coordinating transcriptional events. Here, we interrogated whether PGC-1α is involved in tumor growth and the metabolic flexibility of glioblastoma cells. PGC-1α was expressed in a subset of established glioma cell lines and primary glioblastoma cell cultures. Furthermore, a higher PGC-1α expression was associated with an adverse outcome in the TCGA glioblastoma dataset. Suppression of PGC-1α expression by shRNA in the PGC-1α–positive U343MG glioblastoma line suppressed mitochondrial gene expression, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and diminished oxygen as well as glucose consumption, and lactate production. Compatible with the known PGC-1α functions in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, glioblastoma cells deficient in PGC-1α displayed ROS accumulation, had reduced RNA levels of proteins involved in ROS detoxification, and were more susceptible to death induction by H2O2 compared with control cells. PGC-1αsh cells also had impaired proliferation and migration rates in vitro and displayed less stem cell characteristics. Complementary effects were observed in PGC-1α–low LNT-229 cells engineered to overexpress PGC-1α. In an in vivo xenograft experiment, tumors formed by U343MG PGC-1αsh glioblastoma cells grew much slower than control tumors and were less invasive. Interestingly, the PGC-1α knockdown conferred protection against hypoxia-induced cell death, probably as a result of less active anabolic pathways, and this effect was associated with reduced epidermal growth factor expression and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. In summary, PGC-1α modifies the neoplastic phenotype of glioblastoma cells toward more aggressive behavior and therefore makes PGC-1α a potential target for anti-glioblastoma therapies. The peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and controls metabolism by coordinating transcriptional events. Here, we interrogated whether PGC-1α is involved in tumor growth and the metabolic flexibility of glioblastoma cells. PGC-1α was expressed in a subset of established glioma cell lines and primary glioblastoma cell cultures. Furthermore, a higher PGC-1α expression was associated with an adverse outcome in the TCGA glioblastoma dataset. Suppression of PGC-1α expression by shRNA in the PGC-1α–positive U343MG glioblastoma line suppressed mitochondrial gene expression, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and diminished oxygen as well as glucose consumption, and lactate production. Compatible with the known PGC-1α functions in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, glioblastoma cells deficient in PGC-1α displayed ROS accumulation, had reduced RNA levels of proteins involved in ROS detoxification, and were more susceptible to death induction by H2O2 compared with control cells. PGC-1αsh cells also had impaired proliferation and migration rates in vitro and displayed less stem cell characteristics. Complementary effects were observed in PGC-1α–low LNT-229 cells engineered to overexpress PGC-1α. In an in vivo xenograft experiment, tumors formed by U343MG PGC-1αsh glioblastoma cells grew much slower than control tumors and were less invasive. Interestingly, the PGC-1α knockdown conferred protection against hypoxia-induced cell death, probably as a result of less active anabolic pathways, and this effect was associated with reduced epidermal growth factor expression and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. In summary, PGC-1α modifies the neoplastic phenotype of glioblastoma cells toward more aggressive behavior and therefore makes PGC-1α a potential target for anti-glioblastoma therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2906354380,"Governments, development banks, corporations, and nonprofits are increasingly considering the potential contribution of watershed conservation activities to secure clean water for cities and to reduce flood risk. These organizations, however, often lack decision-relevant, initial screening information across multiple cities to identify which specific city-watershed combinations present not only water-related risks but also potentially attractive opportunities for mitigation via natural infrastructure approaches. To address this need, this paper presents a novel methodology for a continental assessment of the potential for watershed conservation activities to improve surface drinking water quality and mitigate riverine and stormwater flood risks in 70 major cities across Latin America. We used publicly available geospatial data to analyze 887 associated watersheds. Water quality metrics assessed the potential for agricultural practices, afforestation, riparian buffers, and forest conservation to mitigate sediment and phosphorus loads. Flood reduction metrics analyzed the role of increasing infiltration, restoring riparian wetlands, and reducing connected impervious surface to mitigate riverine and stormwater floods for exposed urban populations. Cities were then categorized based on relative opportunity potential to reduce identified risks through watershed conservation activities. We find high opportunities for watershed activities to mitigate at least one of the risks in 42 cities, potentially benefiting 96 million people or around 60% of the urbanites living in the 70 largest cities in Latin America. We estimate water quality could be improved for 72 million people in 27 cities, riverine flood risk mitigated for 5 million people in 13 cities, and stormwater flooding mitigated for 44 million people in 14 cities. We identified five cities with the potential to simultaneously enhance water quality and mitigate flood risks, and in contrast, six cities where conservation efforts are unlikely to meaningfully mitigate either risk. Institutions investing in natural infrastructure to improve water security in Latin America can maximize their impact by focusing on specific watershed conservation activities either for cleaner drinking water or flood mitigation in cities identified in our analysis where these interventions are most likely to reduce risk."
https://openalex.org/W2905896125,"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is believed to be a new B vitamin-like compound, and PQQ supplementation has received attention as a possible treatment for diseases including dementia and diabetes. However, the distribution of PQQ in foods is unclear, due to the difficulty in analyzing the compound. Therefore, in this study, enzymatic and LC-MS/MS methods were optimized to enable an accurate analysis of PQQ in foods. The optimized methods were applied to the screening of foods, in which PQQ contents were identified in ng/g or ng/mL levels. Furthermore, we newly found that some foods related to acetic acid bacteria contain PQQ at 1.94~5.59 ng/mL higher than beer, which is known to contain relatively high amounts of PQQ. These results suggest that the optimized methods are effective for the screening of foods containing PQQ. Such foods with high PQQ content may be valuable as functional foods effective towards the treatment of certain diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2906506255,"Leaves represent the main resource for herbivorous insects and their performances are mainly a function of leaf nutritional quality. Two feeding strategies are known to optimize the exploitation of leaf resources: leaf-miners that selectively feed on tissues of high nutritional quality and gall-inducers that induce the development of a new tissue showing an enhanced nutritional value. Some leaf-miners are known to also manipulate their nutritional environment, but do not affect plant development. Cases of callus proliferation in leaf-mines have been reported, however, the direct role of the insect in the formation of additional plant cells and the nutritional function of this tissue have never been established. Using an experimental approach, we show that leaf-mining larvae of micromoth, Borboryctis euryae (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), that grow on Eurya japonica (Pentaphylacaceae), actively induce callus proliferation within their leaf-mine at the fourth instar. We experimentally demonstrated that, at this developmental stage, the larva feeds exclusively on this newly formed tissue and feeding of the tissue is essential for completing larval stage. Phenological census revealed considerable expansion and variation of fourth instar duration caused by the continuous production of callus. We propose here the “cornucopia” hypothesis which states that the newly produced callus induced by the leaf-mining larvae provides virtually unending nourishment, which in turn allows flexible larval development time. This represents the first example of a leaf-miner manipulating plant development to its benefit, like a gall-inducer. We propose to name this life style “mine-galler”."
https://openalex.org/W2905609750,"Ginkgo biloba (EGb761) is a widely used botanical drug. Several reports indicate that EGb761 confers preventive as well as anti-tumorigenic properties in a variety of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We here evaluate functional effects and molecular alterations induced by EGb761 in hepatoma cells and non-malignant hepatocytes. Hepatoma cell lines, primary human HCC cells and immortalized human hepatocytes (IH) were exposed to various concentrations (0–1000 μg/ml) of EGb761. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated after 72h of EGb761 exposure. Response to oxidative stress, tumorigenic properties and molecular changes were further investigated. While anti-oxidant effects were detected in all cell lines, EGb761 promoted anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects mainly in hepatoma cells. Consistently, EGb761 treatment caused a significant reduction in colony and sphere forming ability in hepatoma cells and no mentionable changes in IH. Transcriptomic changes involved oxidative stress response as well as key oncogenic pathways resembling Nrf2- and mTOR signaling pathway. Taken together, EGb761 induces differential effects in non-transformed and cancer cells. While treatment confers protective effects in non-malignant cells, EGb761 significantly impairs tumorigenic properties in cancer cells by affecting key oncogenic pathways. Results provide the rational for clinical testing of EGb761 in preventive and therapeutic strategies in human liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2905983326,"Genetic factors are an important cause of idiopathic sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI). From the epidemiological perspective, mutations of three deafness genes: GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1, are much more prevalent than those of other genes worldwide. However, mutation spectra of common deafness genes differ remarkably across different populations. Here, we performed comprehensive genetic examination and haplotype analyses in 188 unrelated Mongolian families with idiopathic SNHI, and compared their mutation spectra and haplotypes to those of other European and Asian cohorts. We confirmed genetic diagnoses in 18 (9.6%) of the 188 families, including 13 with bi-allelic GJB2 mutations, three with bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations, and two with homoplasmic MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G mutation. Moreover, mono-allelic mutations were identified in 17 families (9.0%), including 14 with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations and three with mono-allelic SLC26A4 mutations. Interestingly, three GJB2 mutations prevalent in other populations, including c.35delG in Caucasians, c.235delC in East Asians, and c.-23+1G>A in Southwest and South Asians, were simultaneously detected in Mongolian patients. Haplotype analyses further confirmed founder effects for each of the three mutations, indicating that each mutation derived from its ancestral origin independently. By demonstrating the unique spectra of deafness-associated mutations, our findings may have important clinical and scientific implications for refining the molecular diagnostics of SNHI in Mongolian patients, and for elucidating the genetic relationships among Eurasian populations."
https://openalex.org/W2906066137,"Background Brain volume loss is an important surrogate marker for assessing disability in MS; however, contribution of gray and white matter to the whole brain volume loss needs further examination in the context of specific MS treatment. Objectives To examine whole and segmented gray, white, thalamic, and corpus callosum volume loss in stable patients receiving natalizumab for 2–5 years. Methods This was a retrospective study of 20 patients undergoing treatment with natalizumab for 24–68 months. Whole brain volume loss was determined with SIENA. Gray and white matter segmentation was done using FAST. Thalamic and corpus callosum volumes were determined using Freesurfer. T1 relaxation values of chronic hypointense lesions (black holes) were determined using a quantitative, in-house developed method to assess lesion evolution. Results Over a mean of 36.6 months, median percent brain volume change (PBVC) was -2.0% (IQR 0.99–2.99). There was decline in gray (p = 0.001) but not white matter (p = 0.6), and thalamic (p = 0.01) but not corpus callosum volume (p = 0.09). Gray matter loss correlated with PBVC (Spearman’s r = 0.64, p = 0.003) but not white matter (Spearman’s r = 0.42, p = 0.07). Age significantly influenced whole brain volume loss (p = 0.010, multivariate regression), but disease duration and baseline T2 lesion volume did not. There was no change in T1 relaxation values of lesions or T2 lesion volume over time. All patients remained clinically stable. Conclusions These results demonstrate that brain volume loss in MS is primarily driven by gray matter changes and may be independent of clinically effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2906272124,"The viridans group streptococci comprise multiple species and have gained more recognition in recent years as common etiologic agents of bacterial endophthalmitis. The purpose of this study was to identify the species of human endophthalmitis isolates of viridans streptococci and to characterize their potential virulence attributes. The species of 22 endophthalmitis strains of viridans streptococci were identified by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight. Susceptibilities to 3 antibiotics commonly used for bacterial endophthalmitis were determined. The extracellular milieu of each strain was tested for cytotoxicity of retinal pigmented epithelial cells, hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, and protease activity using gelatin zymography. Identified species were Streptococcus mitis/oralis, S. salivarius, S. vestibularis, S. parasanguinis, S. mutans, S. constellatus, and S. gordonii. One strain of S. pseudoporcinus was also identified. All strains were sensitive to vancomycin, 77% were resistant to amikacin, and 27% had intermediate resistance to ceftazidime. Extracellular milieu from all strains except one (S. pseudoporcinus) were largely devoid of toxicity to retinal pigmented epithelial cells and sheep erythrocytes. Twelve strains, 10 of which were S. mitis/oralis, produced protease activity. Interestingly, not all of the S. mitis/oralis strains were proteolytic. These findings highlight the diversity of virulence factor production in ocular strains of the viridans streptococci not only at the group level but also at the species level."
https://openalex.org/W2905724927,"Plants encode a unique group of papain-type cysteine endopeptidases (CysEP) characterized by a C-terminal KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (KDEL-CysEP) and an unusually broad substrate specificity. The three Arabidopsis KDEL-CysEPs (AtCEP1, AtCEP2, and AtCEP3) are differentially expressed in vegetative and generative tissues undergoing programmed cell death (PCD). While KDEL-CysEPs have been shown to be implicated in the collapse of tissues during PCD, roles of these peptidases in processes other than PCD are unknown. Using mCherry-AtCEP2 and EGFP-AtCEP1 reporter proteins in wild type versus atcep2 or atcep1 mutant plants, we explored the participation of AtCEP in young root development. Loss of AtCEP2, but not AtCEP1 resulted in shorter primary roots due to a decrease in cell length in the lateral root (LR) cap, and impairs extension of primary root epidermis cells such as trichoblasts in the elongation zone. AtCEP2 was localized to root cap corpses adherent to epidermal cells in the rapid elongation zone. AtCEP1 and AtCEP2 are expressed in root epidermis cells that are separated for LR emergence. Loss of AtCEP1 or AtCEP2 caused delayed emergence of LR primordia. KDEL-CysEPs might be involved in developmental tissue remodeling by supporting cell wall elongation and cell separation."
https://openalex.org/W2906017994,"Low FMR1 variants (CGGn<26) have been associated with premature ovarian aging, female infertility and poor IVF treatment success. Until now, there is little published information concerning possible molecular mechanisms for this effect. We wished to examine whether relative expression of RNA and the FMR1 gene’s fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) RNA isoforms differ in women with various FMR1 sub-genotypes (normal, low CGGn<26 and/or high CGGn≥34). This prospective cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 in a clinical research unit of the Center for Human Reproduction in New York City. The study involved a total of 98 study subjects, including 18 young oocyte donors and 80 older infertility patients undergoing routine in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. The main outcome measure was RNA expression in human luteinized granulosa cells of 5 groups of FMRP isoforms. The relative expression of FMR1 RNA in human luteinized granulosa cells was measured by real-time PCR and a possible association with CGGn was explored. All 5 groups of FMRP RNA isoforms examined were found to be differentially expressed in human luteinized granulosa cells. The relative expression of four FMR1 RNA isoforms showed significant differences among 6 FMR1 sub-genotypes. Women with at least one low allele expressed significantly lower levels of all 5 sets of FRMP isoforms in comparison to the non-low group. While it would be of interest to see whether FMRP is also decreased in the low-group we recognize that in recent years it has been increasingly documented that information flow of genetics may be regulated by non-coding RNA, that is, without translation to a protein product. We, thus, conclude that various CGG expansions of FMR1 allele may lead to changes of RNA levels and ratios of distinct FMRP RNA isoforms, which could regulate the translation and/or cellular localization of FMRP, affect the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and hormonal receptors, or act in some other epigenetic process and therefore result in the ovarian dysfunction in infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2906406968,"The Nordmøre grid and the sieve panel are two of the main devices used to reduce fish bycatch in trawl fisheries targeting shrimp species. However, even when using such devices, some small-sized fish enter the codend of the trawl together with the targeted shrimp. Therefore, bycatch reduction remains a problem in some shrimp fisheries. One such fishery is the Northeast Atlantic deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery where it is mandatory to use a Nordmøre grid. In this study, the bycatch reduction efficiencies and patterns for several fish species using the standard Nordmøre grid and an experimental sieve panel were investigated and compared. The effect of combining these devices was also explored. The bycatch reduction patterns differed significantly between the two devices and a more efficient bycatch reduction was obtained by combining them. However, while the loss of commercial-sized shrimp was only between 0 and 2% for the Nordmøre grid, it was between 37 and 56% for the tested sieve panel, making this completely unacceptable for commercial fishing. Therefore, before a sieve panel can be considered as an option for the fishery, other sieve panel designs that have a significantly lower loss of shrimp catches need to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W2906677628,"Introduction Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and gastroparesis are two types of diabetic autonomic neuropathy which could affect patients' quality of life and carry significant morbidity and mortality outcomes. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of both CAN and gastroparesis symptoms among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at primary health care level. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 adults with T2DM from April 1, 2017 to March 20, 2018. CAN was defined by the presence of any of the followings: resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension or prolonged corrected QT interval in the electrocardiogram. Gastroparesis symptoms were assessed using a validated questionnaire: the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index. Results The mean age of study participants and disease duration were 55.26 ± 10.65 years and 10.77 ± 6.89 years, respectively. CAN was present in 15.3% of the participants. Hypertension, smoking, antihypertensive use, body mass index, dyslipidemia and albuminuria were significantly higher in participants with CAN than those without CAN (p<0.05). Prolonged disease duration (p = 0.007) and hypertension (p = 0.004) were independently associated with CAN. Gastroparesis symptoms were present in 6.3% of study participants and were significantly associated with those of female gender (P<0.05). Metformin use emerged as an independent predictor of the presence of at least one symptom (p = 0.001). Conclusion Among Saudi adults with T2DM at primary care level, the prevalence of CAN is significant and is independently related to disease duration and hypertension, indicating the importance of CAN screening, especially for those with prolonged disease duration, and the importance of controlling blood pressure in order to prevent CAN or its consequences. The prevalence of gastroparesis symptoms is 6% and is independently related to metformin use, and therefore, symptomatic screening is required to decide which patients need further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2953087982,"The outer surface of insects is covered by the cuticle, which is derived from the apical extracellular matrix (aECM). The aECM is secreted by epidermal cells during embryogenesis. The aECM exhibits large variations in structure, function, and constituent molecules, reflecting the enormous diversity in insect appearances. To investigate the molecular principles of aECM organization and function, here we studied the role of a conserved aECM protein, the ZP domain protein Trynity, in Drosophila melanogaster. We first identified trynity as an essential gene for epidermal barrier function. trynity mutation caused disintegration of the outermost envelope layer of the cuticle, resulting in small-molecule leakage and in growth and molting defects. In addition, the tracheal tubules of trynity mutants showed defects in pore-like structures of the cuticle, and the mutant tracheal cells failed to absorb luminal proteins and liquid. Our findings indicated that trynity plays essential roles in organizing nano-level structures in the envelope layer of the cuticle that both restrict molecular trafficking through the epidermis and promote the massive absorption pulse in the trachea."
https://openalex.org/W2905835842,"Objective Clinician turnover is a major concern as mental health systems and organizations invest substantial resources in the implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP). In this study, we identify malleable factors associated with reduced clinician turnover during a system-wide EBP implementation initiative. Specifically, we examine how proficient organizational culture (i.e., norms and behavioral expectations that clinicians prioritize improvement in client well-being and exhibit competence in up-to-date treatment practices), EBP implementation climate (i.e., perceptions that the organization’s policies, procedures, and practices support EBP use), and change in these organizational characteristics relate to clinician turnover during a system-wide EBP transformation. Method Data were collected from 236 clinicians in 19 mental health clinics across 3 years of a system-wide EBP implementation initiative in the City of Philadelphia. Clinicians reported on proficient organizational culture and EBP implementation climate at baseline (T1) and two-year follow-up (T2). Administrators reported on clinician turnover at three-year follow-up (T3). Hypotheses were tested via multilevel mediation analyses incorporating mixed effects logistic regression models. Results Controlling for organization size, clinician job satisfaction, attitudes towards EBP, job tenure, and age, higher levels of proficient organizational culture and improvement in proficient culture from baseline to two-year follow-up predicted reduced clinician turnover in the year following; these effects were mediated by EBP implementation climate and by improvement in EBP implementation climate, respectively. Conclusions Organizations with more proficient cultures have more supportive EBP implementation climates that predict reduced clinician turnover during system-wide EBP implementation initiatives. Strategies that target these antecedents in mental health service organizations may contribute to reduced clinician turnover."

Cytochrome c Oxidase I (COI) DNA barcodes from 252 specimens collected from 10 stream sites were obtained. The combined analysis revealed 29 species, 21 genera and 11 families. Cryptic diversity was evidenced in Knodus sp.1, Aequidens epae and Copella callolepis, in which deep genetic divergence were detected (intraspecific distances: 20.48%, 7.99% and 3.77%, respectively). The putative new species showed closer relationships with their counterparts occurring in the Tapajós-Xingu water drainages."

The study was carried out over a six-year period at a large reef pass on the oceanic margin of the northern Great Barrier Reef. Over this period (February 2006 -December 2012) tidal state, moon phase and surface seawater temperature were monitored. The timing of sampling was organised to assess variation in physical environment at daily, monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. Over these time scales, temporal patterns of occurrence of 10 species of coral reef fish from 5 families representing 5 defined trophic groups were monitored. The study incorporated 1,357 underwater visual census counts involving 402,370 fish and these estimates were collated with data on tidal state, water temperature, lunar and seasonal periodicity. Aggregated boosted regression trees analysed the univariate responses of fish abundance and species richness to the variation in the physical environment of the reef pass. Flood tides or when water flows from open water through the pass and into the Moore Reef lagoon had 2.3 times as many fish and 1.75 times as many species compared to counts made on ebb tides. Fish abundance was highest in late winter and spring months (Austral calendar), but notably when water temperatures were below the long-term mean of 27°C. Multivariate regression trees and Dufrêne-Legendre indicator predicted 4 out of 10 times the occurrence of all 10 species at any temporal scale ranging from hours to years. Flood tides were the principle driver underlying the occurrence of all 10 species regardless of their trophic classification and produced distinct seasonal assemblages, indicative of fishes aggregating to forage and reproduce."
https://openalex.org/W2905848894,"The exclusive role of the medial temporal lobe in explicit memory has been questioned by several studies reporting medial temporal lobe involvement during implicit learning. Prior studies have demonstrated that hippocampal engagement is present during the implicit learning of perceptual associations, however, it is absent during learning response-related associations. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the function of the medial temporal lobe during implicit learning is related to the extraction of perceptual associations in general. While in most implicit learning tasks visual stimuli were used, the aim of the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to detect whether activations within medial temporal lobe structures are also found during implicit learning of auditory associations. In a modified version of the classical serial reaction time task, participants reacted to the presentation of five different tones. Unbeknownst to the participants, the tones were presented with an underlying sequential regularity that could be learned. To avoid an influence of response learning on acoustic associative learning, response buttons were remapped in every trial. After learning, two different tests were used to measure participants' conscious knowledge about the underlying sequence in order to assess the amount of implicit memory and to exclude participants with explicit knowledge acquired during learning. fMRI results revealed hippocampal activations for implicit learning of the acoustic sequence. When detecting a relation between implicit learning of acoustic associations and hippocampal activations, this study indicated a relation between hippocampal activations and memory formation of perceptual-based relational representation regardless of explicit knowledge. Thus, present findings suggest a general functional role for the formation of sequenced perceptual associations independent of the involvement of awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2906259253,"Mucus constitutes a protective layer which coats the gastrointestinal tract, controlling interactions of both commensal and pathogenic microbes with underlying tissues. Changes to the mucus barrier, for example due to altered mucin expression or external stimuli, may impact interactions with microbes and thus potentially contribute to altered gut homeostasis, onset of inflammation, or pathogen invasion. Food-associated stimuli, including lipids, have been shown to change mucus barrier properties and reduce transport of model drug carriers through mucus. Here, we explore the impact of lipids, specifically triglycerides in a model intestinal medium mimicking a fed state, on Escherichia coli (E. coli) transport through mucus by directly imaging swimming patterns and analyzing associated changes in mucus structure. Lipids in model fed state intestinal contents reduced E. coli speed and track linearity within mucus. These changes may be due in part to changes in molecular interactions within the mucus network as well as crowding of the mucus network by lipid emulsion droplets, which visibly stay intact in the mucus gel. In addition, observed physical interactions between bacteria and lipid structures may impact microbial speed and trajectories. As lipids are normal food components and thus represent safe, mild stimuli, these results support exploration of lipid-based strategies to alter the mucus barrier to control interactions with microbes and potentially prevent microbial invasion of underlying epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2906548976,"Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), along with its receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible (Fn)14, is associated with various biological activities including inflammation. However, its role in the pathogenesis of Graves’ orbitopathy (GO) is unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which TWEAK regulates inflammatory signaling in orbital fibroblasts from GO patients. We found that TWEAK and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFA) mRNA levels were upregulated in GO as compared to non-GO tissue samples. TWEAK, TNF receptor (TNFR)1, TNFR2, and TNFR superfamily member 12A mRNA, and TWEAK and Fn14 protein levels were increased by interleukin (IL)-1β and TNF-α treatment. Treatment with exogenous recombinant TWEAK increased the transcript and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to a greater extent in GO than in non-GO cells, while treatment with the anti-Fn14 antibody ITEM4 suppressed TWEAK-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release and hyaluronan production. Additionally, the serum level of TWEAK was higher in Graves’ disease patients with (341.86 ± 86.3 pg/ml) as compared to those without (294.09 ± 41.44 pg/ml) GO and healthy subjects (255.33 ± 39.38 pg/ml), and was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.629, P < 0.001) and thyroid binding immunoglobulin level (r = 0.659, P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that TWEAK/Fn14 signaling contributes to GO pathogenesis. Moreover, serum TWEAK level is a potential diagnostic biomarker for inflammatory GO, and modulating TWEAK activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy for suppressing inflammation and tissue remodeling in GO."

However, the optimal dose and mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood. We investigated the fate of SH6 spores in the gut of L. vannamei. Shrimp were divided into six groups administrated with either feed only (negative control) or SH6 spores at 5 × 106 CFU/g pellet (high dose, SH6 spore-H group), 1 × 106 CFU/g pellet (medium dose, SH6 spore-M group), 2 × 105 CFU/g pellet (low dose, SH6 spore-L group), astaxanthin at 0.5 mg/g pellet (Carophyll group), or carotenoids from SH6 vegetative cells at 5 μg/g pellet (SH6 carotenoid group). The growth rate was highest in SH6 spore-H (3.38%/day), followed by SH6 spore-M (2.84%/day) and SH6 spore-L (2.25%/day), which was significantly higher than the control (1.45%/day), Carophyll (1.53%/day) or SH6 carotenoid (1.57%/day) groups. The astaxanthin levels (1.9–2.0 μg/g shrimp) and red-colour scores (21–22) in SH6 spore-H/M were higher than the control (astaxanthin: 1.2 μg/g shrimp; red score: 20) or SH6 spore-L, but lower than the Carophyll and SH6 carotenoids. Feeding with medium and high doses of SH6 spores after 28 days resulted in respective 1.3-2-fold increases in phenol oxidase activity and 8–9 fold increases in Rho mRNA expression compared to the control and low dose group. The live-counts of SH6 in the gut gradually increased during the 28-day feeding period with SH6 spores at different concentrations, starting from 4.1, 8.2, and 5.4 × 104 CFU/g gut at day 1 and reaching 5.3, 5.1, and 4.4 × 105 CFU/g gut in the SH6-H/M/L groups, respectively, at day 28. Gut microbiota became more diversified, resulting in a 2-8-fold increase in total bacterial live-counts compared to the controls. SH6 spore germination was detected by measuring the mRNA expression of a specific sequence coding for SH6 amylase at 4 h, reaching saturation at 24 h. Our results confirm that SH6 spores colonize and germinate in the gut to improve the microbial diversity and boost the immune system of shrimp, exhibiting beneficial effects at >1 × 106 CFU/g pellet."
https://openalex.org/W2905993336,"Adenosine signaling is involved in glucose metabolism in hepatocytes and myocytes in vitro. However, no information is available regarding the effect of adenosine on glucose metabolism in vivo. Thus, we examined how extracellular adenosine acts on glucose metabolism using mice. Subcutaneous injections of adenosine (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg bodyweight) dose-dependently increased blood glucose levels, with the peak occurring at 30 min post injection. At 30 min after adenosine injection (25 mg/kg bodyweight), glycogen content in the liver, but not the skeletal muscle, was significantly decreased. Hepatic glycogen depletion by fasting for 12 h suppressed the increase of blood glucose levels at 30 min after adenosine injection. These results suggest that adenosine increases blood glucose levels by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis. To investigate the effect of adenosine on the adrenal gland, we studied the glycogenolysis signal in adrenalectomized (ADX) mice. Adenosine significantly increased the blood glucose levels in sham mice but not in the ADX mice. The decrease in hepatic glycogen content induced by adenosine in the sham mice was partially suppressed in the ADX mice. The level of plasma corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid in mice, was significantly increased in the sham mice by adenosine but its levels were low in ADX mice injected with either PBS or adenosine. These results suggest that adenosine promotes secretion of corticosterone from the adrenal glands, which causes hepatic glycogenolysis and subsequently the elevation of blood glucose levels. Our findings are useful for clarifying the physiological functions of adenosine in glucose metabolism in vivo."

The aim of the current study was to evaluate this association among vegetable greenhouse farmers in Yinchuan City, western China.Three consecutive cross-sectional studies were conducted in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. Face-to-face interviews by trained investigators, using questionnaires, were performed. PEI was calculated by a validated method and then categorized into high, middle and low groups. SRH was measured via a single ten-point scale question and then divided into excellent (score >5) and poor SRH (score ≤5). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association. Meanwhile, the dose-response and interaction effects were estimated.A steady association between high PEI and poor SRH (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.28 in the full model) was identified. Although high PEI was significantly associated with poor SRH in males and the Han ethnicity group, no significant association was found with poor SRH in females or those of Hui ethnicity. Interaction effects of education level and frequency of breakfast with PEI were determined (Pinteraction = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively); synergistic enhanced effects for poor SRH were observed.These findings indicate that high PEI might be associated with poor SRH among vegetable greenhouse farmers. A lower education level and never eating breakfast contributed to an increased likelihood of poor SRH in those with high PEI. The local government should be making great efforts to promote healthy behaviors and improve protection awareness."

Given the large proportion of brain death amongst road accident victims, any improvement in organ donation practices amongst this cohort could potentially address this deficit. In this study, we identify the potential areas for intervention to improve organ donation amongst professional drivers, a population more likely to suffer from road accidents.300 participants were surveyed using a structured, orally-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding organ donation. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify key variables affecting intent to practice.Nearly half our participants had unsatisfactory knowledge and attitude scores. Knowledge and attitude was positively correlated, rs (298) = .247, p < .001, with better scores associated with a higher likelihood of intent to practice organ donation [AOR: 2.23 (1.26-3.94), p = .006; AOR: 12.164 (6.85-21.59), p < .001 respectively]. Lack of family support and fear of donated organs going into medical research were the key barriers for the same [AOR: 0.43 (0.19-0.97), p = .04; AOR: 0.27 (0.09-0.85), p = .02 respectively].Targeted health-education, behaviour change communication, and legal interventions, in conjunction, are key to improving organ donor registrations."
https://openalex.org/W2906176350,"Within current theories on potential adaptive manipulation of offspring sex ratio, giving birth to a male or to a female is assumed to depend on the capacity of the mother to invest in offspring to maximize her fitness. The active role of the father in sex ratio bias at birth has been neglected until recently. The human sex ratio at birth is biased towards sons, although in occidental populations, the ratio has decreased regularly for 30 years and could be the consequence of the adverse effects of environmental chemicals on male hormones. In a Malagasy primate, the lesser mouse lemur, the potential effect of paternal testosterone levels on sex ratio bias at birth was tested on 130 litters (278 babies) produced in 52 mixed-sex groups. For each group, social dominance among males was characterized based on aggressive interactions and sexual behaviours. Using a multi correspondence analysis, high testosterone levels in grouped males, particularly those of the dominant male, were significantly correlated with more infants produced in male-biased litters, independent of the female condition. According to these results, predictions for sex ratio bias towards one sex or the other in mouse lemurs were discussed considering the influence of both parents."
https://openalex.org/W2906571748,"Chromosome organization during cell division is achieved through the timely association of proteins with chromatin and is regulated by protein phosphorylation. Kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A) plays an important role in the chromosome organization through the formation of the chromosome scaffold structure. However, the relationship between the function of KIF4A and its phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of KIF4A at S1186 is required for chromosome binding and chromosome scaffold formation. The KIF4A mutant, which is not phosphorylated at S1186, was found to localize to the nucleus during interphase but did not accumulate in the chromosome scaffold after nuclear envelope breakdown. In addition, defects in KIF4A phosphorylation were found to disrupt the interaction of KIF4A with the condensin I complex. As a result, the morphology of the chromosomes was observed to be laterally decondensed, without condensin I in the chromosome scaffold. Additionally, a defect in chromosome segregation, chromosome bridge formation, was often observed. Although both KIF4A and condensin I disappeared from the chromosomes, the chromosomal localization of condensin II was not affected. Collectively, our novel results revealed that Cdk1-dependent KIF4A phosphorylation at S1186 is a trigger for chromosomal organization during early mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2905717577,"Background We aimed to provide health practitioners greater insight into the public perception of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use. Our objectives were to identify news media reports of children abandoning conventional treatment for traditional and complementary medicine, analyze the thematic content of these news articles and estimate the tonality portrayed. Methods LexisNexis and Factiva were searched for terms related to cancer, children and T&CM. Inclusion criteria were children less than 18 years, in curative phase of treatment who attempted to abandon conventional therapy for any traditional and complementary medicine use. A secondary search was performed in LexisNexis, Factiva and Google News Archive with the names of children in identified cases. Qualitative analysis of news media reports was completed using a grounded theory approach. Quantitative analysis of article sentiment was performed using a linear support vector machine. Results Seventeen cases occurring between 2002 and 2016 were included. Five main themes were identified: treatment as torture, power imbalances, rights of parents, evidence versus beliefs and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Sentiment analysis revealed an overall negative tone, as demonstrated by 73% of the articles. Interpretation A better understanding of factors that lead to abandonment of conventional therapy for traditional and complementary medicine as portrayed in the news media may help healthcare providers prevent the occurrence of these cases."
https://openalex.org/W2905824299,"Species loss from upper trophic levels can result in some major changes in community structure and ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally excluded macroconsumers (e.g., fish and shrimp) in a Brazilian karst tropical stream during the dry season to investigate if their loss affected the accrual of calcium, dry mass (DM) and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of sediment, benthic invertebrates, and chlorophyll-a. We found that the exclusion of macroconsumers decreased accrual of calcium. The absence of fish and shrimp may have promoted increased grazing by mayflies and snails in the electrified treatment as expressed by the depressed calcium accrual and shift in periphyton community composition. However, the exclusion of macroconsumers had no effect on DM and AFDM, chlorophyll-a, or total abundance of invertebrates. Our findings shed new light on the impact of macroconsumer loss and consequences for calcium accrual in karstic streams."
https://openalex.org/W2906348881,"Pneumothorax development can cause precipitous deterioration in ICU patients, therefore quick and accurate detection is vital. Portable chest radiography is commonly performed to exclude pneumothoraces but is hampered by supine patient position and overlying internal and external material. Also, the initial evaluation of the chest radiograph may be performed by a relatively inexperienced physician. Therefore, a tool that could significantly improve pneumothorax detection on portable radiography would be helpful in patient care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of novel enhancement software for pneumothorax detection in readers with varied clinical experience of detecting/excluding pneumothoraces on portable chest radiographs in ICU patients.206 portable ICU chest radiographs, 103 with pneumothoraces, were processed with and without enhancement software and reviewed by 5 readers who varied in reading experience. Images were grouped for different complexity levels.The mean AUC for pneumothorax detection increased for 4/5 readers from 0.846-0.957 to 0.88-0.971 with a largest improvement for the reader with least experience. No significant change was noted for the reader with the longest reading experience. The image complexity had no impact on the interpretation result.Pneumothorax detection improves with novel enhancement software; the largest improvement is seen in less experienced readers."
https://openalex.org/W2906585694,"Spontaneous formation of isoaspartates (isoDs) often causes protein damage. l-Isoaspartate O-methyltransferase (PIMT) repairs isoD residues by catalyzing the formation of an unstable l-isoaspartyl methyl ester that spontaneously converts to an l-aspartyl residue. PIMTs are widely distributed in all three domains of life and have been studied most intensively in connection with their role in protein repair and aging in plants and animals. Studies of bacterial PIMTs have been limited to Escherichia coli, which has one PIMT. The α-proteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris has three annotated PIMT genes, one of which (rpa2580) has been found to be important for cellular longevity in a growth-arrested state. However, the biochemical activities of these three R. palustris PIMTs are unknown. Here, we expressed and characterized all three annotated PIMT proteins, finding that two of them, RPA0376 and RPA2838, had PIMT activity, whereas RPA2580 did not. RPA0376 and RPA2838 single- and double-deletion mutants did not differ in longevity from WT R. palustris and did not exhibit elevated levels of isoD residues in aged cells. Comparative sequence analyses revealed that RPA2580 belongs to a separate phylogenetic group of annotated PIMT proteins present in the α-proteobacteria. Our results suggest that this group of proteins is not involved in repair of protein isoD residues. In addition, the bona fide bacterial PIMT enzymes may play a different or subtler role in bacterial physiology than previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2804893853,"Tussocks are unique vegetation structures in wetlands. Many tussock species mainly reproduce by clonal growth, resulting in genetically identical offspring distributed in various spatial patterns. These fine-scale patterns could influence mating patterns and thus the long-term evolution of wetland plants. Here, we contribute the first genetic and clonal structures of two key species in alpine wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Kobresia tibetica and Blysmus sinocompressus, using > 5000 SNPs identified by 2b-RAD sequencing. The tussock-building species, K. tibetica, has a phalanx (clumping) growth form, but different genets could co-occur within the tussocks, indicating that it is not proper to treat a tussock as one genetic individual. Phalanx growth does not necessarily lead to increased inbreeding in K. tibetica. B. sinocompressus has a guerilla (spreading) growth form, with the largest detected clone size being 18.32 m, but genets at the local scale tend to be inbred offspring. Our results highlight that the combination of clone expansion and seedling recruitment facilitates the contemporary advantage of B. sinocompressus, but its evolutionary potential is limited by the input genetic load of the original genets. The tussocks of K. tibetica are more diverse and a valuable genetic legacy of former well-developed wet meadows, and they are worthy of conservation attention."
https://openalex.org/W2906510179,"Objective Urinary tract infection (UTI), one of the most common bacterial infections occurring during infancy and early childhood, is frequently associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Although several guidelines recommend performing ultrasonography as a screening test, its utility is not adequate and appropriate screening tests are strongly desirable. In this study, we evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a screening test for VUR in children with UTI. Methods We prospectively studied 108 patients with suspected UTI between April 2014 and March 2016. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and urine culture findings. We measured ureteral dilatation using MRI in 96 patients with UTI and assessed the relationship between ureteral dilatation in MRI and VUR in 46 patients who underwent voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). Results Among 108 patients, 88 and 8 were diagnosed with upper and lower UTI, respectively. Among 46 patients who underwent VCUG, 23 had VUR (14 low grade and 9 high grade). Patients with ureteral dilatation detected on MRI had VUR more frequently than those without ureteral dilatation (any grades VUR, 71% vs. 32%; P = 0.02; high-grade VUR, 38% vs. 2%, P = 0.007). Overall, ureteral dilatation findings on MRI achieved sensitivity 65.2% and specificity 73.9% as a screening test for VUR. In addition, DW-MRI achieved sensitivity 100% and specificity 81.8% in the diagnosis of upper UTI. Conclusion These findings suggested that MRI is a valuable tool for screening of VUR as well as diagnosis of upper UTI."
https://openalex.org/W2905938646,"Despite tacrolimus (TAC) drug-level monitoring, TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis remains an important problem. This study investigated the potential of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) as a chronic renal allograft fibrosis biomarker in a two-phase study (proof of concept and cohort). In the proof of concept stage of the study, increased TAC-doses at 3 days after dose adjustment compared with the baseline were associated with elevated uNGAL (+ΔuNGAL) and urinary interleukin 18 (IL-18), but normal serum creatinine (SCr), despite the therapeutic trough levels of TAC. In the cohort study, the patients with elevated uNGAL post-recruitment in comparison with the baseline (+ΔuNGAL) was associated with the more severe renal allograft fibrosis from renal pathology of the protocol biopsy at 12 months post kidney transplantation (post-KT). A cut-off value of uNGAL ≥ 125.2 ng/mL during a 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-KT was associated with a higher fibrosis score, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.88, p < 0.0001) and a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.54 (95% CI 1.45 to 9.33; p < 0.001). We conclude that uNGAL is a sensitive biomarker of TAC induced subtle renal injury and TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis. We propose that uNGAL measurements, in addition to trough levels of TAC, should be used to predict TAC-induced chronic renal allograft fibrosis in the recipients of KT."
https://openalex.org/W2906642065,"The notable increase in the size and dimensions of data have presented challenges for data storage and retrieval. The Bloom filter and its generations, due to efficient space overheads and constant query delays, have been broadly applied to querying memberships of a big data set. However, the Bloom filter and most of the variants regard each element as a 1-dimensional string and adopt multiple different string hashes to project the data. The interesting problem is when the inputs are numerical vectors with high dimensions, it remains unknown whether they can be projected into the Bloom filter in their original format. Furthermore, we investigate whether the projection is random and uniform. To address these problems, this paper presents a new uniform Prime-HD-BKDERhash family and a new Bloom filter (P-HDBF) to retrieve the membership of a big data set with the numerical high dimensions. Since the randomness and uniformity of data mapping determines the performance of the Bloom filter, to verify these properties, we first introduce information entropy. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the P-HDBF can randomly and uniformly map the data in their native formats. Moreover, the P-HDBF provides an efficient solution alternative to implement membership search with space-time overheads. This advantage may be suitable for engineering applications that are resource-constrained or identification of the nuances of the graphics and images."
