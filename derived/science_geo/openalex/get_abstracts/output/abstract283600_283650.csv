https://openalex.org/W1996892293,Petrified plant remains that composed a Permian peat deposit occur at a coal horizon in a local area of Mount Augusta near the Beardmore Glacier in Antarctica. This discovery is the first in the entire Gondwana area that yields plant materials as exquisitely preserved as the materials of the well-known coal-ball localities of the Northern Hemisphere. A sampling of anatomical details is illustrated.
https://openalex.org/W2039210308,The lunar atmosphere is the likely source of excess argon-40 in lunar surface material; about 8.5 percent of the argon-40 released into the lunar atmosphere will be implanted in the surface material by photoionization and subsequent interaction with fields in the solar wind. The atmosphere is also likely to be the source of other unexpected surface elements or of solar wind elements that impact from non-solar wind directions.
https://openalex.org/W2043599147,"An inherited factor causing the normal sex ratio of 92 percent females to drop to about 5 percent has been produced by selective breeding in a laboratory strain of the arrhenotokous parasitic wasp Dahlbominus fuliginosus (Nees) (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae). The factor is known to be of genetic origin and is sex-limited, being transmitted by females to their sons. Its effect on the sex ratio is constant and not influenced by the female parent, the host, or the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2050195191,"Color centers in amethyst are produced by the action of ionizing radiation on precursor centers that arise from substitution of Fe+3 for Si+4 in the Î±-quartz structure. These Fe+3 centers provide the dominant features of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of amethyst. The three equivalent Si+4 sites are unequally occupied by Fe+3, a circumstance that explains the optical biaxiality of amethyst."

https://openalex.org/W2153558731,"The age of trees growing on the moraines of a small, high-altitude glacier in the Canadian Rockies suggests that the date of the maximum post-Pleistocene ice advance was around A.D. 1714, with another later advance about 1832. These two dates are synchronous with the two major periods of recent ice advance in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2063616952,"The intensity and spectrum of solar neutrons in the vicinity of the earth are calculated on the assumption that the low-energy protons recently detected in balloon and satellite flights are products of solar neutron decay. The solar-neutron flux thus obtained exceeds the global average cosmic-ray neutron leakage above 10 Mev, indicating that it may be an important source of both the inner and outer radiation belts. Neutron measurements in the atmosphere are reviewed and several features of the data are found to be consistent with the estimated solar neutron spectrum."

https://openalex.org/W2066677737,"Marine assemblages of foraminifera, ostracods, mollusks, and echinoids were recovered from deposits stratigraphically beneath the classic vertebrate assemblages from the tar pits at Rancho La Brea. The marine fossils indicate deposition in quiet, shallow water and suggest that accumulation of the type Rancholabrean material began during Wisconsin time."
