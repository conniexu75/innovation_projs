https://openalex.org/W2068878293,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections, and comprise nearly 8% of the human genome. The most recently acquired human ERV is HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor. Unlike most other human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins. However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host, with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours, melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here we demonstrate that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells. Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development."

https://openalex.org/W1969412365,"About half of human genes use alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (ApA) to generate messenger RNA transcripts that differ in the length of their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) while producing the same protein. Here we show in human cell lines that alternative 3' UTRs differentially regulate the localization of membrane proteins. The long 3' UTR of CD47 enables efficient cell surface expression of CD47 protein, whereas the short 3' UTR primarily localizes CD47 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. CD47 protein localization occurs post-translationally and independently of RNA localization. In our model of 3' UTR-dependent protein localization, the long 3' UTR of CD47 acts as a scaffold to recruit a protein complex containing the RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAVL1) and SET to the site of translation. This facilitates interaction of SET with the newly translated cytoplasmic domains of CD47 and results in subsequent translocation of CD47 to the plasma membrane via activated RAC1 (ref. 5). We also show that CD47 protein has different functions depending on whether it was generated by the short or long 3' UTR isoforms. Thus, ApA contributes to the functional diversity of the proteome without changing the amino acid sequence. 3' UTR-dependent protein localization has the potential to be a widespread trafficking mechanism for membrane proteins because HuR binds to thousands of mRNAs, and we show that the long 3' UTRs of CD44, ITGA1 and TNFRSF13C, which are bound by HuR, increase surface protein expression compared to their corresponding short 3' UTRs. We propose that during translation the scaffold function of 3' UTRs facilitates binding of proteins to nascent proteins to direct their transport or function--and this role of 3' UTRs can be regulated by ApA."
https://openalex.org/W2056677926,"Two drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, have functions that modulate differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells directly, enhance remyelination, and significantly reduce disease severity in mouse models of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by an autoimmune response and failure of remyelination in the brain due to defects in differentiation of myelin-producing cells from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Most current treatments target the immune system. Paul Tesar and colleagues screened for compounds that can enhance oligodendrocyte maturation from mouse pluripotent epiblast stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors. They found two drugs — miconazole (an antifungal) and clobetasol (a steroid) — that enhance myelin production in vivo in mouse models of multiple sclerosis and enhanced the differentiation of human oligodendrocytes progenitors in vitro. Mechanistically, these compounds appear to target both the immune response and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Multiple sclerosis involves an aberrant autoimmune response and progressive failure of remyelination in the central nervous system. Prevention of neural degeneration and subsequent disability requires remyelination through the generation of new oligodendrocytes, but current treatments exclusively target the immune system. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are stem cells in the central nervous system and the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes1. These cells are abundant in demyelinated regions of patients with multiple sclerosis, yet fail to differentiate, thereby representing a cellular target for pharmacological intervention2. To discover therapeutic compounds for enhancing myelination from endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we screened a library of bioactive small molecules on mouse pluripotent epiblast stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells3,4,5. Here we show seven drugs function at nanomolar doses selectively to enhance the generation of mature oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells in vitro. Two drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, are effective in promoting precocious myelination in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, and in vivo in early postnatal mouse pups. Systemic delivery of each of the two drugs significantly increases the number of new oligodendrocytes and enhances remyelination in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model of focal demyelination. Administering each of the two drugs at the peak of disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis results in striking reversal of disease severity. Immune response assays show that miconazole functions directly as a remyelinating drug with no effect on the immune system, whereas clobetasol is a potent immunosuppressant as well as a remyelinating agent. Mechanistic studies show that miconazole and clobetasol function in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase and glucocorticoid receptor signalling, respectively. Furthermore, both drugs enhance the generation of human oligodendrocytes from human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro. Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and clobetasol, or structurally modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2090671384,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen of periodontitis. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been considered as both offense and defense components of this bacterium. Previous studies indicated that like their originating cells, P. gingivalis vesicles, are able to invade oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts, in order to promote aggregation of some specific oral bacteria and to induce host immune responses. In the present study, we investigated the invasive efficiency of P. gingivalis OMVs and compared results with that of the originating cells. Results revealed that 70–90% of human primary oral epithelial cells, gingival fibroblasts, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells carried vesicles from P. gingivalis 33277 after being exposed to the vesicles for 1 h, while 20–50% of the host cells had internalized P. gingivalis cells. We also detected vesicle-associated DNA and RNA and a vesicle-mediated horizontal gene transfer in P. gingivalis strains, which represents a novel mechanism for gene transfer between P. gingivalis strains. Moreover, purified vesicles of P. gingivalis appear to have a negative impact on biofilm formation and the maintenance of Streptococcus gordonii. Our results suggest that vesicles are likely the best offence weapon of P. gingivalis for bacterial survival in the oral cavity and for induction of periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W1580479524,"Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been implicated in the physiological catabolism of Alzheimer's amyloid-β (Aβ). Conversely, their association with vascular amyloid deposits, blood-brain barrier disruption, and hemorrhagic transformations after ischemic stroke also highlights their involvement in pathological processes. To better understand this dichotomy, recombinant human (rh) MMP-2 and MMP-9 were incubated with Aβ40 and Aβ42, and the resulting proteolytic fragments were assessed via immunoprecipitation and quantitative mass spectrometry. Both MMPs generated Aβ fragments truncated only at the C terminus, ending at positions 34, 30, and 16. Using deuterated homologues as internal standards, we observed limited and relatively slow degradation of Aβ42 by rhMMP-2, although the enzyme cleaved >80% of Aβ40 during the 1st h of incubation. rhMMP-9 was significantly less effective, particularly in degrading Aβ(1–42), although the targeted peptide bonds were identical. Using Aβ(1–34) and Aβ(1–30), we demonstrated that these peptides are also substrates for both MMPs, cleaving Aβ(1–34) to produce Aβ(1–30) first and Aβ(1–16) subsequently. Consistent with the kinetics observed with full-length Aβ, rhMMP-9 degraded only a minute fraction of Aβ(1–34) and was even less effective in producing Aβ(1–16). Further degradation of Aβ(1–16) by either MMP-2 or MMP-9 was not observed even after prolonged incubation times. Notably, all MMP-generated C-terminally truncated Aβ fragments were highly soluble and did not exhibit fibrillogenic properties or induce cytotoxicity in human cerebral microvascular endothelial or neuronal cells supporting the notion that these truncated Aβ species are associated with clearance mechanisms rather than being key elements in the fibrillogenesis process.

Metalloproteases are a family of secreted and membrane-bound zinc-dependent endoproteases that are extrinsic regulators of many biological and pathological processes extending from development, morphogenesis, and tissue remodeling to vascularization, wound healing, cell invasion, and tumor metastasis. To achieve these biological functions, metalloproteases proteolytically cleave growth factors, degrade a wide range of extracellular matrix proteins, and regulate cleavage of various receptors. The large family of metalloproteases includes, among others, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 4The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteaserhrecombinant humanAβamyloid βADAlzheimer diseaseCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineAPPamyloid precursor proteinBBBblood-brain barrierHFIP1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanolIPimmunoprecipitationCAAcerebral amyloid angiopathy. and a disintegrin-metalloproteases (ADAMs). Twenty six MMPs have been identified so far and are clustered into six major groups as follows: collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, membrane-type MMPs, and other MMPs according to their domain structure and substrate specificity (1.Sekhon B.S. Matrix metalloproteinases–an overview.Res. Rep. Biol. 2010; 2010: 1-20Google Scholar, 2.Sbardella D. Fasciglione G.F. Gioia M. Ciaccio C. Tundo G.R. Marini S. Coletta M. Human matrix metalloproteinases: an ubiquitarian class of enzymes involved in several pathological processes.Mol. Aspects Med. 2012; 33: 119-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). They are secreted as inactive zymogens, requiring proteolytic removal of a propeptide domain before becoming enzymatically active, and are tightly regulated by specific tissue inhibitors of MMPs, a family of four endogenous protease inhibitors (3.Nagase H. Visse R. Murphy G. Structure and function of matrix metalloproteinases and TIMPs.Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). The ADAM family is composed of 21 members identified in the human genome, with only 12 of them exhibiting catalytic activity. They are type I transmembrane proteinases that also require the removal of their propeptide N-terminal domain to become enzymatically active. A large number of cell-surface proteins are known to undergo ectodomain shedding by proteolytic cleavage. Although some MMPs can act as “sheddases,” the best known shedding events are mediated by ADAMs, particularly ADAM-9, ADAM-10, and ADAM-17 (4.Endres K. Fahrenholz F.

Both MMPs and ADAMs have been reported to prevent the synthesis or to facilitate the clearance of Aβ, the 40–42-amino acid peptide composing vascular and parenchymal amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease (AD). In mammalian cells and throughout life, Aβ is cleaved from its precursor APP by the sequential action of β- and γ-secretases, in a pathway dubbed “amyloidogenic” because the two main products, Aβ40 and Aβ42, are the central components of amyloid lesions in AD brains. APP is also processed by α-secretase in a “nonamyloidogenic” pathway that prevents the release of Aβ and results in the secretion of a soluble APPα fragment, reported to exhibit neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects (5.Ghiso J. Frangione B. Amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2002; 54: 1539-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Among the various candidates for the α-secretase activity, three members of the ADAM family, ADAM-9, ADAM-10, and ADAM-17, have been proposed, with emerging consensus that ADAM-10 is largely responsible for the cleavage of APP at the Lys687–Leu688 peptide bond (amino acids 16 and 17 of the Aβ sequence) and the generation of the soluble APPα fragment (6.Vardy E.R.

A role for the increased expression of MMPs in hemorrhagic complications associated with vascular amyloid deposits in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has been suggested by the known association of these proteases with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in many vasculopathies and with hemorrhagic transformations after ischemic stroke (13.Montaner J.

MMP-2 has been demonstrated to be a key element in the disruption of tight junction proteins and induction of BBB permeability alterations. It is secreted by endothelial cells in culture upon stimulation with Aβ peptides, being particularly responsive to vasculotropic Aβ mutants (16.Hernandez-Guillamon M. Mawhirt S. Fossati S. Blais S. Pares M. Penalba A. Boada M. Couraud P.O. Neubert T.A. Montaner J. Ghiso J. Rostagno A. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) degrades soluble vasculotropic amyloid-β E22Q and L34V mutants, delaying their toxicity for human brain microvascular endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27144-27158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Through their ability to degrade Aβ, MMP-2 and MMP-9 likely contribute to the brain homeostasis of Aβ and to the maintenance of Aβ levels in biological fluids. Both enzymes are able to generate in vitro Aβ fragments that are found in vivo in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (17.Hampel H. Shen Y. Walsh D.M. Aisen P. Shaw L.M. Zetterberg H. Trojanowski J.Q. Blennow K. Biological markers of amyloid β-related mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease.Exp. Neurol. 2010; 223: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, no systematic studies have been performed identifying the steps through which these truncated species are generated. Using mass spectrometry (MS) approaches, the studies presented herein compare the kinetics of Aβ proteolysis by both MMP-2 and MMP-9 using Aβ40 and Aβ42 homologues as substrates. The data indicate that both enzymes generate sequential intermediates that also serve as self-substrates and identify the end point peptide fragments as molecules of high solubility, lacking fibrillogenic propensity and neurotoxicity. The data support the notion that the proteolytically generated fragments are related to clearance mechanisms rather than being key elements in the amyloidogenesis process. Synthetic homologues of Aβ42, Aβ40, the C-terminal truncated fragments Aβ(1–34), Aβ(1–30), and Aβ(1–16), as well as the Aβ40 genetic variant containing the L34V substitution were synthesized using N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry by James I. Elliott at Yale University. For quantitative MS, isotopically labeled peptide standards of Aβ42, Aβ40, and the C-terminal truncated fragments Aβ(1–34), Aβ(1–30), and Aβ(1–16) were synthesized with deuterated [2H]phenylalanine residues; labels were introduced at positions 4, 19, and 20 in Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ34, and Aβ30, whereas Aβ(1–16) contained a single labeled residue at position 4. All synthetic peptides were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, molecular masses corroborated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, and concentrations assessed by amino acid analysis, as described previously (16.Hernandez-Guillamon M.

To remove pre-formed aggregates, peptides were pretreated with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) for at least 24 h at room temperature with intermittent vigorous vortexing. After lyophilization, peptides were either reconstituted in deionized water to a 1 μg/μl concentration (stock solution) for immediate use or stored at −80 °C for up to 2 months. The various Aβ homologues were proteolytically cleaved by incubation with activated recombinant human MMP-2 or MMP-9 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Prior to the enzymatic assay, and following the supplier's protocol, both rhMMP-2 and rhMMP-9 were activated by 37 °C incubation with 1 mm para-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Brij-35 (TCNB; rhMMP-2 for 1 h and rhMMP-9 for 24 h). After activation, MMP-2- and MMP-9-specific activities were assessed by their ability to cleave the specific fluorescent peptide substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (R&D Systems; where Mca is 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl acetyl and Dpa is N-3–2,4-dinitrophenyl-l-2–3-diaminopropionyl (19.Knight C.G.

In all cases both enzymes exhibited comparable specific activity (consistently ranging between 1250 and 1400 pmol/min/μg, depending on the lot). Proteolytic cleavage of Aβ was performed at 37 °C at an enzyme/peptide ratio of 1:25 (100 nm enzyme, 2.5 μm Aβ in TCNB), as described previously (16.Hernandez-Guillamon M. Mawhirt S. Fossati S.

Aliquots were retrieved at different time points for up to 24 h; in the case of Aβ40L34V, incubation with MMP-9 was further extended up to 10 days. In all cases, protease activity was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 15 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, followed by freezing at −80 °C. In all cases, assessment of proteolytic degradation was evaluated by Western blot analysis and by the identification of specific Aβ degradation products via immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by MS analysis, as described below. Intact Aβ peptides and newly generated proteolytic fragments were immunoprecipitated by incubation with paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Invitrogen) coated with a combination of 4G8 and 6E10 antibodies (Covance, Princeton, NJ), as described previously (16.Hernandez-Guillamon M.

After overnight incubation at 4 °C with the anti-Aβ-coated beads, samples were resuspended in PBS containing 0.025% Tween 20 (PBS-T), washed three times with PBS-T and once with 50 mm NH4HCO3, followed by elution with 0.5% formic acid. The eluted IP material was dried down in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Fisher) and further reconstituted in 5 μl of 0.1% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile for MS. One-fifth of the reconstituted sample (1 μl) was combined with an equal volume of α-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Agilent Technologies) reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 100% acetonitrile at a concentration of 15 g/liter and 1 μl of the resulting mixture spotted onto a Bruker Daltonics MTP 384 massive target T aluminum plate pre-seeded with 0.5 μl of α-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (1 g/liter). All samples were spotted in duplicate and analyzed at the New York University Mass Spectrometry Core for Neuroscience using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) in linear mode using standard instrument settings. For quantitative MS assessments, known amounts of the corresponding deuterated standards were added to the digestion mixture prior to the IP and MS analysis. At least two sets of measurements containing different amounts of the same standard were used for each experiment to estimate the concentration of the truncated peptides generated. In all cases, MS spectra were processed and analyzed by FlexAnalysis, and quantitation was performed by comparison with peak intensities of the pertinent labeled standards. Detection of Aβ by Western blot was performed following previously described protocols (22.Rostagno A. Ghiso J. Isolation and biochemical characterization of amyloid plaques and paired helical filaments.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2009: 3.33.31-33.33.33Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, MMP digestion samples were separated on 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto 0.45-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore Corp, Billerica, MA) for 45 min at 400 mA using CAPS buffer, pH 11. After blocking for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T, membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Aβ40 (1:500, Invitrogen) or anti-Aβ42 (1:500, Invitrogen) recognizing specifically the fragments ending at positions 40 or 42, respectively, without immunoreacting wit the C-terminal truncated species. This was followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000, BioSource-Invitrogen) for 1 h, development of fluorograms by enhanced chemiluminescence using Supersignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer and Stable Peroxide solutions (Thermo Scientific), and image analysis with ImageJ software (rsbweb.nih.gov).

Fluorescence was recorded after 300 s in a LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 435 nm (slit width = 10 nm) and 490 nm (slit width = 10 nm), respectively. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Curve fitting for quantitative MS data were performed by spline/lowess analysis using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Statistical analyses of cell death ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase release, and thioflavin T binding data were performed by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison post hoc test (Graph-Pad Prism); values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. IP/MS analysis of the time course degradation of full-length Aβ40 (average mass M + H = 4,330.86 Da) and Aβ42 (M + H 4,515.10 Da) peptides by rhMMP-2 and rhMMP-9 revealed the generation of three major proteolytic products, all truncated at the C terminus as follows: Aβ(1–34) (M + H 3,788.16 Da); Aβ(1–30) (M + H 3,391.63 Da); and Aβ(1–16) (M + H 1,956.03 Da). Although the resulting degradation fragments were basically the same, Aβ40 and Aβ42 showed different susceptibility to each MMP despite the comparable specific activity of both enzymes. Fig. 1 depicts the time-resolved MALDI-TOF MS spectra and relative ion counts at different time points, illustrating the progression of the enzymatic reaction with the Aβ(1–40) peptide. As illustrated, rhMMP-9 required 30 times longer incubation than rhMMP2 (5 h versus 10 min) to generate Aβ(1–34) and Aβ(1–30) fragments with comparable intensity ratios. The smaller fragment Aβ(1–16) required even longer degradation time to be detected, ∼30 min with rhMMP-2 versus more than 5 h with rhMMP-9, suggesting that either the Aβ peptide bond Lys16–Leu17 is less susceptible to proteolysis (e.g. through a steric hindrance-like mechanism) or it is generated from a substrate different from the initial intact peptide (e.g. one of the cleavage products) and has, therefore, a delayed appearance. By assessing the relative intensity ratios between the intact peptide and each of the proteolytically generated fragments at all the tested time points, the data indicate that by 30 min of incubation with Aβ40, rhMMP-2 reaches a degradation plateau (Fig. 1A), and similar levels of the remaining intact peptide are achieved only after 24 h of incubation with rhMMP-9 (Fig. 1B). Judged by the relative intensity ratios produced by rhMMP-2 at the various time points, it seemed that the smaller fragments were generated at the expense of intermediate degradation products rather than the full-length Aβ40 (Fig. 1A). Notably, the longest incubation (24 h) with MMP-9, but not with MMP2, generated an additional fragment with a mass compatible with the fragment Aβ(1–22) (m/z 2661.87 theoretical; 2661.76 experimental). Further validation for the Aβ(1–40) degradation by rhMMP-2 and rhMMP-9 was obtained via Western blot analysis utilizing an antibody specific to the C terminus of the peptide (anti-Aβ40) that does not react with the proteolytic fragments ending at positions 34, 30, and 16. As shown for selected time points (0, 1, and 24 h), Aβ(1–40) was more efficiently cleaved by rhMMP-2 than by rhMMP-9. Loss of intact Aβ(1–40) as a result of proteolytic degradation was clearly visualized at the 1-h incubation time point with rhMMP-2 (Fig. 1A), whereas rhMMP-9 required a longer incubation time (Fig. 1B). No obvious Aβ oligomerization was visualized in the time frame of the experiments under the current experimental conditions that could account for the different enzymatic susceptibility. A similar degradation profile illustrated in Fig. 1 for Aβ40 was obtained for Aβ42. As indicated in Fig. 2, the same three fragments ending at positions 34, 30, and 16 were generated with both enzymes, although for rhMMP-9 the degradation process was much slower than with rhMMP-2 (Fig. 2A) despite the comparable specific activities of both enzymes, and the Aβ(1–16) fragment was hardly detected even after the 24-h incubation of Aβ(1–42) with rhMMP-9 (Fig. 2B). Time-resolved MALDI-TOF spectra revealed that the rhMMP-2 degradation products Aβ(1–34), Aβ(1–30), and Aβ(1–16) were generated from Aβ42 within a comparable time frame as those originating from Aβ40; however, the reaction reached a plateau at a higher Aβ42/degradation products relative intensity ratio, a clear indication that m"
https://openalex.org/W2079987638,"In mammals, germ cell differentiation is initiated in the Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) during fetal development. Prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants such as endocrine disruptors may alter PGC differentiation, development of the male germline and induce transgenerational epigenetic disorders. The anti-androgenic compound vinclozolin represents a paradigmatic example of molecule causing transgenerational effects on germ cells. We performed prenatal exposure to vinclozolin in mice and analyzed the phenotypic and molecular changes in three successive generations. A reduction in the number of embryonic PGCs and increased rate of apoptotic cells along with decrease of fertility rate in adult males were observed in F1 to F3 generations. Blimp1 is a crucial regulator of PGC differentiation. We show that prenatal exposure to vinclozolin deregulates specific microRNAs in PGCs, such as miR-23b and miR-21, inducing disequilibrium in the Lin28/let-7/Blimp1 pathway in three successive generations of males. As determined by global maps of cytosine methylation, we found no evidence for prominent changes in DNA methylation in PGCs or mature sperm. Our data suggest that embryonic exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors induces transgenerational epigenetic deregulation of expression of microRNAs affecting key regulatory pathways of germ cells differentiation."

Irisin, a novel exercise-induced myokine, activates thermogenesis in rodents through increasing beige fat cells abundance within white fat. We aimed to investigate circulating irisin levels in association with the degree of physical activity and various metabolic parameters in humans. Methods Circulating irisin levels (ELISA) and metabolic parameters were analyzed in 428 subjects (195 men/233 women). Participants were classified according to their self-reported physical activity and to their area of residence. Results Circulating irisin levels were higher in active than in sedentary subjects (p= 0.006). Rural inhabitants showed higher circulating irisin levels than urban subjects (p < 0.0001). The increase in irisin levels related to an active lifestyle was only observed in rural citizens (p = 0.014). Among sedentary participants, irisin levels were positively associated with metabolic risk factors (BMI, fasting insulin, HOMA and fasting triglycerides). The area of residence (β= - 0.592, p= < 0.0001) contributed independently to circulating irisin levels variance after controlling for age, gender, BMI, HOMAIR, triglycerides and physical activity. Conclusions In sedentary participants, circulating irisin levels were positively associated with parameters related to an increased cardiometabolic risk. The present study confirmed that an active lifestyle increases circulating irisin levels, but only among subjects living in a rural environment. Area of residence might be a determinant of irisin levels."
https://openalex.org/W2265293639,"Rictor, an essential component of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), plays a pivotal role in regulating mTOR signaling and other biological functions. Posttranslational regulation of rictor (e.g. via degradation) and its underlying mechanism are largely undefined and thus are the focus of this study. Chemical inhibition of the proteasome increased rictor ubiquitination and levels. Consistently, inhibition of FBXW7 with various genetic means including knockdown, knock-out, and enforced expression of a dominant-negative mutant inhibited rictor ubiquitination and increased rictor levels, whereas enforced expression of FBXW7 decreased rictor stability and levels. Moreover, we detected an interaction between FBXW7 and rictor. Hence, rictor is degraded through an FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination/proteasome mechanism. We show that this process is dependent on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3): GSK3 was associated with rictor and directly phosphorylated the Thr-1695 site in a putative CDC4 phospho-degron motif of rictor; mutation of this site impaired the interaction between rictor and FBXW7, decreased rictor ubiquitination, and increased rictor stability. Finally, enforced activation of Akt enhanced rictor levels and increased mTORC2 activity as evidenced by increased formation of mTORC2 and elevated phosphorylation of Akt, SGK1, and PKCα. Hence we suggest that PI3K/Akt signaling may positively regulate mTORC2 signaling, likely through suppressing GSK3-dependent rictor degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2065968257,"Lifestyle factors are well-known important modifiable risk factors for obesity; the association between tobacco smoking and central obesity, however, is largely unknown in the Chinese population. This study examined the relationship between smoking and central obesity in 0.5 million Chinese adults, a population with a low prevalence of general obesity, but a high prevalence of central obesity.A total of 487,527 adults (200,564 males and 286,963 females), aged 30-79 years, were enrolled in the baseline survey of the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) Study conducted during 2004-2008. Waist circumference (WC) and WC/height ratio (WHtR) were used as measures of central obesity.The prevalence of regular smokers was significantly higher among males (60.6%) than among females (2.2%). The prevalence of central obesity increased with age and BMI levels, with a significant gender difference (females>males). Of note, almost all obese adults (99.4%) were centrally obese regardless of gender. In multivariable regression analyses, adjusting for age, education, physical activity, alcohol use and survey site, regular smoking was inversely associated with BMI in males (standardized regression coefficients, β= -0.093, p<0.001) and females (β= -0.025, p<0.001). Of interest, in the BMI stratification analyses in 18 groups, all βs of regular smoking for WHtR were positive in both genders; the βs showed a significantly greater increasing trend with increasing BMI in males than in females. In the analyses with model adjustment for BMI, the positive associations between regular smoking and WHtR were stronger in males (β= 0.021, p<0.001) than in females (β= 0.008, p<0.001) (p<0.001 for gender difference). WC showed considerably consistent results.The data indicate that tobacco smoking is an important risk factor for central obesity, but the association is gender-specific and depends on the adjustment for general obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2086182067,"The microRNA-34 family (miR-34a, -34b and -34c) have been reported to be tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs) that are regulated by the TP53 and DNA hypermethylation. However, the expression, regulation, and prognostic value of the miR-34 family have not been systematically studied in colon cancer. To elucidate the roles of miR-34 family in colon carcinogenesis, miR-34a/b/c were measured in tumors and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 159 American and 113 Chinese colon cancer patients using quantitative RT-PCR, and we examined associations between miR-34a/b/c expression with TNM staging, cancer-specific mortality, TP53 mutation status and Affymetrix microarray data. All miR-34 family members were significantly increased in colon tumors, counter to the proposed tumor suppressor role for these miRNAs. Increased miR-34b/c were observed in more advanced tumors in two independent cohorts and increased expression of miR-34b/c was associated with poor cancer-specific mortality. While the expression of miR-34 family was not associated with TP53 mutation status, TP53 transcriptional activity was associated with miR-34a/b/c expression that is consistent with the proposed regulation of miR-34a/b/c by TP53. To examine where the miR-34 family is expressed, the expression of miR-34 family was compared between epitheliums and stromal tissues using laser microdissection technique. The expression of miR-34b/c was increased significantly in stromal tissues, especially in cancer stroma, compared with epithelial tissue. In conclusion, increased miR-34b/c predominantly expressed in stromal tissues is associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer. MiR-34 may contribute to cancer-stromal interaction associated with colon cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2057730551,"Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of two commonly altered genes ERG and PTEN in prostate cancer (PC) and evaluate their prognostic significance. Despite conflicting published results, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN loss are generally considered unfavorable markers for PC progression. Materials and Methods Of the 762 prostatic adenocarcinoma specimens obtained from radical prostatectomy, 613 without neoadjuvant hormone therapy were included in tissue microarrays for quantitatively assessment of ERG and PTEN expression via immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis of the association between such expression and clinicopathological parameters, including clinical prognosis, was performed with a p-value of <0.05 considered significant. Results During a median follow-up period of 44.0 months, 132 (21.5%) patients developed biochemical recurrence (BCR). ERG overexpression and PTEN loss were observed in 145 (23.7%) and 253 (41.3%) cases, respectively. BCR-free survival was significantly better in patients with ERG overexpression (p=0.005), but unfavorable among those with PTEN loss (p=0.142). Sub-group analysis revealed that patients with PTEN loss and negative ERG expression had the worst BCR-free survival outcome (p=0.021). Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified prostate-specific antigen level (≥10 ng/mL), Gleason score (>6), pathologic T stage (≥T3), positive surgical margin, and extraprostatic capsule extension as significant risk factors for BCR (p<0.05). Conclusions Our results indicated that ERG overexpression was associated with favorable BCR-free survival after radical prostatectomy for PC, whereas PTEN loss was with unfavorable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1968417319,"The structural organization of proteins in biological membranes can affect their function. Photosynthetic thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts have the remarkable ability to change their supramolecular organization between disordered and semicrystalline states. Although the change to the semicrystalline state is known to be triggered by abiotic factors, the functional significance of this protein organization has not yet been understood. Taking advantage of an Arabidopsis thaliana fatty acid desaturase mutant (fad5) that constitutively forms semicrystalline arrays, we systematically test the functional implications of protein crystals in photosynthetic membranes. Here, we show that the change into an ordered state facilitates molecular diffusion of photosynthetic components in crowded thylakoid membranes. The increased mobility of small lipophilic molecules like plastoquinone and xanthophylls has implications for diffusion-dependent electron transport and photoprotective energy-dependent quenching. The mobility of the large photosystem II supercomplexes, however, is impaired, leading to retarded repair of damaged proteins. Our results demonstrate that supramolecular changes into more ordered states have differing impacts on photosynthesis that favor either diffusion-dependent electron transport and photoprotection or protein repair processes, thus fine-tuning the photosynthetic energy conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2089716974,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has angiogenic, inflammatory, and bone-destructive roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to determine the unique role of VEGF in osteoclastogenesis in RA. VEGF-induced receptor activator of nuclear factor ҡB ligand (RANKL) expression was determined in RA synovial fibroblasts by real-time PCR, luciferase assays, and ELISA. Osteoclastogenesis in peripheral blood monocytes cultured with VEGF was assessed by determining the numbers of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells. Synovial fluid RANKL was correlated with VEGF concentration in the RA patients. VEGF stimulated the expression of RANKL in RA synovial fibroblasts. The RANKL promoter activity was upregulated by VEGF in the synovial fibroblasts transfected with RANKL-reporter plasmids. The VEGF-induced RANKL expression was decreased by the inhibition of both VEGF receptors (VEGFR) 1 and 2, Src, protein kinase C (PKC) and p38 MAPK. VEGF induced osteoclast differentiation from monocytes in the absence of RANKL and this was decreased by the inhibition of VEGFR1 and 2, Src, PKC and p38 MAPK. On coculturing with VEGF-prestimulated RA synovial fibroblasts, the monocytes differentiated into osteoclasts, and the osteoclastogenesis decreased by inhibition of Src and PKC pathways. VEGF plays dual roles on osteoclastogenesis in RA: direct induction of osteoclastogenesis from the precursors and stimulation of RANKL production in synovial fibroblasts, which is mediated by Src and PKC pathways. The axis of VEGF and RANKL could be a potential therapeutic target for RA-associated bone destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2335549233,"Development of many conditions and disorders, such as atherosclerosis and stroke, are dependent upon hemodynamic forces. To accurately predict and prevent these conditions and disorders hemodynamic forces must be properly mapped. Here we compare a shear-rate dependent fluid (SDF) constitutive model, based on the works by Yasuda et al in 1981, against a Newtonian model of blood. We verify our stabilized finite element numerical method with the benchmark lid-driven cavity flow problem. Numerical simulations show that the Newtonian model gives similar velocity profiles in the 2-dimensional cavity given different height and width dimensions, given the same Reynolds number. Conversely, the SDF model gave dissimilar velocity profiles, differing from the Newtonian velocity profiles by up to 25% in velocity magnitudes. This difference can affect estimation in platelet distribution within blood vessels or magnetic nanoparticle delivery. Wall shear stress (WSS) is an important quantity involved in vascular remodeling through integrin and adhesion molecule mechanotransduction. The SDF model gave a 7.3-fold greater WSS than the Newtonian model at the top of the 3-dimensional cavity. The SDF model gave a 37.7-fold greater WSS than the Newtonian model at artery walls located immediately after bifurcations in the idealized femoral artery tree. The pressure drop across arteries reveals arterial sections highly resistive to flow which correlates with stenosis formation. Numerical simulations give the pressure drop across the idealized femoral artery tree with the SDF model which is approximately 2.3-fold higher than with the Newtonian model. In atherosclerotic lesion models, the SDF model gives over 1 Pa higher WSS than the Newtonian model, a difference correlated with over twice as many adherent monocytes to endothelial cells from the Newtonian model compared to the SDF model."

Tryptophan is also needed in the production of kynurenine, a process mediated by the type I interferon (IFN)-regulated rate-limiting enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The aim of this study was to investigate levels of serotonin in patients with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), association to clinical phenotype and possible involvement of IDO in regulation of serotonin synthesis. Serotonin levels were measured in serum and plasma from patients with SLE (n=148) and healthy volunteers (n=79) by liquid chromatography and ELISA, as well as intracellularly in platelets by flow cytometry. We found that SLE patients had decreased serotonin levels in serum (p=0.01) and platelets (p<0.0001) as compared to healthy individuals. SLE patients with ongoing type I IFN activity, as determined by an in-house reporter assay, had decreased serum levels of serotonin (p=0.0008) as well as increased IDO activity (p<0.0001), as determined by the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio measured by liquid chromatography. Furthermore, SLE sera induced IDO expression in WISH cells in a type I IFN-dependent manner (p=0.008). Also platelet activation contributed to reduce overall availability of serotonin levels in platelets and serum (p<0.05). Decreased serum serotonin levels were associated with severe SLE with presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and nephritis. In all, reduced serum serotonin levels in SLE patients were related to severe disease phenotype, including nephritis, suggesting involvement of important immunopathological processes. Further, our data suggest that type I IFNs, present in SLE sera, are able to up-regulate IDO expression, which may lead to decreased serum serotonin levels."

Systems biology approaches to defining how signal transduction pathways are integrated at the level of whole organisms also often downplay the contribution of phosphatases, defining them as “erasers” that serve merely to restore the system to its basal state. Here, we present a study that counteracts the idea of “nonspecific phosphatases.” We have characterized two structurally similar and functionally related kinases, BRK and SRC, which are regulated by combinations of activating autophosphorylation and inhibitory C-terminal sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. We demonstrated specificity at the level of the kinases in that SRMS phosphorylated the C terminus of BRK, but not SRC; in contrast, CSK is the kinase responsible for C-terminal phosphorylation of SRC, but not BRK. For the phosphatases, we observed that RNAi-mediated suppression of PTP1B resulted in opposing effects on the activity of BRK and SRC and have defined the mechanisms underlying this specificity. PTP1B inhibited BRK by directly dephosphorylating the Tyr-342 autophosphorylation site. In contrast, PTP1B potentiated SRC activity, but not by dephosphorylating SRC itself directly; instead, PTP1B regulated the interaction between CBP/PAG and CSK. SRC associated with, and phosphorylated, the transmembrane protein CBP/PAG at Tyr-317, resulting in CSK recruitment. We identified PAG as a substrate of PTP1B, and dephosphorylation abolished recruitment of the inhibitory kinase CSK. Overall, these findings illustrate how the combinatorial effects of PTKs and PTPs may be integrated to regulate signaling, with both classes of enzymes displaying exquisite specificity.

To investigate if urinary LAM-positivity is the result of renal TB infection we correlated the outcomes of urinary LAM-antigen testing to renal histology in an autopsy cohort of hospitalized, Ugandan, HIV-infected adults. Methods We performed a complete autopsy, including renal sampling, in HIV-infected adults that died during hospitalization after written informed consent was obtained from the next of kin. Urine was collected postmortem through post-mortem catheterisation or by bladder puncture and tested for LAM with both a lateral flow assay (LFA) and an ELISA assay. Two pathologists assessed the kidney histology. We correlated the LAM-assay results and the histology findings. Results Of the 13/36 (36%) patients with a positive urinary LAM ELISA and/or LFA, 8/13 (62%) had renal TB. The remaining 5 LAM-positive patients had disseminated TB without renal involvement. Of the 23 LAM-negative patients, 3 had disseminated TB without renal involvement. The remaining LAM-negative patients had no TB infection and died mostly of fungal and bacterial infections. LAM LFA had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 100% to diagnose TB at any location, and the LAM ELISA a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 100%. 54% (7/13) LAM LFA-positive patients were not on anti-TB treatment at the time of death. Conclusion Renal TB infection explained LAM-positivity in the majority of patients. Patients with disseminated TB without renal involvement can also be diagnosed with LAM. This suggests that other mechanisms that lead to urinary LAM-positivity exist in a minority of patients."
https://openalex.org/W1970889253,"Haematophagous insects can ingest large quantities of blood in a single meal and eliminate high volumes of urine in the next few hours. This rise in diuresis is possible because the excretory activity of the Malpighian tubules is facilitated by an increase in haemolymph circulation as a result of intensification of aorta contractions combined with an increase of the anterior midgut peristaltic waves. It has been previously described that haemolymph circulation during post-prandial diuresis is stimulated by the synergistic activity of allatotropin (AT) and serotonin in the kissing bug Triatoma infestans; resulting in an increase in aorta contractions. In the same species, AT stimulates anterior midgut and rectum muscle contractions to mix urine and feces and facilitate the voiding of the rectum. Furthermore, levels of AT in midgut and Malpighian tubules increased in the afternoon when insects are getting ready for nocturnal feeding. In the present study we describe the synergistic effect of AT and serotonin increasing the frequency of contractions of the aorta in Rhodnius prolixus. The basal frequency of contractions of the aorta in the afternoon is higher that the observed during the morning, suggesting the existence of a daily rhythmic activity. The AT receptor is expressed in the rectum, midgut and dorsal vessel, three critical organs involved in post-prandial diuresis. All together these findings provide evidence that AT plays a role as a myoregulatory and cardioacceleratory peptide in R. prolixus."

Whether CTCs and primary tumor cells (PTCs) respond to chemotherapy differently is not known. Here, we show that CTCs of breast cancer are more resistant to chemotherapy than PTCs because of potentiated DNA repair. Surprisingly, the chemoresistance of CTCs was recapitulated in PTCs when they were detached from the extracellular matrix. Detachment of PTCs increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and partially activated the DNA damage checkpoint, converting PTCs to a CTC-like state. Inhibition of checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 in CTCs reduces the basal checkpoint response and sensitizes CTCs to DNA damage in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Our results suggest that DNA damage checkpoint inhibitors may benefit the chemotherapy of breast cancer patients by suppressing the chemoresistance of CTCs and reducing the risk of cancer metastasis.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that CTCs are biologically different from primary tumor cells (PTCs). It was reported that the gene expression profile of CTCs from patients with metastatic colorectal cancers was different from that of PTCs by genes related to enhanced migratory, invasive, adhesive, and anti-apoptotic properties (15.Barbazán J.

In addition, differential HER2 gene amplification and expression were also noted between CTCs and PTCs in breast cancer patients, which may underlie their different sensitivity to anti-Her2 therapy (17.Hayashi N.

Moreover, CTCs from breast cancer exhibit migratory mesenchymal or stem-cell like phenotypes that are rarely detected in PTCs (19.Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J.

Expression of stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in primary breast cancer patients with circulating tumor cells.Breast Cancer Res. 2012; 14: R15Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Genome sequencing of CTC revealed pre-existing mutations in the PIK3CA gene and newly acquired mutations in the genes of estrogen receptor (ESR1), PIK3CA, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, etc. (21.Yu M. Bardia A. Aceto N. Bersani F. Madden M.W. Donaldson M.C. Desai R. Zhu H. Comaills V. Zheng Z. Wittner B.S. Stojanov P. Brachtel E. Sgroi D. Kapur R. et al.Cancer therapy. Ex vivo culture of circulating breast tumor cells for individualized testing of drug susceptibility.Science. 2014; 345: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In light of their distinct biological features, CTCs may respond differently to chemotherapies as do PTCs. Recently, it was reported that CTC was sensitive to paclitaxel and resistant to doxorubicin upon exposure to a panel of drugs (21.Yu M. Bardia A. Aceto N. Bersani F. Madden M.W. Donaldson M.C. Desai R. Zhu H. Comaills V. Zheng Z. Wittner B.S. Stojanov P. Brachtel E. Sgroi D. Kapur R. et al.Cancer therapy. Ex vivo culture of circulating breast tumor cells for individualized testing of drug susceptibility.Science. 2014; 345: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). However, the chemosensitivity of CTCs has not been well characterized, and the mechanisms that underlie differential chemoresponse of CTCs as compared with PTCs remain elusive. The distinct biology of CTCs may result from two different mechanisms. CTCs could be enriched from a minority of PTCs that are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy. Also, the detachment of cancer cells from primary tumors, especially from ECM support, may lead to dramatic biological changes by undergoing excessive stress that induces either anoikis-associated apoptosis (22.Zhong X. Rescorla F.J. Cell surface adhesion molecules and adhesion-initiated signaling: understanding of anoikis resistance mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.Cell. Signal. 2012; 24: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or an oxidative burst with massive production of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) (23.Schafer Z.T. Grassian A.R. Song L. Jiang Z. Gerhart-Hines Z. Irie H.Y. Gao S. Puigserver P. Brugge J.S. Antioxidant and oncogene rescue of metabolic defects caused by loss of matrix attachment.Nature. 2009; 461: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Therefore, in response to detachment stress, CTCs that remain alive may gain survival advantage and are thus more resistant to chemotherapy than PTCs. In this study, we compared the chemosensitivity of CTCs with that of PTCs from metastatic breast cancer patients. Furthermore, we evaluated whether detachment of PTCs may recapitulate drug resistance in CTCs and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Blood and primary tumor samples were obtained from 60 cases of patients with metastatic breast cancer at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University. Pathological diagnosis, including estrogen receptor, PR, and Her2 status of primary tumors, was verified by two different pathologists. Among these patients, 55 cases underwent chemotherapy (epirubicin, 90 mg/m2; paclitaxel, 75 mg/m2; and cyclophosphamide, 600 mg/m2). All patient samples with informed consents were collected according to the Internal Review and the Ethics Boards of the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. Enumeration of CTC in the whole blood of breast cancer patients was done in the CellSearch® system according to the manufacturer's instruction as described previously (7.Cristofanilli M. Budd G.T. Ellis M.J. Stopeck A. Matera J. Miller M.C. Reuben J.M. Doyle G.V. Allard W.J. Terstappen L.W. Hayes D.F. Circulating tumor cells, disease progression, and survival in metastatic breast cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). Apoptotic CTCs were detected by integrating CTC assay with specific mAbs, M30 CytoDEATHTM fluorescein (ALX-804-590, Alexis Biochemicals), and analyzed with the fourth filter of the CellSearch® system; data were expressed as the percentage of apoptotic CTCs per 7.5 ml of blood. To isolate human CTCs (24.Ozkumur E. Shah A.M. Ciciliano J.C. Emmink B.L. Miyamoto D.T. Brachtel E. Yu M. Chen P.I. Morgan B. Trautwein J. Kimura A. Sengupta S. Stott S.L. Karabacak N.M. Barber T.A. et al.Inertial focusing for tumor antigen-dependent and -independent sorting of rare circulating tumor cells.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 179ra47Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), 20–50 ml of fresh blood from metastatic breast cancer patients was layered over Ficoll-Paque (1.077, density) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The interphase cells, containing lymphocytes, monocytes, and tumor cells, were resuspended at 5 × 107 cells in 300 μl of solution containing 100 μl of FcR blocking reagent (130-059-901, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), 100 μl of CD45 microbeads (130-045-801, Miltenyi Biotec), and 100 μl of CD15 microbeads (130-091-058, Miltenyi Biotec). After depletion of CD45+ and CD15+ cells by magnetic separation with autoMACSTM Pro Separator, 100 μl of CD326 (EpCAM) microbeads (130-095-500, Miltenyi Biotec) per 5 × 107 cells was added for 30 min of incubation at 4 °C. The magnetic CD326+ and CD326− cell fractions were eluted as the EpCAM+ and EpCAM− CTCs. The purity of epithelial cells was determined by immunofluorescent staining with anti-cytokeratin antibody (10 μg/ml, ab41825, Abcam), which was over 95%. For a cell to be identified as a CTC, it had to meet two criteria as follows: (i) positive staining for a tumor-specific marker by immunocytochemistry (cytokeratin) and (ii) positive scoring upon review by the cytopathologist. Mouse CTCs were obtained from the blood specimens of the animals by cardiac puncturing as described previously (25.Howard E.W. Leung S.C. Yuen H.F. Chua C.W. Lee D.T. Chan K.W. Wang X. Wong Y.C. Decreased adhesiveness, resistance to anoikis and suppression of GRP94 are integral to the survival of circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer.Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2008; 25: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nucleated cells from mouse blood were enriched in erythrocytes lysis buffer, and the epithelial cells were isolated by magnetic antibody cell separation (Miltenyi Biotec) and resuspended in 0.1 ml of PEB (1× PBS, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% BSA fraction V) (Sigma) as described previously. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to the manufacturer's instruction. PTCs were isolated from breast cancer samples, as described previously (26.Yu F. Yao H. Zhu P. Zhang X. Pan Q. Gong C. Huang Y. Hu X. Su F. Lieberman J. Song E. let-7 regulates self-renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells.Cell. 2007; 131: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar), and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% serum. Suspension culture was performed in the Ultra Low Attachment Surface Products (Corning, NY). After testing a range of culture conditions, we found that CTCs proliferated better as tumor spheres when cultured in ultralow attachment plates (Corning) containing tumor sphere medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium (with phenol red) supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), basic FGF (20 ng/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), B27 (10 ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were cultured in a humid 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Our CTC culture condition is similar as described previously (21.Yu M. Bardia A. Aceto N. Bersani F. Madden M.W. Donaldson M.C. Desai R. Zhu H. Comaills V. Zheng Z. Wittner B.S. Stojanov P. Brachtel E. Sgroi D. Kapur R. et al.Cancer therapy. Ex vivo culture of circulating breast tumor cells for individualized testing of drug susceptibility.Science. 2014; 345: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). For in vitro chemotherapy, cells were exposed to epirubicin (1 μg/ml, Sigma) or cisplatin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) for 2 h and were placed in fresh media for another 1–2 h for recovery after stringent washing, followed by evaluation of cell survival and apoptosis. In some experiments, Chk1 inhibitor (Chir-124, 250 nm, Selleckchem), Chk2 inhibitor (Chk2 inhibitor II, 10 μm, Sigma), Chk1/2 inhibitor (debromohymenialdisine (DBH), 3 μm, Calbiochem), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mm, Sigma), or nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, 5 μm, Sigma) was added to the cultures 2 h prior to chemotherapy. All procedures of animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University and conformed to the legal mandates and national guidelines for the care and maintenance of laboratory animals. 2 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing luciferase or enhanced GFP were injected into the mammary fat pads of 6-week-old BALB/c-nu mice. After tumors were detected, tumor size was measured in two dimensions with calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated as length (mm) × width (mm) × width (mm) × 0.5 up to 60 days. Treatment began when tumors reached ∼0.5 cm. Intravenous injection with or without the Chk1 inhibitor (Chir-124, 10 mg/kg) (Selleckchem) or Chk2 inhibitor (Chk2 inhibitor II, 1 mg/kg) (Sigma) 2 h preceding intravenous injection with cisplatin (5 mg/kg) (Sigma) was performed in a weekly cycle. Mice were subjected to a total of four cycles of therapy. To obtain CTC in the mice, approximately, 0.8-ml blood samples were obtained via cardiac puncture from mice anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane for CTC isolation after the above-mentioned treatment. To evaluate in vivo metastasis, mice were anesthetized and given 150 mg/kg of d-luciferin in PBS by intraperitoneal injection for bioluminescence imaging with a charge-coupled device camera (IVIS; Xenogen). Paraffin sections (4 μm) of the lung and liver tissues were used for immunohistochemistry with PCNA antibody (sc-7907, 1: 200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections according to standard LSAB protocol (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), using primary antibodies against PCNA antibody. Isotype-matched IgG was used as negative controls. The percentages of positive tumor cells were calculated per field of view, with at least 20 view-fields per section evaluated at ×400 magnification. The cumulative changes of live and apoptotic CTCs were expressed as described previously (27.Rossi E. Fassan M. Aieta M. Zilio F. Celadin R. Borin M. Grassi A. Troiani L. Basso U. Barile C. Sava T. Lanza C. Miatello L. Jirillo A. Rugge M. et al.Dynamic changes of live/apoptotic circulating tumour cells as predictive marker of response to sunitinib in metastatic renal cancer.Br. J. Cancer. 2012; 107: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by the parameter ΔAUC; the detected numbers of M30-negative and M30-positive CTCs were separately plotted in relation to time, and the area under the curve (AUC) of longitudinal graphs was calculated (by the trapezoidal rule) following a procedure that is commonly adopted to evaluate cumulative changes of serological tumor markers. The difference between live and apoptotic CTC concentration-time area was calculated in all patients according to Equation 1,ΔΑUC=AM30negativeCTCUC−AM30positiveCTCUC (Eq. 1)Eq. 1 Progression-free survival was measured as the time between the baseline CTC assessment (i.e. the initiation of treatment) and the documentation of the first radiographic disease progression or death. Patients who were alive and progression-free at the time of analysis were censored by using the time between the baseline CTC assessment and their most recent follow-up evaluations. The progression-free survival between groups defined by < = 0 or >0 ΔAUC was compared with the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were tested with the log-rank test. Other results are expressed as mean values ± S.D., and mean values of at least three experiments are shown. Statistical analysis was done by one-way analysis of variance, and comparisons among groups were done by the independent sample t test or Bonferroni multiple comparison t test, using SPSS for Windows version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago). A p value <0.05 in all cases was considered statistically significant. Although CTCs from breast cancer may have undergone dynamic epithelial mesenchymal transition characterized by down-regulation of epithelial markers, they can be captured by antibody mixtures with EpCAM or EGF receptor (19.Gingery A. Bradley E. Shaw A. Oursler M.J. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase coordinately activates the MEK/ERK and AKT/NFκB pathways to maintain osteoclast survival.J. Cell.

Med. 2013; 5: 179ra47Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). In this study, we used magnetic beads coupled with anti-EpCAM antibody for positive selection, and beads with anti-CD45 and anti-CD15 antibodies for negative selection to isolate CTCs from 50 ml of peripheral blood from five patients with metastatic breast carcinomas, in which CTC enumerations were over 530 cells/ml of blood determined by CellSearch® system (Table 1). The corresponding PTCs were isolated from tumor biopsies of the same patients. The isolated CTCs and PTCs were treated with the following two commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs for breast cancer, respectively: epirubicin at 1 μg/ml or cisplatin at 10 μg/ml for 2 h, and then recovered in fresh media for another 2 h, followed by evaluation of cell survival and apoptosis. Treatment with epirubicin or cisplatin reduced the colony formation of PTCs in soft agar by ∼87% (p < 0.001) and 89% (p < 0.001), respectively, and in CTCs by only 11.4% (p > 0.05) and 17.3% (p > 0.05), respectively (Fig. 1A), suggesting that CTCs are more resistant to the growth inhibition of chemotherapy in vitro. To evaluate apoptotic cell death of CTCs and PTCs treated with epirubicin or cisplatin, we examined the expression of M30 determined by immunostaining. In contrast to PTCs that showed increased M30 immunostaining after treatment with epirubicin or cisplatin, M30 immunostaining in CTCs was only slightly enhanced (Fig. 1B). Together, these data suggest that CTCs are more resistant to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy in vitro.TABLE 1Circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts and clinicopathological features in five metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with high circulating tumor cell burdenCase no.AgePrimary tumor sizePathological classificationERPRMetastatic sitesGradeCTC countsaQuantification was by CellSearch® system (Veridex LLC, Raritan, NJ) per 7.5 ml of blood.cm1505.6IDC+−Brain, liverIII87852484.8IDC−−Liver, boneIII78563544.6IDC+−Liver, boneIII57854425.2IDC+−Liver, lungIII48855405.2IDC+−Liver, lungIII3985a Quantification was by CellSearch® system (Veridex LLC, Raritan, NJ) per 7.5 ml of blood. Open table in a new tab To evaluate the clinical relevance of the above findings, we examined the apoptosis of CTCs and PTCs that were freshly isolated from 55 metastatic breast cancer patients (Table 2), before and after four cycles of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy increased the percentage of M30+ PTCs by 3.5-fold (p < 0.01, Fig. 1C) in the biopsies taken from primary tumors but increased M30+ CTCs only by 1.6-fold (p < 0.05, Fig. 1C). Next, we further correlated the changes of apoptotic M30+ CTCs and PTCs upon chemotherapy with the progression of distant metastasis determined by computerized tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1D). Although all the patients showed markedly increased proportion of M30+ PTCs in the primary tumors following chemotherapy (Fig. 1D), only the patients responded to chemotherapy (PR + SD) showed a significant increase in the percentage of M30+ CTCs (Fig. 1D), whereas the nonresponders (PD) demonstrated a stable M30+ CTC level (Fig. 1D and Table 2). In addition, we correlated the cumulative changes of live/apoptotic CTCs (27.Rossi E. Fassan M. Aieta M. Zilio F. Celadin R. Borin M. Grassi A. Troiani L. Basso U. Barile C. Sava T. Lanza C.

https://openalex.org/W1967258687,"Schistosomiasis is a common debilitating human parasitic disease in (sub)tropical areas, however, schistosome infections can also protect against a variety of inflammatory diseases. This has raised broad interest in the mechanisms by which Schistosoma modulate the immune system into an anti-inflammatory and regulatory state. Human dendritic cells (DCs) show many phenotypic changes upon contact with Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA). We here show that oxidation of SEA glycans, but not heat-denaturation, abrogates the capacity of SEA to suppress both LPS-induced cytokine secretion and DC proliferation, indicating an important role of SEA glycans in these processes. Remarkably, interaction of SEA glycans with DCs results in a strongly increased expression of Suppressor Of Cytokine Signalling1 (SOCS1) and SH2-containing protein tyrosine Phosphatase-1 (SHP1), important negative regulators of TLR4 signalling. In addition, SEA induces the secretion of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and the surface expression of the costimulatory molecules Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) and OX40 ligand (OX40L), which are known phenotypic markers for the capacity of DCs to polarize naïve T cells into Th2/Treg cell subsets. Inhibition of mannose receptor (MR)-mediated internalization of SEA into DCs by blocking with allyl α-D-mannoside or anti-MR antibodies, significantly reduced SOCS1 and SHP1 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that SEA glycans are essential for induction of enhanced SOCS1 and SHP1 levels in DCs via the MR. Our data provide novel mechanistic evidence for the potential of S. mansoni SEA glycans to modulate human DCs, which may contribute to the capacity of SEA to down-regulate inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2062448619,"Methylophiopogonanone A (MO-A), an active homoisoflavonoid of the Chinese herb Ophiopogon japonicus which has been shown to have protective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, little is known about its role in cerebral I/R injury. Therefore, in this study, by using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion rat model, the effect of MO-A on cerebral I/R injury was examined. The results showed that MO-A treatment reduced infarct volume and brain edema, improved neurological deficit scores, reversed animal body weight decreases, and increased animal survival time in the stroke groups. Western blotting showed that MO-A suppressed MMP-9, but restored the expression of claudin-3 and claudin-5. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy were monitored to determine the blood–brain barrier (BBB) alterations in vitro. The results showed that MO-A markedly attenuated BBB damage in vitro. Additionally, MO-A inhibited ROS production in ECs and MMP-9 release in differentiated THP-1 cells in vitro, and suppressed ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in ECs and leukocyte/EC adhesion. In conclusion, our data indicate that MO-A has therapeutic potential against cerebral I/R injury through its ability to attenuate BBB disruption by regulating the expression of MMP-9 and tight junction proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2036108889,"Many hours of sunlight in the midnight sun period suggest that significant amounts of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) may be released from arctic ecosystems during night-time. However, the emissions from these ecosystems are rarely studied and limited to point measurements during daytime. We measured BVOC emissions during 24-hour periods in the field using a push-pull chamber technique and collection of volatiles in adsorbent cartridges followed by analysis with gas chromatography- mass spectrometry. Five different arctic vegetation communities were examined: high arctic heaths dominated by Salix arctica and Cassiope tetragona, low arctic heaths dominated by Salix glauca and Betula nana and a subarctic peatland dominated by the moss Warnstorfia exannulata and the sedge Eriophorum russeolum. We also addressed how climate warming affects the 24-hour emission and how the daytime emissions respond to sudden darkness. The emissions from the high arctic sites were lowest and had a strong diel variation with almost no emissions during night-time. The low arctic sites as well as the subarctic site had a more stable release of BVOCs during the 24-hour period with night-time emissions in the same range as those during the day. These results warn against overlooking the night period when considering arctic emissions. During the day, the quantity of BVOCs and the number of different compounds emitted was higher under ambient light than in darkness. The monoterpenes α-fenchene, α -phellandrene, 3-carene and α-terpinene as well as isoprene were absent in dark measurements during the day. Warming by open top chambers increased the emission rates both in the high and low arctic sites, forewarning higher emissions in a future warmer climate in the Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W2086752770,"Oxidative folding, the process by which proteins fold and acquire disulfide bonds concurrently, is of critical importance for a wide range of biological processes. Generally, this process is catalyzed by oxidoreductase enzymes that facilitate oxidation and also bear chaperone functionality. Although this process has been well described qualitatively, fine yet important details remain obscured by a limited quantitative perspective, arising from the limitations in the application of bulk biochemical methods to the study of oxidative folding. In this work, we have applied single molecule force spectroscopy techniques to monitor in real time the process of oxidative folding as catalyzed by DsbA, the enzyme solely responsible for the catalysis of oxidative folding in the bacterial periplasm. We provide a quantitative and detailed description of the catalytic mechanism utilized by DsbA that offers insight into the entire sequence of events that occurs in the periplasm from the unfolded-reduced state to the folded-oxidized protein. We have compared our results with those of protein disulfide-isomerase, the eukaryotic counterpart of DsbA, allowing us to devise a general mechanism for oxidative folding that also reflects upon the physiological functions and demands of these enzymes in vivo. Background: The enzyme DsbA is essential for production of disulfide-bonded proteins in E. coli. Results: The folding, misfolding, and release kinetics of a substrate interacting with DsbA are determined from single molecule observations. Conclusion: DsbA is much more effective than its eukaryotic counterpart. Significance: Previous mechanistic models are generalized while providing insight into the kinetic parameters that influence oxidative folding outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1989376820,"In cardiomyocytes, intracellular calcium (Ca2+) transients are elicited by electrical and receptor stimulations, leading to muscle contraction and gene expression, respectively. Although such elevations of Ca2+levels ([Ca2+]) also occur in the nucleus, the precise mechanism of nuclear [Ca2+] regulation during different kinds of stimuli, and its relationship with cytoplasmic [Ca2+] regulation are not fully understood. To address these issues, we used a new region-specific fluorescent protein-based Ca2+ indicator, GECO, together with the conventional probe Fluo-4 AM. We confirmed that nuclear Ca2+ transients were elicited by both electrical and receptor stimulations in neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes. Kinetic analysis revealed that electrical stimulation-elicited nuclear Ca2+ transients are slower than cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients, and chelating cytoplasmic Ca2+ abolished nuclear Ca2+ transients, suggesting that nuclear Ca2+ are mainly derived from the cytoplasm during electrical stimulation. On the other hand, receptor stimulation such as with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) preferentially increased nuclear [Ca2+] compared to cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Experiments using inhibitors revealed that electrical and receptor stimulation-elicited Ca2+ transients were mainly mediated by ryanodine receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), respectively, suggesting different mechanisms for the two signals. Furthermore, IGF-1-elicited nuclear Ca2+ transient amplitude was significantly lower in myocytes lacking neuronal Ca2+ sensor-1 (NCS-1), a Ca2+ binding protein implicated in IP3R-mediated pathway in the heart. Moreover, IGF-1 strengthened the interaction between NCS-1 and IP3R. These results suggest a novel mechanism for receptor stimulation-induced nuclear [Ca2+] regulation mediated by IP3R and NCS-1 that may further fine-tune cardiac Ca2+ signal regulation."

Since DBM is prepared in powder form its handling properties are not optimal and limit the clinical use of this material. Various synthetic and biological carriers have been used to enhance the DBM handling. In this study we evaluated the effect of gamma irradiation on the physical-chemical properties of Pluronic and on bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) amount in DBM samples. In vivo studies were carried out to investigate the effect on bone regeneration of a gamma irradiated DBM-Pluronic F127 (DBM-PF127) composite implanted in the femur of rats. Gamma irradiation effects (25 kGy) on physical-chemical properties of Pluronic F127 were investigated by rheological and infrared analysis. The BMP-2/BMP-7 amount after DBM irradiation was evaluated by ELISA. Bone regeneration capacity of DBM-PF127 containing 40% (w/w) of DBM was investigated in transcortical holes created in the femoral diaphysis of Wistar rat. Bone porosity, repaired bone volume and tissue organization were evaluated at 15, 30 and 90 days by Micro-CT and histological analysis. The results showed that gamma irradiation did not induce significant modification on physical-chemical properties of Pluronic, while a decrease in BMP-2/BMP-7 amount was evidenced in sterilized DBM. Micro-CT and histological evaluation at day 15 post-implantation revealed an interconnected trabeculae network in medullar cavity and cellular infiltration and vascularization of DBM-PF127 residue. In contrast a large rate of not connected trabeculae was observed in Pluronic filled and unfilled defects. At 30 and 90 days the DBM-PF127 samples shown comparable results in term of density and thickness of the new formed tissue respect to unfilled defect. In conclusion a gamma irradiated DBM-PF127 composite, although it may have undergone a significant decrease in the concentration of BMPs, was able to maintains bone regeneration capability."

This study aimed to determine the quality of antimicrobial products used by Vietnamese striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) farmers. Twenty one antimicrobial products (11 products contained a single antimicrobial and 10 products contained a mixture of two different antimicrobials) commonly used by catfish farmers were obtained from so-called chemical shops located in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry was used to analyze concentration of sulfonamides, trimethoprim, amoxicillin, cefalexin and ciprofloxacin whereas concentrations of florfenicol and doxycycline were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with UV detection. Results revealed that only 4/11 products with a single antimicrobial and 2/10 products with a mixture of antimicrobials contained active substances within ±10% of the concentration declared on the product label. Two products with antimicrobial mixtures did not contain any of the declared antimicrobials. Comparing two batches, analysis of 11 products revealed that only one product contained a concentration of active compound that varied with less than 10% in both batches. Several product labels provided inadequate information on how to calculate therapeutic dosage and further stated withdrawal time despite lack of pharmacokinetic data on the antimicrobials in catfish. There is an urgent need to strengthen approval procedures and in particular regularly to monitor the quality of antimicrobials used in Vietnamese aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2142621940,"Background Atopic eczema (AE) is a chronic disease with flares and remissions. Long-term control of AE flares has been identified as a core outcome domain for AE trials. However, it is unclear how flares should be defined and measured. Objective To validate two concepts of AE flares based on daily reports of topical medication use: (i) escalation of treatment and (ii) days of topical anti-inflammatory medication use (topical corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors). Methods Data from two published AE studies (studies A (n=336) and B (n=60)) were analysed separately. Validity and feasibility of flare definitions were assessed using daily global bother (scale 0 to 10) as the reference standard. Intra-class correlations were reported for continuous variables, and odds ratios and area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for binary outcome measures. Results Good agreement was found between both AE flare definitions and change in global bother: area under the ROC curve for treatment escalation of 0.70 and 0.73 in studies A and B respectively, and area under the ROC curve of 0.69 for topical anti-inflammatory medication use (Study A only). Significant positive relationships were found between validated severity scales (POEM, SASSAD, TIS) and the duration of AE flares occurring in the previous week – POEM and SASSAD rose by half a point for each unit increase in number of days in flare. Smaller increases were observed on the TIS scale. Completeness of daily diaries was 95% for Study A and 60% for Study B over 16 weeks). Conclusion Both definitions were good proxy indicators of AE flares. We found no evidence that ‘escalation of treatment’ was a better measure of AE flares than ‘use of topical anti-inflammatory medications’. Capturing disease flares in AE trials through daily recording of medication use is feasible and appears to be a good indicator of long-term control.

https://openalex.org/W2004345651,"Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype of lung cancer, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Despite attempts for the treatment of lung cancer which have been accumulating, promising new therapies are still needed. Here, we found that cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-CREB binding protein (CBP) transcription factors complex inhibitor, Naphthol AS-TR phosphate (NASTRp), is a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer. We show that NASTRp inhibited oncogenic cell properties through cell cycle arrest with concomitant suppression of tumor-promoting autophagy with down-regulations of Atg5-12 and Atg7, and accumulation of p62 in human lung cancer cell lines. In addition, NASTRp induced expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers such as DDIT3/CHOP, and led to apoptosis along with Bim induction. These findings suggest that transcription factor/co-activator complex, CREB-CBP, can be a potential therapeutic target and its inhibition could be a novel therapeutic strategy for lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2017035350,"Background The effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on prostate cancer (PCa) outcome remains controversial. Thus, we investigated the association of DM history, glycemic control, and metformin use with oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods We reviewed the records of 746 contemporary patients who had hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured within the 6 months preceding RP. The associations between clinical variables and risk of adverse pathological features and biochemical recurrence (BCR) were tested using a multivariate logistic regression and multiple Cox-proportional hazards model, respectively. BCR was defined as prostatic specific antigen (PSA) > 0.2 ng/mL in 2 consecutive tests. Results There were no significant differences in the rates of adverse pathologic features and BCR-free survival between patients with (n = 209) and without (n = 537) a history of DM diagnosis (all p > 0.05). In multivariate analyses, high HbA1c level (≥ 6.5%) was significantly related with high pathologic Gleason score (≥ 4+3; odds ratio [OR] 1.704, p = 0.019) and BCR-free survival (OR 1.853, p = 0.007). Metformin use was not associated with BCR-free survival (OR 0.662, p = 0.125). Conclusions Poor glycemic control was significantly associated with BCR after RP. Meanwhile, metformin use was not associated with biochemical outcome after RP. Further investigation would be needed to identify exact mechanism underlying the impact of glycemic control on PCa treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2033892479,"The brown adipocyte phenotype (BAP) in white adipose tissue (WAT) is transiendy induced in adult mammals in response to reduced ambient temperature. Since it is unknown whether a cold challenge can permanendy induce brown adipocytes (BAs), we reared C57BL/6J (B6) and AxB8/PgJ (AxB8) mice at 17 or 29°C from birth to weaning, to assess the BAP in young and adult mice. Energy balance measurements showed that 17°C reduced fat mass in the preweaning mice by increasing energy expenditure and suppressed diet-induced obesity in adults. Microarray analysis of global gene expression of inguinal fat (ING) from 10-day-old (D) mice indicates that expression at 17°C vs. 29°C was not different. Between 10 and 21 days of age, the BAP was induced coincident with morphologic remodeling of ING and marked changes in expression of neural development genes (e.g., Akap 12 and Ngfr). Analyses of Ucp1 mRNA and protein showed that 17°C transiendy increased the BAP in ING from 21D mice; however, BAs were unexpectedly present in mice reared at 29°C. The involution of the BAP in WAT occurred after weaning in mice reared at 23°C. Therefore, the capacity to stimulate thermogenically competent BAs in WAT is set by a temperature-independent, genetically controlled program between birth and weaning.—Chabowska-Kita, A., Trabczynska, A., Korytho, A., Kaczmarek, M.

https://openalex.org/W1997977091,"Lymphoproliferative disease virus (LPDV) is a poorly understood, oncogenic avian retrovirus of domestic turkeys that has historically been restricted to Europe and Israel. However, a recent study reported LPDV in multiple wild turkey diagnostic cases from throughout the eastern United States of America (USA). To better understand the distribution of LPDV in the eastern USA, we surveyed 1,164 reportedly asymptomatic hunter-harvested wild turkeys from 17 states for the presence of LPDV proviral DNA by PCR. In total, 564/1,164 (47%) turkeys were positive for LPDV. Wild turkeys from each state had a relatively high prevalence of LPDV, although statewide prevalence varied from 26 to 83%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two major clades of LPDV in the USA, although one was at a low frequency suggesting restricted transmission, as well as significant clustering by state of isolation. To determine the best tissue to target for diagnostic purposes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow were tested from a subset of 15 hunter-harvested wild turkeys and 20 wild turkey diagnostic cases. Overall, bone marrow provided the highest level of detection for both hunter-harvested turkeys and diagnostic cases. The sensitivity of LPDV detection between tissues was not significantly different for diagnostic cases, but was for hunter-harvested birds. These results indicate that LPDV infection is common and widespread in wild turkey populations throughout the eastern USA, even without overt signs of disease."

The results revealed a strong down-regulation (more than 65%) of genes HA1 and FRO2 coding for enzymes proton-ATPase and Ferric-Chelate Reductase (FC-R), respectively, in –FeS plants when compared with –Fe ones. H+-extrusion and FC-R activity analyses confirmed the genetic results, indicating that flooding stress markedly repressed acidification and reduction responses to Fe deficiency (3.1- and 2.0-fold, respectively). Waterlogging reduced by half Fe concentration in +FeS roots, which led to 30% up-regulation of Fe transporter IRT1, although this effect was unable to improve Fe absorption. Consequently, flooding inhibited 57Fe uptake in +Fe and –Fe seedlings (29.8 and 66.2%, respectively) and 57Fe distribution to aerial part (30.6 and 72.3%, respectively). This evidences that the synergistic action of both enzymes H+-ATPase and FC-R is the preferential regulator of the Fe acquisition system under flooding conditions and, hence, their inactivation implies a limiting factor of citrus in their Fe-deficiency tolerance in waterlogged soils."
https://openalex.org/W2055021446,"Whether the coexistence of anti-A/B antibody and donor specific anti-HLA antibody (HLA-DSA) has a synergistic impact on the development of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR) in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is unclear. This study includes 92 KTRs who received a kidney from an ABO-incompatible (ABOi) donor or were presensitized to donor HLA (HLAs) and 292 controls (CONT). HLAs was defined as a crossmatch positivity or the presence of HLA-DSA. We compared the incidence of AAMR among ABOi (n = 58), ABOi+HLAs (n = 12), HLAs (n = 22), and CONT (n = 292) groups and evaluated the risk factors and antibody type (anti-A/B vs. HLA-DSA) responsible for AAMR. AAMR developed less frequently in ABOi and CONT than in the ABOi+HLAs or HLAs (P < 0.05 for all); however, there was no difference between the ABOi+HLAs and HLAs groups. AAMR developed more frequently with strong HLA-DSA at baseline; however, high baseline anti-A/B titer did not affect AAMR development. Strong baseline HLA-DSA was an independent predictor for AAMR, however the baseline anti-A/B titer was not. All four AAMR episodes in ABOi+HLAs were positive to HLA-DSA but not to anti-A/B. In conclusion, ABO incompatibility does not increase the risk for AAMR in HLAs KTRs."
https://openalex.org/W2056286712,"Progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor participate in growth and differentiation of the different rat decidual regions. Steroid hormone receptor antagonists were used to study steroid regulation of decidualization. Here we describe a suppressive interaction between progesterone receptor (onapristone) and estrogen receptor (ICI182780) antagonists and their relation to a rescue phenomenon with concomitant regulation of Hand2, Bmp2 and p-ERK1/2 during the early decidualization steps. Phenotypes of decidua development produced by antagonist treatments were characterized by morphology, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and expression of signaling molecules. We found that suppression of progesterone receptor activity by onapristone treatment resulted in resorption of the implantation sites with concomitant decrease in progesterone and estrogen receptors, PCNA, KI67 antigen, DESMIN, CCND3, CX43, Prl8a2, and signaling players such as transcription factor Hand2, Bmp2 mRNAs and p-ERK1/2. Moreover, FGF-2 and Vegfa increased as a consequence of onapristone treatment. Implantation sites from antagonist of estrogen receptor treated rats developed all decidual regions, but showed an anomalous blood vessel formation at the mesometrial part of the decidua. The deleterious effect of onapristone was partially counteracted by the impairment of estrogen receptor activity with rescue of expression levels of hormone steroid receptors, proliferation and differentiation markers, and the induction of a probably compensatory increase in signaling molecules Hand2, Bmp2 and ERK1/2 activation compared to oil treated controls. This novel drug interaction during decidualization could be applied to pathological endometrial cell proliferation processes to improve therapies using steroid hormone receptor targets."
https://openalex.org/W2070470244,"NK cells are the most abundant lymphocyte population in the feto-maternal interface during gestation. The uterine NK cells (uNK) are transient, have a unique immunophenotype and produce a number of cytokines. These cytokines play an important role in establishment and maintenance of vascular remodeling and tolerance associated with successful pregnancy. The uNK cells also express TIM-3 during gestation and blockade of TIM-3 expression results in fetal loss in mice. In this study we determined the effect of TIM-3 blockade on uNK cells. Specifically we observed surface receptor phenotype and cytokine production by uNK cells following TIM-3 blockade. Our results show that TIM-3 plays a role in regulating the uNK cells and contributes to the maintenance of tolerance at the feto-maternal interface."
https://openalex.org/W2075937953,"Purpose Asthma during adolescence can induce social, psychological, and behavioral problems. We examined the impact of asthma and other allergic diseases on psychological symptoms and health risk behaviors among South Korean adolescents. Methods In this population-based cross-sectional study, 3192 adolescents (10–18 years of age) participating in the 2008–2011 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were enrolled. Psychological problems associated with clinically diagnosed asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were assessed using questionnaires and surveys. Data was analyzed using logistic regression to determine the association of depression with allergic disease while controlling for age, sex, body mass index, smoking experience, and alcohol use. Results Asthma and atopic dermatitis were associated with a higher prevalence of depression (17.2% and 13%, respectively). After adjusting for the covariates, asthma patients were approximately two times as likely to have depression as non-allergic participants (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.22–2.68). Psychosocial stress significantly increased in the following order: no allergy, any allergy without asthma, asthma only, and asthma with any allergy (p for linear trend = 0.01). The asthma without other allergies group showed the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking (p = 0.007). Conclusions In this study, asthma with or without other allergies was significantly related to increases in depression, psychosocial stress, and smoking experience. Thus, care should be taken to adjust treatment to account for the psychological symptoms and health risk behaviors common among asthmatic adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2087772106,"In order to assess the feasibility of amplicon-based parallel next generation sequencing (NGS) for the diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), we investigated multiplex-PCR of 212 amplicons covering genomic mutational hotspots in 48 cancer-related genes. Samples from 64 patients with MPN and five controls as well as seven (myeloid) cell lines were analyzed. Healthy donor and reactive erythrocytosis samples showed several frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but no known pathogenic mutation. Sequencing of the cell lines confirmed the presence of the known mutations. In the patient samples, JAK2 V617F was present in all PV, 4 of 10 ET, and 16 of 19 MF patients. The JAK2 V617F allele burden was different in the three groups (ET, 33+/-22%; PV 48+/-28% and MF 68+/- 29%). Further analysis detected both previously described and undescribed mutations (i.e., G12V NRAS, IDH1 R132H, E255G ABL, and V125G IDH1 mutations). One patient with lymphoid BC/Ph+ ALL who harbored a T315I ABL mutation and was treated with ponatinib was found to have developed a newly acquired V216M TP53 mutation (12% of transcripts) when becoming resistant to ponatinib. Ponatinib led to a decrease of ABL T315I positive transcripts from 47% before ponatinib treatment to 16% at the time of ponatinib resistance in this patient, suggesting that both TP53 and ABL mutations were present in the same clone and that the newly acquired TP53 mutation might have caused ponatinib resistance in this patient. In conclusion, amplicon-sequencing-based NGS allows simultaneous analysis of multiple MPN associated genes for diagnosis and during treatment and measurement of the mutant allele burden."
https://openalex.org/W2131955463,"Rice field art is a large-scale art form in which people design rice fields using various kinds of ornamental rice plants with different leaf colors. Leaf color-related genes play an important role in the study of chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast structure and function, and anthocyanin biosynthesis. Despite the role of different metabolites in the traditional relationship between leaf and color, comprehensive color-specific metabolite studies of ornamental rice have been limited. We performed whole-genome resequencing and transcriptomic analysis of regulatory patterns and genetic diversity among different rice cultivars to discover new genetic mechanisms that promote enhanced levels of various leaf colors. We resequenced the genomes of 10 rice leaf-color accessions to an average of 40× reads depth and >95% coverage and performed 30 RNA-seq experiments using the 10 rice accessions sampled at three developmental stages. The sequencing results yielded a total of 1,814 × 106 reads and identified an average of 713,114 SNPs per rice accession. Based on our analysis of the DNA variation and gene expression, we selected 47 candidate genes. We used an integrated analysis of the whole-genome resequencing data and the RNA-seq data to divide the candidate genes into two groups: genes related to macronutrient (i.e., magnesium and sulfur) transport and genes related to flavonoid pathways, including anthocyanidin biosynthesis. We verified the candidate genes with quantitative real-time PCR using transgenic T-DNA insertion mutants. Our study demonstrates the potential of integrated screening methods combined with genetic-variation and transcriptomic data to isolate genes involved in complex biosynthetic networks and pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2330972712,"Elevated concentrations of arsenic, up to 7058 μg g-1 in topsoil and bedrock, and more than 0.03 μg m-3 in air on a 2-week basis, were measured in the Nellis Dunes Recreation Area (NDRA), a very popular off-road area near Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. The elevated arsenic concentrations in the topsoil and bedrock are correlated to outcrops of yellow sandstone belonging to the Muddy Creek Formation (≈ 10 to 4 Ma) and to faults crossing the area. Mineralized fluids moved to the surface through the faults and deposited the arsenic. A technique was developed to calculate airborne arsenic concentrations from the arsenic content in the topsoil. The technique was tested by comparing calculated with measured concentrations at 34 locations in the NDRA, for 3 periods of 2 weeks each. We then applied it to calculate airborne arsenic concentrations for more than 500 locations all over the NDRA. The highest airborne arsenic concentrations occur over sand dunes and other zones with a surficial layer of aeolian sand. Ironically these areas show the lowest levels of arsenic in the topsoil. However, they are highly susceptible to wind erosion and emit very large amounts of sand and dust during episodes of strong winds, thereby also emitting much arsenic. Elsewhere in the NDRA, in areas not or only very slightly affected by wind erosion, airborne arsenic levels equal the background level for airborne arsenic in the USA, approximately 0.0004 μg m-3. The results of this study are important because the NDRA is visited by more than 300,000 people annually."
https://openalex.org/W2035688413,"Tularemia is caused by a gram-negative, intracellular bacterial pathogen, Francisella tularensis (Ft). The history weaponization of Ft in the past has elevated concerns that it could be used as a bioweapon or an agent of bioterrorism. Since the discovery of Ft, three broad approaches adopted for tularemia vaccine development have included inactivated, live attenuated, or subunit vaccines. Shortcomings in each of these approaches have hampered the development of a suitable vaccine for prevention of tularemia. Recently, we reported an oxidant sensitive mutant of Ft LVS in putative EmrA1 (FTL_0687) secretion protein. The emrA1 mutant is highly sensitive to oxidants, attenuated for intramacrophage growth and virulence in mice. We reported that EmrA1 contributes to oxidant resistance by affecting the secretion of antioxidant enzymes SodB and KatG. This study investigated the vaccine potential of the emrA1 mutant in prevention of respiratory tularemia caused by Ft LVS and the virulent SchuS4 strain in C57BL/6 mice. We report that emrA1 mutant is safe and can be used at an intranasal (i. n.) immunization dose as high as 1x106 CFU without causing any adverse effects in immunized mice. The emrA1 mutant is cleared by vaccinated mice by day 14–21 post-immunization, induces minimal histopathological lesions in lungs, liver and spleen and a strong humoral immune response. The emrA1 mutant vaccinated mice are protected against 1000–10,000LD100 doses of i.n. Ft LVS challenge. Such a high degree of protection has not been reported earlier against respiratory challenge with Ft LVS using a single immunization dose with an attenuated mutant generated on Ft LVS background. The emrA1 mutant also provides partial protection against i.n. challenge with virulent Ft SchuS4 strain in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice. Collectively, our results further support the notion that antioxidants of Ft may serve as potential targets for development of effective vaccines for prevention of tularemia."
https://openalex.org/W2078800419,"Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) are utilized to identify the effects caused by human activities on water quality along the coast of Sanya, South China Sea. PCA and CA identify the seasonality of water quality (dry and wet seasons) and polluted status (polluted area). The seasonality of water quality is related to climate change and Southeast monsoons. Spatial pattern is mainly related to anthropogenic activities (especially land input of pollutions). PCA reveals the characteristics underlying the generation of coastal water quality. The temporal and spatial variation of the trophic status along the coast of Sanya is governed by hydrodynamics and human activities. The results provide a novel typological understanding of seasonal trophic status in a shallow, tropical, open marine bay."
https://openalex.org/W2017439362,"Introduction Abdominal pain in PNH has never been investigated by in-vivo imaging studies. With MRI, we aimed to assess mesenteric vessels flow and small bowel wall perfusion to investigate the ischemic origin of abdominal pain. Materials and Methods Six PNH patients with (AP) and six without (NOP) abdominal pain underwent MRI. In a blinded fashion, mean flow (MF, quantity of blood moving through a vessel within a second, in mL·s-1) and stroke volume (SV, volume of blood pumped out at each heart contraction, in mL) of Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) and Artery (SMA), areas under the curve at 60 (AUC60) and 90 seconds (AUC90) and Ktrans were assessed by two operators. Results Mean total perfusion and flow parameters were lower in AP than in NOP group. AUC60: 84.81 ± 11.75 vs. 131.73 ± 18.89 (P < 0.001); AUC90: 102.33 ± 14.16 vs. 152.58 ± 22.70 (P < 0.001); Ktrans: 0.0346 min-1 ± 0.0019 vs. 0.0521 ± 0.0015 (P = 0.093 duodenum, 0.009 jejunum/ileum). SMV: MF 4.67 ml/s ± 0.85 vs. 8.32 ± 2.14 (P = 0.002); SV 3.85 ml ± 0.76 vs. 6.55 ± 1.57 (P = 0.02). SMA: MF 6.95 ± 2.61 vs. 11.2 ± 2.32 (P = 0.07); SV 6.52 ± 2.19 vs. 8.78 ± 1.63 (P = 0.07). We found a significant correlation between MF and SV of SMV and AUC60 (MF:ρ = 0.88, P < 0.001; SV: ρ = 0.644, P = 0.024), AUC90 (MF: ρ = 0.874, P < 0.001; SV:ρ = 0.774, P = 0.003) and Ktrans (MF:ρ = 0.734, P = 0.007; SV:ρ = 0.581, P = 0.047). Conclusions Perfusion and flow MRI findings suggest that the impairment of small bowel blood supply is significantly associated with abdominal pain in PNH."
