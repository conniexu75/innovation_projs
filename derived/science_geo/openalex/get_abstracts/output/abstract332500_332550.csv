https://openalex.org/W2167705553,"Structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of compounds in the series La2-xSrx CuO4-y for 0.05 </= x </= 1.1, with deltax = 0.025, were studied. Resistance, susceptibility, Meissner, and shielding measurements have revealed superconductivity among several members of the series. For x = 0.15, the transition temperature T(c), measured at the midpoint of the resistive transition, is a maximum at 39.3 K with a width of 2 K. At other compositions the transition is broader and occurs at a lower temperature. Annealing the x = 0.15 sample in oxygen at 500 degrees C increases T(c) to 40.3 K, while annealing at the same temperature under vacuum suppresses the superconductivity. These changes in oxygen content and T(c) are reversible."

As a result of the unique properties of supercritical fluids, SFC is rapidly becoming a prominent separation technique for the analysis of reactive, thermally labile, and nonvolatile compounds. This article reviews the history, instrumentation, and practice of the technique. Particular emphasis is placed on the different programming methods that allow elution to be selectively controlled in ways that are unique to SFC."

Deep optical and neutral hydrogen images of Markarian 348, a type 2 Seyfert galaxy, show that it is a gigantic spiral (perhaps the largest known non-cluster galaxy). Measurements of the neutral hydrogen velocity field and spiral structure, and detection of an optical ""tidal plume,"" all provide evidence that it has been subject to tidal disruption. The measured velocities yield a mass-to-light ratio for this object (within a radius of 130 kiloparsecs from its nucleus) that is similar to the ratio found for the inner regions of most galaxies of similar type. This is one of the few cases where detailed velocity measurements have demonstrated that a galaxy with an active nucleus has been subject to extensive tidal perturbation."

https://openalex.org/W4252013622,"The article ""Back to the energy crisis"" by Mark Crawford (News & Comment, 6 Feb., p. 626) overstated American imports of petroleum and petroleum products for the years 1977 and 1985. Imports in 1977 averaged 8.8 million barrels per day as opposed to 8807 million barrels as stated. By 1985 imports had fallen to 5.07 (rounded) million barrels per day, not 5067 million barrels daily. The United States' use of petroleum-not foreign consumption as stated in the article-is projected to hit 17.7 million barrels per day in 1995. U.S. imports could then reach 9.8 million barrels a day."
