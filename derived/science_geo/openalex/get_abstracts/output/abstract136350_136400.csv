https://openalex.org/W2164916497,"The BRCA1 tumor suppressor encodes a polypeptide with two recognizable protein motifs: a RING domain near the N terminus and two tandem BRCT domains at the C terminus. Studies of tumor-associated mutations indicate that the RING and BRCT sequences are required for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. In addition, recent work has shown that BRCA1 is a potent regulator of RNA transcription and that the BRCT domains are also essential for this activity. Therefore, we used the Sos recruitment system to screen for proteins that bind this critical region of BRCA1. Our results show that the BRCT domains interact in vivo with CtIP, a protein originally identified on the basis of its association with the CtBP transcriptional co-repressor. This finding suggests that BRCA1 regulates gene expression, at least in part, by modulating CtBP-mediated transcriptional repression. Moreover, the in vivo interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP is completely ablated by each of three independent tumor-associated mutations affecting the BRCT motifs of BRCA1. These results indicate that the BRCA1-CtIP interaction may be required for tumor suppression by BRCA1.

Germline mutations of BRCA1 are responsible for many cases of hereditary breast cancer. Although the mechanism of tumor suppression by BRCA1 is poorly understood, recent studies suggest a role for its protein product in some aspect of DNA repair (1Zhang H. Tombline G. Weber B.L.

The major isoform of BRCA1 is a polypeptide of 1863 amino acids that contains a RING domain near the N terminus and two tandem copies of the BRCT motif at the C terminus (5Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W. Bell R. Rosenthal J. Hussey C. Tran T. McClure M. Frye C. Hattier T. Phelps R. Haugen-Strano A.

Phylogenetic conservation of the BRCA1 sequence is most pronounced in the RING and BRCT domains, implying that these regions are especially important for normal BRCA1 function. The BRCA1 alterations responsible for familial breast cancer are usually frameshift or nonsense mutations that grossly truncate its open reading frame (7Shattuck-Eidens D. McClure M. Simard J. Labrie F. Narod S. Couch F. Hoskins K. Weber B. Castilla L. Erdos M. Brody L. Friedman L. Ostermeyer E. Szabo C. King M.-C. Jhanwar S. Offit K. Norton L. Gilewski T. Lubin M. Osborne M. Black D.

Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, 5–10% of BRCA1-linked breast cancers can be attributed to missense mutations that create single amino acid substitutions. Most of these affect residues within the RING or BRCT sequences, and as such they underscore the importance of these regions for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression (7Shattuck-Eidens D. McClure M. Simard J. Labrie F. Narod S. Couch F. Hoskins K. Weber B. Castilla L. Erdos M. Brody L. Friedman L. Ostermeyer E. Szabo C. King M.-C. Jhanwar S. Offit K. Norton L. Gilewski T. Lubin M. Osborne M.

Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that BRCA1 modulates gene expression at the level of RNA transcription. First, the BRCT sequences of BRCA1 can activate RNA transcription when expressed as fusions with a heterologous DNA-binding domain (9Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 10Monteiro A.N.A. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Second, wild type BRCA1 polypeptides co-purify from whole cell extracts with the holoenzyme of RNA polymerase II (11Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Third, wild type BRCA1 can potentiate the transcription of certain reporter genes when overexpressed in mammalian cells (12Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng X.Y. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 13Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N.A. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Remarkably, each of these properties is abrogated by tumor-associated alterations of the BRCT domains, such as the A1708E and M1775R missense mutations and a nonsense mutation that deletes the C-terminal 11 amino acids of BRCA1 (Y1853Δ) (9Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 10Monteiro A.N.A. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, if BRCA1 does function in transcriptional regulation, the BRCT sequences are likely to have a central role in this process. The BRCT domain is found in more than 50 distinct proteins, many of which have defined roles in the cellular response to DNA damage (6Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 15Bork P. Hoffman K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V.

Although a common molecular function for this domain has not been uncovered, the BRCT sequences of some proteins serve as sites of protein-protein interaction (17Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the Sos recruitment system (SRS),1 a new form of yeast two-hybrid analysis (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), to screen for protein interactions involving the BRCT sequences of BRCA1. Several candidate BRCA1-interacting proteins were identified; our data show that one of these, the CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP), readily associates with BRCA1 in mammalian cells. CtIP was recently described as a polypeptide that binds CtBP (21Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), a transcriptional co-repressor used by the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein (22Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 23Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and several diverse DNA-binding factors, including the Drosophila Knirps, Snail, and Hairy proteins (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 25Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, BRCA1 may regulate gene expression by targeting the CtBP pathway of transcriptional repression. Significantly, the interaction between CtIP and BRCA1 is abolished by tumor-associated missense mutations in the BRCT domains of BRCA1, indicating that formation of a stable BRCA1-CtIP complex may be required for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. An expression plasmid encoding the SRS bait was produced by inserting cDNA sequences encoding the SZ segment of human BRCA1 (amino acids 1528–1863) into pAD-FLAG, a yeast shuttle vector that contains coding sequences for an N-terminal moiety of human Sos (residues 1–1070). The pAD-FLAG vector was itself generated in two steps using the Yes-5′ Sos and pADNS plasmids (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). First, a synthetic polylinker was inserted into the BamHI site of pYes-5′ Sos. Second, a HindIII/NotI fragment containing the Sos-coding and synthetic polylinker sequences was excised from the resultant vector and inserted into theHindIII/NotI sites of pADNS. To prepare cDNA libraries for SRS screening, polyadenylated RNA from HBL-100 cells was converted to cDNA using the Superscript™ Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and inserted into yeast shuttle vectors that contain coding sequences for the v-Src myristoylation signal. Two libraries of HBL-100 cDNA were prepared using different vectors: one library contains ∼30 million independent transformants in the pYes-MΔpoly(A) vector (the ne-2 library) and the other has ∼7 million independent transformants in pYes-Sal (the ns-1 library). The pYes-MΔpoly(A) vector has been described (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and pYes-Sal was produced by inserting a synthetic polylinker into theEcoRI/NotI sites of pYes-MΔpoly(A). SRS screening in yeast was conducted essentially as described (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) except that transformation of cdc25–2 cells with the bait and library plasmids was done successively rather than simultaneously. Plasmid DNA was recovered from each colony that displayed galactose-dependent growth at the restrictive temperature (36 °C). In addition to bait-interacting clones, SRS screening also selects for library plasmids that encode certain components of the Ras signaling pathway (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because TC21 is the most abundantly expressed Ras protein in HBL-100 cells, library plasmids encoding TC21 were identified by dot blot DNA hybridization and eliminated from further consideration. The remaining library plasmids were then subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis; this step eliminated plasmids encoding other components of the human Ras signaling pathways (e.g. H-Ras, CDC25, etc.) or containing cDNA inserts that were out-of-frame with the coding sequences for the v-Src myristoylation signal. To confirm the interaction in yeast, each of the remaining plasmids was then co-transfected intocdc25–2 cells together with a vector encoding either the original Sos-SZ bait or the Sos domain alone; those clones that interacted with the Sos-SZ hybrid, but not the Sos domain, upon re-transfection were deemed to be “positive.” Eighteen positive clones representing fourteen independent cDNA clones from nine different mRNAs were obtained by screening ∼25 million library transformants. Expression plasmids that encode hybrid polypeptides were constructed by inserting cDNA fragments into the pCMV-GAL4 vector (26Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) or the pVP-FLAG5, 6, or 7 vectors (27Tsan J.T. Wang Z. Jin Y. Hwang L.-Y. Bash R.O. Baer R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 217-232Google Scholar). Mammalian two-hybrid assays were conducted in 293 cells as described (27Tsan J.T. Wang Z. Jin Y. Hwang L.-Y. Bash R.O. Baer R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 217-232Google Scholar). To verify expression of the GAL4-X hybrids, lysates of each transfected culture were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a Gal4p-specific rabbit antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Expression vectors for human PCTAIRE-1 were provided by Sander van den Heuvel (28van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, each 100-mm plate of 293 cells was transfected with 7.0 μg of the expression plasmid and 0.5 μg of the pCMVβ control plasmid (CLONTECH) using the calcium phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.) (26Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Two days later, cell lysates were prepared in 0.5 ml of “high salt” Nonidet P-40 buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 10 μl of each lysate were evaluated by immunoblotting with the HA-specific monoclonal antibody (12CA5) to confirm expression of the HA-tagged polypeptide. The remainder of each lysate was incubated with 16 μg of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. After rocking at 4 °C for 2 h, 40 μl of staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose beads (20% slurry) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each lysate, and the mixture was rocked at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times in high salt Nonidet P-40 buffer with protease inhibitors and two times in “low salt” (250 mm NaCl) Nonidet P-40 buffer with protease inhibitors. Finally, the immunoprecipitates were examined by Western analysis (26Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) using antibody reagents that recognize either N-terminal (residues 1–304) (MS110 mouse monoclonal; Oncogene Research Products) (29Scully R. Ganesan S. Brown M. Caprio J.A.D. Cannistra S.A. Feunteun J. Schnitt S. Livingston D.M. Science. 1996; 272: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or C-terminal (residues 1844–1863) (C-20 rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) sequences of human BRCA1. To identify proteins that interact with the BRCT domains of BRCA1, we used the SRS, a new form of yeast two-hybrid analysis that does not involve a transcriptional readout (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). SRS screening exploits the ability of human Sos, a guanyl nucleotide exchange factor for Ras proteins, to rescue the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains bearing the temperature-sensitivecdc25–2 allele (30Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To detect protein-protein interactions, cdc25–2 cells are co-transformed with plasmids encoding two hybrid polypeptides: one containing the N-terminal 1070 residues of Sos fused to protein X (the Sos-X hybrid) and the other containing the myristoylation signal of v-Src fused to protein Y (the Myr-Y hybrid). If proteins X and Y interact stablyin vivo, then the Myr-Y hybrid will recruit Sos-X to the inner surface of the plasma membrane; the Sos moiety of Sos-X will then catalyze nucleotide exchange of membrane-bound Ras and restore the growth of cdc25–2 cells at the restrictive temperature (20Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For SRS screening we constructed a yeast expression plasmid that encodes Sos-SZ, a hybrid polypeptide containing sequences of human Sos (residues 1–1070) fused to the SZ segment of human BRCA1 (residues 1528–1863). Cdc25–2 yeast cells were then transformed with the Sos-SZ expression plasmid, and the synthesis of Sos-SZ polypeptides in these cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with a Sos-specific antiserum (data not shown). We also prepared cDNA libraries from HBL-100, an immortalized line of normal human mammary epithelial cells (31Caron de Fromentel C. Nardeux P.C. Soussi T. Lavialle C. Estrade S. Carloni G. Chandrasekaran K. Cassingena R. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These libraries, which encode hybrid polypeptides containing the myristoylation signal of v-Src fused to cDNA products of HBL-100, were used to transform cdc25–2 yeast cells that express the Sos-SZ bait. In all, 18 isolates that restored the growth of cdc25–2 cells in a BRCA1-dependent manner were obtained by screening approximately 25 million library transformants (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sequence analysis revealed that these isolates represent 14 independent cDNA clones derived from 9 distinct mRNAs. We obtained four independent cDNA isolates encoding the PCTAIRE-1 kinase (GenBankTM accession numberX66363) and three encoding hSDP, the homolog of a single-strand DNA-binding protein from chickens (cSDP, accession number U68380). In addition, single isolates were obtained for the heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein (HSC70; accession number P11142), the CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP; accession number U72066), and five additional proteins that have not been described previously. The mammalian version of the conventional two-hybrid assay was used to ascertain whether any of the candidate BRCA1-interacting proteins associate with BRCA1 in mammalian cells (27Tsan J.T. Wang Z. Jin Y. Hwang L.-Y. Bash R.O. Baer R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 217-232Google Scholar, 32Dang C.V. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Resar L.M.S. Kato G.J. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For this purpose we constructed a mammalian expression plasmid that encodes “VP16-SZ,” a hybrid polypeptide containing the transactivation domain of herpesvirus VP16 fused to the SZ segment of BRCA1, and a panel of vectors encoding the DNA-binding domain of Gal4p fused to each of the nine candidate BRCA1-interacting proteins. The mammalian two-hybrid assay was then performed by transfecting human 293 cells with a Gal4p-responsive reporter gene and pairwise combinations of the appropriate expression vectors. Reporter gene expression was determined by measuring the luciferase activity in cell lysates from each transfected culture. As illustrated in Fig. 1, luciferase activity was not significantly induced by co-expression of the VP16-SZ hybrid with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4p (lane 1) or by co-expression of the GAL4-CtIP hybrid with the VP16 transactivation domain (lane 14). However, a dramatic increase in luciferase activity was elicited by co-expression of the VP16-SZ and GAL4-CtIP hybrids (lane 13). In contrast, none of the other candidate BRCA1-interacting proteins induced a measurable increase upon co-expression with VP16-SZ (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, and 19). Western analysis with a Gal4p-specific antiserum confirmed that each of the GAL4-X hybrids was expressed at levels comparable with or greater than that of GAL4-CtIP (data not shown). The BRCA1-CtIP interaction was also detected by mammalian two-hybrid analysis in SW480, a line of human colon carcinoma cells (data not shown). The inability of the other eight proteins to interact with BRCA1 in the mammalian two-hybrid assay does not necessarily eliminate them as candidate BRCA1-associated proteins (26Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar,27Tsan J.T. Wang Z. Jin Y. Hwang L.-Y. Bash R.O. Baer R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 217-232Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these results indicate that CtIP forms a stable complex with BRCA1 in mammalian cells and that the interaction is mediated by sequences within the C-terminal 336 amino acids of BRCA1 (i.e. the SZ fragment). CtIP is a polypeptide of 897 amino acids that was recently identified on the basis of its interaction with the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) (21Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA library clone recovered by SRS screening encodes the C-terminal 853 amino acid residues of human CtIP (data not shown). To confirm the ability of CtIP to associate with BRCA1 in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with lysates of transfected 293 cells. Therefore, 293 cultures were transfected with a series of expression plasmids, each of which encoded a polypeptide containing the HA epitope. Two days later, lysates of each culture were immunoprecipitated with a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (12CA5), and each immunoprecipitate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of endogenous BRCA1 polypeptides in these immunoprecipitates was then determined by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against either an N-terminal (residues 1–304) (Fig. 2 A) or C-terminal (residues 1844–1863) (Fig. 2 B) region of BRCA1. As expected, endogenous BRCA1 was co-immunoprecipitated from cells expressing a HA-tagged polypeptide containing the BRCA1-interacting sequences of BARD1 (BARD1 residues 26–142) (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 7) (26Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In contrast, BRCA1 was not present in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing other HA-tagged proteins, including wild type (lanes 3 and 8) and kinase-inactive (lane 2) forms of PCTAIRE-1, as well as the TAL1, LMO2, GATA1, and ATF4 polypeptides (data not shown). Significantly, however, endogenous BRCA1 polypeptides were readily detected in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing HA-CtIP (Fig. 2,lanes 4 and 9). Although this analysis involves overexpression of an epitope-tagged CtIP polypeptide, by using a CtIP-specific polyclonal antiserum we have also observed co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous CtIP and BRCA1 polypeptides from untransfected HBL-100 and MCF7 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the specific association of BRCA1 and CtIP in mammalian cells was demonstrated by two independent procedures: the two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. The data described above indicate that CtIP interacts with the SZ fragment of BRCA1 (amino acids 1528–1863), a region that includes the two tandem BRCT motifs (Fig. 3 A). To define more specifically the sequence requirements for CtIP binding, smaller C-terminal segments of BRCA1 were tested for their potential to associate with CtIP in the mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the ability to bind CtIP is retained by the CT segment of BRCA1 (residues 1651–1863) (lane 3) but not by segments AZ and GZ (lanes 7and 9, respectively), each of which lacks sequences from BRCT motif 1 (Fig. 3 A). In separate experiments, the NP segment, which lacks sequences from BRCT motif 2 (Fig. 3 A), was also unable to associate with CtIP (data not shown). Thus, the minimal BRCA1 sequence required for CtIP association (i.e.the CT segment; residues 1651–1863) corresponds almost precisely to the two tandem BRCT domains, indicating that both BRCT motifs are involved in the interaction with CtIP (Fig. 3 A). Tumor susceptibility in some families with hereditary breast cancer has been ascribed to subtle alterations in the BRCT sequences of BRCA1. These tumor-associated lesions include missense mutations that produce single amino acid substitutions in either the first (e.g. A1708E) or second (M1775R) BRCT motif, as well as a nonsense mutation that eliminates the C-terminal 11 amino acids of BRCA1 (Y1853Δ) (7Shattuck-Eidens D.

Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To evaluate their effect on the BRCA1-CtIP interaction, GAL4-SZ hybrid polypeptides containing each of these lesions were tested for the ability to bind VP16-CtIP in the mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4). As expected, the wild type GAL4-SZ hybrid readily interacts with VP16-CtIP (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). However, this interaction is abolished by each of the three tumor-associated BRCA1 mutations (lanes 5, 7, and 9), despite the fact that the mutant GAL4-SZ polypeptides are expressed at levels equivalent or greater than that of wild type GAL4-SZ (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that tumorigenic lesions of the BRCT domain prevent the association of BRCA1 and CtIP. Although BRCA1 may play a central role in the cellular response to DNA damage (1Zhang H. Tombline G. Weber B.L.

Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar), the biochemical mechanisms by which BRCA1 exerts its effects are not understood. Through its association with known repair proteins such as HsRad51 (2Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M.

In addition, however, BRCA1 may also serve as a sensor or signal transducer that detects DNA damage and helps to coordinate the appropriate cellular response. Consistent with this, recent studies show that BRCA1 has the potential to regulate RNA transcription (9Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

Significantly, the transcriptional functions of BRCA1 are obviated by subtle alterations in the BRCT domains, including the A1708E and M1775R missense mutations (9Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Also, gene transfer experiments have shown that cell growth can be inhibited by overexpression of truncated BRCA1 polypeptides that retain the BRCT domains (34Humphrey J.S. Salim A. Erdos M.R.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3351-3355PubMed Google Scholar) and that growth inhibition by these polypeptides is mitigated by the A1708E and M1775R mutations (34Humphrey J.S. Salim A. Erdos M.R. Collins F.S. Brody L.C. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 94: 5820-5825Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the BRCT sequences of BRCA1, as well as the transcriptional regulatory functions ascribed to these sequences, may well be essential for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. Our data suggest that transcriptional regulation by BRCA1 is mediated by its association with CtIP, a protein that was recently identified on the basis of its ability to bind the CtBP transcriptional co-repressor (21Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CtBP was itself isolated as a cellular phosphoprotein that interacts with C-terminal sequences of the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein (22Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This region of E1A includes a short motif of five amino acids (PLDLS) that is required for CtBP binding (22Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 33Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of the CtBP-binding motif dramatically enhances the in vitro transformation potential and in vivotumorigenicity of E1A, implying that this motif normally serves to restrain E1A-mediated oncogenesis (33Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Moreover, the CtBP-binding sequence of E1A is a potent repressor of RNA transcription when targeted to a promoter by fusion with a heterologous DNA-binding domain (23Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Significantly, the tumor-restraining and transcriptional repression properties of the E1A C-terminal region correlate with its ability to bind CtBP (22Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 23Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent studies of Drosophila support the notion that CtBP functions as a co-repressor, i.e. a transcriptional repressor that is recruited to specific target genes by virtue of its association with an appropriate DNA-binding transcription factor. In particular, Nibu et al. (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have shown that the transcriptional repression domains of Knirps and Snail have sequences resembling the PLDLS motif of E1A and that these sequences mediate a functional interaction with the Drosophila ortholog of CtBP. Likewise, Poortinga et al. (25Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) reported that transcriptional suppression by the Hairy protein also involves in vivo association with Drosophila CtBP through a PLDLS-like sequence. Notably, each of these CtBP-interacting proteins belongs to a different class of DNA-binding transcription factor; DNA recognition by the Hairy, Knirps, and Snail proteins is mediated, respectively, by a helix-loop-helix domain, a nuclear receptor zinc-binding motif, and conventional (i.e. Tramtrak-like) zinc fingers (24Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 25Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, by using a PLDLS-like motif to recruit CtBP, DNA-binding transcription factors that are otherwise unrelated can repress gene expression by interaction with a common co-repressor. CtIP was recently identified as a human CtBP-interacting polypeptide that does not have obvious sequence homology with other known proteins (21Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, CtIP does possess a CtBP-binding sequence (PLDLS) identical to that of E1A, and mutation analysis indicates that this sequence is required for the interaction of CtIP with CtBP (21Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, CtIP belongs to a family of diverse proteins that employ a common PLDLS-like motif to bind the CtBP co-repressor. Although some members of this family possess recognizable DNA-binding motifs (e.g.Hairy, Knirps, and Snail), others, such as viral E1A and cellular CtIP, do not. The effects of CtIP on the DNA repair, transactivation, and tumor suppression properties of BRCA1 remain unclear. The function of CtIP with respect to the CtBP pathway of transcriptional repression is also not understood. On one hand, CtIP may serve as a downstream effector of CtBP that represses RNA transcription. On the other hand, CtIP may function as an regulator of CtBP that either promotes or inhibits CtBP-mediated transcriptional repression. Any one of these alternatives might account for the transcriptional activation properties displayed by the BRCT sequences of BRCA1 (9Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 10Monteiro A.N.A. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All clones had a common nucleotide sequence that was homologous to the mRNA sequences of mouse and human collagen XVIII. The deduced amino acid sequence of the chick fragment shows an 83% overall homology with the human and mouse collagen XVIII. Similar to the human and mouse homologue, the chick collagen XVIII mRNA has a size of 4.5 kilobase pairs. In Western blots, collagen XVIII appeared as a smear with a molecular mass of 300 kDa. After treatment with heparitinase, the protein was reduced in molecular mass by 120 kDa to a protein core of 180 kDa. Collagen XVIII has typical features of a collagen, such as its existence, under non-denaturing conditions, as a non-covalently linked oligomer, and a sensitivity of the core protein to collagenase digestion. It also has characteristics of an HSPG, such as long heparitinase-sensitive carbohydrate chains and a highly negative net charge. Collagen XVIII is abundant in basal laminae of the retina, epidermis, pia, cardiac and striated muscle, kidney, blood vessels, and lung.

Like perlecan, agrin is a large multi-domain protein of over 200 kDa with several laminin G, follistatin, and epidermal growth factor-like repeats (16Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M.

Side by side comparison shows that the domain arrangements at the C-terminal part of agrin is similar to that of perlecan (1Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J.

Members of the collagen family, such as collagen IX and XII, also carry glycosaminoglycan side chains and exist as part-time proteoglycans. So far, however, only chondroitin sulfate chains have been shown to be associated with collagen protein cores (20Fukai N. Apte S. Olsen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 3-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that collagen XVIII is the first member of the collagen family with heparan sulfate side chains. Collagen XVIII was identified several years ago by screening cDNA libraries with probes for collagen-like proteins (21Oh S.P. Yamagata Y. Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Ooshima A. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mouse and human collagen XVIII are expressed in three alternative splice variants and localized at perivascular basal laminae (25Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Griffith C.M. Oh S.P. Fadel B. Quertermous T.

Collagen XVIII came into the focus of medical interest when an 18-kDa anti-angiogenic peptide with tumor-suppressing activity, named endostatin, turned out to be the C-terminal part of collagen XVIII (28O'Reilly M.S.

Based on the presence of several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan attachment, it was suggested that collagen XVIII could be a proteoglycan (21Oh S.P. Yamagata Y. Muragaki Y. Timmons S.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, attempts to show that collagen XVIII is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan were unsuccessful, as the digestion with chondroitinase did not lead to a shift in the molecular weight of the protein (25Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Griffith C.M. Oh S.P. Fadel B. Quertermous T. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8763-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate that collagen XVIII is indeed a proteoglycan with almost half of its molecular weight in heparan sulfate side chains. Furthermore, collagen XVIII is a constituent of almost all embryonic and adult basal laminae. The two monoclonal antibodies (mAb 6C4 and 1B11) against a heparitinase-sensitive proteoglycan from chick embryonic basal lamina were obtained from hybridoma clones of X63Ag8.653 myeloma cells (29Kearney J.F. Radbruch A. Liesegang B. Rajewsky K. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1548-1558PubMed Google Scholar) fused with splenocytes of a mouse immunized with embryonic day (E) 10 chick retinal basal laminae. Cross-reactivity studies (30Halfter W. Schurer B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the isolation of cDNAs with identical nucleotide sequences with both antibodies (this study) show that the 1B11 and 6C4 antibodies recognize the same protein.

Hassel (Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, Tampa Bay, FL). A mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 33-2, see Ref. 36Bayne E. Anderson M. Fambrough D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1486-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to a chicken heparan sulfate proteoglycan was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (John Hopkins University, Baltimore). The tissue distribution and the molecular weight of the antigen strongly suggest that the 33-2 antibody recognizes chick perlecan. The 6C4 and 1B11 hybridoma supernatant was used to screen each 600,000 and 300,000 recombinants from an E5 chick yolk sac lambda-ZAP II cDNA expression library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eleven positive phage clones from the 6C4 screen and 3 clones from the 1B11 screen were plaque-purified, and Bluescript II SK(+) phagemids containing the inserts were rescued by in vivo excision. The plasmids were purified using the Wizard plasmid purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced on both strands at the University of Pittsburgh sequencing facility by using T3, T7, and internal sequencing primers and the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (ABI, Foster City, CA). Sequences were aligned and a contig was constructed using the “Sequencer” software (Gene Codes Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). The sequences were compared with published data base banks using the Blast search algorithm (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59917) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were translated into amino acid sequences using the Sequencer program, and the amino acid sequence was aligned with the human and mouse collagen XVIII peptide sequences using the P-Blast program (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59917) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, mRNA from E10 chick brain, liver, and kidney was isolated using the “Total RNA Isolation” kit (Promega) followed by using the “Poly(A) Track” kit (Promega). One μg of poly(A)+ mRNA samples were separated in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde, transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Immobilon N, Millipore), and cross-linked with UV (Stratagene). cRNA hybridization probes were synthesized from the linearized p10d template in the presence of digoxigenin UTP using the RNA-polymerase labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim). A digoxigenin-labeled RNA ladder (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to determine the size of the collagen XVIII mRNA. Another set of Northern blots, containing mRNA samples of E9 chick brain, gut, heart, liver, and cultured astrocytes (38Tsen G. Napier A. Halfter W. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15934-15937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was probed with the radiolabeled insert from the p10d plasmid. The probe was synthesized using random primers and [α-32P]dATP. Membranes were hybridized for 20 h with radioactive probe and washed with high stringency. Amnion, kidneys, and meninges were dissected from E10 chick embryos and homogenized in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' solution (CMF), 50 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma). The homogenates were spun at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellets were re-extracted in 8 m urea in CMF and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm. The supernatants from the urea extracts were used as the samples. To characterize further the biochemical nature of the protein, samples were treated with 0.5 units of heparitinase (Seikagaku, Rockville, MA), 0.5 units of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma), or 5 units/ml collagenase (Sigma type VII) for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Intact tissues were treated first with the enzymes for 1 h and washed in CMF twice. Following homogenization in CMF and centrifugation, the pellets were extracted in 8 m urea, spun again, and the supernatants from the urea extracts were used as samples. Vitreous bodies were collected from E10 chick eyes, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was used, undigested or digested, as samples. Vitreous body supernatant and tissue extracts were mixed with SDS sample buffer/β-mercaptoethanol and were loaded either boiled or non-boiled onto the gels. The proteins were separated by 3.6–14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon P membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% skim milk in CMF, the blots were incubated with the 6C4 or 1B11 hybridoma supernatants for 1 h. The blots were rinsed three times in CMF/milk, incubated with 1:5000 diluted (CMF/milk) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h, and finally developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as described previously (31Halfter W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2863-2873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect any nonspecific proteolysis during the enzyme treatments, blots with heparitinase- and collagenase-treated samples were also stained with a monoclonal antibody to tenascin (clone M1, see above). The trunks of E3 to E16 chick embryos and the dissected spinal cord of a 5-day-old chick (P5) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h. After washing in CMF and cryoprotecting with 30% sucrose for 4 h, the specimens were embedded in Tissue-Tek (Miles, Elkhart, IN) and sectioned with a cryostat at 25 μm. Muscle samples from post-hatched (P) 5 chicken were sectioned unfixed. Sections were mounted on Superfrost slides (Fisher) and incubated with hybridoma supernatants for 1 h. After 3 rinses, the sections were incubated with 1:500 Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for another hour. After 2 final rinses, the specimens were examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Basal lamina whole mounts from E6 chick retinae were prepared as described (39Halfter W. Reckhaus W. Kroeger S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3712-3722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whole mounts were rinsed several times with 2% Triton X-100 to remove all cellular components and stained with the 6C4 mAb to collagen XVIII or the 9H2 mAb to NCAM (see above). The p10d plasmid was linearized, and a digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probe were synthesized from the template using an RNA polymerase labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The in situ hybridization procedure of tissue sections follows the procedure described previously (40Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Adjacent sections were also labeled with probes to agrin and collagen XII. The isolation of the agrin plasmid has been described previously (13Tsen G. Halfter W. Kröger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the plasmid to collagen XII was obtained by antibody screening of a E5 chick yolk sac cDNA library with a polyclonal antiserum to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans from chick embryos. The identity of the collagen XII clone was confirmed by matching the DNA sequence with the mRNA sequence of collagen XII (bp 5070–5604) in the data bank using the Blast search. 2W. Halfter, unpublished observations. Collagen XVIII was isolated from E10 chicken vitreous bodies by ion exchange chromatography followed by immunoaffinity purification using the 6C4 mAb coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, see Ref.30Halfter W. Schurer B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The vitreous bodies from approximately 400 eyes were collected and spun at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant (100 ml) was run over a 3-ml column of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and eluted with a salt gradient from 0 to 2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Fractions containing collagen XVIII immunoreactivity were collected, dialyzed against CMF, and run over an affinity column containing 6C4 mAb conjugated to Sepharose. After extensive washing with CMF, 0.5% Tween, and CMF alone, collagen XVIII was eluted with 0.1 m diethylamine buffer, pH 11.5. Fractions were tested by a dot assay on nitrocellulose membrane filters, and collagen XVIII-containing fractions were concentrated using Centricon filters (Millipore). The concentration of the proteoglycan was estimated both by the dye-binding method of Minamide and Bamburg (41Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and by gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie and a modified Alcian blue/silver staining procedure for the detection of proteoglycans (42Moller H.J. Heinegard D. Poulsen J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The concentration of the samples was also estimated by comparing the staining density of the proteoglycan band with that of known concentrations of laminin and fibronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in adjacent lanes of the gel. Each purification yielded between 10 and 50 μg of proteoglycan. As substrates for cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth assays, collagen XVIII (50 μg/ml), merosin (Life Technologies, Inc., 50 μg/ml), and ovalbumin (Sigma, 50 μg/ml) were spotted onto nitrocellulose-coated dishes (43Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The dishes were rinsed 3 times in CMF, 2% ovalbumin, and 60 μl of a cell suspension from trypsin-dissociated E12 chick dorsal root ganglia in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 2% ovalbumin was added to the substrates. After 6 h, the cultures were rinsed 3 times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% ovalbumin, and finally fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The number of cells per microscopic field were counted at 3 different areas of every culture dish. For each substrate, the assays was run in triplicate. To account for variations between different test runs, the average number of cells on the ovalbumin control substrate was set at 100%. The average number of cells attached on the other substrates was expressed as multiples of the ovalbumin control. The identity of the cells as Schwann cells was done by staining cultures with a mAb to P0 (clone 1E8, kindly provided by Dr. E. Frank, University of Pittsburgh, see Ref. 44Bhattacharyya A. Frank E. Ratner N. Brackebury R. Neuron. 1991; 7: 831-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a protein specific for Schwann cells. According to the immunohistochemistry, over 90% of the cells in the ovalbumin and collagen XVIII-coated dishes were Schwann cells. Two monoclonal antibodies to a putatively new basal lamina HSPG were used to screen an E5 chick yolk sac cDNA expression library. The screen resulted in the isolation of 14 cDNA clones ranging in size from 2 to 2.5 kb. All 14 clones overlapped in their sequence. A Blast search revealed that the common sequence was highly homologous to the 3′ third of human and mouse collagen XVIII mRNA. The 2.5-kb p10d cDNA clone was the longest and most complete cDNA clone, as it contained at its 3′ end an AATAAA termination signal followed by a poly(A) tail (Gene Bank™ accession number AF083440). The p10d clone also contained 1.2 kb of 3′-untranslated region and 1.2 kb of a coding sequence that was homologous to the 3′ third of the coding region of human and mouse collagen XVIII. Translation of the coding sequence showed a 387-amino acid long peptide that started at its N-terminal end with a typical collagen sequence that was followed by a short, non-collagenous stretch. After yet another short collagen sequence, the peptide ended at its C-terminal part with a long, non-collagenous domain (Fig. 1). The two chick collagen domains were over 90% homologous with the 9th and 10th collagen domain (Col9 and Col10) of the human and mouse collagen XVIII. Both non-collagenous domains (NC10 and NC11) were between 60 and 90% identical to the human and mouse collagen XVIII counterparts. The most homologous sequence in the NC11 domain corresponded to the N-terminal part of the 18-kDa endostatin peptide (Fig. 1). The overall amino acid sequence identity of the chick and human collagen XVIII was 65%, and the overall homology was 83%. The identity and homology between the chick and human amino acid sequences are slightly lower than the identity and homology between the human and mouse collagen XVIII amino acid sequences, which are 79 and 95%, respectively. The chick sequence showed one serine-glycine consensus sequence as a potential GAG attachment site, which was conserved in the human and mouse homologue. Northern blot showed that the chick collagen XVIII was abundant in kidney and heart and barely detectable in liver and brain tissue. The message size was in all tissues 4.5 kb (Fig. 2, lanes 1–4). The Northern blots were repeated but using a radiolabeled DNA probe. The blots showed a single band of 4.5 kb in all samples that was faint in samples of brain (Fig. 2, lane 6), gut, and liver (not shown) but prominent in samples from cultured astrocytes (Fig. 2, lane 5). Based on the overall sequence homology, we assumed that the chick HSPG is the chick homologue of collagen XVIII, and we decided to tentatively refer to the unidentified chick HSPG as collagen XVIII in further studies.Figure 2Northern blots showing the size and abundance of chick collagen XVIII mRNA in kidney (lane 1), liver (lane 2), brain (lane 3), and heart (lane 4). A strong band of 4.5 kb was detected in samples of kidney and heart, whereas faint bands were detected in liver and brain. The blot with lanes 1–4 was probed with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA. Another blot, probed with a radiolabeled DNA probe (lanes 5 and 6), showed a strong band of 4.5 kb in a sample from cultured astrocytes and a faint 4.5-kb band in an mRNA sample of brain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Western blots, intact chick collagen XVIII from chick vitreous body appeared as a smear with an apparent molecular mass of 300 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 1, and Fig. 4, lane 4). Digestion with heparitinase led to a reduction of the size of the protein by 120 kDa to a core protein of 180 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2, and Fig. 4,lane 5). Treatment with chondroitinase had no effect on the size or banding pattern of the molecule (Fig. 3, lane 4, and Fig. 4, lane 6), confirming previous experiments with mouse collagen XVIII (25Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Griffith C.M. Oh S.P. Fadel B. Quertermous T. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8763-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). When the samples were treated with collagenase, the protein was no longer detectable in Western blots (Fig. 3,lane 3, and Fig. 4, lane 7), demonstrating a collagenase-sensitive core protein. To check the collagenase and heparitinase preparations for potential protease contamination, the same samples that were used to detect collagen XVIII were also probed with an antibody to tenascin. Tenascin, a large 220-kDa glycoprotein, was degraded neither by collagenase (Fig. 3, lane 6) nor heparitinase (Fig. 3, lane 7). The specificity of collagenase for only collagenous proteins was confirmed in an independent study by digesting chick vitreous body and meninges with the enzyme (45Halfter W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 46Halfter W. Schurer B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 397: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); all collagenous components from vitreous body and meninges, such as collagen I, II, IV, and IX, were no longer detectable in Western blots, whereas the abundance and the banding pattern of non-collagenous vitreous body and meningeal proteins, such as laminin, agrin, nidogen, tenascin, fibronectin, and axonin I, were unchanged.Figure 4Western blots comparing the banding pattern of collagen XVIII in non-boiled (lanes 1–3) and boiled samples (lanes 4–7) from chick vitreous body. The samples in lanes 2 and 5 were treated with heparitinase, the samples in lane 3 and 6 with chondroitinase, and lane 7 with collagenase.

Normally angiogenesis does not occur actively in adults but an exception is the female reproductive organ. In the uterine endometrium, angiogenesis takes place actively for supporting the endometrial growth that occurs during transition from the diestrus to estrous stage. This transition is under control of 17β-estradiol (E2), an ovarian hormone, and can be mimicked by injection of E2 to ovariectomized (OVX) mouse. Thus, the uterus is a pertinent site to examine the Epo function in angiogenesis. We found that Epo protein and its mRNA were produced in an E2-dependent manner, when the uterus from OVX mouse was cultured in vitro. The de novoprotein synthesis was not needed for E2 induction of Epo mRNA. Administration of E2 to OVX mouse induced a rapid and transient increase in Epo mRNA in the uterus. Injection of Epo into the OVX mouse uterine cavity promoted blood vessel formation in the endometrium. Furthermore, injection of the soluble Epo receptor capable of binding with Epo into the uterine cavity of non-OVX mouse in diestrus stage inhibited the endometrial transition to proestrus stage, whereas heat-inactivated soluble Epo receptor allowed the transition to occur. These results, combined with our finding that the endothelial cells in uterine endometrium express Epo receptor, strongly suggest that Epo is an important factor for the E2-dependent cyclical angiogenesis in uterus.

Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels by the extension of pre-existing vessels into avascular area and involves the proteolytic degradation of the vascular basal membrane, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and alignment of the migrating cells for tubular formation. Angiogenesis occurs very actively in embryogenesis, but it is down-regulated in the healthy adult. Active neovascularization in adults takes place in certain pathological conditions such as arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, wound healing, and tumor growth (reviewed in Ref. 1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6091) Google Scholar). An exception in adults is the female reproductive organ, where active angiogenesis is demanded to support the cyclic remodeling of tissues. In every estrus cycle, capillary networks in the ovaries are formed for supporting development of follicles and corpora lutea. In the uterus, cyclic formation of blood vessels in the functional endometrium occurs to compensate for the lost vessels. In response to embryonic implantation, decidual transformation of the endometrium is accompanied by neovascularization, which ultimately leads to formation of maternal vessels in the placenta. Cyclic development of the uterine endometrium is under the control of E2,1 which is produced by ovarian follicles (2Clark J.H. Markaverich B.M. Knobil E. Neil J. The Physiology of Reproduction; Actions of Ovarian Steroids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 675-724Google Scholar). This endometrial development can be mimicked by the administration of E2 to the OVX immature or adult animals (3Ham K.N. Hurley J.V. Lopata A. Ryan G.B. J.

Angiogenic activity of Epo has been studied by the use of in vitro cultured endothelial cells. EpoR mRNA is expressed in endothelial cells from human umbilical vein, bovine adrenal capillary, and rat brain capillary (28Anagnostou A. Liu Z. Steiner M. Chin K. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Noguchi C.T.

Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5978-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and also angiogenesis of the rat thoracic aorta (31Carlini R.G. Reyes A.A. Rothstein M. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 740-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recent studies of human umbilical vein endothelial cells indicate that Epo signaling in endothelial cells is conducted via tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including phosphorylation of transcription factor STAT-5, which is similar to that in erythroid cells (32Haller H. Christel C. Dannenberg L. Thiele P. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 481-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether endothelial EpoR is physiologically functional or is only a vestige reflecting a common developmental lineage between endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells (8Bikfalvi A. Han Z.C. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 523-529PubMed Google Scholar). The uterus where the active angiogenesis takes place in an E2-dependent manner may be a target pertinent to examine the physiological significance of Epo in angiogenesis. We found E2-dependent Epo production in uterus, suggesting the estrous cycle-dependent fluctuation of Epo concentration in the uterine tissues. This finding prompted us to examine the role of Epo in the E2-induced endometrial regeneration with an expectation that Epo acts as a uterine angiogenic factor. Recombinant human Epo was produced and isolated as described previously (33Goto M. Akai K. Murakami A. Hashimoto C. Tsuda E. Ueda M. Kawanishi G. Takahashi N. Ishimoto A. Chiba H. Sasaki R. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 67-71Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Goto M. Murakami A. Akai K. Kawanishi G. Ueda M. Chiba H. Sasaki R. Blood. 1989; 74: 1415-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epo was measured with a sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunoassay using two monoclonal antibodies that bind Epo at different epitopes (35Okano M. Masuda S. Narita H. Masushige S. Kato S. Imagawa S. Sasaki R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This assay measures Epo as low as 1 pg/ml. Recombinant human Epo was used as a standard. Recombinant murine soluble EpoR (sEpoR), an extracellular domain of EpoR capable of binding with Epo, was produced and isolated as described in the previous report (36Nagao M. Masuda S. Abe S. Ueda M. Sasaki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 888-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by the use of RNA Isolation System kit (Promega). The RT reaction was performed using a random nonamer primer and 1 μg of RNA in a volume of 20 μl. PCR primers of Epo and β-actin were those described previously (22Morishita E. Masuda S. Nagao M. Yasuda Y. Sasaki R. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 26Masuda S. Chikuma M. Sasaki R. Brain Res. 1997; 746: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and those of VEGF were sense primer (mVEGF130F, 5′-TGCTGTACCTCCACCATGCCAA-3′) and antisense primer (mVEGF657R, 5′-ACCGCCTTGGCTTGTCACATCT-3′) (GenBankTM accession number M95200; Ref. 48Claffey K.P. Wilkison W.O. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR cycles and conditions for denaturation, annealing, and elongation were 40 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 63 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C of Epo; 25 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 64 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C of VEGF; 25 cycles, 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 61 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C of β-actin. The amplified DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Band intensity was quantified using a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH image program. 2National Institutes of Health image program written by Wayne Rasband is available from the Internet by anonymous ftp from zippy.nimh.nih.gov. The PCR cycle used here was set within the range so that the cycle number was approximately proportional to the band intensity of the amplified DNA. Animals were maintained and handled in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals at Kyoto University. Four-week-old outbred mice of the ICR strain (Clea) were ovariectomized and used for experiments at 4–6 weeks after OVX. Ten-week-old mice in the diestrus stage, which was determined by the vaginal smear, were used for experiments of non-OVX mice. Bilateral horns of the uterus from OVX mouse were cut into two separate horns. One horn was cultured in the medium containing E2 for 6 h in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum, and the contralateral horn was cultured without E2 as a control. Epo protein secreted in the culture media was measured. Tissues were used for detection of Epo mRNA by RT-PCR. E2 (0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (olive oil) was given intraperitoneally. Epo was injected into the uterine cavity of the OVX mouse as follows. The abdominal wall of the mouse under deep anesthesia was incised, and the entire uterus was pulled out. Then the uterus was ligated at the oviduct and vaginal ends to form three uterine cavities, two lateral and one central. Epo in 100 μl of saline was injected into one of the lateral cavities through a microsyringe with a 32-gauge needle (Hamilton) and saline into the contralateral cavity as a control. Then the whole uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal incision was sutured. At 24 h after injection, the uterus was excised and fixed in Zamboni solution. sEpoR or heat-inactivated sEpoR in 100 μl of saline was injected into uterine cavity of 10-week-old non-OVX mice in the diestrus stage with the above-described procedures for Epo injection. At 24 h after injection, the uterus was excised and fixed in Zamboni solution. Methods for preparing cryosections and staining tissues were as described previously (37Yasuda Y. Nagao M. Okano M. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Konishi H. Tanimura T. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1993; 35: 711-722Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cells and EpoR-expressing cells were detected by the use of anti-factor VIII (von Willebrand factor) antiserum (Dako, 1:200) and anti-N-terminal EpoR antiserum (38Nagao M. Matsumoto S. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Blood. 1993; 81: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Immunocomplexes were visualized using ABC kit (Vector) and diaminobenzidine (Dojin). If we assume that Epo plays an important role in E2-dependent angiogenesis in the uterine endometrium, there would be two possibilities for Epo production. One possibility is that uterine target cells gain responsiveness to Epo by the action of E2, and the serum Epo derived from the kidney acts on the E2-sensitive cells. The other would be that a local site for Epo production exists in the uterine tissues, and the production is induced by E2, resulting in an E2-dependent increase of Epo concentration in uterine tissues sufficient for activating angiogenesis. To test the latter possibility, we first examined if the in vitrocultured uterus from OVX mouse produced Epo protein and its mRNA in an E2-dependent manner. One of the bilateral horns of the uterus prepared from the OVX mouse was cultured in the medium containing E2, and the other horn was cultured in the absence of E2 as a control. Epo production into the culture medium was almost undetectable in the absence of E2, whereas the culture with E2 produced Epo in an E2-dependent manner, and the increase was evident at physiological concentrations of E2(10−8m) (Fig. 1 a). Cycloheximide and actinomycin D completely inhibited E2-induced production of Epo by the cultured uterus (Fig. 1 b), demonstrating that Epo secreted into the culture media was newly synthesized. Epo mRNA was detected with RT-PCR, and restriction mapping confirmed that the amplified DNA band was the specific product derived from Epo mRNA (data not shown). Epo mRNA was definitely expressed in the uterus cultured with E2, but it was undetectable in that cultured without E2 (Fig. 1 b). Actinomycin D completely blocked expression of Epo mRNA, whereas the expression was superinduced by cycloheximide, indicating that the de novoprotein synthesis is not needed for induction of Epo mRNA. Epo that supports erythropoiesis is produced by the kidney in a hypoxia-inducible manner (17Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jelkmann W. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 449-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). We cultured the uterus in the absence or presence of 10−7m E2in 21, 5, and 2% O2, but Epo production was not activated by the low oxygen concentrations (data not shown). We examined whether or not E2 injection to the OVX mouse induced Epo mRNA in the uterus. E2 was given intraperitoneally, and the uterus was removed at intervals to extract RNA. Epo and β-actin mRNAs were measured semi-quantitatively by setting PCR cycles to be approximately proportional to the band intensity of the amplified DNA. The two upper panels in Fig. 2 a show Epo mRNA- and β-actin mRNA-derived products from two individual mice, and thelowest panel in Fig. 2 a indicates band intensities of Epo mRNA-derived product (n = 5 mice). There was a clear increase of Epo mRNA at 1 h after E2 injection, and the increase continued for at least 4 h, but at 8 h its level decreased to that of E2-uninjected mice. VEGF mRNA was also increased at 1 h after E2 injection, and thereafter its level was gradually reduced (the lowest panel in Fig. 2 b), which was in agreement with the previous finding (10Cullinan-Bove K. Koos R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Three amplified DNA bands (the most upper panel in Fig. 2 b) are derived from VEGF mRNAs produced by alternative splicing of the primary transcript (39Tischer E. Gospodarowicz D. Mitchell R. Silva M. Schilling J. Lau K. Crisp T. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 40Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major band is derived from VEGF164 mRNA. To examine the effects of Epo on uterine tissues in vivo and compare with those of E2, Epo was injected into one of the uterine bilateral cavities of OVX mouse and saline into the contralateral cavity as a control. E2 or olive oil (solvent for E2) was given intra-peritoneally. At 24 h after injection, we inspected uterine tissue sections under light microscopy. Administration of E2 to OVX mice caused development of uterine tissues including uterine hypertrophy and endometrial growth (compare Fig. 3 c witha and b). Similar development was found in the uterus after injection of Epo (Fig. 3 e). Little enlargement of the uterus occurred in OVX mouse that received saline (compare Fig. 3, a and d). A clear difference between E2- or Epo-injected mouse and oil- or saline-injected mouse was found when endometrial sections were stained with the antiserum against factor VIII, an endothelial cell-specific marker; blood vessel formation was stimulated upon administration of Epo (Fig. 3 j) as well as E2(Fig. 3 h). To demonstrate this stimulation by a more quantitative manner, we counted blood vessels in the sections. Stimulation by Epo was similar to that by E2, when vessel density was expressed per field; both increased the density by 210% (Fig. 4 a). However, endometrial sections from E2-injected mouse were significantly lower in cell density than those from Epo-injected mouse (see Fig. 3, h and j). Thus, the vessel number per endometrial cell increased by 440% upon E2 injection, whereas the increase by Epo injection was 230% (Fig. 4 b). E2 causes a rapid increase in microvascular permeability, resulting in a lower cell density of the endometrium (10Cullinan-Bove K. Koos R.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Moreover, the action of Epo somewhat differs from that of E2 in the morphology of vessels; most of the vessels induced by Epo were smaller in diameter than those induced by E2. Neither development of uterine tissues nor stimulation of blood vessel formation was observed when Epo was pretreated with an excess amount of sEpoR (data not shown). The cyclic remodeling of uterine tissues in the murine estrus cycle takes place every 3–5 days. The above-mentioned results suggest that Epo is involved in the estrus cycle-dependent endometrial growth through stimulation of angiogenesis. To demonstrate this possibility, sEpoR or the heat (56 °C, 30 min)-inactivated sEpoR was injected into one of the uterine bilateral cavities of the non-OVX mouse in diestrus stage and saline into the contralateral cavity. At 24 h (proestrus) after injection, we inspected uterine tissue sections under light microscopy. Transition from diestrus (Fig. 5 a) to proestrus (Fig. 5 d) caused endometrial growth. This endometrial growth was severely inhibited by the injection of sEpoR (Fig. 5 b) but not by the inactivated sEpoR (Fig. 5 c). To quantify the effect of sEpoR, the areas of myometrium and endometrium layers were calculated. The endometrium/myometrium ratios in the sEpoR-injected uterus were significantly smaller than those in the inactivated sEpoR- or saline-injected uterus (Table I), indicating that sEpoR was detrimental to the endometrial growth in the transition from diestrus to proestrus. Further detailed inspection of magnified sections stained with the anti-factor VIII indicated that the formation of blood vessels in the endometrium is inhibited by sEpoR but not by the inactivated sEpoR (Fig. 5, e–g).Table IsEpoR but not heat-inactivated sEpoR inhibits endometrial growthInjectionSaline (n = 5)sEpoR (n = 7)Heat-inactivated sEpoR (n= 7)Area ratio (endometrium/myometrium)2.03 ± 0.131.35 ± 0.241.81 ± 0.45Relative ratio1.000.660.89The values were calculated from the weight of the myometrial and endometrial areas cut out from the micrographs in Fig. 5,b–d.

Immunochemical staining of the uterine section from non-OVX mice in the estrous stage using the antiserum against the extracellular domain of EpoR (Fig. 6, a and b) and anti-factor VIII antiserum (Fig. 6, c and d) showed that the uterine microvascular endothelial cells express EpoR as well as factor VIII. We found that the uterus is a novel site for Epo production. E2 has been reported to influence Epo production (41Peschle C. Rappaport I.A. Sasso G.F. Condorelli M. Gordon A.S. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 42Anagnostou A. Zander A. Barone J. Fried W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1976; 88: 700-706PubMed Google Scholar), but the production site responding to E2 was not known. The major regulator in the uterus appears to be different from that in other Epo production sites. Oxygen is a primary signal for regulation of Epo biosynthesis in the kidney and liver; hypoxia induces transcriptional activation of the Epo gene (reviewed in Ref. 43Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). This induction requires de novo protein synthesis (43Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E2-induced increase of Epo mRNA in the uterus is very rapid and does not require de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, Epo production in uterus is not induced by hypoxia. E2 does not induce Epo production in the kidney and brain. 3M. Chikuma, S. Masuda, T. Kobayashi, M. Nagao, and R. Sasaki, manuscript in preparation. This unique regulation of uterine Epo production may ensure the appropriate local function of Epo in the uterus with small, if any, distortion on erythropoiesis and the central nervous system. A data base search of the DNA sequences of Epo genes (44Galson D.L. Tan C.C. Ratcliffe P.J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 82: 3321-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the 5′-flanking regions of human and mouse genes contain sequences highly homologous to the sequence responsible for E2 receptor binding. A functional analysis of these sequences with respect to E2response is in progress. Identification of the cells responsible for production of uterine Epo has not been completed. Collagenase digestion of the uterus from OVX mouse and the subsequent fractionation of the dispersed cells suggest that the uterine Epo is produced in an E2-dependent manner by the fraction rich in endometrial stromal cells. 4S. Masuda, M. Chikuma, K. Inoue, T. Kobayashi, M. Nagao, and R. Sasaki, unpublished observations. Injection of Epo into the uterine cavity of OVX mouse caused endometrial alterations, which differed somewhat from those induced by E2. The cell density in the endometrium of the mouse given E2 is apparently lower than that of the mouse given Epo. Presumably the low cell density results from an increased vascular permeability due to stimulation of VEGF production by E2(9Hechter O. Krohn L. Harris J. Endocrinology. 1941; 23: 25-31Google Scholar). A high density of vessels with a larger diameter, which is seen in mice given an E2 injection, may reflect more extensive proliferation and maturation of the endothelial cells. Taken together with the inhibitory effect of sEpoR on the endometrial transition from the diestrus to proestrus stage, these results indicate that Epo is one of the E2-regulated signal molecules that is required for execution of the cyclic angiogenesis in estrus cycle; Epo is essential, although it is not sufficient, for completion of this process. The interplay of Epo with other angiogenic factors, particularly with VEGF, must be studied for better understanding of uterine angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial cells in the adult still express a large number of hematopoietic cell differentiation markers (8Bikfalvi A. Han Z.C. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 523-529PubMed Google Scholar, 45Risau W. Sariola H. Zerwes H.G. Sasse J. Ekblom P. Kemler R. Doetschman T. Development. 1988; 102: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar), which has been thought to indicate a common developmental lineage between hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells (46Augustin H.G. Kozian D.H. Johnson R.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, endothelial cells from some sources express EpoR (28Anagnostou A. Liu Z. Steiner M. Chin K. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Noguchi C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3974-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 29Yamaji R. Okada T. Moriya M. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and Epo exhibits the in vitro angiogenic activity on these cells (30Anagnostou A. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5978-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 31Carlini R.G. Reyes A.A. Rothstein M. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 740-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings and the immunochemical detection of EpoR in uterine endothelial cells suggest that Epo directly acts on these cells. It is hard to speculate that systemically distributable blood Epo is involved in physiological angiogenesis including that in the uterus. This possibility may be excluded by our finding that the uterine tissue produces Epo transiently in an E2-dependent manner, and the low ligand affinity to EpoR expressed in endothelial cells (29Yamaji R. Okada T. Moriya M. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 30Anagnostou A. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5978-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) may at least in part support the hypothesis that blood Epo is not involved in physiological angiogenesis. The ligand affinity to EpoR in endothelial cells is much lower than that in erythroid precursor cells; the K d value of EpoR in endothelial cells is ∼1 nm (29Yamaji R. Okada T. Moriya M. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 30Anagnostou A. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5978-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), whereas theK d value of the high affinity site in erythroid cells is ∼50 pm (38Nagao M. Matsumoto S. Masuda S. Sasaki R. Blood. 1993; 81: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the expression of only the low affinity site in endothelial cells is unclear. Since the normal concentration of serum Epo is ∼15 milliunits/ml (∼5 pm) (34Goto M. Murakami A. Akai K. Kawanishi G. Ueda M. Chiba H. Sasaki R. Blood. 1989; 74: 1415-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EpoR in endothelial cells appears to be nonfunctional physiologically and only to be a remnant reflecting a memory of a common origin of hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells (8Bikfalvi A. Han Z.C. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 523-529PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Epo-producing cells in uterus remain to be identified, probably a paracrine Epo/EpoR system would exist in the uterus so that the E2-induced increase in the uterine Epo concentration may be locally high enough to act on endothelial cells through the low affinity site. Presumably expression of only the low affinity site is crucial for preventing unregulated angiogenesis by the action of kidney-derived Epo in the circulation. A similar Epo/EpoR system may also operate in the ovary where active angiogenesis takes place for follicle maturation and growth of corpus luteum (47Augustin H.G. Braun K. Telemenakis I. Modlich U. Kuhn W. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 339-351PubMed Google Scholar), because the ovary produces Epo.4 Homozygous mice carrying a null mutation in Epo or EpoR gene died around embryonic day 13 due to deficiency of the fetal liver erythropoiesis (15Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 16Lin C.S. Lim S.K. D'Agati V. Costantini F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). No defect was found in endothelial cells in the EpoR null mouse embryos (15Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Thus, Epo is unimportant in vasculogenesis, which occurs in the embryonic stage accompanying differentiation of precursors into endothelial cells, and its importance in blood vessel formation seems to be restricted in the female reproductive organ in adults."
https://openalex.org/W1982341626,"Human cystathionine β-synthase catalyzes the first step in the catabolic removal of the toxic metabolite, homocysteine. It is unique in being dependent on both pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and heme for activity. The reaction involves condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine. Although the role of PLP can be rationalized in analogy with other PLP-dependent enzymes that catalyze β-replacement reactions, the role of the heme is unknown. In this study, we have purified and characterized the recombinant human enzyme and have examined the effect of heme oxidation state on enzyme activity. We find that under reducing conditions, generated by addition of titanium citrate, the enzyme exhibits a 1.7-fold lower activity than under oxidizing conditions. Reoxidation of the ferrous enzyme with ferricyanide results in alleviation of inhibition. This redox-linked change in enzyme activity correlates with changes in heme oxidation state monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. Dithiothreitol, which does not reduce the enzyme-bound heme, does not perturb enzyme activity. These studies provide the first evidence for redox-linked regulation of cystathionine β-synthase which is heme-dependent. Human cystathionine β-synthase catalyzes the first step in the catabolic removal of the toxic metabolite, homocysteine. It is unique in being dependent on both pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and heme for activity. The reaction involves condensation of serine and homocysteine to give cystathionine. Although the role of PLP can be rationalized in analogy with other PLP-dependent enzymes that catalyze β-replacement reactions, the role of the heme is unknown. In this study, we have purified and characterized the recombinant human enzyme and have examined the effect of heme oxidation state on enzyme activity. We find that under reducing conditions, generated by addition of titanium citrate, the enzyme exhibits a 1.7-fold lower activity than under oxidizing conditions. Reoxidation of the ferrous enzyme with ferricyanide results in alleviation of inhibition. This redox-linked change in enzyme activity correlates with changes in heme oxidation state monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. Dithiothreitol, which does not reduce the enzyme-bound heme, does not perturb enzyme activity. These studies provide the first evidence for redox-linked regulation of cystathionine β-synthase which is heme-dependent. cystathionine β-synthase pyridoxal phosphate N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone S-adenosylmethionine 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. Cystathionine β-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22, CBS)1 is one of two key mammalian enzymes that metabolizes cellular homocysteine. The latter is a toxic metabolite, formed by the breakdown of S-adenosylhomocysteine, and its elevated levels are correlated with an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (1McCully K.S. Artherosclerosis Rev. 1983; 11: 157-246Google Scholar, 2Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 3Malinow M.R. Nieto F.J.

In most tissues, homocysteine is diverted via two major pathways into innocuous products (Fig. 1). Thus, transmethylation, catalyzed by methionine synthase, converts it to methionine, while trans-sulfuration, catalyzed by CBS, yields cystathionine (Reaction FR1). Catastrophic mutations in CBS result in severe hyperhomocysteinemia and is an inborn error of metabolism that displays an autosomal recessive inheritance (2Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Early and aggressive occlusive arterial diseases are a dominant clinical phenotype in these patients. Cystathionine β-synthase is a tetramer of identical subunits and is allosterically regulated by AdoMet (5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.J. Pick A.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The early literature on this enzyme is fraught with conflicting claims of the size and subunit composition of the native enzyme that stems from the proteolytic sensitivity of its subunits. Cleavage of the 63-kDa subunit at a hypersensitive site results in a 48-kDa product that exists as a homodimer (6Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 583-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 588-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent cloning of the cDNA encoding human CBS (8Kraus J.P. Le K. Swaroop M. Ohura T. Tahara T. Rosenberg L.E. Roper M.D. Kozich V. Hum. Mol.

Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Figure FR1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CBS is unique in being dependent on two cofactors, heme and PLP, for activity (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the reaction catalyzed by CBS involves β-replacement in which the hydroxyl group of the substrate, serine, is exchanged for the thiolate of homocysteine (Reaction FR1). Enzymatic reactions involving either β-replacement or β-elimination reactions (viz. tryptophan synthase and tryptophanase) are characteristically PLP-dependent and generally believed to share a common mechanism. For CBS, it is predicted that an external aldimine is formed between the serine and PLP (12Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The elimination and replacement reactions confer overall retention of configuration at the β-carbon of cystathionine (12Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This mechanism does not include an obvious role for the heme, and its function is presently unknown. The heme in CBS is iron protoporphyrin IX, as judged by the pyridine hemochrome assay (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kim I.C. Deal W.C.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 2: 4925-4930Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but appears to be in an unusual environment in the protein. The spectrum of the ferric and dithionite-reduced ferrous hemes have Soret absorption maxima at 428 and 450 nm, respectively (13Kim I.C. Deal W.C.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 2: 4925-4930Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Omura T. Sadano H. Hasegawa T. Yoshida Y. Kominami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unlike the cytochrome P450s, which derive their name from the 450 nm absorption maximum of the CO-ferrous heme complex, the 450 nm absorption in CBS is observed in the absence of CO. Treatment of ferrous CBS with CO results in the Soret band shifting to 420 nm (14Omura T. Sadano H. Hasegawa T. Yoshida Y. Kominami S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of the heme in CBS is unknown, it may be required for PLP binding, since the extent of PLP saturation is apparently determined by the heme content of the enzyme (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nature, heme cofactors function in electron transfer, as reversible oxygen carriers, in catalyzing oxygenation chemistry or serve regulatory roles as in the soluble guanylate cyclase. Based on the condensation chemistry catalyzed by CBS, electron transfer, oxygenation, and oxygen binding roles for the heme in CBS would appear to be unlikely. In this study, we have examined the effect of heme reduction on CBS activity. We demonstrate that the redox state of the heme modulates enzyme activity. Thus, reduction of heme by titanium citrate lowers activity by a factor of ∼2, and its reoxidation by ferricyanide restores the original activity. Based on these results, we postulate that the heme in CBS is redox-active and reversibly regulates the activity of the enzyme. The following materials were obtained from Sigma: bovine serum albumin, 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzene), l-homocysteine thiolactone, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, benzamidine, TLCK, dithiothreitol, PLP, dithionite, thrombin, potassium ferricyanide, DEAE-Sepharose, δ-aminolevulinic acid, and glutathione. [14C]Serine (158 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Life Sciences Inc. Glutathione S-transferase-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose (fast flow) were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech. Homocysteine was prepared from homocysteine thiolactone as described previously (15Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). AdoMet 1,4-butane disulfonate was a generous gift from Knoll Farmaceutici Spa (Milano, Italy). Human CBS was purified from a recombinant expression system (pGEX4T1/hCBS) described previously (16Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) which produces a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase at the N terminus. Limited proteolysis by thrombin separates glutathioneS-transferase from CBS and generates an N-terminal extension containing the residues Gly-Ser-Pro-Glu-Phe-Pro-Gly-Arg-Pro-Ala-Gly preceding the initiator methionine. E. coli containing pGEX4T1/hCBS was grown in Luria broth medium containing ampicillin (75 μg/ml) at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.4. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm) in the presence of 75 mg/liter δ-aminolevulinic acid, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 21 h.E. coli cells (∼30 g wet weight obtained from 6 liters of culture) were suspended in ∼200 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1.3 mmbenzamidine HCl, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mm TLCK, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 ml/liter aprotinin, and 1 mg/liter pepstatin. The cells were disrupted with a Heat Systems Ultrasonic Processor XL, operated at an output setting of 7 for 6 × for 1 min with 3-min breaks between the cycles to prevent overheating. Lysozyme (40 mg), 20 mg of PLP, and 0.02% (w/v) CHAPS were added to the suspension to help CBS, which tends to aggregate, remain in solution. The suspension was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at ∼2,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5 × 15-cm Q-Sepharose (fast flow) column and washed with 1 liter of buffer A. The column was eluted at 4–5 ml/min with a 2-liter linear gradient ranging from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 14 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PLP. Fractions containing CBS, determined by enzyme activity assays, were pooled and concentrated. CBS eluted between 0.1 and 0.2 mNaCl. CBS from the previous column was loaded on a 5 × 4-cm GSH-Sepharose column (35-ml bed volume). The column was washed with 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. CBS was eluted with 200 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mmglutathione at a flow rate of ∼3 ml/min. The concentrated protein solution (∼50 ml of 1–2 mg/ml protein) from the previous step was treated with thrombin (2.5 unit of thrombin/mg protein) at 25 °C for 14–16 h in the presence of 0.2 mm TLCK and 2 mmdithiothreitol. The thrombin-treated protein solution was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 16 cm) equilibrated with 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient ranging from 15 to 300 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mm TLCK. The flow rate was 2–3 ml/min. CBS eluted at 50–100 mm potassium phosphate. The fractions containing CBS were concentrated to 1–2 mg of protein/ml and stored frozen at −80 °C. Approximately 20–25 mg of CBS were obtained and judged to be 95% pure by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Enzyme activity was measured by a modification of the procedure described previously (17Suda M. Nakagawa H. Kimura H. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 17: 454-458Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The complete assay mixture contained 250 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 0.25 mm PLP, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.38 mm AdoMet, 30 mm[14C]serine (∼50,000 dpm/μmol), 15 mml-homocysteine, and CBS in a total volume of 200 μl. All the components except homocysteine were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by addition of homocysteine and terminated after 30 min with 200 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The amount of enzyme was adjusted so that approximately 10% of the substrate was consumed during the assay. The mixture was centrifuged for ∼5 min at top speed in a microcentrifuge to remove precipitants, and 300 μl of the sample was loaded onto a 1.5 × 12-cm column (Bio-Rad Econo-Pac polypropylene columns) containing 2 ml of AG-50W-X8 resin from Bio-Rad. The column was washed with 2 × 4 ml of water, 6 × 4 ml of 0.6 n HCl followed by 4 × 4 ml of water. The product, cystathionine, was eluted with 5 ml of 3n ammonium hydroxide in two batches. The first 3-ml batch was collected in a scintillation vial containing 0.15 ml of concentrated HCl, the second 2-ml fraction was collected in a separate scintillation vial containing 0.35 ml of concentrated HCl. Biodegradable scintillation fluid (EcoLite from ICN) was added to each vial (15 ml), and the radioactivity was counted. The sum of the radioactivity in the two vials containing sample from the same column was employed to determine enzyme activity. One unit of CBS catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of cystathionine/h at 37 °C. AG-50W-X8 in the columns used for cystathionine purification was regenerated using the following series of washes: 2 × 20 ml of water, 4 ml of 3 n NH4OH, 3 × 20 ml of water (or until the pH is between 8 and 9), 4 ml of 6 nHCl, 3 × 20 ml of water (or until the pH is between 4 and 5). The anaerobic assay was conducted when the effect of reductants was being investigated. The reaction was carried out essentially as described above except that serum-stoppered vials were employed. The reaction mixture was made anaerobic by bubbling N2 for 30 min. Protein solutions (CBS and bovine serum albumin) were made anaerobic in serum-stoppered glass vials placed on ice, by gently blowing N2 on the surface for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method, using reagents from Bio-Rad, and bovine serum albumin as standard. For the steady-state kinetic analysis, the concentration of the stock homocysteine solution was determined immediately before the experiments by titration with the thiol reagent, dithiobis(nitrobenzene), and calculated using an ε412 of 13,600m−1 cm−1. Enzyme preparations were analyzed for their total metal content by plasma emission spectroscopy (18Jones J.B.J. Commun. Soil Sci. Plant Anal. 1977; 8: 349-365Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) at the Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia, Athens. This method detects 20 metal ions including the common transition metal ions. Two independent samples were sent for analysis along with the appropriate buffer blanks. Heme concentration was determined by the pyridine hemochrome assay as described previously (19Berry E.D. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). PLP was measured fluorimetrically using a modification of a published procedure (20Srivastava S.K. Beutler E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 304: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PLP was released from the enzyme by treating 0.5 mg of CBS in 1.5 ml of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with 5 mmhydroxylamine at 4 °C for ∼16 h followed by centrifugation in a Centricon concentrator (P30, Amicon). The absorption spectrum of the filtrate (containing PLP) and the retentate (containing CBS and heme) were recorded. The filtrate contained no heme and was employed for the fluorimetric analysis. Fluorescence emission of the PLP oxime was detected at 446 nm following excitation at 353 nm. A standard curve was generated using eight PLP samples of known concentrations, which had been determined spectrophotometrically using ε295 = 5.1 mm−1 cm−1 in 0.1 nHCl. A Beckman amino acid analyzer, model 6300, was employed to determine the total amino acid composition of CBS. The sample was prepared by dialyzing CBS overnight against distilled water. Amino acid analysis was performed at the protein sequencing facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. We have used a 3-step protocol to purify recombinant human CBS to ∼95% purity and in 40% overall yield (Table I). The subunit molecular mass of the protein is 63 kDa as reported previously (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We did not observe formation of the proteolytically truncated 48-kDa product. The specific activity of the enzyme obtained from this procedure is ∼280 μmol/h/mg protein at 37 °C and is comparable to the specific activity of 200 to 300 μmol/h/mg protein reported previously (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purified CBS eluted as a single peak from a size exclusion column with a retention time consistent with it being a tetramer 2CBS was separated on a calibrated Superose 12 FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech) using 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, containing 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm AdoMet.

Cox D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6614-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Kozich V. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This has been circumvented recently by the generation of fusion proteins with subsequent release of CBS from its fusion partner by limited proteolysis. In both systems, the resulting recombinant CBS has modifications at the N terminus (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Shan X. Kruger W.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), an outcome that is now fairly common in proteins expressed using this strategy. In order to ascertain whether or not the N-terminal modification impacts the kinetic properties of the enzyme, the K m values for the two substrates (Table II) were determined in the presence and absence of the allosteric effector, AdoMet (5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.J. Pick A.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). TheK m for homocysteine is 4.8 ± 0.5 mm (−AdoMet) and 5.0 ± 0.9 mm (+AdoMet). The K m for serine in the presence and absence of AdoMet were both 2.0 ± 0.3 mm. TheK m for homocysteine has been reported to range from ∼1 (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to 25 mm (7Skovby F. Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 588-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K m for serine is reported to range from 0.7 (22Kimura H. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1971; 69: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to 8 mm (23Kashiwamata S. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our values are most similar to those reported by Borcsok and Abeles (12Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab The references from which these values are taken are reported in the text. The K m for homocysteine was reported to decrease 8-fold in the presence of AdoMet (24Roper M.D. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although a later study reported the lower K m in the absence of AdoMet (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We observe no effect of AdoMet on the K m for homocysteine; however, the V max is altered as reported previously (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The V max in the absence of AdoMet is 159 ± 7 μmol of cystathionine formed per h/mg of protein and increases 2-fold in the presence of AdoMet to 295 ± 23 μmol of cystathionine formed per h/mg of protein. The turnover numbers of the enzyme at 37 °C in the presence and absence of AdoMet are 21 ± 2 s−1 and 11 ± 1 s−1, respectively. Native CBS has been reported to be maximally active between pH 8.3 and 8.6 (22Kimura H. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1971; 69: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Kashiwamata S. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have determined the pH rate profile of the recombinant enzyme. It displays a bell-shaped dependence with a pH optimum of ∼8.5 and reveals two titratable pK a values at 7.9 ± 0.2 and 8.8 ± 0.2 (Fig. 2). The pH profile is identical in the anaerobic assay in the presence of titanium citrate, conditions under which the heme is reduced to the ferrous state (see below). Thus, the pH dependence and kinetic parameters of recombinant human CBS are indistinguishable from those of the wild type enzyme. CBS, like other homocysteine-utilizing enzymes such as the B12-dependent and B12-independent methionine synthases, needs to activate the nucleophile, homocysteine. This is expected to involve deprotonation of homocysteine (pK a = 10 (25Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5877-5881Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar)) to generate the thiolate anion. The other two enzymes appear to use a common strategy in which homocysteine is activated via coordination to an active site zinc (26Gonzalez J. Peariso K. Penner-Hahn J.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12228-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Goulding C.W. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15749-15757Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test whether or not CBS also contains zinc, plasma emission spectroscopy was employed. Metal analysis revealed the presence of two irons per α4 tetramer. No other metal ions were found. Hence, human CBS, unlike the B12-dependent and -independent methionine synthases, does not utilize zinc to activate homocysteine. The iron stoichiometry obtained from plasma emission spectroscopy is surprising since CBS is a homotetramer. It raises the possibility that the heme is bound at the subunit interface of dimers or that the enzyme exhibits half of site activity. It contradicts a stoichiometry of 1 heme/monomer reported recently for the recombinant human enzyme (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to resolve this discrepancy, we repeated the pyridine hemochrome analysis on CBS and redetermined the extinction coefficients of the ferrous and ferric states. The heme spectrum of CBS analyzed by the pyridine hemochrome method is typical of iron protoporphyrin IX, with α and β absorption maxima at 557 and 525 nm, respectively. Based on the reported extinction coefficients (19Berry E.D. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and the amount of protein used in the assay, we estimate that recombinant CBS has 2.2 ± 0.3 hemes/tetramer, the average obtained from six independent determinations. The extinction coefficient for CBS-bound heme was estimated on protein samples taken from the same enzyme preparations that had been subjected to plasma emission spectroscopy and on which we had an independent estimation of the iron content. Based on our analysis, the extinction coefficient for ferric CBS at 428 nm is 166 ± 7 mm−1 cm−1 at pH 8.6. This value is 2-fold higher than that reported recently by Kraus and co-workers (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for recombinant human CBS. It is possible that during expression of the recombinant human enzyme, heme is limiting, and the CBS that we purify is only half-saturated with heme, accounting for the discrepancies between Kraus's (11Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) preparation and ours. At least two lines of evidence rule out this possibility. First, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of our enzyme is comparable to that of both wild type and recombinant CBS purified by Kraus and co-workers (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ratio of the absorbances at 280 and 428 nm is 0.76 for the liver (28Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 0.89 for the recombinant (29Kery V. Elleder D. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) human enzymes, respectively. Protein purified in our laboratory exhibits a ratio of 0.96, comparable to 1.03 reported for the native pig enzyme by Kim and Deal (13Kim I.C. Deal W.C.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 2: 4925-4930Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These authors had also concluded that 2.1 mol of heme are bound per mol of tetramer. 3These authors had estimated a native molecular mass of 218 kDa (similar to the 252 kDa that is expected from an α4 tetramer of 63-kDa subunits). However, they had erroneously attributed the oligomeric structure to α2β2, based on their observation of two different subunit sizes of 61 and 45 kDa, respectively. From what is now known about the proteolytic sensitivity of the liver enzyme, it is likely that they had a mixture of truncated dimers and native tetramers, with the latter predominating to yield a molecular weight estimate close to that expected for the α4 species. Hence, the heme to protein ratio of all these preparations is similar. The extinction coefficient estimated by Kraus and co-workers (10Bukovska G. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (ε428 nm = 81.5 mm−1cm−1 at pH 8.6) appears to have been based on an assumed stoichiometry of 4 hemes/tetramer. Instead, a value of 2 hemes/tetramer, consistent with the metal and pyridine hemochrome analyses, would yield the same extinction coefficient as determined by us (i.e. 166 mm−1 cm−1at pH 8.6). Second, specific activities of our preparations are comparable to those reported for the native (160–340 units/mg 4These purifications yielded the truncated dimer that is reported to have a V max that is similar to that of the tetramer (Fig. 5 in Ref. 7Skovby F.

https://openalex.org/W1996002116,"Acanthamoeba actophorin is a member of ADF/cofilin family that binds both actin monomers and filaments. We used fluorescence anisotropy to study the interaction of actin monomers with recombinant actophorin labeled with rhodamine on a cysteine substituted for Serine-88. Labeled actophorin retains its affinity for actin and ability to reduce the low shear viscosity of actin filaments. At physiological ionic strength, actophorin binds Mg-ADP-actin monomers (K d = 0.1 μm) 40 times stronger than Mg-ATP-actin monomers. When bound to actin monomers, actophorin has no effect on elongation at either end of actin filaments by Mg-ATP-actin and slightly increases the rate of elongation at both ends by Mg-ADP-actin. Thus actophorin does not sequester actin monomers. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation shows that actophorin and profilin compete for binding actin monomers. Actophorin and profilin have opposite effects on the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to actin monomers. Despite the high affinity of actophorin for ADP-actin, physiological concentrations of profilin overcome the inhibition of ADP exchange by actophorin. Profilin rapidly recycles ADP-actin back to the profilin-ATP-actin pool ready for elongation of actin filaments.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) suggesting that it may be part of a regulated signal transduction mechanism controlling the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. The original protein of this type, ADF,1 got its name “actin depolymerizing factor” by virtue of its ability to depolymerize actin filaments. Similar evidence led to the name depactin. However, cofilin copolymerizes with actin at pH <7.3, depolymerizing filaments only at higher pH (18Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has not led to a consistent view of the mechanism of action of ADF/cofilin proteins. A variety of evidence suggested that ADF/cofilin proteins sever actin filaments and hasten depolymerization by creating more ends to dissociated subunits (2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Hayden S.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) questioned the severing activity of the ADF/cofilin family and proposed a “dynamizing” mechanism for plant cofilin. Their interpretation was that plant cofilin promotes actin filament turnover by increasing the rates of ATP-actin association at the barbed end and ADP-actin dissociation at the pointed end. Either by severing or enhancing dissociation of subunits from the pointed end, ADF/cofilin proteins should release Mg-ADP-actin monomers, which bind actophorin and cofilin with higher affinity than ATP-actin (21Carlier M.F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The effect of ADF/cofilin proteins on ADP exchange is not known, but high affinity binding might trap ADP-actin bound to an ADF/cofilin protein. Using a new fluorescence anisotropy assay, we confirm the higher affinity of actophorin for Mg-ADP-actin than Mg-ATP-actin and characterize in detail the effect of both actophorin and profilin on the exchange of the bound nucleotide. Without profilin, actophorin forms a stable complex with ADP-actin. Profilin competes with actophorin for binding actin monomers. Even with saturating concentrations of actophorin, a low concentration of profilin promotes the rapid exchange of ADP for ATP. Given the higher affinity of Mg-ATP-actin for profilin, these reactions rapidly transfer actin from actophorin to profilin, allowing actophorin to recycle back to actin filaments. We also show that actophorin bound to ADP- or ATP-actin does not inhibit actin filament elongation at either the barbed or pointed end of filaments. Materials came from the following sources: Sigma, dithiothreitol (DTT), EDTA, Tris, sodium azide, Me2SO, hexokinase, ATP, ADP, phalloidin, Sephadex G-25 medium; Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), 1,N 6-ethenoadenosine-5′-diphosphate (ε-ADP), TCEP (Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5′-tetramethylrhodamine maleimide isomer; Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom), DEAE-cellulose DE-52. Residues Asn-33, Glu-70, and Ser-88 of actophorin were changed to cysteine by reverse polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6770) Google Scholar), and the mutations were verified by sequencing. These cysteines were the only reactive sulfhydryls, because neither of the two native cysteines are accessible to solvent (26Leonard S.A. Gittis A.G. Petrella E.C. Pollard T.D. Lattman E.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant actophorins in plasmid vector pMW172 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS and purified according to Quirk et al. (27Quirk S. Maciver S.K. Ampe C. Doberstein S.K. Kaiser D.A. VanDamme J. Vandekerckhove J.S. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8525-8533Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that 2 mm dithiothreitol was included in all buffers for mutant actophorins to avoid cysteine oxidation. Purified actophorins were stored in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3. A 4-ml sample of 50 μm actophorin in storage buffer was dialyzed 3 h into labeling buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm TCEP, 1 mmNaN3) and then reacted with 7-fold molar excess of 5′-tetramethylrhodamine maleimide isomer from a 20 mm stock in Me2SO for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring. Centrifugation removed precipitated dye. Two steps removed free dye: first, gel filtration on a 60 × 1.5-cm column Sephadex G25 equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaN3, at 4 °C; and second, chromatography on a 13 × 1.5-cm column of DEAE-cellulose DE-52 equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3. Labeled protein was eluted with a 0–250 mm gradient of NaCl and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% acrylamide), and protein concentration was determined by a solid phase dye binding method (28Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Profilin-II was purified fromAcanthamoeba castellanii (29Kaiser D.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Levine B.A. Pollard T.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder (30Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from Acanthamoeba (31Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and isolated as Ca-ATP-G-actin through Sephacryl S-300 chromatography (32MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) at 4 °C in G buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT). Actin was labeled on Cys-374 to a stoichiometry of 0.8–1.0 with pyrene iodoacetamide (Ref. 33Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, as modified by Pollard; see Ref. 31Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mg-ATP G-actin was prepared on ice by addition of 0.2 mm EGTA and an 11-fold molar excess of MgCl2over actin and used within hours. Mg-ADP G-actin was prepared by treatment of Mg-ATP G-actin with soluble hexokinase and glucose (31Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, variable concentrations of actin were mixed with a fixed concentration of rhodamine-S88C-actophorin. Fluorescence measurements were made with a PTI Alpha-scan spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technologies International, South Brunswick, NJ). Fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine-S88C-actophorin was measured with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 574 nm. 2Vinson, V. K., De La Cruz, E. M., Higgs, H. N., and Pollard, T. D. (1998) in press. Data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) and fitted to Eq. 1 where r is the observed anisotropy,racf is the anisotropy of free actophorin,racb is the anisotropy of actophorin bound to actin, [C] is the total concentration of actophorin, [A] is the total concentration of actin and K d the dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex.r=racf+(racb−racf)(Kd+[C]+[A])−(Kd+[C]+[A])2−(4[C][A])2(Eq. 1) Seeds were made by polymerizing 20 μmactin for 2 h at 20 °C in F buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) with a 10-fold molar excess of phalloidin and gelsolin concentrations of 0 or 400 nm. Seeds were diluted 10–50 times into F buffer with 15 μmactophorin and 4 μm pyrenyl-labeled Mg-ADP- or Mg-ATP-actin. The time course of polymerization was measured by fluorescence with excitation at 366 nm and emission at 387 nm. The dissociation Mg-ε-ADP from actin muscle monomers was measured by the decrease in fluorescence with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 410 nm. A Hi-tech SFA-II rapid mixer allowed mixing of equal volumes of 600 μm ATP from one syringe with 2.8 μm Mg-ε-ADP-actin, 6 μm actophorin, and various concentrations of Acanthamoeba profilin-II from the other syringe. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out in a Beckman model XL-I in 6-hole, charcoal-filled centerpieces with quartz windows in a Beckman model An60ti rotor. We determined the molecular weight and the ratio of rhodamine to actophorin after centrifugation to equilibrium at 14,000 rpm. The protein concentration was determinate by Raleigh interferometry assuming 3.3 fringes per mg/ml protein and the rhodamine concentration was measured by absorbance at 541 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 91,400 cm−1m−1. We analyzed competitive binding of 10 μm rhodamine-S88C-actophorin and various concentrations of profilin-II to 10 μm Mg-ADP-actin monomers by sedimentation equilibrium. We monitored rhodamine absorption at 550 nm. The data was collected and analyzed according to (35Mullins R.D. Kelleher J.F. Xu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 841-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data were fit using Eq. 2ln(absorbance,550 nm)=(ς(r2/2−r2m/2))(Eq. 2) where the logarithm of the absorbance is a function of the effective reduced molecular weightς=Mω2(1−v̄ρ)RT(Eq. 3) M is molecular mass (g/mol), ω is the angular velocity (rad/sec), v̄ is the partial specific volume (cm3/gm), ρ is the solvent density (gm/cm3),R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (K), and r m and r are the radii of the meniscus and the bottom of the sample cell, respectively. We used KINSIM (36Barshop A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) to simulate the time course of actin nucleotide exchange in presence of actophorin and profilin and the redistribution of actophorin/Mg-ADP-actin monomer complex at steady state. Acanthamoeba actophorin has two cysteines, Cys-9 and Cys-60 (27Quirk S. Maciver S.K. Ampe C. Doberstein S.K. Kaiser D.A. VanDamme J. Vandekerckhove J.S. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8525-8533Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but neither reacts with rhodamine maleimide when the protein is folded in its native conformation. To label actophorin with rhodamine, we replaced Asn-33, Glu-70, or Ser-88 individually with cysteine (Fig. 1). We chose these residues for three reasons: (a) each is outside the actin binding site mapped for other members of the ADF/cofilin family (37Muneyuki E. Nishida E. Sutoh K. Sakai H. J. Biochem. 1985; 97: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Sutoh K. Mabuchi I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Ohba M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17218-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) each is a serine in at least one member of the family 26; and (c) each is exposed to solvent in the crystal structure (26Leonard S.A. Gittis A.G. Petrella E.C. Pollard T.D. Lattman E.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Actophorin labeled with 5′-rhodamine maleimide isomer on any of the new cysteines has the same mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as unlabeled actophorin (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–6). Rhodamine maleimide labels mutants E70C and S88C (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 5) more efficiently than N33C (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). By sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation rhodamine-S88C-actophorin is a single ideal species with a molecular weight of 15,200 (Fig. 2 B). In this experiment, the ratio of rhodamine (measured byA 550) to protein (measured by Rayleigh interferometry) is constant across the ultracentrifuge cell with 0.44 dyes per protein molecule (Fig. 2 B). If conjugation of the dye with the protein affects its extinction coefficient, the stoichiometry will be different, but in any case, the labeled protein is homogeneous. A second experiment gave similar results. The labeled mutant proteins are indistinguishable from wild type actophorin in their ability to reduce the low shear viscosity of actin filaments (data not shown) using the falling ball assay (1Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence polarization anisotropy r of rhodamine-labeled S88C and E70C is 0.14 independent of the concentration, as expected for a 14-kDa monomeric protein (41Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Labeling of N33C never exceeded 0.1 dye per protein, so we did not use this mutant. Because actin binding has no effect on the fluorescence excitation or emission of any of our three rhodamine-labeled actophorin mutants, we could use fluorescence anisotropy to determine the affinity of actophorin for monomeric actin. The anisotropy of rhodamine-S88C-actophorin is 0.14 when free and 0.21 when bound to actin monomers. Under all of the conditions tested, a bimolecular binding isotherm with a stoichiometry of 1:1 fit the dependence of the anisotropy on actin concentration (Fig. 3). The nucleotide bound to actin has a strong effect on the affinity of actophorin for actin monomers (Table I). At physiological ionic strength (2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl) actophorin binds Mg-ADP-actin monomers 40 times stronger than Mg-ATP-actin (Fig. 3), as observed with other assays (22Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and other members of the ADF/cofilin family (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). In contrast, in low salt concentration actophorin binds Mg-ATP-actin monomers better than Mg-ADP-actin. Rhodamine-S88C-actophorin binds Acanthamoebaand rabbit skeletal muscle actin monomers with similar affinities.Table IDissociation equilibrium constants for actophorin binding to actinSalt concentrationBound nucleotide monomerActophorin +Plant cofilin + muscle actinAmoeba actinMuscle actinμmμmLow saltMgATP0.190.08Low saltMgADP0.660.03High saltMgATP4.55.98High saltMgADP0.150.140.1Carlier et al.

Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). After the addition of the complex of actophorin with Mg-ATP- or Mg-ADP-actin monomers to the end of a filament, phalloidin binds, induces rapid dissociation of actophorin and allows the fluorescence increase associated with pyrenyl-actin polymerization. Elongation is primarily at the barbed end of free seeds and exclusively at the pointed end of seeds capped with gelsolin. Excess actophorin has no effect on the rate or extent of elongation at either end by Mg-ATP-actin (Fig. 4 A) in agreement with the observations of Carlier et al. (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) but slightly increases the rate of elongation at both ends by Mg-ADP-actin (Fig. 4 B). These experiments show that actophorin does not sequester actin monomers in the sense that bound actophorin does not inhibit subunit addition at either end of actin filaments. We analyzed competition of profilin and actophorin for binding to actin monomers by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation (Fig. 5). At equilibrium, labeled actophorin distributes with actin. Unlabeled profilin displaces labeled actophorin from actin in a concentration-dependent fashion. This confirms less direct chemical cross-linking experiments (2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that binding of actophorin and profilin to actin monomers is mutually exclusive. Thus, although actophorin does not sequester actin monomers from polymerization, it does inhibit interactions with at least one other ligand, profilin. Saturating concentrations of actophorin inhibit Mg-ADP dissociation from muscle actin by a factor 13 to a rate constant of 0.006 s−1 in buffer with 2 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 6 A, inset). This is similar to the effect of cofilin on ATP dissociation from actin monomers (18Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 42Nishida E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Profilin reverses this effect of actophorin, increasing the rate of nucleotide exchange from actin-actophorin complex in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 6 A). Scheme FS1 is a minimal mechanism, based on mutually exclusive binding of profilin and actophorin to actin monomers, to explain how the two proteins influence nucleotide exchange. A represents nucleotide-free actin, N nucleotide ATP or ADP, Cactophorin, and P profilin. Remarkably, this simple mechanism and the rate and equilibrium constants measured here and in previous work (43De La Cruz E. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5452-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)2 account quantitatively for the time course (Fig. 6 A) and rate (Fig. 6 B) of ADP exchange in the presence of actophorin and a wide range of profilin concentrations. Two constants were unknown: k +3is the rate constant for nucleotide binding the complex of nucleotide-free actin monomer with actophorin, and K 4 is the association equilibrium constant for actophorin binding nucleotide-free actin. Using measured equilibrium constants and detailed balance, we estimated these values to be 1.5 μm−1 s−1 fork +3 and 3.8 μm−1 forK 4. The available data did not constrain these constants further, because variation of the values of these constants ± a factor of 10 does not affect the simulated time course of nucleotide exchange. The present work is the first measurement of the affinity of actophorin for actin. Maciver et al. (44Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Maciver and Weeds (22Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) estimated the affinity of actophorin for actin by a change in critical concentration measured by pyrene fluorescence and light scattering or by gel filtration. However, Carlier et al. (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) showed (and we confirm3) that ADF-family proteins quench the fluorescence of pyrene-actin when they bind actin filaments. Carlier et al. (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) used quenching of NBD-actin fluorescence to study the interaction of ADF1 from Arabidopsis thaliana with muscle actin monomers. In our hands, actophorin binding did not affect the fluorescence of NBD-actin monomers, so we used anisotropy to study the interaction of actophorin and actin monomers. This approach has the advantage that the fluorescent dye is placed outside of the binding site where it does not interfere with binding. Assays dependent on a change in fluorescence are more convenient and sensitive, but changes in fluorescence are likely to result from direct or indirect interactions of the fluorophore with the ligand and thus may influence the reaction being studied. Thus fluorescence anisotropy has some advantages, and the labeled protein can also be used for observations in live cells. The fluorescence anisotropy assay confirms that interaction of actophorin with both cytoplasmic and muscle actin monomers depends on the nucleotide bound to actin. At physiological ionic strength, actophorin binds Mg-ADP-actin tightly (K d = 0.15 μm) but Mg-ATP-actin weakly (K d = 5.9 μm). These values are in the range estimated by Maciver and Weeds (22Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and agree with the affinity of ADF1 for muscle actin monomers (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The bound nucleotide also affects the affinity of monomeric actin for other proteins. Some proteins like thymosin-β4 and profilin bind ATP-actin monomers more tightly (45Carlier M.F. Jean C. Rieger K.J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,46Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar),2 and others like ADF1, actophorin, and gelsolin bind ADP actin monomers more tightly (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 22Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 47Laham L.E. Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14202-14207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the atomic structures of ATP- and ADP-actin bound to DNase I are nearly identical (48Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), it is unclear why the nucleotide should have such a large effect on affinity of actophorin and related proteins for actin monomers. The structure of actophorin-G-actin complex will be required to give the answer. Actophorin has the same affinity for muscle and amoeba actin monomers, unlike profilin, which binds better to amoeba actin.2 This is convenient, because muscle actin is somewhat easier to purify. Unfortunately the situation is different with actin filaments where actophorin binds much better to muscle than amoeba actin.3Clearly, every case requires a direct comparison to establish whether muscle and cytoplasmic actins interact the same with test proteins. Actophorin was originally thought to make a nonpolymeric complex with actin (1Cooper J.A. Blum J.D. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but Carlieret al. (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) called this into question. They showed that multiple effects of ADF/cofilin proteins on actin filaments complicate the design and interpretation of polymerization experiments. Our new assay (Fig. 5) clarifies the effects of actophorin on actin filament elongation. We used phalloidin to inhibit binding of actophorin to actin filaments (2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),3 so that all added actophorin bound actin monomers and none bound actin filament seeds or elongating pyrene actin filaments. This is essential to avoid quenching of the pyrene fluorescence of the polymerized actin by actophorin. Phalloidin binds actin filaments relatively slowly (49De La Cruz E.M. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14054-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but a concentration of 4 μm will bind with a half-time of 1 s, faster than the rate of phosphate release from ADP-Pi-actin subunits in filaments (50Carlier M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Actophorin does not bind ADP-Pi-actin filaments (2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin monomers saturated with actophorin still elongate both ends of actin filament seeds. Actophorin has no effect on the rate of elongation at either filament end by Mg-ATP-actin in 100 mmKCl. Carlier et al. (21Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) reported that plant ADF1 increases the rate of muscle actin filament elongation 20-fold at low ionic strength but not in 400 mm KCl. ADP-actin saturated with actophorin consistently elongates both filament ends slightly faster than ADP-actin alone. The pointed end reaction is not diffusion limited (51Drenckhahn D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12754-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so actophorin may alter the conformation of actin monomers in a way that favors association. Profilin and actophorin compete for binding actin monomers, suggesting that their actin binding sites overlap. This fits well with the proposal of Hatanaka et al. (9Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaki F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that the actophorin relative, destrin, binds between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin, directly overlapping the profilin binding site. However, a reconstruction of actin filaments with bound cofilin (34McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) does not support this model. Instead, cofilin appears to bind along the two start actin filament helix, interacting with two adjacent actin subunits: one at a site between subdomains 1 and 3 and the other at subdomains 2 and 1. More detailed structures of actin bound to ADF/cofilin proteins will be required to understand the competitive interactions of actophorin and profilin. Saturating concentrations of actophorin reduce 13-fold the rate of MgADP exchange for ATP on actin monomers, similar to the effect of brain cofilin (42Nishida E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast cofilin (24Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) on ATP exchange. We assume that the rate of ADP dissociation is rate-limiting, as in other actin nucleotide exchange reactions. Given the 20 μmconcentration of actophorin in Acanthamoeba and its higher affinity for MgADP-actin monomers than filaments,3 a large pool of monomeric ADP-actin might be bound to actophorin if dissociation of ADP were slow. To examine the fate of ADP-actin/actophorin as it is released from depolymerizing filaments, using KINSIM and the measured rate and equilibrium constants, we simulated what happens when 0.4 μm ADP-actin/actophorin is added to a steady-state mixture of cellular concentrations of actin monomers, actin filaments, actophorin, ATP, and ADP (Fig. 7). In the absence of profilin the reaction has two phases. In less than 1 s the actophorin distributes about equally between ADP-actin monomers and ADP-actin filaments. This is followed by slow (t 1/2 = 30 s) exchange of ADP for ATP in the actin monomer pool. Cellular concentrations of profilin accelerate the slow phase (Fig. 7). Profilin promotes the exchange of ADP for ATP on actin monomers, rapidly depleting the pool of high affinity ADP-actin/actophorin complex. This allows actophorin to redistribute rapidly (t 1/2 = 3 s) back to actin filaments and actin monomers to form a high affinity ATP-actin complex with profilin, ready for rapid elongation of actin filament barbed ends. Our new information regarding monomer binding, filament elongation, and nucleotide exchange focuses attention on interactions of actophorin with actin filaments. This is in accord with the effects of mutations in yeast cofilin. Mutations that inhibit binding to actin filaments but not actin monomers are lethal or temperature-sensitive (24Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Drubin D.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5520-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Actophorin binds with high affinity to ADP-actin monomers, the species likely to be released from depolymerizing actin filaments. In a simple system with these two proteins, actophorin would build up a pool of ADP-actin monomers. However, in the presence of profilin, ADP-actin/actophorin released from filaments is only a transitory state. Released actophorin quickly recycles back to actin filaments and the ADP-monomers enter the ATP-actin/profilin pool. Under physiological conditions, actophorin does not appear from its biochemical properties to have the capacity to sequester a large pool of actin monomers in the cell either by blocking elongation or inhibiting nucleotide exchange. More likely its role is to stimulate filament turnover, either by severing filaments or increasing the rate of subunit dissociation or both. ATP hydrolysis within the filament and dissociation of the γ phosphate are essential as a timer for actophorin binding (2Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), singling out older actin filaments for depolymerization.

A subclass of Smad proteins has recently been identified that antagonize, rather than transduce, TGF-β family signals. Smad7, for example, binds to and inhibits signaling downstream of TGF-β receptors. Here we report that the C-terminal MAD homology domain of murine Smad7 (mSmad7) is sufficient for both of these activities. In addition, we show that mSmad7 interacts with activated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors (BMPR-Is), inhibits BMPR-I-mediated Smad phosphorylation, and phenocopies the effect of known BMP antagonists when overexpressed in ventral cells of Xenopus embryos. Xenopus Smad7 (XSmad7, previously termed Smad8) and mSmad7 are nearly identical within their bioactive C-domain, but have quite distinct N-domains. We found that XSmad7, similar to mSmad7, interacted with BMP and TGF-β type I receptors and inhibited receptor-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signal-transducing Smads. However, XSmad7 is a less efficient inhibitor of TβR-I-mediated responses in mammalian cells than is mSmad7. Furthermore, overexpression of XSmad7 in Xenopus embryos produces patterning defects that are not observed following overexpression of mSmad7, suggesting that mSmad7 and XSmad7 may preferentially target distinct signaling pathways. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the C-domain of antagonistic Smads is an effector domain whereas the N-domain may confer specificity for distinct signaling pathways.

Inhibitory Smads, like signal-transducing Smads, contain conserved N- and C-domains, but the function of each domain is unknown. In the current studies, we have investigated the physical interaction of mSmad7 with BMP receptors and the functional consequences thereof. mSmad7 interacts with activated BMP type I receptors and can inhibit BMP signal transduction in mammalian cells and in Xenopusembryos. Thus Smad7 may act as a general TGF-β family inhibitor. We show that the C-domain of mSmad7 is sufficient for receptor interaction, and for inhibition of downstream signaling. The biochemical and functional properties of XSmad7 overlap extensively with those of mSmad7, but distinct functional differences between the two related Smads are observed. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the C-domain of antagonistic Smads is the effector domain whereas the N-domain may confer specificity for distinct signaling pathways. COS cells and Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Expression constructs for TβR-I, TβR-II, BMPR-II, BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, ActR-I, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad5 have been described (10Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E.

Expression constructs for Flag-tagged mSmad7 C-domain (7C; amino acids 204–426), Flag-tagged mSmad7 C-domain with C-tail deletion (7CΔ; amino acids 204–407), and Flag-tagged XSmad7 (F-XSmad7) were made by using polymerase chain reaction technique and subcloning in pcDNA3-Flag. Transient transfections using the DEAE-dextran protocol, metabolic labeling of cells, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (10Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J.-i. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Anti-Flag antibodies were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. (New Haven, CT). TGF-β1 and BMP-7 were iodinated using the chloramine-T method according to Frolik et al. (30Frolik C.A. Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10995-11000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed as described previously (10Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J.-i. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Complexes of Smads and affinity-labeled receptors were immunoprecipitated with antiserum directed against Flag-tag in Smads. To determine expression levels of receptors, aliquots of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera against type I receptors. Expression of Smads was determined by Western blotting on aliquots of cell lysates. Mv1Lu cells were transfected with p3TPLux, as described (10Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M.

Luciferase activity was measured as described (10Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J.-i. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Xenopuseggs were obtained, and embryos were microinjected and cultured as described (31Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique. 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar). RNA was synthesized by in vitrotranscription (31Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique. 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar) of pCS2+XSmad7 and pCS2+mSmad7 (27Nakayama T. Snyder M.A. Grewal S.S. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Christian J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 857-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter construct was generated by subcloning the coding region of F-mSmad7 into pCS2+ (32Turner D. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Embryonic stages are according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (33Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. Garland Publishing, Amsterdam, North Holland1967Google Scholar). Immunostaining of whole embryos (12/101 antibody was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank under contract N01-HD-2–3144 from the NICHD, National Institutes of Health; Tor70 was obtained from R. Harland, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA) was performed as described by Moon and Christian (31Moon R.T. Christian J.L. Technique. 1989; 1: 76-89Google Scholar). We investigated whether mSmad7 can associate with BMP receptors, in addition to binding to TGF-β receptors as previously shown (24Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 25Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A.

COS cells transfected with cDNAs encoding F-mSmad7 in combinations with BMPR-II (wild-type or kinase-deficient mutant) and BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, or ActR-I (wild-type or kinase-deficient) were affinity labeled with125I-BMP-7, and F-Smad7 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with Flag antiserum. We found that Smad7 interacted with BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB (Fig. 1 A), and ActR-I (data not shown). No interaction was observed between mSmad7 and a heteromeric complex of kinase-deficient type II receptor in combination with wild-type or kinase-deficient type I receptor. Thus, interaction of mSmad7 with the BMP type I receptor requires that this receptor be phosphorylated by the BMP type II receptor. Phosphorylation may induce a conformational change that is required for mSmad7 type I receptor interaction. In light of our finding that mSmad7 can associate with an active BMP receptor complex, we examined the effect of mSmad7 on BMPR-IB- and ActR-I-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 or Smad5 (Fig. 1,B-E). COS cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding BMP receptors and Smad1 or Smad5 in the absence or presence of mSmad7. The phosphorylation level of Smad1 or Smad5 was examined by [32P]orthophosphate labeling and immunoprecipitation from cell lysates using Smad antisera. mSmad7 potently inhibited BMPR-IB-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad5 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B-E). In addition, mSmad7 inhibited ActR-I-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Deletion mutant forms of mSmad7 were tested for their ability to interact with the TGF-β receptor complex, and to inhibit TGF-β signaling. We found that the isolated C-domain of mSmad7 interacted with the TGF-β receptor complex as efficiently as did wild-type mSmad7 (Fig. 2 A), and was able to inhibit TβR-I-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 2 B). In some of the experiments, the inhibitory activity with mSmad7C was less than wild-type mSmad7. In contrast, as previously shown by Hayashi et al. (24Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), a small deletion of C-terminal residues of mSmad7 was found to abrogate receptor binding (data not shown). Deletion mutant forms of mSmad7 were also tested for their ability to inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter, as assayed using the p3TPLux reporter construct. Consistent with the ability of the C-domain of mSmad7 to inhibit TβR-I-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2, this domain was sufficient to inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation, although it was less efficient at doing so than was wild-type mSmad7 (Fig. 2C). Deletion of the last 19 amino acid residues completely abrogated the ability of the mSmad7 C-domain to inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the 3TP promoter (data not shown). XSmad7 shares 96% amino acid identity with mSmad7 within the C-domain (27Nakayama T. Snyder M.A. Grewal S.S. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Christian J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 857-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that this domain is sufficient for receptor binding, and for inhibition of several TGF-β-induced responses, one would predict that these proteins would behave identically with regard to receptor binding and inhibition of downstream signaling. Consistent with this possibility, XSmad7 interacted with the activated TβR-I, BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, and ActR-I (data not shown). In addition, XSmad7 inhibited BMPRI-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad5 in a dose-dependent fashion that was indistinguishable from that of mSmad7 (data not shown). However, whereas mSmad7 efficiently inhibited TβR-I-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2, XSmad7 was less effective at doing so (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, this correlated with the more pronounced effect of mSmad7 versusXSmad7 in inhibiting TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the p3TPLux reporter gene (Fig. 3 B). Of note, mSmad7 is more effective than is XSmad7 at inhibiting activin signaling in aXenopus mesoderm induction assay (27Nakayama T. Snyder M.A. Grewal S.S. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Christian J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 857-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether mSmad7 can inhibit transduction of BMP signals in vivo, we analyzed patterning defects caused by overexpression of mSmad7 in Xenopusembryos. Overexpression of known BMP antagonists, such as dominant negative BMP receptors or ligands, on the ventral side of Xenopus embryos can induce the formation of a partial secondary axis (reviewed in Ref. 34Graff J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 171-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Injection of 200 or 400 pg of RNA encoding mSmad7 near the ventral midline of four-cell embryos led to formation of a secondary dorsal axis in 90 (n = 100) or 96% (n = 79) of embryos, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Secondary axis formation was observed in 94% (n = 98) of embryos injected with 200 pg of RNA encoding the isolated C-domain of mSmad7. Axes induced by either mSmad7 or the C-domain of mSmad7 contained immunoreactive muscle (Fig. 4 D) but lacked notochord (data not shown). In the same series of experiments, injection of 200 or 400 pg of RNA encoding XSmad7 near the ventral midline induced the formation of a secondary axis in 87 (n = 92) or 91% (n = 102) of injected embryos, respectively. One notable difference between the axes induced by the two gene products is that the secondary axes induced by XSmad7 included a cyclopic or fused eye in 10 (200 pg) or 41% (400 pg) of cases, whereas eye formation was rarely observed (3% of embryos) following misexpression of mSmad7, and then only when a high dose (400 pg) of RNA was injected. Ectopic expression of XSmad7 within dorsal cells of Xenopus embryos produces a range of phenotypic defects that cannot be attributed to blockade of BMP signaling. These include failure of the neural folds to fuse (spina bifida) as well as a range of eye defects (27Nakayama T. Snyder M.A. Grewal S.S. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Christian J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 857-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly compare patterning defects caused by misexpression of mSmad7 and XSmad7 within dorsal cells, 200 pg of RNA encoding either protein was injected near the dorsal midline of four-cell embryos. Whereas 20% of XSmad7-injected embryos developed spina bifida, and 40% showed a decrease in eye pigmentation (n = 50), 97% of mSmad7-injected embryos developed completely normally (n = 89, data not shown). When a higher dose (400 pg) of RNA encoding either XSmad7 or mSmad7 was injected, 40% of XSmad7-injected embryos developed with spina bifida (Fig. 4 E, n = 124), whereas only 7% of embryos injected with mSmad7 RNA (n = 140) and 3% of embryos injected with a control RNA (encoding a myc epitope tag,n = 70) displayed this defect. In contrast, 43% of mSmad7-injected embryos developed with variable eye defects ranging from a slight to moderate decrease in eye pigment (data not shown) to fusion of the eyes (Fig. 4 F). Forty-seven percent of XSmad7-injected siblings developed with comparable eye defects (data not shown, 27). The percentage of XSmad7-injected embryos displaying spina bifida, eye induction, or eye defects was somewhat lower in these experiments than that previously reported (27Nakayama T. Snyder M.A. Grewal S.S. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Christian J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 857-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly because of inherent differences between embryos used for the two sets of experiments. Together, these results suggest that mSmad7 and XSmad7 can interact with common signaling pathways in vivo although XSmad7 may target additional, as yet unidentified, pathways in Xenopus. Members of the TGF-β family play critical regulatory roles throughout vertebrate embryogenesis. They have been implicated as key players in mesoderm induction, in specification of ventralversus dorsal fates during early cleavage through gastrula stages, and in patterning of virtually all organs and tissues at later stages of development (reviewed in Refs. 35Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar and 36Vize P.D. Thomsen G.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The multifunctional nature of this family of ligands clearly implicates the need for tight control of their biological activity. Smads play a key role in controlling TGF-β signaling at the intracellular level. Pathway-restricted and common-mediator Smads, which become activated and form heteromeric complexes upon receptor activation, function to transduce TGF-β family signals. Pathway-restricted Smads may also negatively modulate these signal transduction cascades in some contexts. Specifically, Smad2 and Smad1 have been shown to compete with each other for sequestration of a limited pool of the common mediator, Smad4, thereby acting as intracellular antagonists of the BMP and activin signaling pathways, respectively (37Candia A.F. Watabe T. Hawley S.H.B. Onichtchouk D. Zhang Y. Derynck R. Niehrs C. Cho K.W.Y. Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A distinct subfamily of Smads, which function to directly inhibit TGF-β family signaling by preventing formation of an active signal-transducing Smad complex, has recently been identified. In the present study, we have further characterized specific signaling pathways that are antagonized by murine and Xenopus Smad7 and have examined potential molecular mechanisms underlying their inhibitory activities. mSmad7 has previously been shown to inhibit signal transduction downstream of TGF-β and activin (24Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that mSmad7 is also a potent intracellular antagonist of BMPs, thereby implicating it as a broad spectrum inhibitor of TGF-β family signaling. Exposure of cells to TGF-β (25Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) strongly up-regulates mRNA expression of Smad7, consistent with the possibility that Smad7 participates in a negative feedback loop to regulate TGF-β responsiveness. Interestingly, we find that activin and BMP-7 are also potent inducers of expression of Smad7. 2Afrakhte, M., Morén, A., Jossan, S., Itoh, S., Westermark, B., Heldin, C.-H., Heldin, N.-E., and ten Dijke, P. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., in press Smad7 may therefore act as a general feedback inhibitor that decreases the ability of the cell to respond to all TGF-β family ligands following exposure to any one ligand. The molecular mechanism by which members of the inhibitory Smad subfamily function is controversial. Mammalian Smad6 and Smad7 have both been shown to inhibit BMP and/or TGF-β signaling by competing with pathway-restricted Smads for association with the intracellular domain of TGF-β family type I receptors (23Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.-i. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 398: 622-626Crossref Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 24Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

A distinct mechanism of action for Smad6 has recently been proposed in which Smad6 competes with Smad4 for binding to Smad1 (29Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), rather than competing with Smad1 for receptor binding. The Smad6-Smad1 complex is apparently inactive, and prevents formation of active Smad1-Smad4 complexes. In the current studies, our data suggest that Smad7 inhibits BMP signaling by blocking access of Smad1 or Smad5 to the receptor. Specifically, Smad7 stably associates with BMP-7-induced heteromeric complexes of BMPR-II and BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, or ActR-I and prevents receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the BMP pathway-specific Smads, Smad1 and Smad5. Our finding that interaction of Smad7 with BMP type I receptors is dependent on activation of these receptors by the BMP type II receptor kinase supports the physiological relevance of this interaction. Our structure-function analyses demonstrate that the C-domain of mSmad7 is sufficient for interaction with activated type I receptors and for inhibitory function in mammalian cells and in Xenopusembryos. The C-domain of signal transducing Smads has also been shown to be sufficient for receptor interaction (38Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 39Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A short (19 amino acid residue) C-terminal truncation of this domain abrogates receptor interaction and inhibitory activity of mSmad7, suggesting that an intact C-domain is required for function. Hata et al. (29Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) report that the isolated C-domain of Smad6 is a more potent inhibitor of BMP signaling than is wild-type Smad6. In contrast, we find that the isolated C-domain of mSmad7 is less or similarly active at inhibiting TGF-β-induced responses in cultured cells than wild-type mSmad7. Whereas the N-domain of signal-transducing Smads provides an inhibitory function, which can be relieved by receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the C-domain (40Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), antagonistic Smads are not substrates for TGF-β family receptors, and the function of the N-domain is less clear. Deletion of the N-domain from Smad6 relieves the ligand dependence of signal inhibition (29Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain plays a conserved role in silencing all subclasses of Smad proteins in the absence of ligand. Our results suggest that the N-domain of antagonistic Smads may also function to target specific signaling pathways for inhibition. This possibility is supported by our observation that mSmad7 and XSmad7, which share 96% amino acid identity in their C-domains but are less similar (51% identity) in their N-domains, differ in their ability to inhibit TGF-β signaling in cultured cells (present studies) and in their ability to block activin signaling in in vivo assays (27Nakayama T. Snyder M.A. Grewal S.S. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Christian J.L. Development. 1998; 125: 857-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of XSmad7 in Xenopus embryos produces patterning defects that are not observed following overexpression of mSmad7, suggesting that mSmad7 and XSmad7 may preferentially target distinct signaling pathways. To rule out the possibility that these differences are due to species variability awaits the identification of the complete spectrum of inhibitory Smads in mammals and in Xenopus. We are grateful to Napoleone Ferrara for TGF-β1, to Kuber Sampath for BMP-7, and to Joan Massaguéfor the p3TPLux reporter construct."

Plant Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 7: 59-114Google Scholar, 3Preiss J. Romeo T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme from higher plants is a heterotetramer composed of two different subunits (4Preiss J. Sivak M. Zamski E. Schaffer A. Photoassimilate Distribution in Plants and Crops. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 63-96Google Scholar, 9Smith-White B. Preiss J. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the small subunit of plant ADPGlc PPase is highly conserved (80–95%), but the amino acid sequence of the large subunit shows less conservation (55–65%; Ref. 9Smith-White B. Preiss J. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the small and large subunit of the enzyme from potato tuber were found to be 50 and 51 kDa, respectively (10Okita T.W. Nakata P.A. Anderson J.M. Sowokinos J. Morell M. Preiss J Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two cDNAs encoding the large subunit and small subunit of the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase have been expressed in Escherichia coli(11Iglesias A.A. Barry G.F. Meyer C. Bloksberg L. Nakata P.A.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The properties of the recombinant enzyme are very similar to those of the enzyme purified from potato tuber (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The activity of several chloroplast enzymes is regulated by reversible thiol/disulfide interchange (13Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar, 14Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During photosynthetic electron transport in the light, covalent redox modification is mediated by a redox chain, the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, leading to reductive activation of several stromal target enzymes, e.g.fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, NADP-malate dehydrogenase, phosphoribulokinase, etc. (15Scheibe R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, little information is known on the possible activation of ADPGlc PPases via reduction. The activity of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase was found to be stimulated by dithiothreitol (DTT) (7Sowokinos J.R. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sowokinos J.R. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 924-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The authors suggest the presence of key sulfhydryl (-SH) groups at the catalytic and/or allosteric site. The mechanism of DTT stimulation, however, is not known. In the current study, we present evidence that the activation is due to synergism involving the enzyme interacting with both DTT and its substrates. A reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bridge between Cys12 of the two small subunits of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase is involved in the activation process. ATP, ADPGlc, Glc-1-P, 3PGA, inorganic pyrophosphate, and 4-vinylpyridine were purchased from Sigma. [32P]PPi were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [14C]Glc-1-P and [1-14C]iodoacetic acid were from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. All other reagents were purchased at the highest available commercial grade. The wild-type and mutant ADPGlc PPase cDNAs were expressed as described previously (17Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity as estimated from about 4 μg of protein on SDS-PAGE. The mutants were purified as the wild-type enzyme except that the heat treatment and the hydrophobic chromatography steps were eliminated, and a second Mono Q chromatography step was added. In the second Mono Q step, protein elution was done with 50 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, and 20% sucrose with a linear gradient from 0.15 mto 0.3 m over 20 min. The mutant enzymes were purified to about 50% homogeneity as estimated by SDS-PAGE with about 3 μg of protein. In the pyrophosphorolysis direction, enzyme activity was assayed according to the method of Morell et al. (18Morell M.K. Bloom M. Knowles V. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 80 mmglycylglycine, pH 8.0, 2 mm ADP-glucose, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm DTT, 2 mm[32P]PPi (1,000–2,000 cpm/nmol), 10 mm NaF, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and enzyme in a total volume of 250 μl. This assay was primarily used for measuring activity during enzyme purification steps. In the ADP-glucose synthesis direction, enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C according to the method of Preisset al. (19Preiss J. Shen L. Greenberg E. Gentner N. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 264Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was usually measured in this direction in the kinetic analyses unless otherwise indicated. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 0.5 or 1 mm [14C]Glc-1-P (1,000–3,000 cpm/nmol), 1.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, 200 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.3 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase, and enzyme in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction time was 1 min unless otherwise indicated. The enzyme was activated with reaction mixture A (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm ADPGlc, and 3 mm DTT), at 37 °C for 30 min. This condition was referred to as the activation condition. In the control, the enzyme was incubated with reaction mixture B (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and 2 mm ADPGlc). This condition was referred to as the nonactivation condition. To determine the available sulfhydryl groups of the activated and nonactivated potato tuber ADPGlc PPase, enzyme (36 μg) was incubated either under the activation or nonactivation conditions. Then samples were desalted into mixture C (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm ADPGlc) with a Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 0.48 mm DTNB was added to the desalted enzyme, and theA 412 nm was measured every 15 s with a Beckman spectrophotometer model DU680. An extinction coefficient of 13,600 m−1 cm−1 was used for measuring the DTNB reduction (20Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). A molecular mass of 202 kDa (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the amount of enzyme used for the DTNB measurement. The desalting procedure efficiently removed the DTT from the samples as indicated by the fact that in the absence of enzyme both mixture A and mixture B gave the same absorbance reading after desalting. After removal of the DTT, the newly formed –SH groups of the activated enzyme were retained as determined by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Furthermore, the activity of the activated and nonactivated enzyme was fully retained after desalting as determined by a comparison of the specific activity of the corresponding enzyme before the procedure. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Smithet al. (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Garter F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Kenk D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18348) Google Scholar). Enzyme (48 μg) was incubated with mixture A at 37 °C in a final volume of 48 μl. Aliquots of 2.5 μl were withdrawn periodically for activity measurement in the synthesis direction. In parallel, aliquots of 4 μl were withdrawn and immediately mixed with 4 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide to stop the reduction prior to SDS-PAGE analysis as described below. The protein contents of the 100-kDa band (small subunit dimer) and 50-kDa band from each sample were quantified by scanning the stained gels with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer. The reduction time course was also obtained by measuring the decrease of the protein content of the 100-kDa band with time. SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) on 10% polyacrylamide gel. 2-Mercaptoethanol was not added to the protein samples under nonreducing condition. The nonactivated potato tuber ADPGlc PPase (8 μg) was separated in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and subsequently blotted to a ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems Inc.). After staining with Coomassie Blue R250, the 100-kDa band (small subunit dimer) and 50-kDa band were cut for sequencing as described previously (23LeGendre N. Matsudaira P.T. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 77-84Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis, and treated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-spinach leaf ADPGlc PPase IgG. The antigen-antibody complex was visualized by treatment with alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by staining with BM purple AP-substrate precipitating reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). Potato tuber ADPGlc PPase (17 μg) was incubated with either mixture A (activation condition) or mixture B (nonactivation condition). 8 m urea was added and the samples were incubated 15 min at 50 °C and then for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were brought to room temperature, and 20 mm iodoacetamide was added to block all the exposed free thiols. After precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, the pellets were washed three times and dissolved with 8 m urea in 0.4 mNH4HCO3. 1 mm DTT was added, and the reduction was continued at 50 °C for 15 min and then at 37 °C for 30 min. 12.5 mm [14C]iodoacetic acid (8,240 cpm/nmol) was added, and the samples were incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were precipitated and washed as before; the pellets were dissolved with 2% SDS in 100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. Eight ml of scintillation liquid was added, and the samples were counted in a Packard liquid scintillation analyzer. Potato tuber ADPGlc PPase (216 μg) was incubated either under activation or nonactivation conditions as described before. Then 15 mm [14C]iodoacetic acid (8,240 cpm/nmol) was added and incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. [14C]Carboxymethylation was terminated by acidification with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Potato tuber ADPGlc PPase (68 μg) was incubated either under activation or nonactivation conditions as described before. 20 mm 4-vinylpyridine was added to the incubated solution to stop the DTT-dependent reduction of protein and to block exposed thiols. 8 m urea was added and the samples were incubated 30 min at 50 °C and then 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were brought to room temperature and incubated 2 h. After precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, the pellets were washed four times and dissolved with 25 μl of 8 m urea in 0.4 m NH4HCO3; 5 μl of 24 mm DTT was added, and samples were incubated at 50 °C for 15 min and then 37 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 10 μl of 40 mm [14C]iodoacetic acid (8,240 cpm/nmol) was added and the samples were incubated in the dark for 15 min. Carboxymethylation was stopped by addition of 16 μl of 100 mm DTT. Potato tuber ADPGlc PPase (17 μg) was incubated either under activation or nonactivation conditions in a final volume of 15 μl. Then 2.8 μl of 200 mm4-vinylpyridine was added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The labeled proteins were stored at –20 °C prior to sequence analysis. Trypsin digestion was performed according to a described procedure (24Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 43-69Google Scholar) on the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase after direct labeling with [14C]iodoacetic acid. For the tryptic digestion of the potato tuber enzyme after reverse labeling, water was added to adjust the final concentration of urea to 2 m and thenl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was added at a trypsin to ADPGlc PPase ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The digestion was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by freezing of the samples at –20 °C. The tryptic digests were applied to a C18 Vydac RP column (4.6 mm × 250 mm). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient formed by mixing solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A 5 to 60% solvent B gradient was used at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min over 117 min. The radioactive fractions were pooled and the acetonitrile was evaporated with a Speed-Vac prior to further separation. For further purification of the pooled radioactive fractions from direct and reverse labeling, a 135-min linear gradient (5–45% solvent B) and a 90-min linear gradient (5–30% solvent B) was used, respectively, at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Both HPLC separations were performed on a microbore C18 Vydac RP column (0.8 mm × 250 mm). Peptides from HPLC and whole protein samples were applied to a Procise (Applied Biosystems model 494A) automated sequencer for amino acid sequence analysis. The mutant enzymes with Ser and Ala substitutions at residue 12 of the small subunit of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase were designated as SC12SLwt and SC12ALwt, respectively. The SC12SLwt mutant was obtained by using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; Ref. 25Papworth C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Google Scholar); the SC12ALwt mutant was obtained by sequential polymerase chain reaction steps (26Ausubel M.F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Then theNcoI-KpnI fragment containing the Ala substitution was transferred into the expression vector. The sequence of the whole NcoI-KpnI fragment was verified by double-strand sequencing. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are shown below with the underlined bases introduced to replace the codon initially encoding Cys12 in the small subunit.SC12SLwt:5′­CGCAGAATTCACAGACATCT¯CTAGACCCAGATGC­3′3′­GCGTCTTAAGTGTCTGTAGA¯GATCTGGGTCTACG­5′SC12ALwt:5′­ATTCACAGACAGCT¯CTAGACCCAGATGCTAGCCGGAGT­3′3′­TAAGTGTCTGTCGA¯GATCTGGGTCTACGATCGGCCTCA­5′SEQUENCES 1 AND 2 When measured in the absence of activator, 3PGA, the catalytic activity of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase was found to increase with time showing nonlinear kinetics. Various combinations of effectors were tested for their ability to activate the enzyme during a preincubation at 37 °C. As seen in Fig. 1 A, both ADPGlc and DTT were required to give about 10-fold activation of the potato tuber enzyme. In the absence of DTT, ADPGlc could slightly activate the enzyme (close to 2-fold). However, when DTT was included in the preincubation mixture in the absence of ADPGlc, about 70% activity was lost after a 30 min preincubation. To further examine the effect of DTT, the rate of ADPGlc synthesis was measured in the presence or absence of DTT. When DTT was eliminated from the assay mixture, the enzyme was kept in a low activity form. The conversion to a high activity form only took place when DTT was present (data not shown). This may suggest that reduction of a disulfide bridge(s) is involved in the activation process. Different combinations of ATP, Glc-1-P, Ca2+, and DTT were also tested for their effect on the activation of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase. DTT was included in all the combinations since it was required for the activation. Since catalysis would take place when the three effectors (ATP, Glc-1-P, and Mg2+) were present together, Ca2+ was used as a substitute for Mg2+ to separate the activation process from catalysis. Experiments showed that Ca2+ could replace Mg2+ as a cofactor for the potato tuber ADPGlc PPase at about 1/10 of the rate seen with Mg2+, and the apparent affinity of Ca2+ for the enzyme (S 0.5 = 1.8 mm) 2Y. Fu and J. Preiss, unpublished results. is similar to that of Mg2+ (S 0.5 = 2.0 mm). These findings suggest that Ca2+ binds to the same site as Mg2+ but with lower catalytic efficiency. After preincubation, EGTA and Mg2+ were added to start the assay. Since EGTA has a very high affinity for Ca2+ and a very poor affinity for Mg2+, Ca2+ in the assay mixture was efficiently chelated and Mg2+ would be the cation for the reaction. This metal exchange method was successfully used in the study of activation of chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (14Wolosiuk R.A. Ballicora M.A. Hagelin K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 622-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Hertig C.M. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 984-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the enzyme was only activated when all three effectors were present at the same time. With DTT present in cases where one of the other two effectors were not present, enzyme activity actually decreased from the control value in the 30-min preincubation. Since 9.6 nmol of ADPGlc was produced when all three effectors were present in the preincubation (see Fig. 1 B legend), another experiment was conducted to differentiate the activation from ADPGlc and that from ATP, Glc-1-P and Ca2+ in the preincubation. Fig. 2 indicates that even before ADPGlc was produced in the preincubation (2–6 min), the enzyme was already activated. This demonstrates that ATP, Glc-1-P, and Ca2+could activate potato tuber ADPGlc PPase without prior formation of ADPGlc. To determine if a reduction occurred in the activation process, DTNB was used to quantitate the available sulfhydryl groups of the potato tuber enzyme under activated or nonactivated conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, the activation of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase was accompanied by an increase of about 2.5 new sulfhydryl groups per tetrameric enzyme over the nonactivated form. This difference correlates with the reduction of a disulfide bridge in the activation. Since proteins with disulfide bridges often exhibit altered migration on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, both the activated and nonactivated potato tuber ADPGlc PPases were subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4,lanes a and b). The activated protein migrated as a single band with molecular mass about 50 kDa (Fig. 4, lane a). This was in agreement with previous studies on native and cloned ADPGlc PPase (10Okita T.W. Nakata P.A. Anderson J.M. Sowokinos J. Morell M. Preiss J Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that showed the molecular masses of the small and large subunit were 50 and 51 kDa, respectively. Apparently, the small and large subunits in this electrophoresis system were too close to be distinguishable. The nonactivated enzyme migrated as two bands corresponding to molecular masses of 50 and 100 kDa (Fig. 4,lane b). Both bands were transferred to a ProBlott membrane, and their N-terminal sequences were determined. For the 100-kDa band, it was AVSDSQN; for the 50-kDa band, AVSVITT. The former was the same as the N-terminal sequence of the small subunit (12Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the latter was the same as that of the large subunit deduced from cDNA sequence (28Nakata P.A. Greene T.W. Anderson J.M. Smith-White B.J. Okita T.W. Preiss J. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) except that the first methionine was processed in both cases. Thus, the 100-kDa band was the dimer of the small subunit. This result indicated the existence of an intermolecular disulfide bridge between the small subunits of the potato tuber enzyme, which was reduced during activation. Under reducing conditions, both the activated and nonactivated enzyme migrated as a single band of 50 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes d and e). Since a reduction step was involved in the activation of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase, it was of interest to compare the rate of reduction with the rate of activation. Because the reduction resulted in a shift of the dimer of the small subunit (100 kDa) to its monomer position (50 kDa) (Fig. 4), it was possible to determine the time course of the reduction by measuring the decrease of the protein content of the 100-kDa band with time. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The rate of enzyme activation matched closely the rate of reduction. It shows a correlation between the reduction and the activation process, suggesting that the reduction of the intermolecular disulfide is the rate-limiting step in the activation of potato tuber enzyme. A faint band just below the 100-kDa band was due to protein degradation from the small subunit during storage. As both ADPGlc and DTT were required for the activation of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase, an experiment was done to differentiate the effect of these two compounds. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the potato tuber enzyme was first incubated with DTT at 37 °C for 30 min, then DTT was removed by a rapid desalting step. Addition of ADPGlc resulted in instantaneous activation. The enzyme reached 80% of the maximal activity within 10 s. This is in agreement with the result in Fig. 5, which suggests that the reduction is the rate-limiting step of the activation process. During the first incubation with DTT, the enzyme activity decreased as seen in Fig. 1 (A and B). When the enzyme was first incubated with ADPGlc, subsequent addition of DTT could not activate the enzyme in the absence of ADPGlc (Fig. 6 B). Still, both ADPGlc and DTT were required to activate the enzyme. The results suggest that reduction is a prerequisite for the activation. In Table I, when both ADPGlc and DTT were removed from the incubation mixture, the activity of the activated enzyme decreased to below that of the nonactivated enzyme (control). A second incubation either with ADPGlc or with ADPGlc plus DTT reactivated the enzyme. Addition of DTT showed no effect in the reactivation process, indicating that the intermolecular disulfide bridge was already reduced. This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (under nonreducing condition), showing that the desalted enzyme remained reduced after the first incubation. The data indicate that the ADPGlc-induced conformational change of the reduced enzyme is reversible.Table IReactivation of potato tuber ADPGlc PPaseTreatmentActivitynmol/minControl1.1 ± 0.1First incubation13.6 ± 0.1Desalting0.7 ± 0.1Second incubation (ADPGlc)8.6 ± 0.4Second incubation (ADPGlc + DTT)8.7 ± 0.1In the first incubation, enzyme (25 μg) was incubated with 2 mm ADPGlc and 3 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min.

In the second incubation, the desalted enzyme was incubated either with 2 mm ADPGlc or 2 mm ADPGlc plus 3 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min. 100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, was included in all the incubations. Aliquots of 2.1 μg of enzyme were withdrawn after each treatment to measure the activity. Open table in a new tab In the first incubation, enzyme (25 μg) was incubated with 2 mm ADPGlc and 3 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min.

Aliquots of 2.1 μg of enzyme were withdrawn after each treatment to measure the activity. When the activated (reduced) form (Fig. 7 A, lane b) of enzyme was incubated with DTNB, a mobility shift of the 50-kDa band to the 100-kDa position could be observed on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 7 A, lane c). Oxidation by DTNB was accompanied by a decrease of the enzyme activity (Fig. 7 B), suggesting the reformation of the intermolecular disulfide bridge. The DTNB-treated enzyme could be reactivated by a second preincubation with ADPGlc and DTT. Upon reactivation, the intermolecular disulfide bridge was reduced again (Fig. 7 A, lane d). There are 28 cysteine residues in potato tuber ADPGlc PPase (6 in the small subunit and 8 in the large subunit). Prior to locating the intermolecular disulfide bridge between the small subunits, the total number of disulfide bridges of potato tuber ADPGlc PPase was determined by [14C]"
https://openalex.org/W2003199291,"Abstract The enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Udpgdh) (EC1.1.1.22) converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate, a critical component of the glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate. Although Udpgdh is a comparatively well characterized enzyme, no vertebrate genes encoding this enzyme have been reported to date. We report the cloning and characterization of the human and mouse UDP-glucose dehydrogenase genes. Mouse and human cDNAs predicted proteins of 493 and 494 amino acids, 24–25 residues longer at their carboxyl termini than the previously reported bovine Udpgdh sequence. The mouse Ugdh gene is composed of 10 exons, spanning 15 kilobases. Northern analyses indicated widespread expression of the gene in embryo and adult. Through interspecific backcross analyses, we localized the Ugdh gene to mouse chromosome 5 at approximately 39 centimorgans, suggesting that the humanUGDH gene is localized to chromosome 4p13–15. Results from Southern analyses strongly suggest that Udpgdh is encoded by a single gene in the mouse. Transfection of mouse Ugdh expression vectors led to an increase in detectable Udpgdh activity in mammalian cells. Preliminary expression studies indicated that proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1β, can substantially increase the expression of human UGDH in cultured human fibroblasts, suggesting that glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis may be partly regulated by the availability of activated UDP-glucuronate, as determined by relative Udpgdh expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W1968505616,"Oxidation-reduction properties of methylglyoxal-modified protein in relation to free radical generation were investigated. Glycation of bovine serum albumin by methylglyoxal generated the protein-bound free radical, probably the cation radical of the cross-linked Schiff base, as observed in the reaction of methylglyoxal with l-alanine (Yim, H.-S., Kang, S.-O., Hah, Y. C., Chock, P. B., and Yim, M. B. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 28228–28233) or withN α-acetyl-l-lysine. The glycated bovine serum albumin showed increased electrophoretic mobility suggesting that the basic residues, such as lysine, were modified by methylglyoxal. The glycated protein reduced ferricytochromec to ferrocytochrome c in the absence of oxygen or added metal ions. This reduction of cytochrome c was accompanied by a large increase in the amplitude of the electron paramagnetic resonance signal originated from the protein-bound free radical. In addition, the glycated protein catalyzed the oxidation of ascorbate in the presence of oxygen, whereas the protein free radical signal disappeared. These results indicate that glycation of protein generates active centers for catalyzing one-electron oxidation-reduction reactions. This active center, which exhibits enzyme-like characteristic, was suggested to be the cross-linked Schiff base/the cross-linked Schiff base radical cation of the protein. It mimics the characteristics of the metal-catalyzed oxidation system. The glycated bovine serum albumin cross-linked further to the cytochromec in the absence of methylglyoxal. The cross-linked cytochrome c maintains its oxidation-reduction properties. These results together indicate that glycated proteins accumulatedin vivo provide stable active sites for catalyzing the formation of free radicals. Oxidation-reduction properties of methylglyoxal-modified protein in relation to free radical generation were investigated. Glycation of bovine serum albumin by methylglyoxal generated the protein-bound free radical, probably the cation radical of the cross-linked Schiff base, as observed in the reaction of methylglyoxal with l-alanine (Yim, H.-S., Kang, S.-O., Hah, Y. C., Chock, P. B., and Yim, M. B. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 28228–28233) or withN α-acetyl-l-lysine. The glycated bovine serum albumin showed increased electrophoretic mobility suggesting that the basic residues, such as lysine, were modified by methylglyoxal. The glycated protein reduced ferricytochromec to ferrocytochrome c in the absence of oxygen or added metal ions. This reduction of cytochrome c was accompanied by a large increase in the amplitude of the electron paramagnetic resonance signal originated from the protein-bound free radical. In addition, the glycated protein catalyzed the oxidation of ascorbate in the presence of oxygen, whereas the protein free radical signal disappeared. These results indicate that glycation of protein generates active centers for catalyzing one-electron oxidation-reduction reactions.

Glycation reaction (nonenzymatic glycosylation; Maillard reaction), which produces brown fluorescent compounds, is a chance event that may occur when a protein is in solution with a reducing sugar, such as glucose. In this reaction, free amino groups of protein react slowly with the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars to yield Schiff-base intermediates, which undergo Amadori rearrangement to stable ketoamine derivatives (1Reynolds T.M. Adv. Food Res. 1963; 12: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These Amadori products subsequently degrade into α-dicarbonyl compounds, deoxyglucosones (2Kato H. Shin D.B. Hayase F. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 2009-2011Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Schiff bases can also be fragmented to glyoxal (3Wells-Knecht K.J. Zuzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). These compounds are more reactive than the parent sugars with respect to their ability to react with amino groups of proteins. Thus, the α-dicarbonyl compounds or α-ketoaldehydes are mainly responsible for forming inter- and intramolecular cross-links of proteins, known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs)1 (1Reynolds T.M. Adv. Food Res. 1963; 12: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The AGEs, which are irreversibly formed, accumulate with aging, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus, especially associated with long-lived proteins such as collagens, lens crystallins, and nerve proteins (4Gordillo E.

Fenton reaction-mediated oxidation of sugars, lipids, and proteins produces various α-dicarbonyl compounds. Accordingly, the transition metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of glucose is suggested to be a more important factor in glycation than the formation of the Amadori product of glucose itself (9Wolff S.P. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 618-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Wolff S.P. Dean R.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 11Jiang Z.Y. Woollard A.C.S. Wolff S.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The α-ketoaldehydes, such as methylglyoxal, are also found as a normal metabolite in mammals and microorganisms. The methylglyoxal is formed by the non-enzymatic or enzymatic elimination of phosphate from triose phosphate and by the oxidation of hydroxyacetone and aminoacetone (12Inoue Y. Kimura A. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1995; 37: 177-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Thornalley P.J. Wolff S. Crabbe J. Stern A. Biochim. Biophys.

The increased formation of methylglyoxal was observed in hyperglycemia associated with diabetes mellitus (15Phillips S.A. Mirrlees D. Thornalley P.J. Biochem.

(Lond.). 1994; 87: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that methylglyoxal-modified albumin underwent receptor-mediated endocytosis by macrophage, which may suggest the involvement of methylglyoxal in pathophysiology (17Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it was suggested that cellular oxidant stress or free radicals are generated by AGEs themselves (18Mullarkey C.J. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several AGEs were identified from the products formed during the reaction of methylglyoxal with model compounds and proteins. These species includeN ε -(carboxyethyl)lysine (22Ahmed M.U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition to these AGEs, several investigations have also shown by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy that unidentified protein free radicals were produced during the reaction of methylglyoxal with proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and casein (27Gascoyne P.R.C. Int. J. Quantum. Chem. Symp. 1980; 7: 93-100Google Scholar, 28McLaughlin J.A. Pethig R. Szent-Györgyi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 499-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In our previous report (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the free radical was assigned to be the radical cation of the cross-linked Schiff base on the basis of the detailed analysis of EPR spectra observed from the reaction mixture containing methylglyoxal and alanine. We also suggested that the cation radical sites in the cross-linked proteins could serve as reactive centers for one-electron oxidation-reduction with appropriate substrates. These reactions will produce free radicals for a long duration and contribute to accelerating oxidative modification of the biological macromolecules (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In this report, we use methylglyoxal-modified bovine serum albumin (MG-BSA) as a model protein to study the free radical generating properties of glycated proteins and their capacity to catalyze oxidative modifications of macromolecules. The results provide supporting evidence for the suggestion derived from our previous study on the free radical generation during the glycation reaction of amino acids by methylglyoxal (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The following materials were obtained from Sigma: methylglyoxal, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA),N α-acetyl-l-lysine,N α-acetyl-l-arginine, BSA, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocyte, catalase from bovine liver, and cytochrome c from bovine heart. Ascorbic acid was purchased from Merck. Commercially supplied BSA was purified by gel filtration chromatography on a column of Superdex 200 HR10/30 (10 × 300 mm; V o: 8.2 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluent was 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m sodium chloride, and the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. The eluted sample was desalted and lyophilized to dryness. The catalase was also purified by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) to remove contaminating superoxide dismutase. Commercial catalase dissolved in Tris glycine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.3 m NaCl was fractionated using the same column. The buffers used for the reaction of BSA with methylglyoxal were treated with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove traces of transition metal ions. BSA was reacted with methylglyoxal in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Unless otherwise indicated, the concentrations of BSA and methylglyoxal were 20 mg/ml (0.3 mm) and 30 mm, respectively. After modification, samples were repeatedly filtered though PM-10 ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon) using 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and further desalted with Fast Desalting Column H10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The effect of methylglyoxal modification on the net charge, adduct formation, and oligomerization of BSA was investigated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with/without urea, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focusing, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. PAGE was performed on 9% polyacrylamide gel with or without 6 m urea, and SDS-PAGE was on 5–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel. Isoelectric focusing was carried out at 4 °C under constant power of 7 watts, using a polyacrylamide gel (5% T, 3% C) containing 2% Bio-Lyte (Bio-Rad), 5% glycerol, and 6m urea at a pH range between 3.8 and 9.4. GFC was performed using a Superdex 200 HR10/30 on fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl as eluent. In ion exchange chromatography, a Protein Pak SP 5PW column (Waters) was used on a Waters Delta Prep 4000 system. The mobile phase was 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Proteins were eluted isocratically for 15 min, and then the eluent was shifted linearly to 50 mm acetate buffer containing 1m NaCl for 10 min. MG-BSA (1 mg/ml) was mixed with 32 μm cytochrome c in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was monitored at 550 nm at 37 °C. The experiment was carried out in an SLM DW-2000TM UV-visible spectrophotometer (Aminco Corp.) equipped with a MilliFlow Stopped-flow Reactor set on dual wavelength mode, where the reference wavelength was 700 nm. Ascorbate was incubated with MG-BSA in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 30 °C. The concentration of the unreacted ascorbate in the reaction mixture was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography. An aliquot of the sample solution was loaded onto an ODS Hypersil column (4.6 × 100 mm) (Hewlett-Packard) in a Waters HPLC 600S equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 1100 UV detector. Mobile phase was 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid, and the eluent was monitored at 254 nm. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300S EPR spectrometer. For some analysis, samples were frozen at 77 K using liquid nitrogen. The operating conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.44 GHz; microwave power, 10 milliwatts; sweep width, 100 G; conversion, 40.96 ms. Modulation amplitude was set to 4.00 G at 77 K or 1.47 G at room temperature. BSA was incubated with methylglyoxal in 0.1 m Chelex-treated phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 5 days. Further incubation had little effect on the modification of BSA as indicated by PAGE analysis. The native PAGE of the reaction products (shown in Fig. 1 A) demonstrated that the electrophoretic mobility of MG-BSA increases with increasing concentration of methylglyoxal used for the glycation. This result indicates the progressive loss of the positive charge in the MG-BSA during the glycation reaction. When a high concentration of methylglyoxal (30 mm or higher) was used for glycation, additional bands appeared with lower electrophoretic mobility. The species with lower mobility may represent the higher aggregates of MG-BSA. At 600 mm methylglyoxal, the aggregate formed precipitates (lane 8 in Fig. 1 A). The result obtained from the denaturing PAGE (6 m urea; data not shown) also supports this conclusion. The identical results were also obtained with the reaction products prepared anaerobically. Isoelectric focusing revealed similar results, suggesting that glycation of BSA by methylglyoxal introduced net negative charges into MG-BSA adducts, although at a higher concentration of methylglyoxal (30 mmor higher) some species possessing net positive charges were also formed (data not shown). In accordance with the above observation, the SDS-PAGE data (Fig. 1 B) indicate the presence of additional protein bands for samples obtained with higher concentration of methylglyoxal at the positions corresponding to the molecular mass of the dimer and tetramer of BSA. Chromatographic analysis also gave similar results. Cation exchange chromatography showed that, as BSA incubation with methylglyoxal proceeded, its net charge becomes more negative. Gel filtration chromatographic analysis of MG-BSA gave peaks that correspond to the dimer and tetramer. The basic lysines and arginines are known to be the residues modified and responsible for forming Schiff bases for intra- and intermolecular cross-links during the glycation reaction. Thus, the net charges of MG-BSA adducts may be shifted to more negative values. Previous investigations of the reaction of methylglyoxal with protein suggested that, in addition to the modification of protein, the treatment of methylglyoxal fragmented the protein (17Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we did not detect any protein fragments during the modification of BSA by methylglyoxal. The difference may have arisen from the fact that we treated all the solutions with Chelex resin to remove traces of transition metal ions, such as iron and copper, known to cleave protein in the presence of oxygen. Thus, the characteristics of the glycated protein observed in this study are caused mostly by the covalent binding of the methylglyoxal with few effects from protein fragmentation or reaction products of the fragments. We examined the residues responsible for cross-linking by investigating variousN α-substituted amino acids for their ability to undergo the glycation reaction and form the cross-linked radical cation. The EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 2 A was obtained from the reaction mixture containing 0.2 m N α-acetyl-l-lysine and 0.2m methylglyoxal in carbonate buffer at pH 9.5. This spectrum was compared with the previously reported spectrum (Fig. 2 B) obtained from alanine-methylglyoxal system, which was identified as the radical cation of the cross-linked Schiff base, the methylglyoxal dialkylimine radical cation (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although the hyperfine structure in Fig. 2 A is different from that in Fig. 2 B, there is little doubt that the chemical structures of these radicals are similar to the radical cations of the cross-linked Schiff base. Thus, ε-amino groups of twoN α-acetyl-l-lysines form a cross-linked Schiff base with a methylglyoxal, which lose one electron to form the cross-linked radical cation. With otherN α-blocked amino acids, includingN α-acetyl-l-arginine, no detectable EPR signal was observed (Fig. 2 C). This result is in agreement with previous reports showing thatN α-acetyl-l-arginine did not produce a Schiff base (23Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cheung S.-T. Fonda M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Methylglyoxal is also known to react with arginine and cysteine residues in proteins, yielding stable imidazolone and hemithioacetal compounds, respectively (23Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several investigators have shown, however, that lysine residues are the main cross-linking sites in MG-treated proteins by forming imidazolium cross-links between two lysines (24Brinkmann, E., Wells-Knecht, K. J., Thorpe, S. R., and Baynes, J. W. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 1–2Google Scholar, 25Wells-Knecht, K. J, Brinkmann, E., Wells-Knecht, M. C., Litchfield, J. E., Ahmed, M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These observations together with our results showing that the cross-linked radical cations were detected only withN α-acetyl-l-lysines suggest that the lysine residues are likely the main cross-linking sites for forming protein free radicals in MG-BSA adducts. The treatment of BSA with methylglyoxal produced free radical sites on the protein as shown in Fig. 3. The EPR spectra were obtained at 77 K with filtered and desalted MG-BSA to remove unreacted methylglyoxal. It gave a single broad EPR line at a g value of 2.006 (Fig. 3 A). However, the untreated BSA did not give any EPR absorption (Fig. 3 B). Addition of ferricytochromec to the MG-BSA sample caused a large increase in the amplitude of the EPR signal (Fig. 3 C), indicating an additional production of the protein free radicals. This increase in EPR signal is derived from the interaction between ferricytochromec and glycated BSA because with the untreated BSA one failed to observe such signal (Fig. 3 D). This additional production of the protein free radicals was accompanied by the reduction of ferricytochrome c. Fig. 4shows the time course of this reduction from ferri- to ferrocytochromec by glycated protein monitored at 550 nm. The rate of the reduction depends on the degree of BSA glycation. This reduction, however, did not require oxygen, and it was not affected by the addition of a chelating agent, DTPA. These results together suggest that ferricytochrome c receives one electron directly from the species of glycated BSA, most likely the cross-linked Schiff bases, to produce the radical cation of the cross-linked Schiff bases in the protein according to Reaction 1.cross­linked Schiff base+Cyt c (III)→Reaction 1 cross­linked Schiff base⨥+Cyt c (II)These radical cations may be the species possessing net positive charges detected in the isoelectric focusing experiment of MG-BSA generated with a high concentration of methylglyoxal.Figure 4Time course of cytochrome creduction by MG-BSA. BSA (20 mg/ml; 0.3 mm) was reacted with 0, 0.3, 1, 5, 30, 100, and 300 mm(curves a to g) methylglyoxal in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 5 days.

We examined the possibility that this free carbonyl group of MG-BSA reacts with cytochrome c to form cross-links. After incubation of 0.4 mm (5 mg/ml) cytochrome c with 25 mg/ml (0.4 mm BSA) MG-BSA (in the absence of free methylglyoxal) at 37 °C, small aliquots of the reaction mixture were analyzed with time by GFC using Superdex 200 HR10/30 (Fig. 5 A). Similar chromatograms were obtained in the absence (Fig. 5 Aa) or presence (Figs. 5, Ab and Ac) of cytochrome c with the exception of fraction 3, which corresponds to free cytochrome c. The concentration of free cytochromec decreased with increasing incubation time. MG-BSA obtained in the absence of cytochrome c (fraction 2 in panel Aa) has an absorption maximum at 278 nm with a prominent shoulder centered at 330 nm (Fig. 5 B) as observed in our previous study with alanine (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, fraction 2obtained from the reaction mixture of MG-BSA and cytochromec (Fig. 5, Ab and Ac) gave an additional absorption peak, the distinct Soret band of cytochromec at 415 nm (Fig. 5 B). The fractions corresponding to BSA oligomers (t R, 14–20,fraction 1 in Fig. 5 Ab) also gave similar results. This absorbance at the Soret band increased with the incubation time, whereas the concentration of free cytochromec (t R, 28, fraction 3) decreased. These results indicate that cytochrome ccross-linked to MG-BSA. Moreover, the ferricytochrome c in the cross-linked protein was reduced to ferrocytochrome c by the addition of dithionite (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the cross-linked cytochrome c maintains its oxidation-reduction properties. Fig. 6 shows the time courses of cytochrome c reduction, protein free radical generation, and the formation of cytochrome c-MG-BSA cross-links. MG-BSA (25 mg/ml) was mixed with 0.4 mm cytochrome c. At the indicated times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed to measure the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm (curve a), the concentration of the protein free radical from the EPR signal amplitude (curve b), and the remaining concentration of free cytochrome c by GFC (curve c). The formation of the protein free radical and the reduction of ferricytochrome c took place at a very fast rate, whereas the concentration of the free cytochrome c decreased very slowly. Approximately 0.25 mm cytochrome c was reduced according to the absorbance change at 550 nm (ε550 = 28 mm−1cm−1). During this reduction, EPR amplitude increased about 4-fold maximally. These results indicate that this sample contained 0.08 mm protein free radicals and 0.25 mm redox active centers which were oxidized by ferricytochrome c to form the protein free radicals, probably by the Reaction 1. It is not clear why a large portion (∼60%) of the cytochromec cross-linked to the MG-BSA found to be in the oxidized state (Fig. 5 C). At 20 h of incubation of MG-BSA with 0.4 mm cytochrome c (Fig. 6), approximately 0.1 mm cytochrome c remained in the oxidized state, and about 30% of cytochrome c (0.12 mm) was covalently bound to MG-BSA. Among the 0.12 mmbound-cytochrome c, 0.07 mm (∼60%) was in the oxidized state which can be reduced by dithionites (Fig. 5 C). These results together indicate that most of the oxidized cytochrome c that remained in the sample after 20 h of incubation (0.1 mm) was bound to the MG-BSA as MG-BSA-cytochrome c (III) adducts (0.07 mm). We do not have any explanation for this observation at this time. However, this observation may suggest that the reduction of the cytochromec is not catalytic unless reducing agents are supplied. The effect of the reducing agent ascorbate on the protein free radical of MG-BSA is shown in Fig. 7. Addition of ascorbate to MG-BSA, which originally displayed spectrum A, quenched the EPR signal as shown in spectrum B. This result indicates that ascorbate reduces the protein-radical cation of MG-BSA to the non-radical species. This reduction of radical cation was accompanied by the degradation of ascorbate (Fig. 8). Under anaerobic conditions, a small portion of incubated ascorbate was consumed, which reached a plateau with time when 0.1 mm ascorbate was consumed (Fig. 8 A). The controlled experiments showed that unmodified BSA failed to degrade ascorbate, and metal chelator, DTPA, had no inhibitory effect on the ascorbate degradation (data not shown). The latter experiment indicates that adventitious metal ions were not the cause of the observed ascorbate consumption. These results suggest that the ascorbate was directly oxidized by the protein free radical cation in MG-BSA according to Reaction 2, and the concentration of the protein free radical cation in MG-BSA used in this experiment is approximately 0.1 mm.cross­linked Schiff base⨥+AscH−→cross­linked Schiff base+Asc⨪ +H+ (Reaction 2)In the presence of oxygen, however, the oxidation of ascorbate continued to reach far beyond 1 molar ratio of the degraded ascorbate to MG-BSA (Fig. 8 A). The degradation of ascorbate increased with increasing MG-BSA concentration (Fig. 8 B). The initial rates obtained from these degradation data showed that the oxidation of ascorbate proceeded linearly with respect to the MG-BSA concentration. The straight line obtained from the concentration-dependent plot (data not shown), however, intercepts at 0.02 mm/h, indicating that the initial rate observed for the ascorbate degradation contained a small MG-BSA independent term. Fig. 8 C shows the oxidation of ascorbate as a function of time obtained by using various concentrations of ascorbate and a fixed concentration of MG-BSA (7 mg/ml; 0.1 mm BSA). The initial rates of the ascorbate oxidation determined from the degradation curves increased as a saturation function with respect to the ascorbate concentration. The double-reciprocal plot of the initial rates (shown in theinset) yielded a K m of 1 mmfor ascorbate and a k cat of 3.3/h if the MG-BSA used contained 0.1 mm protein free radical cation as determined from Fig. 8 A.Figure 8Degradation of ascorbate by MG-BSA. The MG-BSA was obtained by incubating BSA (20 mg/ml, 0.3 mm) and methylglyoxal (30 mm) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 5 days. The desalted MG-BSA was reacted with ascorbate in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C, and the remaining ascorbate was quantified at the indicated time by high performance liquid chromatography. A, MG-BSA (7 mg/ml; 0.1 mm BSA) was reacted with 0.4 mm ascorbate in nitrogen (•) or in air (○). B, 0.4 mmascorbate was reacted with 0.3 (•), 3 (▪), 10 (■), or 30 (○) mg/ml MG-BSA. C, MG-BSA (7 mg/ml) was reacted with 0.1 (•), 0.4 (▪), 1 (■), and 4 mm (○) ascorbate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, superoxide dismutase, but not catalase, exerts partial inhibition on the degradation of ascorbate (approximately 20% inhibition by 0.4 μm Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in the reaction between 0.4 mm ascorbate and 2 mg/ml MG-BSA at pH 7.4). The fact that this inhibition is only partial indicates that O2, but not O⨪2, is directly involved in this catalytic reaction. The partial inhibition, however, suggests that superoxide radical anions are produced during this reaction, and they play a role in ascorbate degradation, probably via the superoxide-scavenging reaction by ascorbate (31Nishikimi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 32Nadezhdin A.D. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1979; 57: 3017-3022Crossref Google Scholar, 33Cabelli D.E.

Together these results indicate that MG-BSA behaves as an enzyme, which has an ability to catalyze the oxidation of ascorbate in the presence of oxygen to produce superoxide radical anion and semi-dehydroascorbate radical. This reaction is initiated by the protein-radical cation of MG-BSA. Free amino groups in protein react with the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars or α-ketoaldehyde, which has been implicated as the onset of glycation. Previous investigations have shown that free radicals were produced in the reaction of methylglyoxal with proteins (27Gascoyne P.R.C. Int. J. Quantum. Chem. Symp. 1980; 7: 93-100Google Scholar, 28McLaughlin J.A. Pethig R. Szent-Györgyi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 499-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We also detected protein free radical from the reaction between methylglyoxal and BSA (Fig. 3). The results obtained in this study are summarized in the reaction scheme shown in Fig. 9. The structure of the free radical of the MG-BSA is most likely to be the radical cation of the cross-linked Schiff base (Fig. 9, species D) on the basis of our previous results obtained with alanine as a model system (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). When methylglyoxal was reacted with variousN α-acetyl substituted amino acids, the free radical signal was observed only withN α-acetyl-l-lysine (Fig. 2). In addition, previous investigations have shown that lysine residues are the main cross-linking sites in MG-treated proteins (24Brinkmann, E., Wells-Knecht, K. J., Thorpe, S. R., and Baynes, J. W. (1995) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 1–2Google Scholar, 25Wells-Knecht, K. J, Brinkmann, E., Wells-Knecht, M. C., Litchfield, J. E., Ahmed, M. U., Reddy, S., Zyzak, D. V., Thorpe, S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These results together suggest that methylglyoxal cross-links inter- or intramolecular lysine residues of the protein to form cross-linked Schiff bases (Fig. 1, oligomer formation; Fig. 9,species A and B). This cross-linked Schiff base of MG-BSA can donate an electron to methylglyoxal to produce the radical cation of the cross-linked Schiff base as we have described previously (29Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). During these processes, the Schiff bases or the protein free radicals may be oxidized to formN ε -(carboxyethyl)lysine (22Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem.

Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the protein free radical cation from the cross-linked Schiff base, or vice versa, depends on the electron affinity of the interacting species. Thus, in the presence of ferricytochromec which has a high electron affinity, the cross-linked Schiff base of MG-BSA will lose an electron to cytochrome cto produce additional radical cations of the cross-linked Schiff base and ferrocytochrome c (see Figs. 3, 4, and 9 and Reaction 1). In the presence of electron-donating ascorbate, however, the radical cation of the cross-linked Schiff base accepts an electron from ascorbate to produce the cross-linked Schiff base and semi-dehydroascorbate radical (see Figs. 7, 8, and 9 and Reaction 2). These reactions can proceed even in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 8), MG-BSA behaves as an enzyme, which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbate (K m = 1 mm). We do not know at this time the exact mechanism for this catalytic reaction. However, the reaction catalyzed by MG-BSA in the presence of oxygen is similar to the transition metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate (35Amici A. Levine R.L. Tsai L. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3341-3346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a transition metal ion-catalyzed oxidation system such as Fe3+/ascorbate/O2, the reaction is initiated via the one-electron reduction of Fe3+ by ascorbate, whereas in the MG-BSA/ascorbate/O2 system, it is initiated via the one-electron reduction of the protein free radical cation by ascorbate. In both reactions, superoxide radical anions are generated by the oxidation of ascorbate. A mechanism proposed for the transition metal ion-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate in the presence of oxygen is shown in Reactions 3 and 4 as follows (34Afanas'ev, I. B., Grabovetskii, V. V., and Kuprianova, N. S. (1987) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II, 281–285Google Scholar). AscH−+O2 ↔Mn+ complex→Asc⨪ +O⨪2+H+Reaction 3 O⨪2+AscH−→productsReaction 4 In the reaction with the glycated protein, the cross-linked radical cation may function as the transition metal ion M+ in Reaction 3. Reactions 3 and 4 may explain the partial inhibition of ascorbate degradation observed from the reaction mixture containing superoxide dismutase. In essence, the cross-linked Schiff base/its radical cation of glycated proteins behave as an active site of an enzyme for the one-electron oxidation-reduction reactions. In addition, long term incubation of cytochrome c with MG-BSA produces cross-links between cytochrome c and MG-BSA, probably through the reaction between free carbonyl groups of MG-BSA and amino groups of cytochromec (Figs. 5, 6, and 9, species C). The cross-linked cytochrome c maintains its oxidation-reduction properties (Fig. 5 C). The AGEs formed in vivo are heterogeneous species, which may have a variety of chemical structures. There is no direct evidence so far that the MG-BSA radical cation or similar radical species are formed in vivo. We showed, however, in this model study that one type of reactive structure (a cross-linked Schiff base/the radical cation of the Schiff base) has the enzyme-like characteristic for catalyzing the one-electron oxidation-reduction reaction yielding free radicals including superoxide radical anions. Similar types of reactive centers, if formed in vivo, may exert significant effects on their biological environment by generating free radicals for a long duration.

We have shown that the rate of FAS transcription is induced dramatically when fasted animals are refed with a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet or when streptozotocin-diabetic mice are given insulin. The FAS promoter was up-regulated by insulin through the proximal insulin response sequence containing an E-box motif at the −65-base pair position. Binding of upstream stimulatory factors to the −65 E-box is functionally required for insulin regulation of the FAS promoter. In the present study, we characterized signaling pathways in the insulin stimulation of FAS transcription using specific inhibitors for various signaling molecules and transfecting engineered phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase subunits and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. PD98059 and rapamycin, which inhibit MAP kinase and P70 S6 kinase, respectively, had little effect on the insulin-stimulated FAS promoter activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. On the other hand, wortmannin and LY294002, which specifically inactivate PI 3-kinase, strongly inhibited the insulin-stimulated FAS promoter activity. As shown in RNase protection assays, LY294002 also inhibited insulin stimulation of the endogenous FAS mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cotransfection of expression vectors for the constitutively active P110 subunit of PI 3-kinase resulted in an elevated FAS promoter activity in the absence of insulin and a loss of further insulin stimulation. Transfecting a dominant negative P85 subunit of PI 3-kinase decreased FAS promoter activity and blocked insulin stimulation. Furthermore, cotransfected wild-type PKB/Akt increased FAS promoter activity in the absence of insulin and a loss of insulin responsiveness of the FAS promoter. On the other hand, kinase-dead PKB/Akt acted in a dominant negative manner to decrease the FAS promoter activity and abolished its insulin responsiveness.

Three tandem copies of the −68/−52 FAS promoter region linked to the heterologous SV40 promoter were responsive to insulin (8Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), members of basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper family of transcription factors, bind to the E-box at −65 in vitro (9Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By correlating functional assays of mutated FAS promoter with USF binding activities and cotransfection of expression vectors of wild-type and dominant negative USFs, we demonstrated that USF binding to the E-box at −65 is functionally required for insulin regulation of the FAS promoter (10Wang D.

Insulin stimulates glucose transport by the peripheral tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, inhibits glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, and stimulates protein synthesis and lipogenesis. Some of these effects are exerted on the transcription level through a cascade of signaling events (11O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to the insulin receptor on cell membrane triggers tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and results in its autophosphorylation within the cytoplasmic domain (12Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor then interacts with insulin receptor substrates (IRSs). Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 on the tyrosine residues then results in the recruitment and activation of divergent signaling molecules, including those in the Ras/MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathways. PI 3-kinase is composed of the regulatory subunit (P85) and the catalytic subunit (P110). P85 acts as an interface by interacting with the IRS-1 through its SH2 domain and thus recruits the P110 subunit to the cell membrane through its iSH2 domain (12Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). P110 then catalyzes the reaction to release phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate as the second messenger using phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate as the substrate.

Since FAS is a critical enzyme involved in lipogenesis, we set out to investigate the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of FAS transcription by insulin. In this report, we provide experimental evidence to demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway mediates insulin regulation of FAS transcription. While inhibition of MAP kinase and S6 kinase activity by PD98059 and rapamycin, respectively, had little effect on the insulin stimulation of FAS promoter activity, wortmannin and LY294002, which inhibit PI 3-kinase, blocked the insulin stimulation of FAS promoter activity. Regulation of the endogenous FAS mRNA by insulin was also blocked by treating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with LY294002. Cotransfection of expression vectors encoding a constitutively active P110 subunit of PI 3-kinase resulted in elevated FAS promoter activity in the absence of insulin and a loss of insulin response of the FAS promoter. On the other hand, a dominant negative P85 subunit of PI 3-kinase inhibited FAS promoter activity and abolished insulin stimulation of the FAS promoter. Moreover, cotransfection of PKB/Akt stimulated FAS promoter activity in the absence of insulin to that comparable to the insulin-stimulated level. Acting in a dominant-inhibitory fashion, kinase-dead PKB/Akt inhibited FAS promoter activity in the presence and the absence of insulin. These data suggest that insulin regulation of FAS transcription is mediated by the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway and that PKB/Akt is involved as a downstream effector.DISCUSSIONWhen circulating insulin is high, there is an increase in lipogenesis in liver and adipose tissue. These processes occur in coordination with the increase in glucose uptake by peripheral tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, with inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis, and so forth. Increase in lipogenesis is impaired when insulin is low, and administration of insulin restores the rate to its normal level. FAS is a key lipogenic enzyme, and insulin increases its activity dramatically, not through allosteric effectors or covalent modification but through changes in transcription (5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rapid and high level induction of the FAS gene by insulin makes FAS an excellent model for studying the transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes by insulin. Previously, we had defined the FAS insulin response sequence to the proximal promoter region at −68/−52 and had shown that USF binding to the E-box motif within this region is functionally required for insulin stimulation of FAS transcription. However, the signaling pathway(s) that leads to the increase in lipogenesis or the activation of lipogenic genes by insulin is not known. In this report, we provide evidence that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, but not the P70 S6 kinase nor the MAP kinase pathways, mediates the insulin effect on FAS transcription. Inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002) abolished the insulin stimulation of endogenous FAS mRNA (Fig. 2) as well as the transfected FAS promoter-reporter construct in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). Expression of the constitutively active P110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase resulted in the loss of insulin responsiveness of the FAS promoter at an elevated activity level (Fig. 3). Expression of the dominant negative P85 regulatory subunit also resulted in loss of insulin responsiveness of the FAS promoter, but at a repressed activity level (Fig. 4). Similar effects on the insulin responsiveness of FAS promoter were also observed when wild-type and kinase-dead (dominant negative) PKB/Akt were expressed, suggesting PKB/Akt is a downstream mediator of the insulin stimulation of the FAS transcription (Fig. 5). This is the first report, to our knowledge, that demonstrates the involvement of the PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt signaling pathway in the transcriptional regulation of lipogenic genes. Our data, therefore, suggest that PI 3-kinase is not only involved in the stimulation of glucose transportation, glycogen synthesis, and inhibition of gluconeogenesis, but also in the stimulation of lipogenesis. It also suggests that the effect of PI 3-kinase is a major branching point of the insulin signaling pathways that exert the insulin effect at multiple levels of gene expression, including control of transcription (e.g. stimulation of FAS and inhibition of PEPCK), phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, and translocation of the GLUT4 transporter. Since inhibiting MAP kinase activity by PD98059 had no effect on insulin stimulation of the FAS promoter, it appears that the MAP kinase pathway, which plays an important role in mediating the mitogenic-effect of insulin, is not likely to be involved in insulin stimulation of lipogenesis.From the results presented in Fig. 5, it is suggested that PKB/Akt is the downstream mediator of the insulin stimulation of FAS transcription. However, further targets of this signaling pathway remain unknown. We previously reported that binding of the helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor USF to the insulin response sequence of the FAS gene is required for insulin regulation (10Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but thus far there has been no conclusive report on the regulation of USF by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. It is possible that either USF itself is regulated by phosphorylation status, or likely a USF-interacting protein is regulated by phosphorylation. In this regard, four proteins including Ets-1 (49Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Fra-1 (50Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E.

Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which are known to be phosphorylated, were reported to be able to interact with USF and are likely the candidates for regulation by phosphorylation. However, whether phosphorylation of any of these USF interacting proteins plays a role in affecting stimulation of transcription by USF requires further investigation. Whether any of these USF interacting proteins is required for insulin regulation of FAS promoter remains to be elucidated. Fatty acid synthase (FAS)1 plays an important role in de novo lipogenesis in mammals and birds. Using NADPH as reducing equivalents, FAS catalyzes the seven steps in the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate. FAS activity is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional, hormonal, and developmental status (1Volpe J.J. Vagelos P.R. Physiol.

We previously reported that insulin increases FAS mRNA levels in streptozotocin-diabetic mice and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that the regulation is at the transcriptional level (5Paulauskis J.D.

Using chimeric constructs of serial 5′-deletions of the rat FAS promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene and transfection into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we mapped the insulin response sequence to the proximal promoter region from −68 to −52 (7Moustaid N. Sakamoto K. Clarke S. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,8Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains an E-box (5′-CATGTG-3′) motif at −65. Three tandem copies of the −68/−52 FAS promoter region linked to the heterologous SV40 promoter were responsive to insulin (8Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), members of basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper family of transcription factors, bind to the E-box at −65 in vitro (9Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By correlating functional assays of mutated FAS promoter with USF binding activities and cotransfection of expression vectors of wild-type and dominant negative USFs, we demonstrated that USF binding to the E-box at −65 is functionally required for insulin regulation of the FAS promoter (10Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Insulin regulates a wide variety of biological responses in coordination with other hormones, such as glucagon, to maintain glucose homeostasis. Insulin stimulates glucose transport by the peripheral tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, inhibits glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, and stimulates protein synthesis and lipogenesis. Some of these effects are exerted on the transcription level through a cascade of signaling events (11O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to the insulin receptor on cell membrane triggers tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor and results in its autophosphorylation within the cytoplasmic domain (12Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor then interacts with insulin receptor substrates (IRSs). Phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 on the tyrosine residues then results in the recruitment and activation of divergent signaling molecules, including those in the Ras/MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathways. PI 3-kinase is composed of the regulatory subunit (P85) and the catalytic subunit (P110). P85 acts as an interface by interacting with the IRS-1 through its SH2 domain and thus recruits the P110 subunit to the cell membrane through its iSH2 domain (12Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). P110 then catalyzes the reaction to release phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate as the second messenger using phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate as the substrate. Recently, the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (14Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A.

Recently, PI 3-kinase has been shown to mediate insulin inhibition of the transcription of the PEPCK gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis (31Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C.

Molecular mechanisms mediating insulin regulation of lipogenesis, especially the signaling pathways involved, is largely unknown. Since FAS is a critical enzyme involved in lipogenesis, we set out to investigate the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of FAS transcription by insulin. In this report, we provide experimental evidence to demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway mediates insulin regulation of FAS transcription. While inhibition of MAP kinase and S6 kinase activity by PD98059 and rapamycin, respectively, had little effect on the insulin stimulation of FAS promoter activity, wortmannin and LY294002, which inhibit PI 3-kinase, blocked the insulin stimulation of FAS promoter activity. Regulation of the endogenous FAS mRNA by insulin was also blocked by treating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with LY294002. Cotransfection of expression vectors encoding a constitutively active P110 subunit of PI 3-kinase resulted in elevated FAS promoter activity in the absence of insulin and a loss of insulin response of the FAS promoter. On the other hand, a dominant negative P85 subunit of PI 3-kinase inhibited FAS promoter activity and abolished insulin stimulation of the FAS promoter. Moreover, cotransfection of PKB/Akt stimulated FAS promoter activity in the absence of insulin to that comparable to the insulin-stimulated level. Acting in a dominant-inhibitory fashion, kinase-dead PKB/Akt inhibited FAS promoter activity in the presence and the absence of insulin. These data suggest that insulin regulation of FAS transcription is mediated by the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway and that PKB/Akt is involved as a downstream effector. DISCUSSIONWhen circulating insulin is high, there is an increase in lipogenesis in liver and adipose tissue. These processes occur in coordination with the increase in glucose uptake by peripheral tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue, with inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis, and so forth. Increase in lipogenesis is impaired when insulin is low, and administration of insulin restores the rate to its normal level. FAS is a key lipogenic enzyme, and insulin increases its activity dramatically, not through allosteric effectors or covalent modification but through changes in transcription (5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rapid and high level induction of the FAS gene by insulin makes FAS an excellent model for studying the transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes by insulin. Previously, we had defined the FAS insulin response sequence to the proximal promoter region at −68/−52 and had shown that USF binding to the E-box motif within this region is functionally required for insulin stimulation of FAS transcription. However, the signaling pathway(s) that leads to the increase in lipogenesis or the activation of lipogenic genes by insulin is not known. In this report, we provide evidence that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, but not the P70 S6 kinase nor the MAP kinase pathways, mediates the insulin effect on FAS transcription. Inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002) abolished the insulin stimulation of endogenous FAS mRNA (Fig. 2) as well as the transfected FAS promoter-reporter construct in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). Expression of the constitutively active P110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase resulted in the loss of insulin responsiveness of the FAS promoter at an elevated activity level (Fig. 3). Expression of the dominant negative P85 regulatory subunit also resulted in loss of insulin responsiveness of the FAS promoter, but at a repressed activity level (Fig. 4). Similar effects on the insulin responsiveness of FAS promoter were also observed when wild-type and kinase-dead (dominant negative) PKB/Akt were expressed, suggesting PKB/Akt is a downstream mediator of the insulin stimulation of the FAS transcription (Fig. 5). This is the first report, to our knowledge, that demonstrates the involvement of the PI 3-kinase and PKB/Akt signaling pathway in the transcriptional regulation of lipogenic genes. Our data, therefore, suggest that PI 3-kinase is not only involved in the stimulation of glucose transportation, glycogen synthesis, and inhibition of gluconeogenesis, but also in the stimulation of lipogenesis. It also suggests that the effect of PI 3-kinase is a major branching point of the insulin signaling pathways that exert the insulin effect at multiple levels of gene expression, including control of transcription (e.g. stimulation of FAS and inhibition of PEPCK), phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, and translocation of the GLUT4 transporter.

One property of a protein that leads to rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation is the presence of a basic, acidic, or bulky hydrophobic residue at its N terminus. However, in normal cells, substrates for this N-end rule pathway, which involves ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) E214k and ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) E3α, have remained unclear. Surprisingly, in soluble extracts of rabbit muscle, we found that competitive inhibitors of E3α markedly inhibited the125I-ubiquitin conjugation and ATP-dependent degradation of endogenous proteins. These inhibitors appear to selectively inhibit E3α, since they blocked degradation of125I-lysozyme, a model N-end rule substrate, but did not affect the degradation of proteins whose ubiquitination involved other E3s. The addition of several E2s or E3α to the muscle extracts stimulated overall proteolysis and ubiquitination, but only the stimulation by E3α or E214k was sensitive to these inhibitors. A similar general inhibition of ubiquitin conjugation to endogenous proteins was observed with a dominant negative inhibitor of E214k. Certain substrates of the N-end rule pathway are degraded after their tRNA-dependent arginylation. We found that adding RNase A to muscle extracts reduced the ATP-dependent proteolysis of endogenous proteins, and supplying tRNA partially restored this process.

Invest. 1997; 100: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Moreover, in skeletal muscle extracts, the Ub-proteasome system catalyzes the complete breakdown of most soluble proteins as well as of individual myofibrillar proteins that are very stable in vivo (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle comprises most of the body proteins in mammals. Consequently, overall rates of protein degradation in muscle are tightly regulated, and mobilization of muscle protein reserves is of particular importance in energy homeostasis. For example, in fasting this degradative process is accelerated to provide amino acids for hepatic gluconeogenesis (6Mitch W.E. Goldberg A.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 9Tawa N.E. Goldberg A.L. Engle A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology: Basic and Clinical. 2nd Ed.

Muscle proteolysis also rises in a number of disease states, including cancer cachexia, sepsis, and denervation atrophy and leads to rapid muscle atrophy, primarily through activation of the Ub-proteasome system (6Mitch W.E.

J. 1995; 307: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Proteins to be hydrolyzed by this system are first modified by covalent conjugation to the protein cofactor, Ub (1Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

The linkage of a protein to a chain of Ub moieties marks it for rapid ATP-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (15Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6065-6068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). In this system, the Ub is first activated by the Ub-activating enzyme (E1), which forms a Ub-thioester. The activated Ub is then transferred to one of the cell's many Ub carrier proteins (E2s) and subsequently to a polypeptide substrate in a reaction catalyzed by a specific Ub-protein ligase (E3), several of which have been identified. The specificity in this proteolytic pathway appears to depend on the nature of the E2s and E3s involved, many of which have been shown to catalyze the conjugation of Ub to specific short lived proteins (1Finley D.

However, for most of these ubiquitination enzymes, the basis of substrate selection is not clear, nor is it known which E2(s) or E3(s) ubiquitinate the bulk of cell proteins. One structural feature of a polypeptide that leads to its ubiquitination and degradation is the nature of its N-terminal residue (22Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 23Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wunning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16700-16712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown genetically in yeast that proteins with basic, acidic, or large hydrophobic N termini are ubiquitinated and degraded very rapidly, while the same proteins bearing other N-terminal residues, e.g. methionine, are stable (22Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 23Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wunning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16700-16712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between the identity of a protein's N-terminal residue and its half-life has been termed the N-end rule pathway and was also shown to function in mammalian cells (22Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 23Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wunning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3685-3690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies in reticulocytes have demonstrated that this selectivity is due to the Ub-protein ligase, E3α (Ubr1) and its cognate Ub carrier protein, E214k (26Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E3α contains two binding sites, one specific for proteins or peptides with basic N termini and the other for substrates with bulky hydrophobic N termini (23Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wunning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16700-16712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol.

Dipeptides and amino acid methyl esters with such N termini can bind to E3α and inhibit the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the corresponding protein substrates both in intact yeast cells and in extracts (22Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 23Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wunning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

In addition, proteins with acidic N-terminal residues are also degraded by this pathway after undergoing a specific arginyl-tRNA-dependent N-terminal arginylation, which triggers their ubiquitination by E3α (22Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 27Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15511-15517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these extensive findings, the physiological significance of the N-end rule pathway in vivo has long been unclear, and its importance has even been questioned (33Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants that lack this pathway (i.e. mutants in Ubc2, which encodes the yeast homologue of E214k, or in Ubr1, which encodes the yeast homologue of E3α) have only minor phenotypes (34Bartel B. Wunning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and efforts to identify substrates with destabilizing N termini or ones that undergo tRNA-dependent proteolysis have not succeeded thus far. We report here the unexpected finding that this ubiquitination system, involving E214k and E3α, as well as tRNA-dependent substrate modification, is responsible for up to 60% of the ATP-dependent degradation of soluble proteins in extracts of normal skeletal muscles. Ubiquitin, actin, myosin, bovine serum albumin, and human α-lactalbumin were from Sigma. Lysozyme was from Boehringer Mannheim. Radioiodination of protein substrates was performed by the chloramine T method as described previously (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The dominant negative inhibitor mutants of the E2s were kindly provided by Jackie Pierce, Margaret Read, and Vincent Chau (Proscript, Inc.).Escherichia coli strains engineered to express E214k, E2-F1 (UbcH7), and UbcH5b were kindly provided by S. Wing, M. Scheffner, and A. Weissman, respectively. Male New Zealand White rabbits (3–4 kg) were killed by lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital, and extracts from psoas muscles were prepared as described earlier (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to remove myofibrils. “Crude extracts” were prepared by centrifuging the supernatants at 100,000 × g for 1 h and were either studied directly or fractionated on DEAE-cellulose (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) into fraction II, the resin-bound material, which contains the proteasomes and most of the enzymes required for Ub conjugation, and fraction I, the flow-through, which contains Ub and 70% of cell proteins. Both crude extracts and fraction II were then dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 and 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C until use. E1 was prepared from rabbit muscle fraction II extract using Ub-Sepharose affinity chromatography by elution with AMP and PPi as described previously (35Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E1 was further purified by MonoQ FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). E214k was purified from E. coli fraction II by MonoQ FPLC and size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-100 HiPrep FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UbcH5b and E2-F1 were prepared directly from crude E. coli lysates using HiTrapS FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by Sephacryl S-100 HiPrep FPLC. Partially purified E3α was prepared from crude muscle extract using a protocol kindly provided by A. Haas and co-workers. 2R. Crinelli, O. V. Baboshina, and A. L. Haas, personal communication. Crude muscle extract (35 mg) was twice passed over a 1.0-ml E214k-Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) affinity column (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using 10 μmE214k and 5.0 ml of resin). The column was washed exhaustively with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, and then E3α was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT into tubes containing bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The material was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. Degradation of endogenous proteins in crude extracts and fraction II was measured by assaying the generation of free tyrosine in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble supernatant (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained the following in a volume of 100 μl: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmDTT, ATP regenerating system (10 μg of creatine phosphokinase and 10 mm creatine phosphate), 1 mm ATP, 25 μg of Ub, and approximately 1 mg of dialyzed crude extract or fraction II. Following incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and the amount of tyrosine generated in the supernatant was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy as described previously (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). When degradation of125I-myosin, 125I-actin, or125I-lysozyme in the crude extracts was studied, the reaction mixture contained 3 μg of labeled proteins, and their degradation was measured by following the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity using a γ-counter. The results shown are typical of those obtained in three independent experiments. The absolute amount of protein degraded in the absence or presence of ATP varied from extract to extract. To measure Ub conjugation in the crude muscle extracts, the dialyzed extracts (50 μg protein) were incubated in a 20-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mm AMP-PNP, 125I-Ub (∼150,000 cpm, 5–10 μm), 20 μg/ml bestatin (to block aminopeptidases), 20 μm MG132 (to block proteasomal activities), and 2 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (to inhibit the hydrolysis of ubiquitin conjugates by deubiquitinating isopeptidases (36Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 87: 1829-1833Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar)). For ubiquitination assays in fraction II, which lack endogenous ubiquitin, preparations were centrifuged for 6–8 h at 100,000 ×g to remove most of the proteasomes (37Hegde A.N. Goldberg A.L. Schwartz J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The supernatant (60 μg in a volume of 25 μl) was then incubated with125I-Ub (∼150,000 cpm, 5–10 μm) at 37 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATPγS, 20 μg/ml bestatin, and 5% glycerol in the absence or presence of the various inhibitors. All dipeptides and methyl esters were added at a concentration of 2 mm. All reactions were carried out in parallel under identical conditions. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Finally, equal amounts of125I-labeled proteins were loaded onto the gel, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) on 12% acrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. We reported previously that crude extracts of rabbit psoas muscle degrade endogenous proteins all the way to amino acids via the Ub-proteasome system as shown by the ATP-dependent generation of free tyrosine (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Because this amino acid cannot be synthesized or degraded by muscle, its appearance indicates the degradation of cell proteins (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This process occurred at a linear rate for 2 h at 37 °C, was stimulated 3–6-fold by ATP, and was blocked by removal or inhibition of proteasomes (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To test whether the N-end rule pathway contributes to this degradation of endogenous proteins, various competitive inhibitors of E3α were added to these muscle extracts. The addition of arginine methyl ester reduced the ATP-dependent degradation of soluble muscle proteins by about 50% (Table I). The inhibitor of the hydrophobic site of E3α, leucine methyl ester, also reduced proteolysis but to a lesser extent (30%). In contrast, alanine methyl ester, which does not inhibit E3α (24Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused little reduction (<10%) in the breakdown of muscle proteins. Similarly, the dipeptide inhibitor of E3α, Phe-Ala, also reduced ATP-stimulated degradation of endogenous proteins by 30%, but its isomer, Ala-Phe, had little effect on this process (<5% inhibition). There was also a low amount of ATP-independent proteolysis in these preparations, but it was not affected by these dipeptides or amino acid esters (data not shown). These observations suggest that a large fraction (perhaps 60–80%) of the ATP-dependent degradation of soluble proteins in crude muscle extracts involves E3α, the Ub-protein ligase of the N-end rule pathway.Table IInhibitors of the N-end rule pathway reduce the ATP-stimulated degradation of endogenous proteins in rabbit muscle extractsAdditions (2 mm)Inhibition of degradationCrudeFraction II%None00Arginine methyl ester5045Leucine methyl ester3025Alanine methyl ester105Phe-Ala3025Ala-Phe55RNase A25NARNase A pretreated with RNase inhibitor5NARNase A + RNase inhibitor + tRNA15NADNase I0NAAs indicated, the reaction mixtures included variousl-amino acid dipeptide or methyl ester inhibitors of E3α at 2 mm. To prevent hydrolysis of the added dipeptide, bestatin (20 μg/ml), an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, was added to all reaction mixtures, including controls. Bestatin alone reduced tyrosine production slightly (less than 20%). 100% proteolytic activity is the value measured in the absence of any inhibitors. Typically, crude extracts produced 150 pmol of tyrosine in the absence of ATP, 550 pmol in its presence, and for fraction II, 120 pmol of tyrosine was generated in the absence of ATP and 700 pmol in the presence of ATP and Ub in 2 h. The ATP-independent proteolysis was subtracted from all samples, and the results were normalized to 100%. The data on this ATP-independent process are not shown, since the addition of inhibitors had no effect on degradation in the absence of ATP and/or Ub. For the RNase A inhibition assay, the reaction mixtures were preincubated for 30 min with 0.02 units of RNase A (from bovine pancreas) prior to the addition of ATP and Ub. The concentration of bovine pancreas DNase I used was 5 units. The data shown in this and subsequent tables were obtained in a single experiment and are the averages of triplicate determinations, which agreed within 10%. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.NA, not assayed.The crude extract was preincubated with RNase A (0.02 units), and then excess human placental RNase inhibitor (0.05 units) was added to inactivate the nuclease.

Subsequently, tRNA from fetal calf liver (0.13 units) was added. A very similar effect of these inhibitors on proteolysis was seen after the extracts were fractionated by DEAE chromatography. Most cell proteins, including Ub, flow through the column (fraction I), but about 30% of cell proteins were bound and eluted with high salt. This material (fraction II) contains E1, E214k, E3α, and proteasomes (26Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fagan J.M.

Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ATP and Ub were added to fraction II, they stimulated the breakdown of endogenous proteins 3–5-fold (8Solomon V. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and as shown in Table I, most of the degradation of proteins in fraction II (like those in crude extracts) appears to involve E3α. This ATP- and Ub-stimulated degradation was inhibited when arginine methyl ester or Phe-Ala was added, while alanine methyl ester or Ala-Phe, which do not inhibit E3α, had very little effect (<5%) on proteolysis. In fact, the pattern of inhibition in fraction II with the dipeptide and methyl ester inhibitors of E3α was almost identical to that seen in crude extracts (Table I). Another type of substrate for the N-end rule pathway is proteins with acidic N-terminal residues. Genetic studies by Varshavsky (27Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and biochemical studies by Ferber and Ciechanover (28Ferber S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3128-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that such proteins are modified before degradation by covalent linkage of an arginine residue to their N terminus. This modification requires arginyl-tRNA and leads to rapid Ub conjugation by E3α (27Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2082739985,"Pax proteins are transcriptional regulators controlling a variety of cell fates during animal development. This role depends on the intact function of the paired (Prd) domain that is able to recognize specific DNA sequences. The Prd domain is composed of two distinct helix-turn-helix subdomains, PAI and RED. Molecular functions of Pax proteins are subjected to different levels of regulation involving both pre-translational and post-translational mechanisms. By using Pax-5 and Pax-8 recombinant proteins, we demonstrate that the binding activity of the Prd domain is regulated through the oxidation/reduction of conserved cysteine residues. Mass spectrometry analysis and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the redox regulation is accomplished through the reversible formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge involving the cysteines present in the PAI subdomain, whereas the RED subdomain appears quite insensitive to redox potential. Circular dichroism experiments indicate that only the reduced form of the Prd domain is able to undergo the proper conformational change necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding. Nuclear extracts from different cell lines contain an activity that is able to reduce the Paired domain and, therefore, to control the DNA binding activity of this protein. Immunodepletion of nuclear extracts demonstrate that the protein Ref-1 contributes to the redox regulation of the Prd DNA binding activity. Given the modular nature of the Prd domain and the independent DNA binding specificity of the PAI and RED subdomains, we propose that this control mechanism should be involved in “switching” among different DNA sequences and therefore different target genes.

Hallonet M. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Pax proteins are defined by the presence of the paired domain, a 128-amino acid-long evolutionary conserved DNA-binding region (6Bopp D. Burri M. Baumgertner S. Frigerio G. Noll M.

The spatio-temporally restricted expression pattern of these proteins controls a variety of developmental decisions and, in adult life, contributes to the maintenance of differentiation state of several cell types (8Busslinger M.

Some developmental functions of Pax proteins are conserved through evolution; for instance, the human PAX-6 is a master control gene for eye development in Drosophila, just as its flyeyeless homologous (13Halder G. Callaerts P. Gehring W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Mutations of Pax genes give rise to abnormal phenotypes in mice and corresponding diseases in humans (5Mansouri A. Hallonet M. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Moreover, structural abnormalities or mis-expression may play a role in the generation or progression of human tumors (14Stuart E.T. Kioussi C. Aguzzi A. Gruss P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1994; 1: 207-214Google Scholar, 15Dressler G.R. Douglass E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 16Poleev A. Fickenscher H.

Harris E. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 19Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch U. Goulding M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This region functionally consists of two distinct subdomains and recognizes specific DNA sequences (20Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 21Epstein J. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The resolution of the crystal structure of the Prd1 domain of the Drosophila paired protein bound to a target DNA sequence confirmed the presence of two structurally distinct and independent subdomains (named PAI and RED, see Ref. 22Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both containing a helix-turn-helix motif joined by a linker region (23Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The presence of these distinct structural regions allows the Prd domain to recognize DNA sequences by using different binding modes. The Prd domain can bind as a monomer when it uses only the PAI subdomain or as a cooperation between the two subdomains (22Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing may inactivate the binding function of the PAI domain; in this case, DNA sequences are recognized only through the RED subdomain, with oligomers of the protein assembled on a single DNA molecule (21Epstein J. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 24Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because of these different binding modes, Prd domains can recognize seemingly divergent sequences (20Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 22Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S.

J. 1996; 315: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).The biological effects of Pax genes are linearly related to the amounts of the functional protein products. For example, both in humans and in mice, abnormalities due to PAX-6 mutations are semidominant; whereas the eye phenotype is more severe in the homozygous state, several abnormalities are evident also in the heterozygous state (26Hanson I. Van Heyningen V. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 268-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, increasing the Pax-6 gene dosage in mice elicits also severe eye abnormalities (27Schedl A. Ross A. Lee M. Engelkamp D. Rashbarn P. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that functional levels of Pax proteins are so strictly poised that even minor changes in the equilibrium state may give rise to a severe perturbation of the biological system. In turn, the functional activity of Pax proteins could be a sensitive switch to regulate cell function. Such a view predicts that either expression or molecular functions of Pax proteins could be the target of regulatory events. In the B cell lineage, for example, the transition from mature B cell to plasma cell is associated to a great reduction of Pax-5 gene expression (28Barberis A. Widenhorn L. Vitelli L. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, thyrotropin (TSH), the chief regulator of the follicular thyroid cell functions, increasesPax-8 steady-state mRNA and protein levels in several follicular thyroid cell models 2D. Fabbro, L. Pellizzari, F. Mercuri, and G. Damante, submitted for publication.2D. Fabbro, L. Pellizzari, F. Mercuri, and G. Damante, submitted for publication. (see also Ref.29Van Renterghem P. Vassart G. Christophe D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In the past few years it became evident that oxygen free radicals and their by-products, collectively referred as reactive oxygen species (ROS), may influence gene expression (30Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Also the activity of several transcription factors is controlled by ROS; the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) are clear examples of this regulation (31Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar). In the first case the ROS effects appear to be mediated by reduction/oxidation of a cysteine residue, located in the highly conserved Rel homology domain, that allows DNA binding only in the reduced state (32Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The reduction/oxidation state of a single conserved cysteine regulates also the AP-1 DNA binding activity (33Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the redox potential controls the Pax-8-induced transcriptional activation of the thyroglobulin promoter (34Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the DNA binding activity of the paired domain could also be subjected to redox regulation. The aim of the present work was to test whether the redox potential can regulate the DNA binding function of the Prd domain. Our data demonstrate that the paired domain of Pax-8 and Pax-5 can recognize several DNA sequences only following a treatment with reducing agents. This effect occurs through the reduction of intramolecular disulfide bridges. The DNA binding function of the PAI subdomain is extremely sensitive to redox regulation, whereas the activity of the RED subdomain is unaffected. Therefore, the redox regulation may switch the DNA binding modes of Pax proteins. In addition we observed that nuclear extracts of several cell lines contain a temperature-sensitive activity able to mimic the effects of reducing agents.DISCUSSIONPax genes are important regulators of developmental pathways, and in adult life, they hold a prominent role in the maintenance of differentiation state of several cell types (5Mansouri A. Hallonet M. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because of the central role that these genes play in differentiation and development, it may be expected that Pax genes are subjected to several levels of regulation. It has been recently demonstrated that alternative splicing for some of these genes, i.e. Pax-6 (21Epstein J. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), Pax-8 (24Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), Pax-3, and Pax-7 (51Vogan K.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6677-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), could give rise to protein isoforms with quite different DNA binding specificities. Alternative splicing, if regulated, could represent a potential mechanism to switch among a subset of different target genes. Besides this pre-translational control, additional forms of regulation could be achieved by post-translational mechanisms, such as phosphorylation (52Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 53Hoeffler W.K. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the last few years increasing evidence suggested that redox potential can be considered a useful mechanism able to modify the DNA binding activity of transcription factors (33Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 55Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Akamatsu Y. Ohno T. Hirota K. Kagoshima H. Yodoi J. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14497-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 57Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the transcriptional function of Pax-8 protein is subjected to redox regulation (34Kambe F. Nomura Y. Okamoto T. Seo H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 801-812PubMed Google Scholar); this event has a physiological relevance since TSH is able to up-regulate the Pax-8 binding activity by reducing the oxidized form of Pax-8 protein pre-existing in FRTL-5 cells. Here, we demonstrate that this regulation occurs through the oxidation/reduction of conserved Cys residues in the Pax-8 Prd domain. The binding activity of Pax-5 is similarly controlled, suggesting that redox potential may control the function of the whole set of Pax proteins.The Prd domain is a bipartite DNA-binding region comprising the PAI and RED subdomains (23Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) which are able, per se, to recognize different DNA sequences3 (see also Ref. 24Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The PAI subdomain contains two conserved Cys residues, one of which, Cys-49, is believed to establish specific contacts with base pairs (23Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assays, here described for Pax-5 and Pax-8 Prd domain, clearly demonstrated that binding to the corresponding DNA targets is extremely sensitive to redox conditions. MALDI-MS analysis of the Pax-8 construct showed that Cys-49, which can form a disulfide bridge with either Cys-37 or Cys-109, is highly oxidizable, thus accounting for the loss of DNA binding activity. Furthermore, EMSA experiments on the separated PAI and RED subdomains demonstrated that although the binding activity of the PAI subdomain was heavily subjected to redox potential control, the RED subdomain activity was unaffected by the oxidizing environment. This insensitivity could be due to two, not mutually exclusive, reasons as follows: (i) Cys-109 does not establish contacts with DNA and/or its redox state does not influence other DNA-contacting residues; (ii) the protein molecules, in which the Cys-37 to Cys-49 disulfide bridge occurs, still present the Cys-109 in the reduced state.MALDI-MS analysis did not allow the quantitative measurement of the relative abundance of the Cys-37 to Cys-49 or of the Cys-49 to Cys-109 S–S bridges in the samples. However, theoretical analysis indicates that the former disulfide bridge is more favored compared with the latter. In fact, the reactivity of a cysteine residue is enhanced by the neighboring basic amino acids through the formation of a thiol-anion base pair (58Kallis G.B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10261-10265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretical isoelectric local points calculation (pI) of the peptides surrounding cysteine residues in Prd domain predicts a very low reactivity for Cys-109 (local pI = 2.8), in comparison to either Cys-37 (local pI = 8.9) or Cys-49 (local pI = 8.9). The binding phenotype of the C37S mutant demonstrates the relevance of the Cys-37 to Cys-49 disulfide bridge controlling the Prd domain. Since the redox potential controls the binding activity of the PAI subdomain but not that of the RED subdomain, changes in the redox potential could act as a switch between a DNA binding mode in which the PAI subdomain is involved to a DNA binding mode based only on the activity of the RED subdomain. A similar molecular genetic “switch” has been demonstrated for the OxyR-controlled regulon of hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes in Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli (57Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A conformational change of OxyR, upon direct oxidation of the protein induced by exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide, leads to unleash its transcriptional activating potential. This regulation goes through a reversible intrachain disulfide bond formation between two Cys residues (59Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The conformational change allows OxyR to interact with the same promoters (oxyr, katG, and ahpC) in different manners. For example, the OxyR protein can function both as an activator (reduced form) or as a repressor (oxidized form) in regulating its own expression through the binding of the oxyr promoter (57Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar).CD experiments have established that the oxidized state of the cysteine residues in the Prd domain induced structural variations leading to an interference with the proper conformation useful for DNA binding. Thus, the redox state of these residues controls the Prd domain potential in undergoing the conformational switch necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding. Also for the tumor suppressor protein p53, redox changes could influence the biological activity by modulating its DNA binding activity through effects on protein conformation. More specifically, reduction of thiols favors the tertiary folding of p53 in a form permissive for DNA binding (60Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings have been described for the oncoprotein Myb (61Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); the redox state of a unique cysteine residue (Cys-43) could function as a molecular sensor for a redox regulatory turning on-off specific DNA binding. Here, we propose that the redox potential could not simply turn on-off the binding activity of Pax proteins, but it would control subsets of target genes subjected to the regulation of Pax gene products. In the reduced state, Pax proteins would regulate transcriptional units in which sequences recognized by the PAI subdomain are present; in the oxidized state the effect of Pax proteins would be directed to transcriptional units in which the RED subdomain is sufficient for binding.The cells realize efficient production of ATP mainly through the glucose oxidation. However, this event leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2, O⨪2, and ⋅OH radicals, that are by-products in electron transport processes into the mitochondria. To protect themselves from the harmful effect of oxygen, cells use primarily two defense mechanisms, the enzymatic systems of catalase and superoxide dismutase, and the glutathione and TRX systems, which contribute to create an intracellular reducing environment. Therefore, through the induction of antioxidant systems, ROS constitute a useful tuning device for signal transduction. It is well established that the redox state affects cell growth and several differentiated functions by modulating signaling pathways activated by cell-surface receptors. This is the case of the cascades induced by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1β (31Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar). Besides endogenous oxidative stress generated metabolically in multicellular organisms, cells are exposed to oxidative stresses originated from other tissues as well as from neighboring cells. For example, the lymphocytes are exposed to oxidative stress when they migrate in inflammatory regions where oxidants are generated by neutrophils and other phagocytic cells in the processes accompanying phagocytosis. This observation seems particularly interesting in the case of Pax-5, which is the only Pax gene that plays a primary role in lymphoid tissue. During maturation of B cell, this gene's results are completely turned off when the mature B cell transforms to plasma cell (28Barberis A. Widenhorn L. Vitelli L. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Finally, a series of investigations have established that TSH is able to induce the production of H2O2 that is essential in the iodination and in the coupling reactions for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (62Bjorkman U. Ekholm R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 63Kimura T. Okajima F. Sho K. Kobayashi I. Kondo Y. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The finding that TSH increases the DNA binding activity of Pax-8 through a redox mechanism reinforces the hypothesis that ROS may serve as common intracellular signals in specific tissues (30Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 64Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar).

Insulin caused a rapid time- and dose-dependent induction of MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression. Blockade of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) withN G-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate, and cGMP with RpcGMP, completely inhibited MKP-1 expression. Insulin-mediated MKP-1 expression was preceded by inducible NOS (iNOS) induction and cGMP production. Blockade of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling with wortmannin inhibited insulin-mediated iNOS protein induction, cGMP production, and MKP-1 expression. To evaluate potential interactions between NOS and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, we employed PD98059 and SB203580, two specific inhibitors of ERKs and p38 MAPK. These inhibitors abolished the effect of insulin on MKP-1 expression. Only PD98059 inhibited insulin-mediated iNOS protein induction. Vascular smooth muscle cells from spontaneous hypertensive rats exhibited a marked decrease in MKP-1 induction due to defects in insulin-induced iNOS expression because of reductions in PI3-kinase activity. Treatment with sodium nitroprusside and 8-bromo-cGMP restored MKP-1 mRNA expression to levels comparable with controls. We conclude that insulin-induced MKP-1 expression is mediated by PI3-kinase-initiated signals, leading to the induction of iNOS and elevated cGMP levels that stimulates MKP-1 expression.

ERK, extracellular regulated kinase c- jun amino-terrminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase. Intracellular signaling following stimulation by insulin, other growth factors, tumor promoters, cytokines, osmotic shock, and stress involves the initiation of one or more phosphorylation cascades leading to the rapid and reversible activation of a family of ubiquitous, well characterized serine/threonine kinases known collectively as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs,1 1–4). MAPKs play a major role in regulating cellular events required for cell growth, differentiation, and cell homeostasis (1Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 2Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Full activation of MAPKs requires phosphorylation on critical tyrosine and threonine residues. Several upstream dual-specificity kinases catalyzing this modification have been identified (6Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Once activated, these kinases are responsible for the activation and phosphorylation of additional kinases as well as a battery of regulatory proteins, including transcription factors required for the expression of genes involved in cell growth and/or differentiation (6Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). The activities of all the three members of the MAPK family are regulated by reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues, indicating that protein phosphatases play a critical role in controlling enzyme activity. Recent studies indicate that inactivation or attenuation of MAPK signaling is mediated by a class of dual specificity protein phosphatases (7Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Keyse S. Emsile E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). These include MKP-1 (also known as CL100, Erp, and hVH-1, which is encoded by murine gene,3ch134 (9Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MKP-2, MKP-3, PAC-1, and B23 (10Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). MKP-1, the most ubiquitously expressed and best studied of these phosphatases, has dual catalytic activity toward phosphotyrosine- and phosphothreonine-containing proteins and is known to inactivate ERKs, JNK, and p38HOG in vivo as well as in vitro (7Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). MKP-1 and the other family members are principally regulated at the transcriptional level as evidenced by very low to undetectable mRNA expression in quiescent cells and a rapid induction upon treatment of cells with growth factors, as well as agents that cause oxidative stress and heat shock (7Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

MKP-1 has been implicated in a feedback loop serving to inactivate MAPK after stimulation by mitogens as well as during the cellular response to stress (7Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Bernstein K.E Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a function for this phosphatase in response to insulin or IGF-1 has not been established in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Hypertension is frequently associated with insulin-resistant states such as diabetes and obesity (14Reaven G.M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 15DeFranzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4196) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms linking hypertension with insulin resistance are not clear. VSMCs are a major constituent of blood vessel walls responsible for the maintenance of vascular tone (16Vinters H.V. Berliner J.A. Diabete & Metab. 1987; 13: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar). Accelerated VSMC growth, hypertrophy, and abnormal vascular tone play a central role in the development of hypertension (17Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4027) Google Scholar, 18Stout R.W. Eur. J. Epidemiol. 1992; 8: 134-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although alterations in insulin action of the vasculature have been proposed to contribute to atherosclerosis and the regulation of vascular tone, little is known about the pathways of insulin signaling that control vascular tone and cell growth or the mechanism of their regulation in VSMCs. Elegant studies by Baron and co-workers (19Steinberg H.O. Brechtel G. Johnson A. Fineberg N. Baron A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin is a potent vasodilator, and this effect of insulin is mediated by nitric oxide (NO, see Ref. 19Steinberg H.O. Brechtel G. Johnson A. Fineberg N. Baron A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). NO is also known to influence the growth of VSMCs. However, the mechanism of NO action remains unclear. We have recently shown that confluent primary cultures of VSMCs isolated from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibit increased responsiveness to insulin in terms of MAPK activation and DNA synthesis (20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether the observed increase in MAPK activation in SHR is due to defective regulation of MKP-1 mRNA induction resulting from alterations in intracellular insulin signaling pathways that mediate MKP-1 expression or unstable MKP-1 mRNA. In this study, in order to gain insight into potential mechanisms linking insulin signal transduction with hypertension, we examined the kinetics of MKP-1 induction by insulin and evaluated the contribution of PI3-kinase, nitric oxide, and cGMP signaling pathway(s) in insulin regulation of MKP-1 expression using primary cultures of VSMCs isolated from SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The results of this study indicate that insulin increases MKP-1 mRNA expression in VSMCs mainly via the PI3-kinase/NO-cGMP signaling pathway, and the observed defects in MKP-1 expression in SHR are due to defective PI3-kinase/NOS signaling leading to reductions in cGMP which may mediate MKP-1 gene expression. Minimal essential medium-α, fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics, trypsin, l-glutamine, and freezing medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., α-[32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol), τ-[33P]ATP (specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol), and125I-protein A were purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

Wortmannin, Rp-8 CPT-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (RpcGMP), 8-bromo cGMP,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate (l-NMMA), PD98059, and SB203580 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses reagents were from Bio-Rad. Rat MKP-1 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Jyotirmoy Kusari (Tulane University, New Orleans). Phosphatidylinositol and all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from the Sigma. The cGMP assay kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The nitric oxide Griess reaction assay kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. VSMCs in primary culture were obtained by enzymatic digestion of the aortic media of male normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) of 200–220 g body weight, as described in our recent publication (20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcultures of VSMCs from passages 3–5 were used in all the experiments. VSMCs prepared from the two strains of rats were not contaminated with fibroblasts or endothelial cells as evidenced by >99% positive immunostaining of smooth muscle α-actin with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-actin antibody (Sigma). All experiments on MKP-1 induction, nitric oxide, and cGMP generation were performed on highly confluent cells (9–11 days in culture) at identical passages. Prior to each experiment, cells were serum-starved for 24–48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing antibiotics. Confluent serum-starved VSMCs from WKY and SHR were treated with and without insulin (0–1000 nm) or IGF-1 (10 nm) for 0–60 min. In some experiments, VSMCs were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min followed by insulin for 10–60 min. RNA was extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit as per the manufacturer's instructions and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260/280 nm. Equal amounts of RNA (10 μg/lane) were separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled MKP-1 cDNA, and detected by autoradiography by standard protocols (21Kaufman P.B. Wu W. Kim D. Cseke L.J. Handbook of Molecular and Cellular Methods in Biology and Medicine. CRC Press Inc., London1995: 65-86Google Scholar). The membrane was stripped by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min in 1% SDS and reprobed with either β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The MKP-1 mRNA and β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expressions were quantitated by densitometric analyses of the autoradiograms. The MKP-1 mRNA was normalized with respect to β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Immunodetection of MKP-1 and iNOS proteins in control and insulin-treated VSMCs was performed by Western blot analyses as described in our recent publications (22Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Begum N. Ragolia L. J. Biol.

Briefly, 20–50 μg of cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (22Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with anti-MKP-1 antibody and anti-iNOS antibody according to the manufacturer's protocols. Visualization of the primary antibody was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence. cGMP was extracted from control and insulin-treated VSMCs by treatment with 75% aqueous ethanol. The ethanol extracts were sonicated on ice, centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants dried. The dried samples were reconstituted in cGMP assay buffer and acetylated according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by measurement of cGMP using a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cGMP levels were expressed as picomoles/mg of protein. Serum-starved VSMCs were stimulated with insulin (0–1000 nm) for 1–30 min. The cells were quickly rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm vanadate and dropped in liquid nitrogen. The frozen dishes were thawed and the cells lysed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (22Begum N.

Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates normalized to 200 μg of protein were performed overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-rabbit IRS-1 antibody directed against the plextrin homology domain (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The immunocomplexes were precipitated the next day by incubation with 50 μl of protein G plus/protein A-agarose beads (50% v/v, Calbiochem). The immunoprecipitates were washed exhaustively with buffers, and PI3-kinase activity was assayed in the immunoprecipitates as described previously (26Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography on oxalate-treated Silica Gel 60 plates in a solvent of chloroform:methanol:water:ammonia (60:47:12.5:2). Cold phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was used as a standard and visualized by iodine vapor. The 33P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3-P was identified by autoradiography and quantitated by cut and count technique. Proteins in the cellular extracts and lysates were quantitated by bicinchoninic acid (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) or by the Bradford technique (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The results are presented as means ± S.E. of four to six independent experiments each performed in triplicate at different times. Unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance was used to compare the mean values among WKY and SHR. Ap value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To understand the mechanism of sustained MAPK activation in SHR, we examined the effect of insulin on MKP-1 induction. As seen in Fig. 1 A, low levels of MKP-1 mRNA are expressed in VSMCs in the basal state in both WKY and SHR. Insulin as well as IGF-1 treatment for 30 min caused a 100% increase over basal levels in MKP-1 mRNA expression in WKY. In contrast, VSMCs from SHR exhibited a lower basal as well as a significant reduction in insulin/IGF-1-mediated MKP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1). Kinetic analyses of MKP-1 mRNA induction in VSMCs treated with insulin revealed a 2.5-fold increase after 10 min in WKY (Fig. 2 A). The stimulation was sustained for 30 min with a return toward basal levels in 60 min. The time course of MKP-1 mRNA induction by insulin is comparable with the previously reported kinetics with 10% FBS and angiotensin II (13Duff J.L. Marrero M.B. Paxttton W.G. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Bernstein K.E Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although VSMCs from SHR exhibited an approximate 2-fold increase in MKP-1 mRNA induction over the basal levels after 10 min of insulin treatment, the stimulation was not sustained for longer periods. This may be due to instability of the message. Over all a 50–70% reduction in insulin-stimulated MKP-1 mRNA expression was observed in SHR at all time points studied when compared with WKY (Fig. 2 A). The insulin effect on MKP-1 mRNA expression was concentration-dependent with a maximum response seen between 1 and 10 nm insulin and the effect sustained up to 100 nm insulin (Fig. 2 B). Higher concentrations of insulin (above 100 nm) appear to inhibit MKP-1 mRNA expression. VSMCs isolated from SHR exhibit resistance to insulin at all concentrations tested. Western blot analyses of MKP-1 protein accumulation 1 h after insulin treatment revealed a dose-dependent increase in MKP-1 protein over the basal levels in WKY, whereas MKP-1 induction in SHR in response to insulin was markedly decreased (Fig. 2 C). Treatment with 10 μg/ml IGF-1 receptor antibody (α-IR3) did not abolish the effects of insulin on MKP-1 induction (data not shown). This observation together with the fact that low concentrations of insulin induce MKP-1 expression suggest that insulin mediates MKP-1 expression through interaction with its own receptor rather than the IGF-1 receptor.Figure 2A, kinetics of insulin-induced MKP-1 mRNA expression.

Invest. 1995; 96: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the role of PI3-kinase and NO signaling pathway in insulin-induced MKP-1 expression. The signaling through these pathways was blocked by pretreatment of VSMCs with selective inhibitors of PI3-kinase, NOS, and cGMP, the downstream effector of NOS. Incubation of VSMCs with 1) 100 nm wortmannin, a selective PI3-kinase inhibitor, 2) 1 mml-NMMA, a potent NOS inhibitor, and 3) 100 μm RpcGMP, a cGMP antagonist, for 30 min prior to insulin exposure resulted in a complete loss of the stimulatory effect of insulin on MKP-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3–5 withlane 2). Furthermore, 100 nm sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the NO donor as well as 100 μm8-bromo-cGMP, a cGMP agonist, mimicked the effect of insulin on MKP-1 induction (Fig. 3, compare lanes 7 and 8 withlane 2). Treatment of VSMCs with 100 nm insulin together with SNP or 8-bromo-cGMP did not cause an additive effect on MKP-1 expression (Fig. 3, compare lanes 6 and 9with lane 2). More importantly, the magnitude of MKP-1 induction in response to 100 nm SNP (the NO donor) and cGMP agonist (a downstream effector of NOS) was comparable between WKY and SHR (see Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that defects in NO generation because of defective NOS may be responsible for the observed impairment in insulin-mediated induction of MKP-1 in SHR. As expected, inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation by pretreatment with erbstatin A or herbimycin completely blocked the subsequent effect of insulin on MKP-1 mRNA expression (data not shown). NOS inhibitor and cGMP antagonist did not block FBS-induced MKP-1 expression, suggesting that multiple signaling pathways may be involved in MKP-1 expression. Both the inhibitors also caused a modest decrease in basal expression of MKP-1 mRNA (data not shown). VSMCs express inducible form of NOS (iNOS, see Ref. 33Busse R. Mulsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the NO signaling pathway in insulin-mediated MKP-1 induction and to identify potential defects in this pathway in SHR further, we measured the kinetics of iNOS protein induction and cGMP generation in insulin-stimulated VSMCs. As seen in Fig. 4 A, insulin caused a rapid time-dependent increase in iNOS protein expression in WKY (2–3-fold increase over basal levels). Maximal increase in iNOS protein expression was observed after 5 min, and the effect was sustained for 30 min and returned to basal levels after 1 h. In contrast, VSMCs from SHR were resistant to insulin as evidenced by a lack of insulin-induced iNOS protein expression (Fig. 4 A). Inhibition of PI3-kinase with wortmannin blocked the stimulatory effect of insulin on iNOS protein expression in WKY (Fig. 4 B). Insulin-mediated iNOS protein induction was accompanied by a time-dependent increase in cGMP levels. A >3-fold increase in cellular cGMP levels was observed after 10 min of exposure to insulin with a return to basal levels in 60 min (Fig. 5 A). VSMCs from SHR exhibited a 40% reduction in basal cGMP levels and a marked impairment (>80%) in cGMP production in response to insulin when compared with WKY (Fig. 5, A and B). However, SNP-induced cGMP production was comparable between WKY and SHR (Fig. 5 B). This confirms that the defect in SHR is at the level of NO production and not due to defective guanylylcyclase activity. Inhibition of PI3-kinase with wortmannin and iNOS with l-NMMA completely prevented insulin-mediated cGMP production (Fig. 5 B). Wortmannin and LNMMA did not block SNP mediated cGMP production (data not shown). Our results on the inhibitory effects of wortmannin on insulin-mediated MKP-1 and iNOS induction suggested that PI3-kinase signaling may mediate the effects of insulin on iNOS induction, cGMP production, and MKP-1 expression. To evaluate further whether insulin differentially activates PI3-kinase in WKY and SHR, we measured PI3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. As seen in Fig. 6, A and B, insulin rapidly stimulates IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types. In WKY, 10–100 nm insulin caused a 2–3-fold increase in IRS-1 associated PI-3 kinase activity. A maximal stimulation (>6 fold over basal) of IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase was observed with 1000 nminsulin. When compared with WKY, SHR exhibited 50–70% decrease in PI3-kinase activity at all insulin concentrations tested, although fold activation over basal value was comparable between the two cell types. A number of recent studies in different cell types suggest that MKP-1 induction is regulated by MAPK family members (7Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,34Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol.

Therefore, to evaluate the potential contribution of MAPK signaling pathway in insulin-mediated iNOS and MKP-1 induction, cells were pretreated with PD98059 (a specific MEK inhibitor to inhibit ERKs, Ref. 20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38HOG MAPK, for 30 min followed by insulin exposure for 30 min. The induction of iNOS protein and MKP-1 mRNA was examined. As seen in Fig. 7, A and B, PD98059 completely blocked insulin-mediated expression of iNOS and prevented the subsequent effect of insulin on MKP-1 expression. As reported in our recent publication (20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in addition to the observed inhibition of iNOS and MKP-1, PD98059 also blocked growth stimulatory effects of insulin in VSMCs by inhibiting insulin-mediated MAPK activation (20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SB203580, a p38HOG kinase inhibitor, did not affect insulin-induced iNOS but inhibited MKP-1 expression to below basal levels (Fig. 7 B). These observations together with the fact that insulin does not affect p38HOG MAPK activity suggest that ERKs may regulate NOS and MKP-1 induction, but the other MAPK family members may coordinate with ERKs in regulating MKP-1 using additional unidentified signaling pathways. The results presented in this study clearly indicate that low concentrations of insulin rapidly induce MKP-1 mRNA and protein expression in VSMCs. The insulin-induced MKP-1 mRNA expression appears to be transient with a return toward basal levels within 60 min. The time course of MKP-1 induction by insulin parallels our recently reported kinetics of MAPK inactivation in VSMCs isolated from WKY (20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, MKP-1 may act as an inhibitory feedback signal in attenuating MAPK signaling in VSMCs. Several lines of evidence presented in this study suggest that MKP-1 induction by insulin in VSMCs is mediated via PI3-kinase-initiated NOS-cGMP signaling pathway. First, inhibition of PI3-kinase with wortmannin blocked insulin-mediated iNOS, cGMP, as well as MKP-1 mRNA induction. Second, blockade of NOS activity withl-NMMA inhibited the effect of insulin on MKP-1 mRNA induction. Third, treatment with RpcGMP, a cGMP antagonist, prevented insulin-induced MKP-1 mRNA expression. Finally, treatment with cGMP agonist, 8-bromo-cGMP, as well as SNP, a NO donor, mimicked the effect of insulin on MKP-1. Moreover, the effects of SNP, 8-bromo-cGMP, and insulin were not additive. More importantly, the NOS-cGMP signaling pathway appears to be dependent upon MAPK signaling as inhibition of ERKs completely blocks iNOS induction by insulin. These results suggest a complex cross-talk between ERKs and NOS-signaling pathway. In contrast to WKY, VSMCs from SHR exhibit a marked insulin resistance in terms of MKP-1 induction. The observed impairment in insulin-induced MKP-1 expression may be responsible for the sustained MAPK activation and increased cell growth observed by us in VSMCs isolated from SHR (see Ref. 20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate insulin-mediated expression of MKP-1 mRNA in VSMCs and its abnormal induction in hypertension. Other studies have demonstrated induction of MKP-1 by FBS, AII, and platelet-derived growth factor (13Duff J.L. Marrero M.B. Paxttton W.G. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Bernstein K.E Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies by Lai et al. (37Lai K. Wang H. Lee W.S. Jain M.K. Lee M.N. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1560-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that balloon injury of rat carotid artery was accompanied by a marked decrease in MKP-1 mRNA expression, whereas p44 MAPK activity was increased. The results presented in this study add a new dimension to the observations that sustained MAPK activation seen in hypertension and atherosclerosis may be due to inherent reductions in MKP-1 mRNA expression resulting from defective regulation of MKP-1 gene expression in response to insulin and IGF-1. These observations led us to examine the precise intracellular insulin signal transduction pathway(s) that mediate MKP-1 expression. Given the knowledge that insulin acts as a potent vasodilator and increases the production of NO in endothelial cells (38Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), we examined the contribution of the NO signaling pathway in insulin-mediated MKP-1 expression in VSMCs. In the initial studies, we observed that incubation of VSMCs with low concentrations of SNP, an exogenous NO donor, rapidly induced MKP-1 mRNA expression. The effects of SNP and insulin were not additive. Furthermore, inhibition of NOS signaling by treatment of VSMCs with l-NMMA, a potent NOS inhibitor, completely blocked insulin-induced MKP-1 expression. In addition, blockade of cGMP, a downstream effector of NOS signaling by treatment with RpcGMP, a cGMP antagonist, prevented insulin-induced MKP-1 expression. These preliminary results suggested that NOS signaling pathway may play a significant role in insulin-mediated MKP-1 expression. Further confirmation of the role of NOS/cGMP signaling in insulin-mediated MKP-1 expression came from studies demonstrating a rapid induction of iNOS protein by insulin. The insulin effect on iNOS was accompanied by a rapid increase in cellular cGMP levels. Pretreatment of VSMCs with the NOS inhibitor, l-NMMA, completely blocked cGMP production and MKP-1 expression. Treatment of VSMCs with 8-bromo-cGMP, a cGMP agonist, also mimicked the effect of insulin on MKP-1 expression and bypassed the inhibitory effects ofl-NMMA. The effects of cGMP and insulin on MKP-1 expression were not synergistic. These results clearly indicate that the NOS/cGMP signaling pathway may play a dominant role in insulin-mediated MKP-1 expression. In support of our observations, studies by Sugimotoet al. (39Sugimoto T. Haneda M. Togawa M. Isono M. Shikano T. Araki S. Nakagawa T. Kashiwagi A. Guan K.L. Kikkawa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 544-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicate that atrial natriuretic peptide, a potent vasorelaxing factor, inhibits MAPK activation and cell proliferation by inducing MKP-1 via activation of guanylate cyclase. The inducible form of NOS is the predominant isoform of the NOS family of proteins that is expressed in VSMCs (40Bakris G.L. Standley P.R. Palant C.E. Walsh M.F. Sowers J.R. Sowers J.R. Endocrinology of the Vasculature. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 341-355Crossref Google Scholar), although recent studies suggest that VSMCs may express constitutive endothelial NOS as well (40Bakris G.L. Standley P.R. Palant C.E. Walsh M.F. Sowers J.R. Sowers J.R. Endocrinology of the Vasculature. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 341-355Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study we observed that induction of iNOS protein was rapid upon treatment with insulin and the protein levels return to basal values in 1 h, suggesting a rapid turnover. To understand further the mechanism whereby insulin regulates NOS/cGMP signaling in VSMCs, we examined the contribution of the PI3-kinase pathway in insulin-mediated iNOS induction. Insulin caused a rapid time- and dose-dependent increase in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity. Treatment with wortmannin, a potent PI3-kinase inhibitor, completely blocked PI3-kinase activation by insulin and inhibited the induction of iNOS, cGMP production, and MKP-1 mRNA expression. Studies by Zheng and Quon (38Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) in human vascular endothelial cells suggested that PI3-kinase may participate in the vasodilatory effects of insulin by increasing the production of NO. In addition to MKP-1 induction, PI3-kinase activation is required for MAPK activation and cell growth as wortmannin blocked the stimulatory of insulin on MAPK activation and mitogenesis (20Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears from the current study as well as from our previous results that insulin-mediated PI3-kinase activation leads to activation of distinct signal transduction pathways that mediate MAPK activation and cell growth as well as MKP-1 induction to terminate MAPK signaling. VSMCs from SHR exhibited marked reductions in PI3-kinase activity, iNOS induction, and cGMP production in response to insulin. However, the effects of cGMP agonist and SNP on MKP-1 induction were preserved in SHR. These observations suggest that the impaired induction of MKP-1 in SHR is due to defects upstream of NO, at the level of PI3-kinase/NOS signaling. Several studies using NIH3T3 fibroblasts and other cell types indicate that MKP-1 induction may be mediated by SAPK signaling and/or ERK signaling pathways (34Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13309-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies with anisomycin, a potent stimulator of JNK/SAPK, indicate that MKP-1 mRNA expression can be induced by anisomycin in VSMCs with a resultant inhibition of mitogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of ERKs and p38 MAPK signaling with PD98059 and SB203580, respectively, blocked insulin-mediated induction of MKP-1 mRNA expression. The above findings suggested the existence of a complex, cell type-specific cross-talk between the ERKs/SAPK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades. Alternatively, MAPK signaling pathways may be interacting with the NOS pathway to cause MKP-1 induction. To test this possibility, VSMCs were exposed to PD98059 and SB203580, respectively, followed by insulin treatment and examined for iNOS induction and MKP-1 expression. Inhibition of ERKs with PD98059 completely blocked the effects of insulin on iNOS induction and MKP-1 mRNA expression. In contrast to PD98059, inhibition of p38HOG kinase activity with SB203580 did not affect iNOS induction by insulin but prevented MKP-1 mRNA expression. Given that insulin increases only ERKs activity in VSMCs and does not affect p38HOG kinase activity, it appears that ERK signaling pathways may cross-talk with iNOS signaling pathway to regulate MKP-1 induction in response to insulin. Several recent studies suggest that p38 MAPK activity increases upon the withdrawal of serum, and the addition of growth factors as well as insulin inhibit p38 MAPK activity (41Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The presence of detectable levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in VSMCs under basal conditions suggests that this enzyme may be needed to maintain adequate expression of MKP-1 mRNA in the basal state. Upon insulin treatment VSMCs may use the MAPK-mediated NOS signaling pathway to cause MKP-1 expression. Further studies with constitutively active as well as dominant negative mutants of ERK and p38 MAPK will help in understanding the exact contribution of ERKs and p38 in NOS activation and MKP-1 induction. It should be noted that the NOS signaling pathway does not directly control MAPK activation in VSMCs, as inhibition of NOS withl-NMMA did not prevent ERK activation but increased its activation status presumably due to inhibition of MKP-1 expression. In VSMCs from SHR, it appears that defective MKP-1 induction by insulin may be due to reductions in PI3-kinase-generated signals leading to impaired induction of iNOS and reduced cGMP production. The above defects in MKP-1 induction could be corrected by direct treatment with SNP, a NO donor, as well as with cGMP agonist. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that insulin induces MKP-1 expression in VSMCs by employing PI3-kinase-initiated signals leading to the induction/activation of iNOS resulting in cGMP production that may mediate MKP-1 gene expression. The observed impairment in MKP-1 induction in SHR is due to defective NOS signaling leading to sustained MAPK activation and accelerated cell growth. This study also highlights the possibility of potential cross-talk between MAPK and NOS signaling pathways."

The ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodesI Kr in human heart. We expressedHERG heterologously in Xenopus oocytes and investigated the effects of PMA on the delayed rectifier potassium current. Upon application of PMA in a concentration of 100 nm, we found a similar reduction of HERG outward current amplitude by 59%. This reduction was due to a shift in the HERG activation curve by 37 mV. The ED50 for the PMA-induced shift was 9.0 nm. The inactive 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4α-PMA) had no effect. PMA is known to act by stimulating distinct protein kinase cascades.

Repolarization of the cardiac action potential involves many potassium currents (1Carmeliet, E. (1993) Eur. Heart J. 14,Suppl. H, 3–13Google Scholar).

The HERG channel is the molecular target of antiarrhythmic therapy with Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, with the result thatI Kr is blocked, and the cardiac action potential is prolonged (7Kiehn J.

Electrophysiological studies have shown that these HERG mutations result in a reduced HERG current with the consequence that the cardiac action potential and QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram of this patients is prolonged (10Sanguinetti M.C.

Protein kinases have been found in almost all cell membranes, and it has been demonstrated that they regulate ion channels (12Walsh K.B. Kass R.S.

Gao W.D. O′Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and when ion channels were expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes (13Busch A.E.

(Lond.). 1996; 495: 681-688Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Among the various protein kinases that have been found in almost all cells are protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA). The PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases that is implicated in intracellular signaling events triggered in response to a variety of agonists. At least 11 different PKC isoforms have been identified (17Quest F.G. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 231-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The effects of PKC on an effector protein can be tested via phorbol ester activation of the PKC cascade, which involves many steps with lipids and proteins of the plasma membrane. PMA is a very potent activator of PKC but not specific for PKC. Besides activation of the PKC cascade, it also has effects on other protein kinases (18Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Schultz H. Engel K. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PKA is a serine/threonine kinase that is cAMP-dependent. PKA can be stimulated by extracellular signals that elevate the intracellular cAMP concentration. cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of the enzyme, and the catalytic subunit phosphorylates the substrate. The effector protein can be phosphorylated directly, or other proteins may be phosphorylated that act on the effector protein. An increased intracellular cAMP concentration and finally PKA activation can be achieved experimentally with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (20Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Effects of PKA on substrates can also be investigated by the use of specific PKA inhibitors. Protein kinases play an essential role in the regulation of many cellular processes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether protein kinases, specifically PKA and PKC, are involved in the regulation of the HERG potassium channel, which underlies I Kr. Because protein kinases are present endogenously in Xenopusoocytes, we could use protein kinase activators and inhibitors. Using combinations of various activators and inhibitors, we provide evidence that PKA is a key enzyme involved in the PMA-induced shift of the HERG activation kinetics. Patch-clamp measurements of guinea pig cardiomyocytes were performed in a bath solution containing 3.5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) plus, additionally, 10 μm chromanol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany), a blocker of I Ks (21Busch A.E. Suessbrich S. Waldegger S. Sailer E. Greger R. Lang H.J. Lang F. Gibson K.J. Maylie J.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 1094-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and 10 μmnisoldipine to block calcium currents. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Two-microelectrode voltage clamp measurements of Xenopus oocytes were performed in a low K+ solution containing 5 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem), 4α-PMA (4α-phorbol PMA; Biomedicals Inc. Aurora, OH), staurosporine (Calbiochem), chelerythrine (Calbiochem), H89 (Calbiochem), KT5720 (Calbiochem), and bisindolylmaleimide (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO to a stock solution of 10 mm and stored at −20 °C. Genistein (Calbiochem), forskolin (Calbiochem), and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonylglycerol (DAG) (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO to a stock solution of 100 mm and stored at −20 °C. Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (Calbiochem) was dissolved directly in the extracellular solution to a concentration of 20 μm. Dofetilide (N-[4-(-{-[4-(methanesulfonamino)phenoxyl]-N-methylethylamino}ethyl)phenyl] methanesulfonamide); Pfizer Central Research, Sandwich, Kent, UK) was dissolved in distilled water, acidified to pH 3.0 by addition of HCl to make a 10 mm stock solution, and stored at −20 °C. On the day of experiments, aliquots of the stock solutions were diluted to the desired concentration with the bath solution. All measurements were made at room temperature (20 °C). Guinea pig cardiomyocytes were isolated with the Langendorff apparatus as described previously (4Kiehn J. Villena P. Beyer T. Brachmann J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 24: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Whole cell recording of the patch-clamp technique was used to measure currents of guinea pig cardiomyocytes.Xenopus oocyte measurements were performed by use of the standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Data were low pass-filtered at 1 to 2 kHz (−3 db, four-pole Bessel filter) before digitalization at 5 to 10 kHz. Pclamp software (Axon Instruments) was used for generation of the voltage-pulse protocols and for data acquisition. Activation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann distribution: G (V) =G max/(1 − exp (V 1/2− V)/k], where V is the test pulse potential, V 1/2 is the half-maximal activation potential, and k is the slope of the activation curve. To calculate the half-maximal effective dose (ED50) for PMA, we fitted a dose-response curve according to the following binding equation to the normalized currents ΔV 1/2 = ΔV 1/2,max/(1 +X/ED50), where ΔV 1/2 is the shift in the activation curve,X is the PMA concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient. Statistical data are presented as mean ±S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated using the unpaired Student's ttest. Differences were considered significant when a p value <0.05 was reached. The HERG clone was a gift from M. T. Keating. The pSP64 construct containing HERG was linearized withEcoRI (Boehringer Mannheim) and transcribed into cRNA with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) by use of SP6 polymerase. RNA (50 to 200 ng/μl) was injected intoXenopus oocytes, and measurements were made 2 to 8 days after injection. We investigated the effects of PMA onI Kr in isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes using a two-step protocol. From a holding potential of −40 mV (where the sodium current is inactivated), we stepped to a variable test pulse from −40 to 40 mV in 20-mV increments and then back to a constant second step to −40 mV to measure tail currents (Fig. 1 A). After a 10-min equilibrium time, the control measurements were done. Then we perfused 100 nm PMA into the bath and made measurements every 3 min. After 15 min, peaks of the I Kr tail currents were reduced as shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Fig. 1 D shows the concentration dependence of the effect of PMA on the peak tail current amplitudes after the test pulse to 40 mV. 1 nm PMA showed no significant current reduction (2.7 ± 8.7%, n = 3), 10 nm significantly reduced the peak tail current amplitude by 20 ± 7.3% (n= 3), and 100 nm PMA reduced the peak tail current significantly by 44 ± 7.4% (n = 6). When HERG is expressed in Xenopus oocytes, potassium outward currents were measured in a two-step protocol, a variable first step (test pulse potential) to measure activating outward currents and a second step to constant −60 mV to measure tail currents. The control HERG current had an activation threshold of −40 mV, then the current amplitude reached a maximum at 0 mV and decreased at test pulse potentials from 20 to 70 mV because of inward rectification that is characteristic to this channel (2Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 6Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T.

Circulation. 1996; 94: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Aand C). In the second step of the protocol the tail current amplitude depends on the preceding test pulse and is a measure of activation of the channel. The tail currents in the control measurement are shown in Fig. 2 A, and the peak amplitudes of the tail currents are shown in Fig. 2 D. The control tail currents had an activation threshold of −30 mV (Fig. 2 D) and reached their maximum at 30 mV at 1.23 μA. The voltage for the half-maximal activation V 1/2 was determined by a Boltzmann fit and gave −5.7 mV (Fig. 2 D). When 100 nm PMA was perfused into the bath for 30 min, the maximum current amplitude of the HERG current during the test pulse was reduced to 41 ± 21% (n = 4) (Fig. 2 C). The peak of the tail current was not significantly changed I PMA/I control = 109 ± 37% (n = 4), but the half-maximal activation voltage (V 1/2) was shifted from −5.7 to 22.1 mV (Fig. 2 D). The average shift of the half-maximal activation voltage (ΔV 1/2) was 27 ± 10.9 mV (n = 4). The inactive phorbol ester 4α-PMA had no significant effect on the HERG activation curve ((ΔV 1/2 = 1.3 ± 2.9 mV) (n = 8)). We investigated in more detail the mechanism of HERG current reduction by PMA. Inward tail currents at −120 mV were larger and could therefore be investigated more precisely than outward tail currents, which are close to the potassium equilibrium potential of −75 mV. Fig. 3 A shows an I-V measured with a protocol similar to that in Fig. 2 A, except that the tail currents were measured at −120 mV. 30 min PMA (100 nm) decreased the maximal outward current to 25 ± 4.7% (n = 8). The peak tail current was virtually not changed (I tail,PMA/I tail,control= 90.8 ± 10.5% (n = 8)), but the activation curve was shifted ΔV 1/2 = 37 ± 6.5 mV (n = 8) (Fig. 3 E). The slope k of the activation curve was not significantly changed (k control = −9.5 ± 1.2 mVversus k 30 min PMA = −11.7 ± 1.1 mV (n = 8)). To address the question whether the current shifted by PMA is a pure HERG current, we chose two different approaches. First, we determined the reversal potential for the control measurement and for the measurement with 100 nm PMA in a tail current protocol, where we activated the current with a first step to 40 mV and stepped back to various potentials between −140 and −20 mV to measure tail currents. The peaks of the tail currents were plotted as an I-V (Fig. 3 F). The reversal potential was nearly identical in control (−76 mV) versus the measurements after 30 min 100 nm PMA (−74.6 mV). The tail current amplitudes with PMA were generally smaller because the activation at 40 mV with PMA was smaller compared with control. This result was obtained in four experiments and indicates that the currents affected by PMA were pure potassium currents with a predicted potassium equilibrium potential of −75 mV. The second approach to demonstrate that PMA acts on the HERG channel was to block the currents after the PMA measurements almost completely with 10 μm dofetilide, which is a specific blocker of HERG. Under the given experimental conditions, the block of HERG by dofetilide is expected to be about 95% (7Kiehn J. Lacerda A.E. Wible B. Brown A.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This was found in four experiments (Fig. 3 C). PMA might change the inactivation properties of the HERG channel as well. To measure inactivation, we used a special protocol that inactivates the channel at a holding potential of 20 mV, recovers the channel from inactivation at various potentials from −120 to 30 mV (20 ms) in 10 mV steps, and measures the resulting peak outward current at constant 20 mV as a measure of steady-state inactivation (6Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 22Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Having obtained the control measurement shown in Fig. 4 A, we washed in 100 nm PMA for 30 min and held the cell during this period of time at −80 mV. In this set of experiments, a holding potential of −80 mV was necessary to prevent destruction of the oocyte that usually occurs when holding the oocyte 30 min at 20 mV. Finally we made the measurements with PMA, shown in Fig. 4 B. In Fig. 4 C, the inactivating outward current amplitude (measured at constant 20 mV) was normalized and plotted against the test pulse potential, giving the steady-state inactivation curve. This curve could be fitted with a Boltzmann distribution and gave the voltage for half-maximal inactivation that was −68.4 ± 1.8 mV (n = 4) for control and −63.8 ± 2.0 mV (n = 4) for the PMA measurements. There was only a small shift of 4.6 mV in the inactivation curves. The pronounced shift in the activation curve by 37 mV together with the small shift in the inactivation curve explains why the current amplitude during the test pulse was reduced, whereas the maximum tail current amplitude was not. In Fig. 4 D a graphical overlay of activation and inactivation curves illustrates this point. To test whether the effect of PMA was specific, we measured a dose-response curve for the effect of PMA on the activation curve shift (ΔV 1/2)((Fig. 4 E). The half-maximal effective dose ED50 was 9 nm and demonstrated that the effect of PMA on ΔV 1/2 was very potent. The stability of the experimental setup and the onset of the PMA effect is demonstrated in Fig. 4 F. We further tested whether the effect of PMA could be washed out. In three experiments the effect of PMA was partially reversible and shifted back the activation curve by ΔV 1/2 = −12.3 ± 1.9 mV after a 120-min washout. To elucidate the role of protein kinases for the PMA-related activation shift of HERG, we perfused 100 nm PMA together with protein kinase inhibitors into the bath for 30 min. After 30 min, the measurements for the activation curve were performed. First we measured the effects of 100 nm PMA plus the wide range protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 μm), which inhibits protein kinases unselectively with an IC50 of 8–20 nm (Table I line B) (23Hoffmann R. Newlands E.S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1991; 28: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PMA (100 nm) plus staurosporine (1 μm) gave a significantly smaller shift in the activation curve (ΔV 1/2 = 10.7 ± 7.7 mV (n = 4)) than PMA (100 nm) alone (ΔV 1/2 = 37.3 ± 6.5 mV (n = 8)) (Table I, line B versus line A). This demonstrates that protein kinases in general are involved, without specifying the types of protein kinases further. The staurosporine derivative bisindolylmaleimide is known to inhibit specifically PKC by acting as a competitive inhibitor for ATP on PKC without strong effects on other protein kinases (Table I, line C) (24Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet P. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even very high concentrations up to 1 μm showed no significant reduction in the PMA-induced shift (Table I, line C). The structurally different very specific PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (25Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) also showed no significant reduction in the PMA-induced shift in a high concentration of 10 μm (Table I, line D).Table ISummary of the results using various protein kinase inhibitors together with 100 nm PMAShift (ΔV 1/2)Significance from APKA (IC50)PKC (IC50)PKG (IC50)Tyrosine kinase (IC50)mVA 100 nm PMA37.3 ± 6.5(n = 8)B 100 nm PMA + 1 μm staurosporine10.7 ± 7.7Significant0.0070.0070.085(n = 4)C 100 nm PMA + 1 μm31.9 ± 2.7Not significant2.00.01 bisindolylmaleimide(n = 4)D 100 nm PMA + 10 μm33.1 ± 2.1Not significant1700.66 chelerythrine(n = 3)E 100 nm PMA + 5 μm H8926.7 ± 4.4Not significant0.048310.48(n = 5)F 100 nm PMA + 50 μm H898.3 ± 3.4Significant0.048310.48(n = 5)G 100 nm PMA + 2.5 μm KT57201.0 ± 5.4Significant0.056>2>2(n = 5)H 100 nm PMA + 20 μm Rp-8-pCPT-31.8 ± 2.7Not significant0.50 cGMPS(n = 4)I 100 nm PMA + 100 μm genistein32.1 ± 0.6Not significant>100>1002.6(n = 5)The shift (ΔV 1/2) of the HERG activation kinetics after 30 min of perfusion under the different experimental conditions (lines A–I) is given in the second column.

The PMA effect could be significantly augmented by PKA inhibition and not by PKC inhibition. Statistical significance was evaluated with the unpaired Studentt test and was considered significant when p< 0.05. Different from the PKC inhibitors, the specific PKA inhibitor H89 (26Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reduced the PMA-induced shift to ΔV 1/2 = 26.7 ± 4.4 mV (n = 5) (Table I, line E) in a concentration of 5 μm and to ΔV 1/2 = 8.3 ± 3.4 mV (n = 5) in a concentration of 50 μm (Table I, line F). KT5720 is an even more specific inhibitor of PKA (27Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). KT5720 (2.5 μm) significantly reduced the PMA-induced shift to ΔV 1/2 = 1.0 ± 5.4 mV (n = 5) (Table I, line G). The protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (28Butt E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (20 μm) and the broad range tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (29Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could not attenuate the PMA-induced shift (Table I, lines H and I). This indicates that mainly PKA and not PKC, PKG, and tyrosine kinases are involved in the PMA-induced shift of HERG activation. Another approach to test whether PKA is involved in the PMA-induced shift is to determine whether PKA activation could induce a shift. In this set of experiments we used forskolin, which activates the adenylate cyclase with an ED50 of 5–10 μm(20Seamon K.B. Padgett W. Daly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3363-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar) and subsequently PKA. We found that forskolin alone (400 μm) induced a shift of the HERG activation kinetics of ΔV 1/2 = 14.1 ± 4.2 mV (n= 4) after an application time of 60 min. These results indicate that PKA is involved in the shift of the HERG activation kinetics. In contrast the physiologic and very specific PKC activator DAG (30Go M. Sekiguchi K. Nomura H. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) could not produce a shift in HERG activation by itself. DAG is a neutral lipid that is able to activate the PKC cascade much more specific than PMA (30Go M. Sekiguchi K. Nomura H. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We used DAG in a very high concentration of 10 μm (without PMA). In five experiments DAG caused no positive shift of the half-maximal activation voltage (ΔV 1/2 = −4.9 ± 2.8 mV (n = 5)). This indicates that activation of PKC is not causing the shift in the HERG activation curve. The phorbol ester PMA reduces I Kr currents in guinea pig cardiomyocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. A more detailed analysis of the effects by PMA was performed on the cloned HERG channel, which was expressed in Xenopusoocytes. Here we found a similar current reduction as in the cardiomyocytes. This reduction is the result of a pronounced shift in the activation curve of 37 mV and a small shift (4.6 mV) in the inactivation curve. The area below these two curves, which reflects open, conducting channels, is reduced by PMA (Fig. 4 D). The number of activable channels in the membrane is likely to be constant upon stimulation with PMA because the maximal tail current amplitude at very positive potentials is not reduced (Fig. 2, D and E). Our results suggest that mainly PKA mediates the PMA effect on HERG. PMA stimulates the PKC cascade, but it is also known that other protein kinases are stimulated by PMA as well (18Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Schultz H. Engel K. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKA upon PMA stimulation could be demonstrated by additionally adding PKA inhibitors into the bath. The specific PKA inhibitors H89 and KT5720 reduced the PMA-induced shift. In support of this view forskolin alone, an adenylate cyclase activator that leads to activate PKA could induce a shift of 14 mV in the HERG activation curve. This is independent evidence that PKA is an important mediator, leading to a shift in HERG activation. PKC appears not to be involved directly in the PMA-induced shift in the HERG activation kinetics. This could be demonstrated by the use of the specific PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide and chelerythrine, which failed to inhibit the PMA response. Furthermore DAG, the physiologic and highly specific activator of PKC, even in a very high concentration of 10 μm failed to induce a shift in HERG activation. These results suggest that PKC is not involved in a major way in the PMA-induced shift. Other effects of PMA, such as the activation of other kinase cascades that result in the activation of PKA, produce the effect. Also, cross-talk between different protein kinase systems might be involved (31Gusovsky F. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 124-129Google Scholar). At this point it is not possible to identify the exact biochemical pathway of this process. PMA is known to affect many proteins and lipids in the membrane, and many of its effects are not fully understood (17Quest F.G. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 231-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nevertheless our results clearly demonstrate that PKA is a key enzyme in this process of HERG activation shift, which can be inhibited or stimulated specifically. The concentrations of the protein kinase inhibitors that we used in the experiments were relatively high. In general, higher concentrations for various drugs are necessary in Xenopus oocyte experiments when applied to the external surface of whole oocytes. For example, the block of HERG by the antiarrhythmic drug dofetilide gave an IC50 that was 20-fold higher when the drug was applied to the bath compared with the application of the drug to the internal surface of the membrane in inside-out membrane patches (7Kiehn J. Lacerda A.E. Wible B. Brown A.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This difference in sensitivity is due to the viteline membrane and the yolk that will reduce the concentration of many drugs in the cell membrane of the oocytes. The effects of protein kinase activation by PMA on HERG are similarin vitro and in vivo, demonstrated by our measurements in Xenopus oocytes and guinea pig cardiomyocytes. Because we found the effects in vivo, these effects may be of physiological significance. PKA is affected in many cellular processes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions (32Pahan K.

The HERG potassium channel is expressed in many cells, most importantly in excitable tissue such as heart and brain. Our results demonstrate for the first time a link between the protein kinase system and the electrophysiological function of the HERG potassium channel. This link could be important in better understanding its physiological and pathophysiological role. We thank Drs. R. Strasser and W. Schoels for comments on the manuscript, K. Güth and S.

The mechanism of free radical formation was evaluated using photolytic oxidation with sodium persulfate and by EPR spectrometry. Characterization of the products by mass spectrometry suggested that phenytoin photolyzes to a nitrogen-centered radical that rapidly undergoes ring opening to form a carbon-centered radical. PHS-1 was incubated with teratogen (phenytoin, mephenytoin, trimethadione, phenobarbital, and major metabolites) or its vehicle and the free radical spin trap α-phenyl-N-t-butylnitrone, and incubations were analyzed by EPR spectrometry. There was no α-phenyl-N-t-butylnitrone radical adduct in control incubations. For phenytoin, a putative unstable nitrogen-centered radical adduct and a stable carbon-centered radical adduct were detected. Free radical spin adducts also were detected for all other teratogens and metabolites except carbamazepine. The PHS inhibitor eicosatetraynoic acid abolished the free radical EPR signal. Incubation of 2′-deoxyguanosine with phenytoin and PHS-1 resulted in a 5-fold increase in its oxidation to 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine.

However, these hypotheses are not consistent with a number of published observations, including 1) the association of embryopathic activities of the structurally similar, asymmetric hydantoin anticonvulsants mephenytoin (Mesantoin) and its N-demethylated active metabolite nirvanol with the l-isomers that primarily do not form the arene oxide (Fig. 1) (7Wells P.G.

PHS and related potential bioactivating enzymes such as lipoxygenases are present with high activity in the embryo during organogenesis, the period of major teratologic susceptibility. Xenobiotic free radicals can bind covalently to cellular macromolecules (DNA, protein) and can initiate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress and oxidative damage to DNA, protein, and lipid. As detailed in the above reviews (3Winn, L. M., and Wells, P. G. (1995) Eur. J. Neurol. 2, Suppl. 4, 5–29Google Scholar, 4Wells P.G. Winn L.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Phenytoin initiates hydroxyl radical formation and the oxidation of embryonic DNA, protein, thiols, and lipid. Conversely, phenytoin-initiated oxidation of embryonic cellular macromolecules and teratogenicity or embryotoxicity are reduced by PHS inhibitors, free radical spin trapping agents, iron chelators, antioxidants, and antioxidative enzymes, including GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase (3Winn, L.

On the other hand, little is known about the chemical nature of the putative free radical intermediate of phenytoin and related xenobiotics in biological systems. Phenytoin and other hydantoins, as well as the structurally related succinimides, contain an imidyl group as shown in boxes in Fig. 1. The generation of imidyl radicals (a nitrogen-centered radical flanked by two acyl groups) fromN-halohydantoins and N-bromosuccinimide has been studied and used in synthetic chemistry for a bromination process since 1942 (14Luning U. Skell P.S. Tetrahedron. 1985; 41: 4289-4302Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). N-Bromosuccinimide undergoes photodecomposition to generate an imidyl radical that opens to form a carbon-centered radical with an isocyanate moiety (14Luning U. Skell P.S.

The characteristic reactions for both of these radicals are hydrogen abstraction and addition to double bonds (14Luning U. Skell P.S. Tetrahedron. 1985; 41: 4289-4302Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y.H. Dong M.H. Jiang X.K. Chow Y.L. Can. J. Chem. 1990; 68: 1668-1675Crossref Google Scholar, 19Chow Y.L.

Given that chemical studies indicate that N-halohydantoins can form a nitrogen-centered radical on their imidyl moiety and biochemical studies have shown that hydantoins and related compounds can initiate hydroxyl radical formation and oxidation of macromolecular targets, we hypothesized that phenytoin and its analogs can be bioactivated by PHS to an imidyl free radical that can undergo ring opening to generate a carbon-centered free radical with an isocyanate group. These radicals may covalently bind to embryonic macromolecules with carbon-carbon double bonds, such as DNA and protein, and/or initiate embryonic ROS formation and oxidative macromolecular damage, thereby initiating teratogenesis. This hypothesis was investigated using two approaches. The first involved the chemical characterization of products following the photolytic oxidation of phenytoin using sodium persulfate. The second approach involved direct characterization of teratogen free radical intermediates by EPR spectrometry and phenytoin-initiated DNA oxidation, following in vitroincubation with PHS. The results provide the first direct chemical evidence for PHS-catalyzed bioactivation of phenytoin and related proteratogens to a potentially embryotoxic free radical intermediate. Purified PHS-1 and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine were obtained from Cayman Chemicals Co. (Ann Arbor, MI); phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin acid), 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-diphenylhydantoin (HPPH), dimethadione, α-phenyl-N-t-butylnitrone (PBN), hematin, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, sodium persulfate, benzophenone, and 2′-deoxyguanosine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Canada); redistilled phenol was from Aldrich. Mephenytoin and nirvanol isomers were gifts from Dr. A. Küpfer (Switzerland); trimethadione was a gift from Abbott. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche. All other reagents used were of analytical or HPLC grade. A 3-ml solution containing 100 μm phenytoin and 100 μm sodium persulfate in 6.0 mm NaOH (pH 11.8) was photolyzed at 300 nm for 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min in a Rayonet chamber. The reaction mixture of each time interval was analyzed for product formation by HPLC equipped with a model 222 solvent delivery system (Scientific Systems, Inc.), a 5-μm Spherisorb ODS II C-18 column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, Jones Chromatography, Lakewood, CO), a model SPD-6AV UV/Vis detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and an integrator (Chromapac model CR501; Shimadzu). The mobile phase consisted of 59% water, 1% glacial acetic acid, and 40% acetonitrile, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The product separation was performed at 240 nm. The photolysis products were separated by preparative TLC using 30:70 ethyl acetate/hexane as the eluting solvent. Authentic samples of some products were synthesized or purchased and co-eluted to confirm the identity of products. The separated products were then scraped off the TLC plate and analyzed by HPLC in line with a tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS). The reaction mixture of each time interval as well as the separated products obtained from TLC studies were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS (API II, Perkin-Elmer Sciex, Concord, Canada). The instrument was set in ion spray mode, and the collision activation spectra of the products were obtained using argon as the target gas at an energy of 80 eV. The mean mass ± S.E. was calculated from the multiply charged ions by the software Mass spec (version 3.3). The HPLC conditions were the same as above. A mixture of 1 g of benzophenone, 1 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 5 ml of pyridine, and 5 ml of absolute ethanol was heated under reflux for 2 h in a water bath. The solvents were removed by rotoevaporation. The residue was precipitated with 5 ml of ice cold water, and the mixture was vacuum-filtered. The oxime was recrystallized from ethanol. Melting point was 142–144 °C; HPLC-MS: m/z(MH+ 198), 180, 77. PHS-1 (1000 units/ml) was incubated with hematin (1.0 μm) and phenol (0.5 mm) for 1 min at 37 °C in 80 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9. After addition of the teratogen (500 μm) or its vehicle and the free radical spin trap PBN (1 mm), arachidonic acid (AA) (67 μm) was added to start the reaction. After 30 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated and extracted twice with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate layers were reduced under nitrogen to 500 μl and analyzed by EPR spectrometry. To obtain information on a less stable, putative nitrogen-centered radical, phenytoin also was incubated with PHS-1 for shorter intervals of 2 and 15 min. To block PHS-1-catalyzed bioactivation of phenytoin, the PHS inhibitor ETYA (40 μm) was incubated with the enzyme at 37 °C for 1 min prior to the addition of phenytoin and AA. The controls for all incubations lacked the respective teratogen but contained all other components of the incubation including the vehicle for the teratogen. For phenytoin and its major in vivometabolite, HPPH, saline/NaOH was the vehicle. Trimethadione, dimethadione, and phenobarbital were dissolved in saline. The vehicle for nirvanol, mephenytoin, and carbamazepine was Me2SO. The concentration of Me2SO in these incubations did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). The free radical adducts of PBN were detected at room temperature in a ST-EPR cavity with a Bruker ER-200 DX band spectrometer. The instrument settings were as follows: microwave power, 20.5 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 50 ms; scan range, 100 G; sweep time, 50 s; accumulation, 5 scans; receiver gain, 5.00 × 10 (5Wells P.G. Winn L.M. Sipes I.G. McQueen C.A. Gandolfi A.J. Comprehensive Toxicology. 10. Pergamon Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford, UK1997: 489-507Google Scholar); field center, 3475 G; frequency, 9.81 GHz. The EPR spectrum for the mixture of the carbon-centered and putative nitrogen-centered free radicals was simulated using a standard software (ESR 42) developed by Dr. Uwe Oehler (Department of Chemistry, University of Guelph, Canada). 2′-Deoxyguanosine (1 mg) was incubated with or without phenytoin in the presence of PHS-1 using the conditions given above with the following modifications: 250 μm phenytoin was used, PBN was replaced with 2′-deoxyguanosine, and 140 μm arachidonic acid was added to start the reaction. The resulting mixture was analyzed by HPLC. Oxidation of 2′-dG to 8-OH-2′-dG was quantified using an isocratic HPLC system (Scientific Systems, Inc.) equipped with a 5-μm Spherisorb ODS II C-18 column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, Jones Chromatography), an electrochemical detector (model 5100A), a guard cell (model 5020), an analytical cell (model 5010) (Coulochem, ESA, Chelmsford, MA) and an integrator (Chromapac model CR501, Shimadzu). Samples were eluted using a mobile phase consisting of 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 5.5) and 5% methanol at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with a detector oxidation potential of +0.4 V. Statistical significance of differences between treatment groups was determined by Student'st test using a standard computerized statistical program (Statsview, Abacus Concepts, Inc.). The level of significance wasp < 0.05. Over the period of 40 min, more than 50% of phenytoin was photolyzed to one major and three minor products, which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS (Fig. 3). The major product of this reaction was 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-oxo-4-phenylquinazoline (1), and the minor products were benzophenone (2), benzophenone oxime (3), and 1-phenyl-1-[2-hydroxyphenyl]methyl imine (4). The HPLC retention times of these compounds are summarized in Table I.Table IRetention times and fragmentation patterns of phenytoin photolysis productsCompoundRetention timeMolecular ion (MH+)Fragmentation patternminm/zPhenytoin 4.25253225, 1821,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-2-oxo-4-phenylquinazoline (1) 3.37223145, 117, 90, 77Benzophenone (2)19.3418378Benzophenone oxime (3)12.15198180, 771-phenyl-1-[2-hydroxyphenyl]methyl imine (4) 8.25198105, 77Phenytoin was photolyzed in the presence of sodium persulfate. The product formation was monitored by HPLC, and the products were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Open table in a new tab Phenytoin was photolyzed in the presence of sodium persulfate. The product formation was monitored by HPLC, and the products were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. The fragmentation pattern for compound 1 (Table I) was consistent with concomitant loss of a phenyl ring, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide from this compound. The fragmentation pattern for compound 2 was consistent with the loss of a phenyl ring. Compounds 3 and 4 had the same molecular weight but showed different fragmentation patterns and were detected at different retention times (Table I). The fragmentation pattern for compound 3 was consistent with a loss of water and phenyl ring, while that of compound 4 was consistent with loss of a phenol group and a phenyl ring. The products of the photolysis reactions were separated on the TLC plate and characterized by HPLC-MS/MS. The fragmentation pattern observed for each product was the same as that observed for the reaction mixture. The authentic samples of compounds 2 and3 had the same R F values by TLC as their corresponding compounds from the reaction mixture, and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns were the same as for their corresponding products of the photolysis reaction. PHS-catalyzed formation of free radical spin adducts were obtained for phenytoin and its in vivo hydroxylated metabolite, HPPH (Fig. 4). The EPR signal for phenytoin after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 4 B) revealed the presence of a carbon-centered free radical. The triplet of doublets observed for this radical adduct of phenytoin had hyperfine splitting constants (HFSCs) of a = 13.75 G and a β = 2.13 G. HPPH also gave rise to a carbon-centered free radical (Fig. 4 C) with similar HFSCs,a = 13.79 G and a β = 2.38 G. Preincubation of PHS-1 with the PHS/lipoxygenase inhibitor ETYA (40 μm) abolished the free radical EPR signal for phenytoin (Fig. 4 D). The 40 μm concentration of ETYA is well above the K i value for PHS inhibition in isolated cells and purified enzyme preparations (22Hammarstrom S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 487: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Klein K.L. Clark K.E. Scott Jr., W.J. Prostaglandins. 1984; 27: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is not embryotoxic, and inhibits phenytoin embryotoxicity in embryo culture (24Miranda A.F. Wiley M.J. Wells P.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The control incubation, which contained saline/sodium hydroxide (Fig. 4 A), the vehicle of phenytoin and HPPH, did not show the presence of any radical other than the two peaks that are always observed, probably from PHS. To explore this possibility and that of the generation of teratogen free radicals by other components, incubations containing all components except the enzyme also were analyzed. Free radicals were not detected in these incubations, indicating that the two signals at either end of the spectra were due to PHS and that free radicals of teratogens were not formed in the absence of PHS-1 (Fig. 5 A). Time-dependent incubation of phenytoin revealed the early simultaneous existence of carbon- and putative nitrogen-centered free radicals at 15 min (Fig. 5 C) and maximally at 2 min (Fig. 5 D), with HFSCs of a = 13.75 G and a β = 2.13 G for the carbon-centered radical adduct and a = 14.2 G,a β = 0.79 G, and a β = 1.90 G for the nitrogen-centered radical adduct. The arrows in Fig. 5 D identify the presence of additional lines that were formed due to the overlapping signals of the nitrogen- and carbon-centered radical adducts. These additional lines were not present in the signal observed for the carbon-centered radical at 30 min of incubation (Fig. 5 B). This characterization was confirmed by computer simulation of the signal (Fig. 5 E). The EPR spectra of isomers of mephenytoin and nirvanol indicated carbon-centered free radicals in varying amounts (Fig. 6) with HFSCs similar to those observed for phenytoin (Table II). There was no radical adduct of PBN in the control incubations of these compounds (Fig. 6 A). We found in our system that concentrations higher than 0.5% of Me2SO, a radical scavenger, resulted in elimination of the signal, possibly by inhibiting PHS. We also found that the addition of more than 1 mm PBN to incubations resulted in a decrease in intensity of the signal, suggesting that higher concentrations of PBN could inhibit PHS.Table IIRelative amounts of free radical detected by ESR and their hyperfine splitting constantsTeratogenSpectral amplitudeHyperfine splitting constantsPhenytoina = 13.75,a β = 2.13 Alone+++a = 14.2,a β = 0.79,a β = 1.90 Plus ETYA+HPPH++++a = 13.79,a β = 2.38l-Mephenytoin+a = 13.56,a β = 2.12d-Mephenytoin++a = 13.60,a β = 2.13l-Nirvanol++a = 13.56,a β = 1.95d-Nirvanol++a = 13.66,a β = 2.12Trimethadione+a = 13.64,a β = 1.97Dimethadione++++a = 13.89,a β = 2.26Phenobarbital+a = 13.95,a β = 2.55The in vitro system contained prostaglandin H synthase, hematin, and phenol. After preincubation for 1 min at 37 °C, arachidonic acid, α-phenyl-N-t-butylnitrone, and xenobiotic or vehicle was added, and the system was incubated for 30 min. Open table in a new tab The in vitro system contained prostaglandin H synthase, hematin, and phenol. After preincubation for 1 min at 37 °C, arachidonic acid, α-phenyl-N-t-butylnitrone, and xenobiotic or vehicle was added, and the system was incubated for 30 min. Both l-mephenytoin and d-mephenytoin were bioactivated by PHS-1 to carbon-centered free radicals, with a stronger signal observed for d-mephenytoin compared with itsl-isomer (Fig. 6, B and C). The embryotoxic l-isomer of nirvanol produced slightly more free radical in the presence of PHS-1 than the nonteratogenicd-isomer (Fig. 6, D and E). Trimethadione and dimethadione were both bioactivated by PHS-1 to carbon-centered free radicals (Fig. 7), with HFSCs similar to phenytoin (Table II). Dimethadione is the pharmacologically active metabolite of trimethadione and, due to its longer half-life, accumulates in humans and animals. Separate administration of these two compounds in pregnant mice suggests that the teratogenicity of trimethadione results from in vivo N-demethylation to dimethadione, which is the penultimate teratogenic species (8Wells P.G. Nagai M.K. Spano Greco G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation in the present study that dimethadione produced a strong EPR signal (Fig. 7 B), while the less teratogenic parent compound trimethadione produced a very weak signal (Fig. 7 C) A free radical signal was not detected in control incubations for these two drugs (Fig. 7 A). Phenobarbital was bioactivated by PHS-1 to a carbon-centered free radical intermediate, which was detected as a weak EPR signal (Table II). Free radical intermediates were not detected in PHS-1 incubations containing the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine (data not shown). Using the reaction conditions above employed for free radical characterization, phenytoin was bioactivated by PHS-1 in vitro to a free radical reactive intermediate that oxidized 2′-dG to 8-OH-2′-dG. Incubations containing phenytoin had a 5.2-fold increase in 2′-dG oxidation compared with incubations with the saline vehicle control (Fig. 8). Results obtained from the photolysis of phenytoin in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent, sodium persulfate, suggest that phenytoin is first oxidized to a nitrogen-centered radical a that can rapidly undergo ring opening to form a carbon-centered free radicalb with an isocyanate moiety (Fig. 9). Radical b and its resonance contributor radical c both react with an oxygen molecule to generate compounds 2 and 4. Analysis of an authentic sample of compound 4 was not attempted, since imines in which the nitrogen is attached to a hydrogen are generally unstable and rapidly decompose or polymerize (25March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structures. 4th Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1992: 897Google Scholar). Cyclization of radical c produces compound 1. Compound 3 may be formed after oxidation of the decomposition product of the radical b. The mechanism postulated in Fig. 9 provides a potential chemical basis for the generation and characteristics of the putative phenytoin free radicals. Bioactivation of phenytoin by the purified PHS-1/AA system generated a putative nitrogen-centered free radical and a definitive carbon-centered free radical. Inhibition of the phenytoin EPR signal by the PHS inhibitor ETYA indicated that the bioactivation of phenytoin to a free radical intermediate was catalyzed by PHS. ETYA is a dual inhibitor of PHS and lipoxygenases (26Downing D.T. Barve J.A. Gunstone F.D. Jacobsberg F.R. Jie M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2041420277,"Selecting effective antisense target sites on a given mRNA molecule constitutes a major problem in antisense therapeutics. By trial-and-error, only 1 in 18 (6%) of antisense oligonucleotides designed to target the primary RNA transcript of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) strongly inhibited TNF-alpha synthesis. Subsequent studies showed that the area in RNA targeted by antisense oligonucleotides could be moved effectively 10-15 bases in either direction from the original area. We observed that only molecules that incorporated a tetranucleotide motif TCCC (complementary to GGGA on RNA) yielded potent antisense oligonucleotides against TNF-alpha. A comprehensive literature survey showed that this motif is unwittingly present in 48% of the most potent antisense oligonucleotides reported in the literature. This finding was prospectively used to predict the sequences of additional antisense oligonucleotides for the rat TNF-alpha primary RNA transcript. Over 50% of antisense constructs (13 of 22) containing the TCCC motif were found to effectively inhibit TNF-alpha synthesis. Marked reductions in mRNA were also observed. This motif was found to be most effective when targeting introns in the primary RNA transcript, suggesting a nuclear localization for the antisense action. Predicting target sites based on the presence of this motif in primary RNA transcripts should be of value in the development on new antisense pharmacotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2036074442,"Despite what is known about the early signaling events in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced apoptosis, characterization of the downstream events remains largely undefined. It is now known that a cross-talk exists between the interferon and TNF-α pathways. This linkage allows recruitment of the cell proliferation suppressor PKR (dsRNA-dependent protein kinase) from the interferon pathway to play a pivotal role in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. In this study, we took advantage of the differential TNF-α susceptibilities of human promonocytic U937 subclones, deficient in or overexpressing PKR, to further characterize the role of PKR in apoptosis. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that TNF-α transiently induces the tumor suppressor p53 in U937 cells. This p53 induction lags behind the TNF-α induction of PKR by 1 h. By cell viability determination, ultrastructural studies, apoptotic DNA laddering, and antisense techniques, it was shown that inhibition of p53 expression in PKR-overexpressing U937 cells abrogates the TNF-α-induced apoptosis in these cells. Conversely, overexpressing wild type p53 in PKR-deficient U937 cells confers the susceptibility of these cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. This latter result indicates that p53 induction is an event downstream of TNF-α-induced up-regulation of PKR, thereby further establishing the critical role of p53 in TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. PKR-overexpressing U937 cells were found to possess a constitutively higher level of p53, which partly explains why these cells spontaneously undergo apoptosis even without TNF-α treatment. Finally, a model is presented on the interplay between PKR and p53 in effecting TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells.

Responding to injury, microbial infection, and tumor invasion, many cell types including activated macrophages, lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, Kupffer cells, and astrocytes may produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 α, a polypeptide cytokine (1Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In general, TNF-α is inducible by bacterial endotoxins, viruses, parasites, antibody/antigen complexes, complements, and other cytokines. On one hand, this pleiotropic cytokine is associated with a plethora of cellular defense responses and activation of many beneficial and cell-protecting genes, including NF-κB (2Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar, 3Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TNF-α is instrumental in a myriad of lethal effects, including septic shock syndrome, tissue injury, inflammation, cachexia, suppression of adipocyte lipoprotein lipase, and reduction of myocyte resting potential. This bipolar beneficial and detrimental potential of TNF-α reflects the duality also evident in other aspects of TNF-α: TNF-α exists both as membrane-bound 26-kDa and soluble 17-kDa forms; TNF-α can interact with either a 60-kDa or an 80-kDa receptor with vastly different consequences; TNF-α can render death in susceptible target tumor and non-tumor cells by both extracellular (necrosis) and intracellular (apoptosis) mechanisms (5Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C. Palladino Jr., M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 6Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Historically known for its necrotic action, TNF-α is being increasingly appreciated for its ability to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells (7Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a genetically determined program in which a committed cell undergoes a new round of protein synthesis and various morphological/physiological changes such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, and ultimately DNA degradation into multiples of 198-base pair oligonucleosomal fragments (apoptotic DNA laddering). The last few years have seen much progress in characterizing the postreceptor binding signaling events in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Factors such as TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs are now known to associate with the p60 and p80 TNF-α receptors in initiating the TNF-α-induced signaling pathway (8Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar). Other than the demonstration of the involvement of the sphingomyelin pathway, ceramide, and the transcription factor NF-κB, much work is needed to map the events connecting the initial receptor binding and the final apoptotic processes. Recently, it was demonstrated that there is a cross-talk between the TNF-α and the interferon signaling pathways and that the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR, a key component in the interferon pathway, is recruited to mediate the downstream events in the TNF-α-induced apoptotic pathway (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PKR is essential for the synthesis of interferon-α and contributes to antiviral activities by phosphorylating and inactivating the translation initiation factor eIF2α in the presence of double-stranded viral RNA or single-stranded viral RNA with double-stranded characteristics. PKR also possesses antiproliferative and apoptosis-promoting activities, including the induction of Fas and mediation of stress-induced apoptosis (10Takizawa T. Nippon Rinsho. 1996; 54: 1836-1841PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takizawa T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8128-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor gene p53 has long been linked to cell cycle G1 arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation (13Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Levine A.J. Chang A. Dittmer D. Notterman D.A. Silver A. Thorn K. Welsh D. Wu M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of this gene are strongly associated with tumorigenesis. Despite the critical role of p53 in cell survival, protein levels of p53 are extremely low in nontransformed cells because of the rapid turnover of p53 (15Reihsaus E. Kohler M. Kraiss S. Oren M. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 137-145PubMed Google Scholar). Still to be fully elucidated, p53 is believed to act through its transcriptionally transactivating activities (13Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considerable interest has also been shown in p53 for its role in apoptosis (13Morgan S.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic overexpression of wild type p53 promotes apoptotic death in many tumor cell lines (16Shaw P. Bovey R. Tardy S. Sahli R. Sordat B. Costa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4495-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 17Yonish-Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). Moreover, another apoptosis-promoting gene, bax, is up-regulated by p53 (18Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar,19Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Miyashita T. Wang H.G. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Hoffman B. Liebermann D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1791-1798PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines and growth factors can protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis (20Collins M.K. Marvel J. Malde P. Lopez-Rivas A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For instance, interleukin-3 protects the mouse hematopoietic Baf-3 cells from p53-mediated apoptosis. Because TNF-α induces NF-κB (21Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), which can in turn up-regulate p53, and in view of the apoptosis-promoting potential of p53, we investigated in this study a possible role of p53 in the apoptotic pathway induced by TNF-α. In particular, we sought to gather evidence in support of the hypothesis that the molecular mechanism of the TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells involves the induction of PKR, which, already a potent growth suppressor by itself, further enhances the expression of another powerful growth suppressor, the anti-oncogene p53, leading eventually to apoptosis and cell death. Construction of expression vectors with sense and antisense PKR inserts driven by the CMV promoter in pRC-CMV (Invitrogen) and isolation and characterization of stable U937 derivatives harboring these plasmids have been described. End point dilution-subcloned U937-PKR stables with control, sense, and antisense PRK plasmids were designated U9K-C, U9K-S, and U9K-A, respectively (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Der S.D. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8841-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for p53 were constructed with standard cloning techniques in pBK-CMV (Stratagene), with the CMV promoter driving full-length sense or antisense p53 cDNA inserts obtained from RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from apparently healthy volunteers' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The upper and lower p53 cloning primers were 5′-TCCGGGTCTAGACCATGGAGGAGCCGCAG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCTAGATCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCC-3′, respectively; p53 inserts were confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. Sense and antisense p53 expression vectors were designated pBK-53S and pBK-53A, respectively. Derivatives doubly overexpressing sense PKR and either antisense p53 or parental pBK-CMV were isolated from transfection of U9K-S cells with either pBK-53A or control pBK-CMV and were designated U9K-S53A and U9K-S53C, respectively. Because the selection markers on both pRC-CMV and pBK-CMV were both neomycin, the additional transfection of pBK-53A into U9K-S cells was performed in the presence of another plasmid, pSTK7, which contains a hygromycin selection marker. After electroporation of 5 × 106 U9K-S cells with 30 μg of pBK-53A (or pBK-CMV) and 1 μg of pST-K7 at 300 V and 500 microfarads, U9K-S53A (or U9K-S53C) cells were selected and maintained in 400 μg/ml each of neomycin (G418) and hygromycin in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro), 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% CO2. All other U937 derivatives were similarly maintained except without hygromycin. Confirmation of foreign gene expression in all cell lines was confirmed by standard Northern blotting or RT-PCR. Induction of apoptosis in U937 cells and determination of cell viability have been described (23Yeung M.C. Pulliam L. Lau A.S. Aids. 1995; 9: 137-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells and derivatives were treated with TNF-α at 0.5 ng/ml for 24 h before cells were stained with 0.1 volume of 0.4% trypan blue to quantify viable cells with a hemacytometer. Percentage cell viability is defined as the percentage of the number of viable test cells over the number of viable control cells of the same cell line at the end of each experimental treatment. For some experiments, the control and anti-p53 oligodeoxynucleotides (phosphodiester; synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) used were 5′-ACTGCCATGGAGGAGCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGCTCCTCCATGGCAGT-3′, respectively. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and data are reported as the mean ± S.D. of three independent values. For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed in Karnovsky solution followed by cacodylate buffer. The cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated for staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Thin sections were examined in a JEOL 100 SX electron microscope. Apoptotic oligonucleosomal DNA fragments were isolated according to Herrmann et al. (24Herrmann M. Lorenz H.M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) without modification. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells treated with TNF-α at 0.5 ng/ml for 18 h were extracted twice with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5). After centrifugation, the combined supernatants were brought to 1% SDS, treated with 5 mg/ml (final concentration) RNase A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 56 °C for 2 h, and followed by digestion with 2.5 mg/ml (final concentration) proteinase K at 37 °C for 2 h. DNA fragments were precipitated and analyzed in 2% agarose gels. Total RNA extraction and RT-PCR for steady-state RNA levels have been previously described (23Yeung M.C. Pulliam L. Lau A.S. Aids. 1995; 9: 137-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR reaction was performed in a thermal cycler (Coy Corp.) for 30 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min) before arresting the reaction in its logarithmic phase by rapid cooling at 4 °C. The PCR products were analyzed on 0.7% agarose gel followed by Southern blotting with gene-specific probes. PCR primer sets used were (i) p53: upstream, 5′-CCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCT-3′, and downstream, 5′-ACAAACACGCACCTCAAAGC-3′; and (ii) 18 S ribosomal RNA: upstream, 5′-CGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAA-3′, and downstream, 5′-TTATGACCCGCACTTACTGG-3′. For data analysis, radioactivity counts (cpm) for p53 messages were normalized against those of the corresponding internal control 18 S messages in the same sample. In our hands, signals generated from RT-PCR as described above were proportional to the amounts of input cDNA (data not shown). As an initial step to demonstrate the involvement of p53 in the TNF-α-induced apoptotic pathway in U937 cells, we first investigated if TNF-α induces p53 in the promonocytic U937 cells. Because of the high turnover rate of p53, it is commonly known that p53 protein levels in U937 cells are extremely low (25Danova M. Giordano M. Mazzini G. Riccardi A. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like others, we experienced considerable difficulties in measuring p53 protein in U937 cells by Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, even when employing sensitive chemiluminescence detection techniques from various manufacturers (data not shown). Similarly, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for p53 expression in U937 cells also did not render reliable data. Consequently, we employed the ultra-sensitive technique of RT-PCR to monitor p53 up-regulation by TNF-α. Fig. 1 shows that TNF-α at a low concentration of 0.5 ng/ml up-regulated the expression level of p53 in U937 cells with time, peaking at around 3 h (lane 3) post-TNF-α treatment. It has been demonstrated that PKR is pivotal in mediating TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As documented previously (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), PKR-overexpressing U9K-S cells have 5-fold the amount of PKR proteins as in U9K-C control cells, whereas U9K-A cells harboring an antisense PKR-expressing vector produce negligible levels of PKR proteins. To ascertain if PKR plays a role in the p53 up-regulation in U937 cells by TNF-α, U937 PKR subclones were treated with 0.5 ng/ml TNF-α for 3 h to allow maximal p53 expression. It is apparent in Fig. 2 that even without TNF-α, constitutively PKR-expressing U9K-S cells had already twice the steady-state p53 mRNA levels (Fig. 2, lane 2) as that in the control U9K-C and PKR-deficient U9K-A cells (Fig., 2, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Upon TNF-α treatment, the steady-state p53 mRNA level in U9K-S cells was 5-fold that in unstimulated U9K-C parental controls (compare lanes 5 and 1 in Fig. 2), whereas the steady-state p53 mRNA levels in U9K-C and U9K-A cells both increased by less than 2-fold after treatment with TNF-α (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1, 4, and 6). To demonstrate if expression of p53 was crucial for induction of apoptosis by TNF-α in U937 cells, expression of p53 in U9K-S cells was inhibited by three antisense techniques before TNF-α treatment. U9K-S cells were chosen for these studies because it was demonstrated that, whereas U9K-C and U9K-A cells are resistant to TNF-α at 0.5 ng/ml, U9K-S cells are susceptible to this low concentration of TNF-α (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To inhibit p53 expression, the first approach was to pre-incubate U9K-S cells with 5 nm of a p53 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, 5′-CGGCTCCTCCATGGCAGT-3′, which has previously been shown to be effective in inhibiting p53 expression in a dose-dependent manner in many cell types, including human acute myeloblastic leukemia blasts, the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1, and the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells (26Zhu Y.M. Bradbury D.A. Russell N.H. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Yeung M.C. Geerstma F. Liu J. Lau A.S. AIDS. 1998; 12: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 24 h of pre-incubation with this anti-p53 oligodeoxynucleotide, U9K-S cells were treated with 0.5 ng/ml TNF-α and in the presence of fresh anti-p53 oligodeoxynucleotides (5 nm) for another 18 h, before the cells were counted with trypan blue for cell viability. Fig. 3 A, bar 1, shows that, consistent with previous results (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), U9K-S cells sustained a 25% cell death induced by TNF-α. In contrast, this TNF-α susceptibility was apparently eliminated by the anti-p53 oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 3 A, bar 2). As a second approach to inhibit p53 expression, 5 × 106 U9K-S cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with 30 μg of the anti-p53 plasmid pBK-53A (or pBK-CMV control). After 24 h, TNF-α at a final concentration of 0.5 ng/ml was added to the cells, which were further incubated for 18 h before viable cell counting with trypan blue. Fig. 3 B shows that, as in the case of using anti-p53 oligodeoxynucleotides, PKR-overexpressing U9K-S cells became much less susceptible to TNF-α when p53 expression was inhibited. To further illustrate the involvement of p53, U9K-S cells stably transfected with pBK-53A (or pBK-CMV) were isolated and treated with 0.5 ng/ml TNF-α for 18 h before cell viability determination. Fig. 3 C (bars 3 and 4) shows once again that inhibition of p53 expression led to resistance to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. As controls, bars 1 and 2 demonstrate the normal responses of PKR-overexpressing U9K-S and PKR-deficient U9K-A cells, respectively, to TNF-α. To confirm resistance to TNF-α as described above, U9K-S53A cells treated with TNF-α at 0.5 ng/ml for 18 h were subjected to transmission electron microscopy studies. Consistent with published data (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), U9K-C cells showed early signs of apoptosis with chromatin condensation following TNF-α treatment (Fig. 4, panels A and D). As expected, U9K-S53C cells also exhibited spontaneous chromosomal condensation and retained their susceptibility to TNF-α, which was evident in the appearance of total chromosomal condensation, a hallmark of apoptosis, and in the appearance of vacuoles (Fig. 4, panels B and E). In contrast, U9K-S53A cells showed much reduced deleterious effects because of TNF-α. The chromosomal condensation spots were just making their appearance along the inner nuclear membrane (Fig. 4, panels C and F). The extent of this chromosomal condensation was similar to that of TNF-α-treated parental U9K-C control cells (Fig. 4, comparepanels D and F). To further demonstrate that p53 expression was involved in resistance to TNF-α, U9K-S53C cells, which overexpressed PKR, and U9K-S53A cells, which overexpressed PKR and antisense p53 mRNA, were treated with 0.5 ng/ml TNF-α for 18 h before extraction of small molecular weight oligonucleosomal DNA. As reported previously (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), Fig. 5 shows that TNF-α treatment resulted in extensive nucleosomal DNA laddering in PKR-overexpressing U9K-S cells (compare lanes 2 and 4) but not in PKR-deficient U9K-A cells (compare lanes 3 and 5). As expected, U9K-S53C cells retained the characteristics of parental U9K-S cells in terms of their low-level spontaneous apoptosis (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and 6) and sensitivity toward TNF-α (Fig. 5, comparelanes 4 and 8). In contrast, when p53 expression was inhibited, U9K-S53A cells exhibited reduced levels of spontaneous apoptosis (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and 7) and susceptibility toward TNF-α (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 9), implicating again the role of p53 in TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. As a complementary approach to the anti-p53 approach described above, 5 × 106 TNF-α-resistant and PKR-deficient U9K-A cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with 30 μg of the wild type p53 expression plasmid pBK-53S (or pBK-CMV control). After 24 h, TNF-α at a final concentration of 0.5 ng/ml was added to the cells, which were further incubated for 18 h before viable cell counting with trypan blue. Fig. 6 shows that overexpression of p53 effectively conferred TNF-α susceptibility to U9K-A cells (bars 3–5), which now behaved similarly to the TNF-α-sensitive U9K-S cells (bars 1 and 2). Most of the current research on TNF-α-induced apoptosis has focused on the early signaling events after TNF-α binds to its membrane receptors. One notable exception is the elucidation of a cross-talk between the TNF-α and interferon pathways, by which a key enzyme in the interferon pathway, PKR, is recruited to play a pivotal, albeit undefined, role in the TNF-α-induced apoptotic process (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of the unique TNF-α responses of U937 subclones overexpressing sense or antisense PKR mRNA and identified the tumor suppressor p53 as another crucial downstream participant in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. By RT-PCR, it was demonstrated that TNF-α could induce p53 in U937 cells. This p53 induction was transitory and tightly regulated: the p53 induction peaked at 3 h and then quickly subsided. Incidentally, the PKR induction by TNF-α is also transitory and peaks at 2 h (9Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the p53 induction peak lagged that of PKR by 1 h (see also below). This tight regulation of PKR and p53 expression reflects both the potency of these two cell growth inhibitors and the potential adverse effects of having abundant amounts of these two proteins. This may partially explain the difficulty in detecting p53 in U937 cells at the protein level. In addition, some undefined characteristics of the cellular milieu of U937 cells may reduce the already short half-life of p53. Despite the common findings of mutations in p53 in many cell lines, solid documentation of mutation in either the transcriptional regulatory sequences or the actual gene coding sequences of p53 in U937 cells has not been reported in the literature. In the event that these p53 sequences are mutated, the possibility exists that TNF-α is able to induce and activate wild type p53 while suppressing the activity of mutant p53 in U937 cells. This unusual property of TNF-α inducing wild type p53 has been reported in the rat glioma C6 cells, which normally express mutant p53 (28Yin D. Kondo S. Barnett G.H. Morimura T. Takeuchi J.

What is important is that our results on p53 in U937 cells as discussed below provide strong evidence for the crucial role of p53 in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Using three different antisense techniques to inhibit p53 expression in U937 cells, we demonstrated by cell viability, ultrastructural studies, and apoptotic DNA laddering that p53 is essential for the TNF-α-induced apoptotic process. This obligatory need for p53 is reflected also by data in the present study that theuninduced steady-state p53 mRNA level in PKR-overexpressing U9K-S cells was already higher than that of either the control U9K-C or the PKR-deficient U9K-A cells (Fig. 2). This increased p53 expression level may partially account for the spontaneous apoptosing nature of U9K-S cells and the heightened susceptibility of these cells to TNF-α. The finding that introduction and overexpression of wild type p53 rendered the previously TNF-α-resistant U9K-A cells susceptible to TNF-α (Fig. 6) is the most telling evidence of the role of p53 in TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. This conclusion is independent of the mutation status of p53 in U937 cells. Lastly, this data also establishes that p53 acted downstream of PKR in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells; as mentioned above, this finding is further supported by the observation that the induction of p53 by TNF-α lagged that of PKR by 1 h. The mechanism of p53 up-regulation remains undefined. Because p53 functions downstream of PKR, there is a possibility that PKR may up-regulate NF-κB, which in turn up-regulates p53. It has been demonstrated that PKR phosphorylates IκB, leading to the release and activation of NF-κB (29Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). A NF-κB recognition sequence has been detected 5′ to the p53 gene, and NF-κB by itself can up-regulate p53 (30Wu H. Lozano G. Lahdenpohja N. Kimmo S. Hurme M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve the issue that NF-κB has actually been found to protect cells from apoptosis in certain circumstances, it is proposed that initial mobilization of NF-κB may activate some protective pathways. However, once a NF-κB-induced threshold level of p53 is reached as a result of continual cell stress, the cells become committed to apoptosis, and self-destruction ensues. Moreover, continued exposure to stress may actually suppress further NF-κB activation, as reported for normal peripheral blood T cells exposed to oxidative stress for 2 days (31Lahdenpohja N. Kimmo S. Hurme M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1354-1358PubMed Google Scholar). Another question remains as to the identity of events downstream of p53. One obvious candidate is p21 (WAF), a cell growth suppressor, that has often been found to be coupled to up-regulated p53 activities in many systems (32Gartel A.L. Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 33Kishi K. Tanaka K. Takai Y. Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 1993; 20: 1107-1121PubMed Google Scholar). However, our preliminary results did not support a significant linkage of p21 and p53 activities in U937 cells in response to TNF-α treatment (data not shown). This may not be surprising because it is now known that p21 can operate independently of p53 (7Serfas M.S. Goufman E. Feuerman M.H. Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 951-961PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In summary, evidence was provided to support a significant role of p53 in TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Up-regulation of p53 expression appears to be a downstream event following TNF-α-induced activation of PKR. Increase in p53 expression may explain the heightened sensitivity to TNF-α in PKR-overexpressing U937 cell lines. A model was proposed linking the contribution of PKR, NF-κB, and p53 to TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Support of this model and identification of events downstream of p53 activation remain to be clarified. We thank Dr. Larry Shapiro for generous support, Drs. Bryan Williams and Robert Silverman for helpful discussion, Danny Chang for excellent technical assistance, and Dr. Martin Breitman for a gift of the pSTK7 plasmid."

Insulin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulate PI3K activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but only insulin is capable of stimulating GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. We found that PDGF causes serine/threonine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in 3T3-L1 cells, measured by altered mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and this leads to a decrease in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1, whereas the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was without a major effect. PDGF pretreatment for 60–90 min led to a marked 80–90% reduction in insulin stimulatable phosphotyrosine and IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. We examined the functional consequences of this decrease in IRS-1-associated PI3K activity. Interestingly, insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport was unaffected by 60–90 min of PDGF preincubation. Furthermore, insulin activation of Akt and p70s6kinase, kinases downstream of PI3K, was unaffected by PDGF pretreatment. Wortmannin was capable of blocking these insulin actions following PDGF pretreatment, suggesting that PI3K was still necessary for these effects. In conclusion, 1) PDGF causes serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and PI3K, or a kinase downstream of PI3K, mediates this phosphorylation. 2) This PDGF-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 leads to a significant decrease in insulin-stimulated PI3K activity. 3) PDGF has no effect on insulin stimulation of Akt, p70s6kinase, GLUT4 translocation, or glucose transport. 4) This suggests the existence of an IRS-1-independent pathway leading to the activation of PI3K, Akt, and p70s6kinase; GLUT4 translocation; and glucose transport.

Tyrosine kinase receptors such as the insulin receptor, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 receptor, and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor activate many of the same signaling cascades. The two most prominent shared pathways are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the microtubule-associated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Activation of MAPK leads to mitogenic progression and may be involved in differentiation (for review, see Ref. 1Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). Numerous studies using inhibitors of PI3K activity, expression of constitutively active PI3K, and microinjection of dominant negative inhibitors of PI3K have all demonstrated that PI3K is necessary for the mitogenic effects of many growth factors and is both necessary and sufficient for the metabolic effects of insulin (2Conricode K.M.

The p85 subunit is composed of an N-terminal Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain and 2 Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains. The SH2 domains flank the region where the p110 associates with p85. The SH2 domains interact with phosphotyrosine residues, leading to subsequent activation of the p110 catalytic subunit (for review, see Ref. 8Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1/2) and the association of PI3K with the SH2 binding sites contained within these proteins. PDGF and EGF activate PI3K through its association with phosphotyrosines located in the C terminus of their receptors. PI3K exhibits both lipid and protein kinase activities. PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositols, causing the production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (8Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The role of PIP2 and PIP3, the primary products of PI3K, has been elusive. Recently, a role for PIP2 and PIP3 in the activation of an Akt kinase has been discovered (9Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). PI3K also phosphorylates proteins on serine/threonine residues (10Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S.

These cells express insulin, PDGF, and EGF receptors. Each of these ligands is capable of activating MAPK in these cells, but only insulin and PDGF activate PI3K (13Wiese R.J. Mastik C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Despite the disparity in insulin and PDGF receptor number in these cells, PDGF and insulin activate PI3K to a similar extent. Because the activation of PI3K has been shown to be necessary for the metabolic effects of insulin, such as the translocation of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the cell membrane, glucose uptake, and glycogen synthesis, it has been puzzling as to how insulin, but not PDGF, causes translocation of GLUT4 and glucose transport when both of these ligands cause stimulation of PI3K (2Conricode K.M.

Insulin and PDGF lead to different time courses of activation of PI3K, with insulin causing a sustained activation of PI3K and PDGF generating transient effects. PDGF pretreatment stimulates the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, interfering with the ability of insulin to activate PI3K. Serine phosphorylation of serine 612, one of the major serine phosphorylation sites in IRS-1, may inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine 608, a site of IRS-1/PI3K interaction (14De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Importantly, this inhibition of IRS-1-associated PI3K activity had no effect on insulin induction of glucose transport, GLUT4 translocation, or Akt and p70s6kinase phosphorylation. These biologic effects of insulin remain PI3K-dependent, however, because they are blocked by PI3K inhibitors. These results indicate that PI3K can be activated under the direction of insulin by an IRS-1/IRS-2-independent pathway. It appears that whereas PI3K activity is necessary for the metabolic effects of insulin, IRS-1 phosphorylation is not essential.

Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was obtained from Pierce. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose, containing 10% calf serum. Postconfluency fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes by changing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose, containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 112 μg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine. The medium was removed after 2 days and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose, containing 10% fetal calf serum, Glutamax, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Seven days after the addition of the differentiation mix, the cells were plated in 6- or 12-well dishes at densities of 8 × 105 and 4 × 105, respectively. The medium was changed every 2–3 days until use, 12–15 days postdifferentiation. Approximately 80–90% of the cells exhibited large lipid droplets indicative of adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin or 50 ng/ml PDGF or pretreated with PDGF for various times and then stimulated with insulin for 5 min. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfoxide, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.4. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with pY20 antibody and anti-mouse IgG agarose or IRS-1 antibody and recombinant protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by a 10-min spin at 14,000 × g. Pellets were washed three times with Buffer A (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μm Na3VO4), three times with Buffer B (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mmLiCl2, and 100 μmNa3VO4), and twice with Buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4). Pellets were resuspended in Buffer C without the Na3VO4. As described previously (15Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), PI3K activity was assessed by the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in the presence of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Following the separation of lipids by thin-layer chromatography using the borate-buffered system (16Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. National Institutes of Health Image software was used to analyze the autoradiographs. Adipocytes plated in 6-well dishes were stimulated at 37 °C with insulin, PDGF, or PDGF followed by insulin for the times indicated. Some wells were treated with wortmannin (100 nm), LY294002 (20 μm), or PD98059 (30 μm) for 20 min prior to the addition of PDGF. Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer mentioned above and spun for 10 min. Antibodies to IRS-1, pY20, or p85 were added to supernatants overnight at 4 °C. Recombinant protein A-agarose or anti-mouse IgG agarose was added for 2–4 h at 4 °C to precipitate IRS-1 complex or p85 and pY20 protein complexes, respectively. Pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer. Laemmli's buffer was added to the pellets and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 5 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with IRS-1, pY20, or RC-20 antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (except in the case of RC-20), proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was determined by a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1. 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 12 days postdifferentiation, were preincubated with or without PDGF for 90 min followed by 10 min of insulin stimulation. The translocation assay was performed as described previously (17Haruta T. Morris A.J. Rose D.W. Nelson J.G. Mueckler M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and incubated with anti-GLUT4 (1F8) antibody overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, a second incubation was performed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min. Cells positive for GLUT4 translocation show an increase in plasma membrane-associated fluorescent staining. The percentage of cells positive for GLUT4 translocation was determined by analyzing 150–200 cells. For glucose transport, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 12 or 15 days postdifferentiation, were washed four times with KRP-Hepes containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm pyruvic acid, pH 7.4. Cells were then stimulated at 37 °C with 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml insulin for 10 min or with 10 or 50 ng/ml PDGF for 60 or 90 min or pretreated with PDGF for various times followed by 10 min of insulin stimulation. Following stimulation, cells were removed from the incubator, and the buffer was replaced with room temperature buffer. Glucose uptake was assessed by the addition of 0.1 mm 2-deoxyglucose containing 0.2 μCi of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose as described previously (18Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E291-E296PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific uptake was assessed by the addition of 0.1 mml-glucose containing 0.2 μCi ofl-[3H]glucose. The reaction was stopped by aspiration and extraneous glucose was removed by four washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 1 nNaOH, and uptake was assessed by scintillation counting. Samples were normalized for protein content. Adipocytes were stimulated at 37 °C with 100 ng/ml insulin for 10 min or with 50 ng/ml PDGF for 10, 60, or 90 min, or they were pretreated with 50 ng/ml PDGF for 60 or 90 min followed by 100 ng/ml insulin for 10 min. Cells were or were not pretreated with wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (20 μm) for 20 min prior to the addition of PDGF. Cells were lysed in the buffer mentioned above and spun for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Equal fractions of the total lysates were mixed 1:1 with 2× Laemmli's buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. Following blocking, membranes were incubated with antibodies to Akt, phospho-Akt, or phospho-p70s6kinase for 2–4 h at room temperature, and a blotting procedure was followed according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Activation of PI3K by the tyrosine kinase receptors for insulin, PDGF, and EGF has been well documented. However, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, only insulin and PDGF can activate PI3K (13Wiese R.J. Mastik C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Both activated PI3K rapidly, within 1–5 min following stimulation (Fig. 1). However, the time course of activation differed for these two growth factors. The insulin-induced PI3K activity precipitable by either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-IRS-1 antibodies was maintained for up to 3 h (Fig. 1, A and B). As assessed in anti-phosphotyrosine precipitates, PDGF-induced PI3K activity peaked at approximately 1–2 min, sharply decreases by 30 min and was undetectable 60 min after stimulation (Fig. 1 C). PDGF-stimulated PI3K activity in IRS-1 antibody precipitates was negligible (data not shown). The ability of insulin to maintain a sustained activation of PI3K may contribute to insulin-specific biological effects. We wanted to determine whether the down-regulation of PI3K activity seen following 60 min of PDGF treatment could inhibit the ability of insulin to stimulate PI3K activity. We treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 50 ng/ml PDGF for various times followed by 5 min of 100 ng/ml insulin stimulation. PI3K activity was immunoprecipitated with phosphotyrosine or IRS-1 antibodies. Insulin-stimulated, phosphotyrosine-precipitated, PI3K activity was dramatically inhibited by preincubation with PDGF and was reduced to basal levels by 60 min of PDGF pretreatment (Fig. 2 A). Insulin-stimulated, IRS-1-precipitated PI3K activity was partially inhibited by 60 min of PDGF pretreatment, but 90 min of PDGF reduced insulin-stimulated PI3K to basal levels (Fig. 2 B). To confirm these results, we assessed the ability of PI3K to associate with IRS-1 by co-precipitation and Western blotting. 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated with insulin for 5 min, PDGF for 5 or 90 min, or PDGF for 90 min followed by insulin for 5 min. PI3K was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-p85 antibodies. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, the immunoprecipitated proteins were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig. 2 C, insulin stimulation led to the association of PI3K with IRS-1 (second lane from left). PDGF stimulation led to a transient association of PI3K with the PDGF receptor that was no longer apparent following 90 min of PDGF stimulation (third and fourth lanes). Preincubation of the cells for 90 min with PDGF followed by 5 min of insulin decreased the insulin-induced association of PI3K with IRS-1 (right lane). The ability of PDGF to inhibit insulin-stimulated PI3K may be due to inhibition of the insulin signal transduction pathway that leads to the activation of PI3K. As indicated in Fig. 2 C, IRS-1, the major route by which insulin activates PI3K, is a likely target for the PDGF effect. To assess this idea, we stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PDGF for various times followed by insulin stimulation for 5 min. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with antibodies to the C terminus of IRS-1 (Fig. 3 A, top panel) or to phosphotyrosine residues (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). Proteins were blotted with a phosphotyrosine antibody. As seen in Fig. 3 A, insulin alone caused tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the insulin receptor β subunit (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), whereas PDGF alone led to tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor and a 120–130-kDa protein(s) (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). However, with increasing times of PDGF pretreatment, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was inhibited, and after 90 min of PDGF pretreatment, IRS-1 phosphorylation was decreased by approximately 60% (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–9). Interestingly, PDGF-induced autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor was transient, returning to basal values by 30–45 min. (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6–9). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin for 5 min following PDGF stimulation for various times. IRS-1 was precipitated from cell lysates following Western blotting with an IRS-1 antibody. The same antibody was used for blotting. As seen in Fig. 3 B, an IRS-1 gel shift occurred following PDGF stimulation and was evident within 45 min of PDGF treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Thus, the inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was paralleled by a decreased electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1, indicating serine or threonine phosphorylation (14De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It is important to note that whereas PDGF inhibited IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A), IRS-1 expression was not affected by PDGF pretreatment (Fig. 3 B). PDGF efficiently activated both the PI3K and MAPK pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (13Wiese R.J. Mastik C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that PI3K, MAPK, or proteins downstream of these pathways were responsible for the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1. We used the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to determine whether either of these proteins is involved. As shown in Fig. 3 B, pretreatment with LY294002 or wortmannin reversed the PDGF-induced IRS-1 gel shift. Pretreatment with PD98059 caused a modest reversal of the IRS-1 gel shift (14De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), but the effect was not as great as that observed with the PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–7). These results indicate that PI3K or a protein downstream of PI3K is involved in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 but that MAPK does not play a major role. This is consistent with previous reports that PI3K phosphorylates IRS-1 on serine residues in vitro (11Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tanti J.-F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine phosphorylation and corresponding decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 may act in concert to prevent the association of PI3K with IRS-1. It has previously been shown that activation of PI3K is a necessary step for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (19Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), and it is known that activated PI3K is sufficient for this biologic effect (5Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 7Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, because PDGF pretreatment has a major inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated PI3K activity, we evaluated the impact of PDGF treatment on insulin-stimulated glucose transport. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin or PDGF or were pretreated with PDGF for various times followed by insulin stimulation. As seen in Fig. 4 A, insulin alone caused a severalfold increase in glucose transport, whereas PDGF alone had only a modest effect. Importantly, preincubation of adipocytes with PDGF for up to 60 min did not inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport. This is in contrast to the marked effect of PDGF pretreatment to almost completely inhibit insulin-stimulated IRS-1-precipitated or antiphosphotyrosine antibody-precipitated PI3K activity. In the above experiments, insulin was used at a maximally effective concentration, and it seemed possible that an inhibitory effect of PDGF pretreatment might be elicited at submaximal insulin levels. Thus, we conducted insulin dose-response studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with and without PDGF pretreatment. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 B, a 90-min PDGF pretreatment had no effect on insulin-induced glucose transport throughout the insulin concentration range. The inability of PDGF to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport, despite its marked inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated PI3K activity, does not mean that PI3K activation is unnecessary for glucose transport stimulation. In fact, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was fully effective at inhibiting insulin-stimulated glucose transport with and without PDGF treatment (Fig. 4 B). In parallel experiments, we directly measured GLUT4 translocation. Following insulin stimulation, cells were fixed and permeabilized and GLUT4 translocation was visualized with immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-GLUT4 antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (17Haruta T.

The formation of a fluorescent ring around the cell surface indicates that a cell is positive for GLUT4 translocation, whereas diffuse fluorescent staining is scored as negative (17Haruta T.

The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 5, which shows that PDGF pretreatment did not inhibit the subsequent effect of insulin to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, because PDGF alone does not stimulate GLUT 4 translocation (21Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is likely that the modest effect of PDGF to increase glucose transport involves stimulation of GLUT1 translocation. It has been suggested that the activation of Akt (protein kinase B), a serine/threonine kinase downstream of PI3K, is necessary for several metabolic effects of insulin, including GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake, and glycogen synthase activation. Therefore, we sought to determine t"

We show here that this specificity is controlled by a proximal promoter (−230/+16) in transfected cardiac cells in culture, in the adult hearts, and in transgenic animals. Functional analysis indicates that MEF2/Oct-1, Sp1, and GATA regulatory elements are required for optimal gene activation because selective mutations produce weak or inactive promoters. MEF2 and Oct-1 transcription factors bind to the same A/T-rich element. A mutation that blocks this binding markedly reduces gene activation in vivo and in vitro, and overexpression of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D in noncardiac cells transactivates the cardiac troponin I promoter. Disruption of these elements inactivates the cardiac troponin I promoter in cultured cardiac cells but has a less important role in transfected adult heart. Moreover, nuclear extracts from an almost pure population of adult cardiac cells contain much lower levels of GATA binding activity compared with fetal cardiac cells. These findings point to a differential role of GATA factors in the maintenance of gene expression in the adult heart as compared with the activation of cardiac genes in fetal cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of GATA family members transactivates the cardiac troponin I promoter, and GATA-5 and GATA-6 are stronger transactivators than GATA-4, a property apparently unique to the cardiac troponin I promoter. Transgenic mice carrying the −230/+126 base pair promoter express β-galactosidase reporter gene in the heart both at early stages of cardiogenesis and in the adult animals. These results indicate that the ability of the cardiac troponin I proximal promoter to target expression of a downstream gene in the heart is also maintained when the transgene is integrated into the genome.

Heart formation is characterized by coordinated morphogenetic events and progressive differentiation of the cardiomyocytes. Little is yet known about the genetic pathways that control cardiac morphogenesis, and the molecular bases of the activation of the cardiac differentiation program are even less understood. Homologous recombination models have recently shown that GATA, MEF2, Nkx 2.5, and HAND family members are major regulatory factors that specify the cardiogenic program and control the first steps of cardiac morphogenesis (1Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Science. 1996; 272: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Fishman M.C. Olson E.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of these factors to cardiogenesis, specification of the cardiac lineage, and maintenance of the differentiation state in the developing and adult heart remain to be established. Cardiac embryogenesis is altered in mice lacking GATA-4, but cardiac cells do form and seem to differentiate properly (3Molkentin J.D. Lin Q. Duneau S.A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 4Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmaceck M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 10: 1048-1060Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of Nkx 2.5 also produces early mortality due to abnormal cardiac development, but cardiac cells are present and express an almost normal pattern of sarcomeric proteins (5Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Promoter analyses, on the other hand, have shown that MEF2 and GATA proteins are involved in the regulation of many cardiac genes (6Navankasattusas S. Zhu H. Garcia A.V. Evans S.M. Chien K.R. Mol.

For example, GATA binding sites are sufficient to activate the B-natriuretic peptide (BNP)1 gene in cardiac cells (7Grépin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh T. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), whereas a single HF-1b/MEF2 site is crucial to activate the MLC2v gene both in vitro (6Navankasattusas S. Zhu H. Garcia A.V. Evans S.M. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and in transgenic animals (11Ross R.S. Navankasattusas S. Harvey R.P. Chien K.C. Development. 1996; 122: 1799-1809PubMed Google Scholar).We have used the cardiac troponin I (cTNI) gene as a model to investigate the molecular basis of cardiac gene regulation. The cTNI gene encodes for the cardiac specific inhibitory subunit of the troponin complex, one of the few sarcomeric proteins identified to date that is exclusively expressed in cardiac muscle (12Ausoni S. De Nardi C. Moretti P. Gorza L. Schiaffino S. Development. 1991; 112: 1041-1051PubMed Google Scholar, 13Murphy A.M. Jones L. Sims H.F. Strauss A.W.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In an attempt to investigate the molecular bases of tissue specificity, the mouse homologue was cloned and characterized (15Ausoni S. Campione M. Picard A. Moretti P. Vitadello M. De Nardi C. Schiaffino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 339-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By progressive deletion of a 4-kilobase pair region, we identified both proximal and distal positive regulatory domains separated by a negative region. However, specific elements responsible for the tissue-specific regulation of the cTNI gene were not characterized. Recently, a GATA element near the transcriptional start site has been shown to regulate the rat cTNI promoter in vitro (16Murphy A.M. Thompson W.R. Peng L.F. Jones L. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); however, it has not been established whether this element is sufficient per se for full gene activation and whether other elements are essential for promoter function.In this study, we focused on the proximal 5′-flanking region of the cTNI gene using three different approaches: in vivotransfection through DNA injection into the adult heart, in vitro transfection into cultured fetal cardiomyocytes, and generation of transgenic animals. Promoter analyses on cardiac genes have been mostly performed using in vitro transfection, but there are a few examples of in vivo studies (17Parmaceck M.S. Vora A.J. Shen T. Barr E. Jung F.

Differences between regulation in vivo and in vitro have been described for the α-MHC gene (18Buttrick P.M. Kaplan M.L. Kitsis R.N. Leinwand L.A. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the specific elements responsible for this differential response have not been identified. We report here that a short segment (−230/+16) of the proximal cTNI promoter is sufficient to confer tissue specificity to a reporter gene in both systems. Functional analyses and protein binding activities demonstrate that functional GATA, Sp1, and MEF2/Oct-1 elements are required for optimal gene activation. However, the specific contribution of these GATA elements varies in fetal cardiac cells in vitro as compared with terminally differentiated cardiac cells in vivo. GATA binding activity to the cTNI promoter is clearly down-regulated in the adult heart, as we demonstrate here by gel shift analysis using nuclear extracts from an almost pure population of adult cardiomyocytes.Analysis of the cTNI promoter has also been performed in transgenic mice. Strong activation of the cTNI/lacZ transgene was detected in the heart both at early developmental stages and in the adult animals. Moreover, expression of the transgene at early developmental stages resembles that of the endogenous gene, thus indicating that the proximal promoter contains information to specify cTNI gene expression in the heart and that this property is maintained when integration into the genome occurs.RESULTSGA-rich, A/T-rich, and GATA Elements Are Required for cTNI Gene RegulationSequence analysis of the mouse cTNI promoter region from −230 to +16 revealed several putative protein binding sites, including GA-rich sequences, two of which are indicated as S1 and S2; GATA elements indicated as G1, G2, and G3; and an A/T-rich element (Fig. 1 A). Two GATA elements (G1 and G2) lie closely associated between −67 and −57 of the promoter, whereas G3 lies at −7, just upstream of the gene transcriptional start site. Two GATA elements are also present in the rat (16Murphy A.M. Thompson W.R. Peng L.F. Jones L. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and human (31Bhavsar P.K. Brand N.J. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J.R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) gene, approximately at the same positions. The A/T-rich element lying at position −36 of the promoter has 90% homology with the MEF2 consensus 5′-CTA(A/T)4TAA/G-3′ (32Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and 50% homology with the Oct-1 consensus 5′-ATGCAAAT-3′ (33Hinkley C. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and represents a noncanonical TATA box. An identical A/T-rich element is present in the rat (16Murphy A.M. Thompson W.R. Peng L.F. Jones L. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the human (31Bhavsar P.K. Brand N.J. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J.R. Genomics. 1996; 35: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) cTNI gene.We used deletion and mutation analyses to assess the contribution of these cis-acting elements and their relative transcription factors to gene activation (Fig. 1 B). Each construct was tested in vitro in fetal cultured cardiac cells and in vivo by direct DNA injection into the left ventricular wall of adult hearts. Results of transfections are summarized in Fig. 2. The role of the GA-rich sequences S1 and S2 was analyzed by producing constructs −145/+16 and −127/+16, which contain only one or no GA-rich element. These deletions progressively reduced in vitro promoter activity (Fig. 2 A), but only deletion of S2 had some effect in vivo (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Functional role of cTNIcis-acting elements in vitro and in vivo. A, cTNI constructs were transfected in cardiac cells and 3T3NIH cells. Values are expressed as -fold increase over the promoterless construct, whose activity accounted for 3.02 ± 0.47 in 3T3NIH cella and 2.06 ± 0.17 in cardiac cells. Values represent ((CAT activities/β-galactosidase activity) × 100) ± S.E. Each construct was tested in a minimum of four independent determinations for 3T3NIH cells and in a minimum of six independent determinations for the cardiac cells. B, the same cTNI constructs were transfected in adult rat hearts. Values are expressed as -fold increase over the promoterless construct, whose activity accounted for 0.16 ± 0.025. Values represent ((CAT activities/protein content) × 100) ± S.E. CAT activity and protein content were tested using 5% of homogenate. Numbers of independent determinations are indicated for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The contribution of GATA elements to tissue specificity and efficiency of expression was determined by mutation of G1, G2, and G3. Sequence GATA was changed into CACA in the first sets of constructs (mI). Mutation in G1/G2 and G3 reduced activity in vitro but had a weak effect or no significant effect in vivo. As expected, simultaneous mutation of G1, G2, and G3 had a dramatic effect in vitro but a weak effect in vivo (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained by introduction of a second type of mutation that changed sequence GATA into GCCA (mII) (Fig. 2). Thus, GATA elements control cTNI gene expression but with substantial quantitative differences in vitro in fetal cultured cardiac cells and in vivo in adult hearts.Mutation of the cTNI A/T-rich element also produced a greater reduction of activity in vitro than in vivo (Fig. 2,A and B). The cTNI A/T-rich element is a noncanonical TATA box potentially able to bind the transcription factor IID. To determine that mutation in this site did not alter basal promoter activity, we cloned the wild type promoter −230/+16 and the A/T-rich mutant in a pCAT Enhancer vector carrying the SV40 enhancer downstream of the CAT reporter gene and performed a functional test in 3T3NIH cells. The A/T-rich mutation did not affect basal promoter activity, which was even higher compared with the wild type promoter. Normalized CAT values of the promoterless enhancer CAT, the −230/+16 enhancer CAT, and A/T-rich m Enhancer CAT were 4.5 ± 0.3, 66.4 ± 2.7 and 210.8 ± 16.1, respectively. Thus, an A/T-rich element controls cTNI gene expression over its basal transcription levels both in vitro in fetal cultured cardiac cells and in vivo in the adult heart.Mutation of the GA-rich, A/T-rich, and GATA elements of the cTNI promoter was also tested in 3T3NIH cells, where the wild type construct is constitutively expressed at very low levels (Fig. 2 A). We observed that each mutation slightly reduced promoter activity and that this reduction was higher with deletion of the two GA-rich elements and with (G1/G2/G3)mI mutant. A modest but statistically significant increase of activity was obtained with (G1/G2/G3)mII mutant.Nuclear Proteins MEF2, Oct-1, Sp1, and GATA Bind to the Proximal cTNI PromoterTransient expression analyses indicate that GA-rich elements, GATA elements, and the A/T-rich element are required for optimal expression of the cTNI promoter in cardiac cells. To characterize transcription factors binding to these sequences, we used EMSAs with DNA probes encompassing the potential cis-regulatory elements and nuclear extracts from cultured cardiac cells. Oligonucleotide probes and competitors used in this study are shown in Table I.Factors Binding to the cTNI GA-rich ElementsProtein binding to the cTNI GA-rich sequences was assessed by using probes corresponding to elements S1 and S2. Nuclear extracts from cultured cardiac cells produced a major shifted complex (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 7). This complex was efficiently self-competed (lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9), was removed by the addition of a canonical Sp1 target sequence (lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11), and was supershifted by an anti-Sp1 antibody (lanes 6 and 12). Additional complexes were observed by using probe S2 and were competed off by a canonical Sp1 sequence. Supershift by the anti-Sp1 antibody (lane 12) removed the major complex without affecting the others. To elucidate further the nature of the other complexes, antibodies specific for Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 were tested. The anti-Sp3 antibody (Fig. 3, lane 15) removed one of these bands and gave a slight supershift, whereas no change was observed with the anti-Sp2 and -Sp4 antibodies (lanes 14 and 16). No Sp1 binding activity was observed with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the GA-rich sequence at −212/−200 of the promoter (not shown).Figure 3cTNI GA-rich motifs are target for Sp1. Nuclear extracts from cultured cells (4 μg) were mixed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the cTNI GA-rich elements S1 (lane 1) and S2 (lane 7). Competitions were carried out with 50- and 100-fold molar excess of self-competitor (lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9) and a canonical Sp1 sequence (lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11). An antibody that recognizes Sp1 (Sp-1 Ab) supershifted the Sp1 band both with S1 (lane 6) and S2 (lane 12) probes. Antibodies specific for Sp2 (Sp-2 Ab, lane 14), Sp3 (Sp-3 Ab, lane 15), and Sp4 (Sp-4 Ab, lane 16) were also tested with the S2 probe. The position of the Sp1 binding activity is indicated by arrows. A dash indicates the position of complexes supershifted by Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Factors Binding to the cTNI A/T-rich ElementEMSAs with the cTNI A/T-rich element and cardiac nuclear extracts gave a more prominent complex and a weaker slow migrating band (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Both complexes were self-competed (lanes 2 and 3). The slower migrating complex was completely removed by the addition of either the MCK MEF2 site (lanes 4 and 5) or the MLC2v MEF2 site (lanes 6 and 7). The faster migrating complex, on the other hand, was efficiently removed by the addition of a canonical Oct-1 sequence (lanes 10 and 11) but not by the canonical MCK MEF2 nor by the MLC2v MEF2 sites. Neither complex was removed by the A/T-rich m mutant (lanes 8 and 9). The slower but not the faster migrating complex was supershifted by an antibody specific for MEF2A but not by antisera against MEF2B and MEF2D (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–4). The faster migrating complex, on the other hand, was supershifted by an anti-Oct-1 antibody, which, in turn, had no effect on the MEF2 complex (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). The addition of nonimmune sera as a control did not interfere with the binding (not shown), thus indicating the specificity of the protein-antibody interactions. In conclusion, the A/T-rich sequence of the cTNI promoter is a complex site that binds at least two transcription factors, MEF2 and Oct-1. Binding of MEF2 factor(s) to the cTNI promoter was rather weak, whereas a strong signal was observed by testing the same nuclear extracts with either a consensus Oct-1 or a MEF2 site (not shown).Figure 4The cTNI A/T-rich element is target for MEF2 and Oct-1 transcription factors. A, cardiac nuclear extracts from cultured cells (4 μg) were mixed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the cTNI A/T-rich element. Two major complexes, indicated with arrows to theleft, were shifted (lane 1). Both complexes were removed by the addition of 50- and 100-fold molar excess of self-competitor (lanes 2 and 3). The slowly migrating complex was removed by the addition of oligonucleotides corresponding to MCK MEF2 (lanes 4 and 5) and MLC2v MEF2 (lanes 6 and 7). This complex was not removed by the addition of an oligonucleotide containing the mutated cTNI A/T-rich element (A/T-rich m) (lanes 8 and 9). The faster migrating complex, on the other hand, was removed by the addition of an oligonucleotide specific for Oct-1 (lanes 10 and 11). B, nuclear extracts from cardiac cells (4 μg) were tested with the cTNI A/T-rich element in the absence of antibody (lanes 1 and 5) and in the presence of antibodies specific for MEF2A (lane 2), MEF2B (lane 3), MEF2D (lane 4) and Oct-1 (lane 6). The slowly migrating complex was supershifted by an anti-MEF2A antibody, while the faster migrating complex was supershifted by an anti-Oct-1 antibody (arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Factors Binding to the cTNI GATA ElementsOligonucleotide probes containing GATA element G1/G2 and GATA element G3 gave a strong shift when incubated with nuclear extracts from cultured cardiac cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 11). This complex was readily removed by the self-competitors (lanes 2, 12, and 13) and by GATA sequences from the BNP (lanes 9, 10, 14, and 15). In contrast, it was not removed by G1m/G2m and G3m mutants (lanes 7, 8, 16, and 17).Figure 5The cTNI GATA elements bind GATA transcription factor(s). The cTNI GATA binding activities are down-regulated in the adult heart. A, nuclear extracts (4 μg) from cultured cardiomyocytes were probed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to either element G1/G2 or element G3 of the cTNI promoter. A strong complex was shifted in both cases (lanes 1 and 11) and was removed by the addition of 50- and 100-fold molar excess of self competitor (lanes 2, 12, and 13) and BNP GATA (lanes 9, 10, 14, and 15). In contrast, the mutated G1m/G2m (lanes 7 and 8) and G3m (lanes 16and 17) oligonucleotides did not remove this complex. G1/G2m competed efficiently for binding (lanes 5 and 6), whereas G1m/G2 had little effect (lanes 3 and 4). B, 2 and 4 μl of an antibody that recognizes GATA-4 (GATA Ab) gave a strong but partial supershift of the GATA complex both with G1/G2 (lanes 2 and 4) and G3 probes (lanes 6 and 8). The addition of the nonimmune serum (n.i. Ab) had no effect (lanes 3 and 7). Note that two different concentrations of the specific antibody (2 and 4 μl) gave the same partial supershift. The supershifted band is indicated by arrows.C, nuclear extracts from cultured fetal cardiac cells and adult rat cardiomyocytes were tested with Oct-1 and G1/G2 probes. Labeled probes were adjusted to equal specific activity. Increasing amounts (2, 4, and 6 μg) of adult nuclear extracts were compared with the signal obtained with 2 μg of nuclear extracts from cultured cardiac cells. Note that even at the highest protein concentration adult nuclear extracts gave a barely detectable signal for GATA, whereas a strong signal for Oct-1 was detected with an Oct-1-specific probe. 24 μg of adult nuclear extracts were also tested with G3 and G1/G2 probes and the anti-GATA-4 antibody. The antibody supershifted most, but not all, of the GATA complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GATA elements G1 and G2 are closely associated in the cTNI sequence and potentially able to cooperate for protein binding. To examine binding preferences of the GATA complex for G1 and G2, mobility shift to G1/G2 probe was competed with an oligonucleotide containing either mutated G1 and intact G2 (G1m/G2) or mutated G2 and intact G1 (G1/G2m). G1m/G2 competed weakly for protein binding activity (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4), whereas G1/G2m blocked complex formation even at the lowest concentration (lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest that integrity of both GATA elements is required for maximal binding and, nevertheless, that G1 and G2 differ, at least for protein-DNA affinity.The nature of the cTNI GATA binding activity was further explored by supershift with an anti GATA-4 antibody (Fig. 5 B). Complex obtained with G1/G2 probe and G3 probe was partially supershifted (lanes 2 and 6), whereas the addition of nonimmune serum gave no effect (lanes 3 and 7). Excess antibody (4 μl) in the reactions did not change the level of supershift, thus suggesting that factors other than GATA-4 probably contribute to the complexes.Our functional analysis showed that mutations within the cTNI GATA elements have a strong effect in vitro in fetal cultured cardiac cells but less effect in vivo in the adult heart. We asked whether different protein-DNA interactions or different levels of the same binding activity were detectable in nuclear extracts from adult hearts as compared with cultured cardiac cells. Probe G1/G2 was tested by EMSAs using constant amounts of nuclear extracts from cultured cells (2 μg) and increasing amounts (2, 4, and 6 μg) of nuclear extracts obtained from an almost pure population of cardiomyocytes from adult rat hearts. Identical analysis was performed with an Oct-1 probe, for comparison. As shown in Fig. 5 C, cardiac extracts shifted the same GATA complex, but signals were much weaker with adult cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, signals obtained with the Oct-1 probe were similar, suggesting that low GATA activity in the adult heart was not due to poor quality of nuclear extracts.The low GATA binding activity in adult cardiomyocytes was tested with the anti GATA-4 antibody. 24 μg of extracts were tested with probe G3 and probe G1/G2 in the presence of excess antibody. The complex was only partially supershifted in both cases, again suggesting that factors other than GATA-4 may contribute to the complex.GATA and MEF2 Factors Transactivate the cTNI GeneThe functional role of GATA elements was further tested by transactivation of the cTNI promoter in 3T3NIH cells. Cells were cotransfected with the −230/+16 promoter and increasing amounts of expression vectors (0.2, 2, or 4 μg of DNA). Under these conditions, transfection of 2 μg of expression plasmid gave a sufficient amount of protein so as to be fully detectable by gel shift analysis (not shown). Overexpression of GATA-4 had a modest transactivation ability. In contrast, GATA-5 and GATA-6 were able to transactivate the promoter to much higher levels up to about 6- and 13-fold increase of activity, respectively (Fig. 6).Figure 6GATA and MEF2 factors transactivate the cTNI promoter in 3T3NIH cells. 3T3NIH cells were transfected using the −230/+16 cTNI reporter gene and various amounts of GATA-4, GATA-5, GATA-6, MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D expression vectors. All transfections were performed using 12 μg of reporter, 0.2 (+), 2 (++), or 4 (+++) μg of expression vector and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase as internal control. Values represent -fold induction and are the average of three independent determinations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transactivation ability of MEF2 was also tested in 3T3NIH cells, which are known to express Oct-1 but not MEF2 proteins. Overexpression of MEF2A gave the highest transactivation corresponding to an 8-fold increase of activity, whereas a weaker effect was observed with MEF2C and MEF2D (Fig. 6). While transactivation increased with increasing amounts of MEF2C expression vectors, the highest transactivation was observed with the lowest concentration of MEF2A and MEF2D expression vectors.A Proximal cTNI Promoter Shows Cardiac Specific Expression in Transgenic MiceIn light of the finding that a very short segment of the cTNI promoter was highly active both in vitro in fetal cultured cardiac cells and in vivo in adult hearts, we tested the minimal promoter in transgenic mice. For this purpose, the same promoter region was fused to the first cTNI exon sequences up to nucleotide +126, and the resulting transgene −230/+126 was cloned upstream of a lacZ reporter gene containing a nuclear leader sequence.

Although Ids affect myogenesis, neurogenesis, and B-cell development, little is known about theirin vivo functions in epithelia. We have examined the effects of forced expression of Id-1 in the small intestinal epithelium of adult chimeric mice. 129/Sv embryonic stem cells, transfected with DNA containing Id-1 under the control of transcriptional regulatory elements that function in all intestinal epithelial cell lineages, were introduced into C57Bl/6 (B6) blastocysts heterozygous for theROSA26 marker. The B6 ROSA26/+ intestinal epithelium of the resulting adult chimeras produces Escherichia coli β-galactosidase, allowing identification of this internal control cell population. Chimeras produced from nontransfected embryonic stem cells served as additional controls. Immunohistochemical studies of the control chimeras indicated that the small intestinal epithelium supports a complex pattern of endogenous Id expression. Id-1 is restricted to the cytoplasm; levels do not decrease as descendants of multipotent intestinal stem cells differentiate. Id-2 and Id-3 are only detectable in nuclei; levels increase markedly as epithelial cells differentiate. Forced expression of Id-1 in the 129/Sv epithelium results in a decline in Id-2 and Id-3 to below the limits of immunodetection. A subset of chimeric-transgenic mice lacked growth factor- and defensin-producing Paneth cells in their 129/Sv epithelium and also developed intestinal adenomas. These changes were not present in normal control chimeras. Adenomas were composed of proliferating β-Gal-positive and -negative epithelial cells, suggesting that they arose through cooperative interactions between 129/Sv(Id-1) and B6ROSA26/+ cells.

Dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 transcription factors play important roles in cellular development. Their HLH domain promotes dimer formation, while their basic domain mediates binding to an E-box sequence (CANNTG) present in target genes. Homodimers of class B, tissue-specific bHLHs activate transcription of “master regulatory” bHLHs that allow cells to commit to a particular fate. Tissue-specific bHLHs can also form heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed class A bHLHs (also known as E-proteins). These heterodimers activate transcription of genes associated with differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Kadesch T. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

The mouse intestinal epithelium has two features that make it attractive for examining the effects of Id expression. First, it renews itself rapidly and continuously throughout life. Proliferation, lineage allocation, differentiation, and death are confined to readily identifiable regions in each of the adult intestine's crypt-villus units: i.e. cells at all developmental stages are represented. Second, this epithelium is known to produce several (b)HLH proteins (28Wang Y. Benezra R. Sassoon D.A. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Biggs J. Murphy E.V.

Epithelial cells are allocated to four principal lineages through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Committed cells belonging to each lineage complete their differentiation during a highly organized, rapid migration. Differentiating absorptive enterocytes, mucus-producing goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells exit the crypt and move up an adjacent finger-like structure (the villus) in coherent columns (41Schmidt G.H. Milkinson M.M. Ponder B.A.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42Hermiston M.L. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I.

Anat. 1974; 141: 521-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). One of the intestine's known bHLH proteins, BETA2/NeuroD, regulates expression of secretin, a peptide produced during terminal differentiation of a subset of enteroendocrine cells (32Mutoh H. Fung B.P. Naya F.H. Tsai M.-J. Nishitani J. Leiter A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3560-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Another bHLH protein, MATH-1, is related toatonal, a master regulator of neurogenesis and is expressed almost exclusively in the intestinal epithelium of adult mice (31Akazawa C. Ishibashi M. Shimizu C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8730-8738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Its function is unknown. There are several reasons why we decided to assess the effects of forced expression of Id-1 on intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Id-1 is normally expressed at a critical point in gut development, embryonic day 16, when the endoderm begins to undergo cytodifferentiation to an epithelial monolayer. At this time, the intestinal epithelium is one of the few sites where Id-1 mRNA levels are high (28Wang Y. Benezra R. Sassoon D.A. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, forced expression of Id-1 in many cultured cell lines has been shown to inhibit bHLH-regulated differentiation (10Jen Y.

In this report, we describe the use of chimeric mice to assess effects of Id-1 on the accumulation of other Ids and on intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Surprisingly, a subset of these mice developed intestinal adenomas. A DNA fragment derived from nucleotides 4–558 of mouse Id-1 mRNA (5Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) was produced by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using small intestinal RNA from a 3-month-old C57Bl/6 (B6) animal. Each PCR primer contained a BamHI restriction site at its 5′ end (5′-GAATTCGGATCCGTACAACCTTTCTCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGGATCCATCTGGTCCCTCAGTGC-3′). The PCR product was purified and subcloned into the T/A vector (InVitrogen). Sequence analysis confirmed that no errors had been introduced during the amplification. A 576-base pair BamHI fragment, containing the mouse Id-1 open reading frame and stop codon, was excised from the T/A vector and inserted into pL596hGHpNeoΔB2 (42Hermiston M.L. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) at its uniqueBamHI site to produce pLF/Id-1. This resulted in placement of the Id-1 open reading frame at nucleotide +3 of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene, and under the control of nucleotides −596 to +21 of a rat fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl; Refs. 54Sweetser D.A.

Id-1 contains the first in-frame Met codon in this recombinant DNA so that Id-1, but not hGH, is produced from the mRNA transcript. A pgk-neomyocin resistance selection cassette is located just downstream of hGH in pLF/Id-1. A 5.3-kilobase pair DNA fragment, containingFabpl-Id-1-hGH-pgkneo, was excised from pLF/Id-1 with SacII, purified, and used to transfect D3 129/Sv embryonic stem (ES) cells (56Doetschman T.C.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Two independently clonedFabpl-Id-1 ES cell lines were injected (separately) into B6ROSA26/+ blastocysts (58Wong M.H. Hermiston M.L. Syder A.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9588-9593Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to generate B6ROSA26/+ ↔ 129/Sv(Id-1) chimeric-transgenic mice. Control “normal” B6 ROSA26/+ ↔ 129/Sv chimeras were generated using nontransfected D3 ES cells. All animals were maintained in microisolator cages in a barrier facility and given Pico Lab Rodent Diet 20 (Purina Mills) ad libitum. Routine screens of sentinel mice for hepatitis, minute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, ectromelia, polyoma, Sendai, pneumonia, and adenoviruses plus enteric bacterial pathogens and parasites were negative. Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of an aqueous solution of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and 5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (12 mg and 1.2 mg/g body weight, respectively) in order to label cells in S phase. Animals were sacrificed 90 min later. The entire small intestine was removed en bloc. The proximal third was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and used as a source of total cellular RNA to verify transgene expression (see below). The remaining distal two-thirds of the small intestine was flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), followed by periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde (PLP; Ref. 59McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The segments were then opened with a longitudinal incision along their cephalocaudal axis and pinned, serosal side down, on dissecting wax. Following fixation with PLP for 1 h at 4 °C, the whole mount preparation was washed with PBS, incubated with gentle shaking in 20 mmdithiothreitol, 20% ethanol, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 45 min at room temperature to remove mucus and then washed again in PBS. To stain β-galactosidase (β-Gal)-producing B6 ROSA26/+ cells, whole mounts were placed in a solution containing PBS, 2 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal), 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 4 mmpotassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2 (final pH=7.6) for 36 h at 40 °C. Some whole mounts were stained with Bluo-Gal instead of X-Gal using the protocol described by its manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following staining, whole mounts were postfixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher) for 4–6 h at room temperature and then stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Segments of X-Gal- or Bluo-Gal-stained intestinal whole mounts were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were cut and collected on glass slides. The sections were deparaffinized using xylene (one cycle of 10 min followed by two cycles of 5 min each), incubated in isopropyl alcohol (three cycles, 5 min each), and then rehydrated in distilled water (5 min). Typically, 300 serial sections were prepared from both the middle and distal thirds of the small intestine of each animal. These regions are referred to as jejunum and ileum, respectively. Sections were cut parallel to the cephalocaudal axis of the intestine: every 30th section was stained with nuclear fast red or hematoxylin and eosin (60Luna L.G. Manual of Histologic Staining Methods of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1968Google Scholar) to assess cellular morphology and crypt-villus architecture. Members of specific cell lineages were visualized in adjacent serial sections using the following histochemical stains (60Luna L.G. Manual of Histologic Staining Methods of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1968Google Scholar): (i) Alcian Blue (detects acidic mucins in goblet cells); (ii) phloxine/tartrazine (visualizes the apical secretory granules of Paneth cells); and (iii) periodate acid Schiff (PAS; detects neutral mucins present in goblet cell mucus globules and Paneth cell granules, as well as glycoconjugates associated with the apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes). Intracellular X-Gal and Bluo-Gal precipitates were not removed during these staining procedures, allowing us to distinguish β-Gal-positive B6 ROSA26/+ epithelium from β-Gal-negative 129/Sv epithelium. Frozen portions of the proximal third of the small intestine from a normal B6 ROSA26/+ ↔ 129/Sv chimera or a B6 ROSA26/+ ↔ 129/Sv(Id-1) chimeric-transgenic mouse were added to RNAzol (Tel-Test; 1 ml of RNAzol/30 mg of tissue) and homogenized with a TissueMizer (Tekmar), and total cellular RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using Avian Myeloblastosis Virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT)12–18 primers according to the supplier's protocol. An aliquot of each reaction was then subjected to PCR as follows. RNA transcripts from the Fabpl-Id-1-hGH transgene were amplified using two different sets of primers. In one set, the upstream and downstream primers (5′-TGAACTCGGAGTCTGAAGTC-3′ and 5′-TTGGCGAAGACACTCCTGAG-3′, respectively) spanned the Id-1/hGH boundary. In the other set, the upstream and downstream primers (5′-CTGCTGCTCATCCAGTCGTG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCTAGAAGCCACAGCTG-3′, respectively) spanned intron 4 of hGH. PCR conditions were as follows: annealing at 60 °C for 30 s; extension at 72 °C for 2 min; denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, for a total of 34 cycles. DNAs representing mRNAs derived from endogenous mouse Id and β-actin genes were also amplified, using primers and cycling conditions described by Riechmann et al. (9Riechmann V. van Crüchen I. Stablitzky F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A panel of previously characterized antibodies was used to define expression of various differentiation markers in each of the four principal small intestinal epithelial cell lineages. In addition, a set of anti-peptide antibodies specific for HLH proteins were used to characterize their cellular and intracellular patterns of accumulation. Staining was performed on paraffin-embedded sections prepared from X-Gal-stained whole mounts. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, placed in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20) for at least 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies: (i) rabbit anti-mouse Id-1 (generated against residues 129–148 of the protein; final concentration of 0.7 μg/ml PBS-blocking buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); (ii) rabbit anti-mouse Id-2 (generated against residues 167–186; 0.7 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (iii) rabbit anti-human Id-3 (residues 98–117; 0.7 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (iv) rabbit anti-human E12/E47 (residues 632–649; 2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (v) goat anti-rat apolipoprotein B (1:500; specific for enterocytes in the small intestine; kindly provided by Patrick Tso, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH); (vi) goat anti-rat apolipoprotein AIV (1:1000; enterocytes; P.

We reason that there may be multiple gene members of Nck to accommodate the large binding repertoires. Here we report identification of novel human and mouse Nck genes and rename them as the Nckα and Nckβ genes (including the human Nckα, human Nckβ, mouse Nckα, and mouse Nckβ genes). Nckα and Nckβ share 68% amino acid identity, whereas the two Nckα and two Nckβ across the species show 96% identity to each other. The human Nckβ gene is mapped to 2q12, whereas the human Nckα gene has previously been mapped at 3q21. Antibodies specifically against Nckα and Nckβ detect Nckα and Nckβ with an identical molecular mass in the same cells of various origins. Ectopically expressed Nckβ, but not its SH2 domain mutant, strongly inhibits epidermal growth factor- and platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. Consistently, epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor preferentially interact with Nckβ over Nckα in vitro. This study indicates that Nck is a multiple gene family and that each gene may have its own signaling specificity. Because previous anti-Nck (human Nckα) antibodies cross-react with Nckβ, reassessment of those studies with specific Nck genes would be necessary.

For example, Grb2 links EGF receptor (EGFR) to Ras by binding to the pYXNV motif (where pY represents phosphotyrosine) in EGFR via its SH2 domain while associating through PPPVPPRRR motifs with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, through the SH3 domains. As a result, Sos is translocated to the plasma membrane, where it activates Ras (5Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr.

A partial cDNA fragment of a mouse Nck homologue, which showed an overall 64% amino acid identity with the human Nck, was initially reported as one of the EGFR-binding proteins (8Margolis B.

We have recently isolated the full-length cDNA of this mouse Nck clone. Nck-like genes have also been identified in Xenopus and in Drosophila (dreadlocks gene, or dork), which share overall 87 and 44% amino acid identity, respectively, with the human Nck gene (9Garrity P.A.

While the function of Nck in these complexes remains elusive, it has been shown that Nck translocates p21-activated kinase to the plasma membrane, and the membrane attachment appears to be sufficient for activating the kinase activity (40Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nck was reported as a proto-oncogene, since elevated expression weakly transformed cultured mouse and chicken fibroblast cells (11Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). While the number of Nck-binding proteins continues to rise, we speculated that Nck may be encoded by a family of genes, in order to accommodate the binding capacity or specificity. In this study, we have undertaken approaches to identify Nck gene homologues and orthologues in humans and mice. We found that both humans and mice have at least two Nck genes, which are even co-expressed in the same cells. More importantly, different Nck play distinct roles in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. A partial mouse Nck cDNA (Grb4) was originally obtained from Ben Margolis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) (8Margolis B. Mohammaddi M. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A human heart cDNA library in ZAP II vector and random primer labeling kit were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The λgt11 cDNA library, constructed from total mRNA of human 293 cells, was used as described previously (41Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mouse pEXLox (+) cDNA expression library was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Mouse embryo (17.5 days) 5′-stretch cDNA library ML1029b and multiple-tissue Northern blots (2 μg of poly(A)+RNA/lane) were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The Oligotex mRNA isolation kit was from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Human recombinant EGF and PDGF-bb were purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Anti-Nck antisera (number 66) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (number 72) were used as described previously (12Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Anti-PDGFR antiserum (number 2879.2) was a gift from John Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Anti-p62DOK antiserum (M276) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-p62DOK antiserum (UCG-25) was raised by our laboratory. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibodies, 12CA5 and HA11, were a gift from Junlin Guan (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA), respectively. The DNA sequencing kit, [α-35S]dATP, and [γ-32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 125I-Protein A was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). DNA templates were labeled by using the Prime It-II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The average specific activity of labeled probes was 1 × 106 cpm/2 ng of DNA. Approximately 1 × 106 cpm/ml was used in hybridization reactions. A cDNA library made from human 293 cells was first screened by the partial mouse Nck cDNA (8Margolis B. Mohammaddi M. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hybridization with the 32P-labeled mouse Nck probe was carried out overnight at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formaldehyde, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 1 × Denhardt's solution. Filters were washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS four times at 65 °C and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. Eight independent phage plaques were isolated from a total of five million phages after tertiary screening. cDNA inserts were subcloned into pBluescript and subjected to nucleotide sequencing analysis. A 5′-stretched human heart cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened for a full-length cDNA clone under the same conditions by using a 32P-labeled cDNA fragment of the newly identified Nck gene. Similarly, to identify novel mouse Nck genes, the mouse embryonic cDNA library (pEXLox (+)) and the mouse embryo 5′-stretch cDNA library (ML1029b, CLONTECH) were screened under high stringency using 32P-labeled human Nck cDNA (7Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) as the probe. Eight independent positive plaques were isolated after three rounds of screening a total of five million phages. Following nucleotide sequencing analysis, a full-length novel mouse Nck cDNA (now termed mouse Nckα) was identified from five of the eight plaques. A DNA sequence encoding three repeats of the nine-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from the influenza virus HA was linked in frame to N termini of the open reading frames of the newly cloned Nckα and Nckβ cDNAs. These HA-Nck fragments were subcloned by PCR into pRK5 expression vector under a cytomegalovirus promotor and a 3′ SV40 enhancer, and the entire Nck sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis. To confirm expression of the HA-tagged Nck genes, these constructs were transiently expressed in COS cells, and Triton X-100 extracts of the cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis using either anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody or antisera (numbers 66 and 68) previously raised against the human Nckα (12Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Nckβ antibodies were raised against the peptide SLRKGASLSNGQGSR, which shares only three amino acids (20%) with the corresponding peptide in the Nckα (this has been established with the assistance of Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Antisera were tested for recognizing HA-tagged human Nckβ. Anti-Nckβ-specific antibodies were further purified by peptide affinity chromatography, and tested for Western immunoblotting assay and immunoprecipitation. We found that the optimal condition for Western immunoblot was 1:500 dilution. This antibody did not appear to work in immunoprecipitations. We previously raised rabbit anti-GST-Nck (human Nckα) fusion protein antisera (number 66; see Ref. 12Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This antiserum recognizes both HA-Nckα and HA-Nckβ (data not shown). To obtain an anti-Nckα-specific antiserum, antiserum 66 was subjected to a GST-Nckβ affinity column to remove the portion of anti-Nckβ antibodies. The flow-through was tested for its specificity of recognizing HA-Nckα. It proved to only recognize HA-Nckα and not HA-Nckβ. Human metaphase cells were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. The biotin-labeled 2-kilobase pair human Nckβ cDNA probe was prepared by nick translation using Bio-11-dUTP (Enzo Diagnostics). Fluorescencein situ hybridization was performed as described previously (42Rowley J.D. Diaz M.O. Espinosa R. Patel Y.D. Van Melle E. Ziemin S. Taillonmiller P. Lichter P. Evens G.A. Kersey J.D. Ward D.C. Domer P.H. LeBeau M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9358-9362Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories), and chromosomes were identified by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Human and mouse multitissue blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and subjected to prehybridization and hybridization according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the RNA blots were incubated in ExpressHyb solution for 3 h at 42 °C without radioactive probes. 32P-dCTP-labeled human and mouse Nckα and Nckβ cDNA probes (1 × 106 cpm/ml, 3 × 105 cpm/ml for GAPDH) were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, added to the reactions, and incubated at 42 °C for 12 h. The membranes were washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS three times at 60 °C and exposed to Kodak XAR film at −70 °C. Mutagenesis was carried out by using QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers that were used to generate human Nckα-R308K and human Nckβ-R312K mutants were as follows: 5′-GGGGATTTCCTCATTAAGGATAGTGAATCTTCGCC and 5′-GGCGAAGATTCACTATCCTTAATGAGGAAATCCCC for the human Nckα and 5′-GGCGACTTCCTCATTAAGGACAGCGAGTCCTCG and 5′-CGAGGACTCGCTGTCCTTAATGAGGAAGTCGCC for the human Nckβ. PCR reactions were carried out, through an overlap extension, by usingPfu DNA polymerase to generate SH2 domain mutants in which the conserved arginine residue in the FLVRES motif was changed to lysine. After DpnI digestion of parental cDNA templates, the mutant clones were transformed into XL1-Blue-competent bacteria, and the plasmids were isolated. Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis. HER14 cells (NIH 3T3 expressing endogenous PDGF receptors (1 × 105 binding sites/cell) and transfected human EGFR (∼4.6 × 105 binding sites/cell)) (45Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and streptomycin/penicillin (50 units/ml). Cells were transfected with individual constructs for 2 h using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of DNA to SuperFect reagent was 1:5, and the total DNA used was 2.5 μg/4 × 105 cells. Three hours following the transfection, media were changed to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 12 h. Cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 h, and EGF (20 ng/ml) and PDGF-bb (20 ng/ml) were added to the culture and incubated for 18 h. 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (ICN; specific activity of 6.7 Ci/mmol) was added to each well and incubated for additional 4 h. Cells were lysed in solution containing 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and 0.1% cold thymidine (w/v), scraped, and subjected to a filter assay, as described previously (44Li W. Hack N. Margolis B. Ullrich A. Skarcki K. Schlessinger J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Following washing, membrane-retained radioactivity was measured in a Packard 2200 CA liquid scintillation counter. Oligonucleotides containing engineered restriction sites (BamHI/EcoRI) were used to amplify the entire coding sequence of Nckα and Nckβ genes by polymerase chain reaction. The DNA fragments were gel-purified, cleaved withBamHI and EcoRI, and repurified prior to being ligated into pGEX-3X vector. Competent XL-1 or BL-21 bacteria were transformed with the constructs, and the recombinant clones were screened for production of the corresponding GST fusion proteins following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (12Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HER14 cultures (80%) were starved in low serum (0.2%) medium for 16 h and treated with or without EGF (500 ng/ml) for 2 min or PDGF-bb (50 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in the lysis buffer as described previously (12Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The postnuclear extracts (total lysates (TL), 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) were incubated with various amounts of the full-length GST-Nck fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the corresponding lysis buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with corresponding antibodies (see figure legends). Results were visualized by125I-protein A and autoradiography. Since an overall 64% amino acid identity between the human Nck (7Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the partial mouse Nck (Grb4; see Ref. 8Margolis B. Mohammaddi M. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was too low to be considered as a pair of orthologue genes between the two species, we screened human cDNA libraries using the partial mouse Nck cDNA, and mouse cDNA libraries using the human Nck cDNA under highly stringent conditions. We aimed to identify a human Nck gene that has higher homology to the mouse Nck gene, and a mouse Nck gene that shares a higher homology to the known human Nck gene. Eight positive clones were isolated from screening human and mouse cDNA libraries. Nucleotide sequencing analyses showed that six of the eight human cDNA clones and five of the eight mouse cDNA clones were different lengths of a novel human and a novel mouse Nck gene, respectively. Full-length cDNA clones of these novel human and mouse Nck genes were obtained by screening 5′-stretched human or mouse cDNA libraries (see “Materials and Methods”). We also isolated the full-length cDNA of the initially partial mouse Nck (Grb4). Comparison both within and across the species between the four mammalian Nck genes indicated that 1) Nck is indeed encoded by a multiple-gene family and 2) the family comprises two pairs of orthologue genes. We rename these Nck genes here as the human Nckα (formally known as Nck) and human Nckβ genes and, correspondingly, the mouse Nckα and mouse Nckβ genes. These data clearly indicate that human Nckα/mouse Nckα and human Nckβ/mouse Nckβ genes represent two pairs of orthologue genes. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the human Nckβ, mouse Nckα, and mouse Nckβ genes are available under GenBankTM accession numbers AFO43119, AFO43259, and AFO43260, respectively. Variations in amino acid sequences between Nckα and Nckβ were found to fall largely into interval sequences outside the SH3 and SH2 domains. Comparison within the SH3 and SH2 domains showed higher amino acid identities (Table I). Noticeable variations between Nckα and Nckβ were found in some of the key sequences, which are believed to play a role in determining ligand binding specificity of SH2 and SH3 domains (46Waksman G.

Structure. 1994; 15: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions in the so-called “RT loop” in all three SH3 domains were observed (VAQQEQ toTAQQDQ in SH3-I; MAERED toVAERED in SH3-II; and SSSNDE to SSVTEE in SH3-III). In SH2 domains, the GQRKFS sequence of “EF loop” and F strand in Nckα is replaced by GQRRFH in Nckβ, and the APIFTSEQGEKL sequence of the “BG loop” in Nckα is changed to APIFTSEHGEKL in Nckβ. More importantly, all of these amino acid variations between Nckα and Nckβ are conserved between the human and the mouse Nck genes. We compared the two human Nck genes to the previously isolated Nck-like genes fromXenopus laevis,2 fromDrosophila (dreadlocks or dork) (9Garrity P.A. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlad J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and C. elegans (Cosmid ZK470, GenBankTM accession numberU39651). As indicated in Table I, human Nckα shows 87, 44, and 33% amino acid identity to Xenopus Nck, Drosophila dork, and C. elegans Nck-like, respectively, and human Nckβ shares 68, 43, and 34% amino acid identity, respectively. While the Xenopus Nck gene is clearly more related to the human Nckα gene, it is not obvious which of the two human Nck genes is evolutionarily closer to the Drosophila dorkand the C. elegans Nck genes. Comparison of changes in the F strand, the BG loop, and the “BC loop” suggested thatdork gene is also more closely related to the human Nckα gene. It is possible that Xenopus and Drosophilamay also have as yet unidentified Nckβ-related genes.Table IAmino acid sequence comparisons of Nck genes from different speciesHumanMouse NckαMouse NckβXenopusNckDrosophila DorkC. elegans Nck-likeov.3-I3-II3-IIISH2ov.3-I3-II3-IIISH2ov.3-I3-II3-IIISH2ov.3-I3-II3-IIISH2ov.3-I3-II3-IIISH2%%%%%Nckα96989496996883888485879691909244635449633674634738Nckβ67828580859696949699688385818243695652623370613540Overall sequences (ov.) as well as SH3-I (3-I), SH3-II (3-II), SH3-III (3-III), and SH2 domain sequences are compared.

https://openalex.org/W2021836528,"We identified the residues that are important for the binding of α-dendrotoxin (αDTX) to Kv1 potassium channels on rat brain synaptosomal membranes, using a mutational approach based on site-directed mutagenesis and chemical synthesis. Twenty-six of its 59 residues were individually substituted by alanine. Substitutions of Lys5 and Leu9 decreased affinity more than 1000-fold, and substitutions of Arg3, Arg4, Leu6, and Ile8 by 5–30-fold. Substitution of Lys5 by norleucine or ornithine also greatly altered the binding properties of αDTX. All of these analogs displayed similar circular dichroism spectra as compared with the wild-type αDTX, indicating that none of these substitutions affect the overall conformation of the toxin. Substitutions of Ser38 and Arg46 also reduced the affinity of the toxin but, in addition, modified its dichroic properties, suggesting that these two residues play a structural role. The other residues were excluded from the recognition site because their substitutions caused no significant affinity change. Thus, the functional site of αDTX includes six major binding residues, all located in its N-terminal region, with Lys5 and Leu9 being the most important. Comparison of the functional site of αDTX with that of DTX-K, another dendrotoxin (Smith, L. A., Reid, P. F., Wang, F. C., Parcej, D. N., Schmidt, J. J., Olson, M. A., and Dolly, J. O. (1997)Biochemistry 36, 7690–7696), reveals that they only share the predominant lysine and probably a leucine residue; the additional functional residues differ from one toxin to the other. Comparison of the functional site of αDTX with those of structurally unrelated potassium channel-blocking toxins from venomous invertebrates revealed the common presence of a protruding key lysine with a close important hydrophobic residue (Leu, Tyr, or Phe) and few additional residues. Therefore, irrespective of their phylogenetic origin, all of these toxins may have undergone a functional convergence. The functional site of αDTX is topographically unrelated to the “antiprotease site” of the structurally analogous bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.

Therefore, all of these toxins may possess a functional surface that is complementary to this loop, an observation that raises the question as to how similar these surfaces are from one toxin to another. The answer to such a question may not only shed light on the evolution of these toxins but should also help characterize the surface by which Kv1 channels interact with these toxins. Mutational analyses have finely delineated the functional sites of scorpion toxins (26Goldstein S.A. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and sea anemone toxins (11Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C.

Although the sea anemone and scorpion toxins are not structurally related, their functional sites share some similarities. They are all flat surfaces of comparable size (∼700 Å2) with five functionally important residues, including a similar critical functional diad (11Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N.

This diad in both toxins comprises a lysine, which always plays a predominant part in binding, and an aromatic residue separated from the lysine by 6.6 Å. It was proposed that the lysine of scorpion toxins projects into the conduction pore of the channel (26Goldstein S.A. Pheasant D.J. Miller C.

Invertebrate toxins that have unrelated architectures but commonly block voltage-gated potassium channels therefore seem to display quite similar functional sites, suggesting that they underwent a convergent functional evolution. To investigate whether this proposal could be extended to toxins from vertebrates, we decided to delineate the functional site of α-dendrotoxin (αDTX), a well known voltage-gated potassium channel-blocking toxin, isolated from venom of the green mamba Dendroaspis angusticeps (30Harvey A.L. Karlsson E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 312: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This toxin is an extensively studied prototype of the family of dendrotoxins isolated from mamba venoms, which all block voltage-gated potassium channels (6Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Harvey A.L.

Its three-dimensional structure, as revealed by crystallographic studies (15Skarzynski T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), is highly similar to that of BPTI (14Berndt K.D. Günter P. Orbons L.P.M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the well known protease inhibitor. Comparison of amino acid sequences of members of the dendrotoxin family suggested that one or more of the lysines present in the triplet 28–30 of αDTX may be involved in the interaction with Kv1 channels (6Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 131-164Google Scholar). However, preliminary site-directed mutagenesis experiments with αDTX did not confirm this proposal (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, 26 residues of αDTX were individually substituted by an alanine, and the corresponding analogs were characterized according to their secondary structure and their capacity to inhibit the binding of radioactive αDTX to rat brain synaptosomal membranes. We thus identified a functional topography composed of six residues. Comparison of this site with functionally important residues recently identified in DTX-K (33Smith L.A. Reid P.F. Wang F.C. Parcej D.N. Schmidt J.J. Olson M.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7690-7696Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), another dendrotoxin, shows that these toxins possess different functional sites that share only a common critical lysine. Furthermore, comparison of the αDTX functional site with those of structurally unrelated Kv1 channel-blocking toxins shows that all of these toxins share a minimal functional anatomy, composed of a key lysine and a hydrophobic residue, suggesting that they have undergone functional convergent evolution. It is also shown that the functional site of αDTX is topographically unrelated to that of BPTI, a well known trypsin inhibitor, although the two proteins share the same fold. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381A synthesizer. Amino acid composition analyses were performed using an Applied Biosystems device (420A Derivatizer and 130A Separation system), and N-terminal sequencing was done using the Applied Biosystems sequencer (477A protein sequencer) on-line with the phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (120A analyzer). Dichroic spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 dichrograph. Expression vector pEZZ18 was generously provided by Prof. Mathias Uhlèn (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden). Mass determination was performed on an API III+ (Perkin-Elmer Sciex) mass spectrometer equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray source. Recombinant αDTX analogs were produced using the periplasmic expression system previously described (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As for previous recombinant αDTXs (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), each analog was recovered as two isoforms: one with an N-terminal glutamine residue and the other, as found in wild-type αDTX, with an N-terminal pyroglutamic residue. The latter was used for structural and functional characterization. The synthesis of native αDTX and of analogs P2A, K5A, K5Nle, K5Orn, L6A, I8A, L9A, E33A, R34A, and I58A was performed using the Fmoc/tert-butyl and maximal temporary protection strategy on an Applied Biosystems 431A synthesizer. The following standard chemical procedure was used for each monosubstituted analog: 0.05 mmof Fmoc-Gly-4-hydroxymethylphenoxy resin, 20-fold excess of each amino acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole activation. Deprotection (1.5 h) and cleavage (300 mg of peptide + resin) were achieved using the mixture trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water (9/0.5/0.5, v/v/v). The acidic mixture was then precipitated in 100 ml of cold diethylether, redissolved in 50 ml of 10% acetic acid in water, and lyophilized. Oxidation of the reduced peptide was achieved at 0.1 mg/ml in degassed potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.8) using the redox couple reduced glutathione (5 mm)/oxidized glutathione (0.5 mm). The disappearance of the reduced peptide was monitored by reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac) using a linear gradient of 40 min starting from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 90% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The crude oxidized peptide was then purified in two steps: reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 semipreparative column (10 × 250 mm, Vydac) in the same conditions as above followed by a final purification on a MonoS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the conditions used for recombinant analogs (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For all αDTX analogs, the protein concentration was estimated using molar extinction coefficients determined by amino acid composition analyses. The presence of the desired substitution in the αDTX analogs produced in E. coli was checked by Edman degradation of the N-terminal glutamine isoform, or, for analogs S44A, K48A, E51A, R54A, and R55A, by sequencing peptides resulting from endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) cleavage of reduced and alkylated protein (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the chemically synthesized αDTX analogs, the substitution was assessed by mass spectrometry. 70 μg of each analog and wild-type αDTX purified from venom were cleaved by trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min on a C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac) using a 65-min gradient of 10–60% eluent B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile in water) in eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). Peptides were identified by means of amino acid composition analyses. For the analog R34A, the peptide containing half-cysteines 16, 32, 40, and 53 was further cleaved by chymotrypsin. Synthetic αDTX (10 μg) was incubated at room temperature in a micro test tube (Eppendorf) coated with 1 μg of iodogen (Pierce) with 2 mCi of125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 200 μl of 0.1m sodium phosphate. After 15 min, 20 μl of 0.1m sodium thiosulfate were added, and the reaction mixture was injected onto a C18 column (Vydac). After washing the column with 25% eluent B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile) in eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), separation was achieved using a 40-min gradient of 25–60% eluent B in eluent A (1 ml/min). The fraction containing pure monoiodinated αDTX (2000 Ci/mmol) was kept at 4 °C after the addition of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The binding capacity of monoiodinated αDTX was 84%, as determined by saturating 4 pm of labeled toxin with increasing concentrations of rat brain synaptosomal membranes (0.35–24 μg of protein/ml). This value remained constant for at least 85 days. Ten adult male rats (Sprague-Dawley, 150 g) were killed by decapitation. Decerebellate brains were homogenized in 100 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using an UltraTurrax T25 (IKA-Labortechnik) and then a glass/Teflon homogenizer. This whole homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged for 10 min at 17,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, briefly homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer, and left for 2 h at 4 °C. Sucrose was then added to the lysed membrane suspension to a final concentration of 36%. The suspension was centrifuged for 90 min at 28,000 rpm using a SW28 rotor (Beckman) (66,100–141,000 ×g) in tubes containing three layers of sucrose (36%: membrane suspension, 28.5 and 10%). The synaptic membrane fraction (lower interface) was diluted to less than 10% sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min, washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All binding experiments were done at room temperature, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After 1.5–2 h, the incubation medium (1–6 ml) was rapidly filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters that had been presoaked in 0.5% (w/v) polyethylenimine, followed by three washes with ice-cold filtration buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl; 3 ml per wash). Radioactivity in the filters was then counted in a gamma counter. In the early stages of this study, there was no clear indication to suggest which analogs should be prepared. It was only established (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that substitutions D12N and K28A/K29A/K30G had little effect on the biological property of the toxin, suggesting that these positions are unlikely to be important for toxin binding to Kv1 channels, whereas the substitution Z1Q caused affinity to increase 5-fold. In the present study, therefore, selection of the positions of αDTX to be substituted was based on a comparison of the primary structures of dendrotoxins and functionally different proteins possessing the same fold (Fig. 1). First, we expected that functionally important features of dendrotoxins would emerge from comparison of their primary structures with those of structurally related proteins. Five residues (Lys5, Lys19, Lys28, Gln31, and Ser38) are more specific to dendrotoxins. Four (Lys5, Lys19, Gln31, and Ser38) were substituted in this study, and one (Lys28) in our previous work (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Asp36, which is present in three of the four DTXs, was also substituted. Second, according to their primary structures, two groups of dendrotoxins can be distinguished: DTX-K and δDTX, and αDTX and DTX-I, which possess two additional residues in their N-terminal. Because this structural partition corresponds to distinct functional properties of DTXs (see under “Discussion”), we anticipated that residues uniquely conserved in both αDTX and DTX-I but not in DTX-K and δDTX may be associated with specific behavior of the first two toxins. Thirteen residues (Pro2, Arg4, Leu6, Ile8, His10, Arg11, Tyr17, Gln27, Lys29, Glu33, Trp37, Ser44, and Ile58) were therefore substituted either in this study or in the previous one (Lys29) (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Third, because dendrotoxins are more basic than any other Kunitz-type proteins, we substituted the positively charged residues not yet included by the above selection procedure (Arg3, Arg15, Arg34, Arg46, Lys48, Arg54, and Arg55). In addition, Asp18, which is specific to αDTX, was also substituted. We also mutated Glu51 and, finally, Leu9 and Asn43 because they were found to be close to functionally important residues identified during this study. Using the procedure previously described (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the production of αDTX analogs in E. coliyielded only 10–90 μg of each isoform per liter of culture. Additionally, attempts to produce the mutant αDTX-W37A failed, probably because Trp37 belongs to a small hydrophobic core (15Skarzynski T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To increase analog yields, we decided to produce them by a chemical approach (43Byrnes M.E. Mahnir V.M. Kem W.R. Pennington M.W. Protein Pept. Lett. 1995; 1: 239-245Google Scholar). Peptide synthesis led to milligram amounts of synthetic αDTX, with a 6% yield from the starting resin. We identified the disulfide bonds of the resulting synthetic αDTX by submitting it to trypsin digestion. The peptide map obtained with the resulting fragments was identical to that of wild-type αDTX (not shown), indicating that the disulfide bridges are identical in the wild-type and synthetic toxins. In mice, intracerebroventricular injections of synthetic αDTX indicated an LD50 of 5 ng/g, a value that is similar to that of the toxin isolated from venom (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the synthetic and native toxins displayed a similar ability to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled αDTX to rat brain synaptosomal membranes (not shown). Using the chemical approach, we therefore synthesized chemically the analogs possessing the substitutions P2A, K5A, L6A, I8A, L9A, E33A, R34A, and I58A; all other alanine analogs were produced by the recombinant approach. We introduced nonnatural residues at position 5 (K5Nle and K5Orn) to probe in more detail the role of lysine 5, which was found to be critical for toxin binding (see below). The analog N43A was also chemically synthesized, but we could not oxidize it, suggesting that the introduced substitution prevented the correct folding of the protein. Rat brain synaptosomal membranes are frequently used to study the binding properties of various ligands toward Kv1 channels, using radiolabeled αDTX as a tracer (11Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J.

Because our mutational analysis required numerous competitive binding experiments, we established new binding conditions using the lowest possible proportions of membranes. A typical saturation binding experiment is shown in Fig. 2 A. Scatchard analysis (Fig. 2 B) indicated that [125I]αDTX binds to a single class of sites with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of 5.4 pm. TheB max va"

Thus, SpMYH is the functional eukaryotic MutY homolog responsible for reduction of 8-oxoG mutational effect. 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine MutY homolog apurinic/apyrimidinic inosine nebularine 2-aminopurine kilobase(s) polymerase chain reaction isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 8-oxoG glycosylase helix-hairpin-helix.

Oxygen is metabolized inside the cell by a series of one-electron reductions with the generation of reactive and potentially damaging intermediates called reactive oxygen species (3Halliwell B.

The formation of GO in DNA, if not repaired, can lead to misincorporation of A opposite to the GO lesion and result in G:C to T:A transversions (5Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

InEscherichia coli, a family of enzymes, MutY, MutM, and MutT, is involved in defending against the mutagenic effects of GO lesions (9Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J.

The MutM protein (Fpg protein) provides a second level of defense by removing both mutagenic GO adducts and ring-opened purine lesions (13Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Grollman A.P.

MutY removes misincorporated adenines paired with GO lesions and reduces the GO mutational effects. Recent results show that MutY and the N-terminal catalytic domain can be trapped in a stable covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate in the presence of sodium borohydride (23Lu A-L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J.

MutY homologous (MYH) activities have been identified in human HeLa (26Yeh Y.-C. Chang D.-Y. Masin J. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6480-6484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and calf thymus (27McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y.-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) extracts. Both human and calf MYH systems share similar features with the E. coli mutY-dependent pathway: mismatch specificities to A/G, A/C, and A/GO, and cleavage of the A but not G strand. Recently, a human cDNA of putative hMYH was cloned and its open reading frame predicts a 60-kDa protein (28Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Luther W.M. Chiang J.-H. Wei Y.-F. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3885-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with the size of a band detected in HeLa extracts with MutY antibodies (27McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y.-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hMYH shares high homology with the E. coli MutY protein (28Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Luther W.M. Chiang J.-H. Wei Y.-F. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3885-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, no enzyme activity has been reported for the protein encoded by this open reading frame. Here, we report the cloning and expression of the MYH gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of SpMYH suppresses the spontaneous mutation rate of E. coli mutY mutant strains. Like E. coli MutY, purified recombinant SpMYH has both adenine glycosylase and AP lyase activities on A/G and A/GO mismatches. Defined oligonucleotides containing various purines were used to examine the substrate specificity. SpMYH has slightly different substrate specificity from that of E. coli MutY protein. SpMYH has greater glycosylase activity on 2-aminopurine (2AP)/G and A/2AP but weaker activity on A/C than doesE. coli MutY. Both enzymes also have different substrate binding affinity and catalytic parameters. These results suggest that SpMYH is a functional eukaryotic homolog of the bacterial MutY. The high homology of MutY homologs among different organisms suggests important roles in their cellular functions. According to the published genomic sequence of S. pombe (accession no.Z69240), the putative mutY homolog (MYH) sequence contains two introns and codes for a 461-residue protein. To clone theS. pombe MYH gene, we synthesized two PCR primers, Chang 219 (5′-GGAGATATACATATGTCGGATTCAAATCATTC-3′) and Chang 220 (5′-GCAGCCGGATCCTTAGCACTCTGCTTTCGT-3′). Chang 219 and Chang 220 anneal at the first six and last six codons of the predicted coding sequence for SpMYH, respectively. DNA prepared from an S. pombe cDNA library in pGADGH (kindly provided by D. Beach, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) was used as a template for the PCR reactions. PCR reactions (100 μl) contained 20 ng of plasmid DNA, 100 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The reactions were performed as follows: 95 °C (1.0 min), 58 °C (1.5 min) and 72 °C (1.5 min) for 30 cycles and a final cycle with extension time at 72 °C for 4 min. The 1.4-kb PCR product was purified using the Wizard PCR clean-up kit (Promega), digested with NdeI and BamHI, ligated intoNdeI- and BamHI-digested pET11a, and transformed into DH5α cells. Sequence analysis of one such clone (pSP11a-2.3) revealed that it contained several mutations. To obtain a mutation-free SpMYH clone, the 1.4-kb PCR product was labeled and used as a probe to screen the S. pombe cDNA library in pGADGH by colony hybridization. Out of 6 × 106 colonies screened, two contained theSpMYH sequence. Subsequent restriction and PCR analysis indicated that the MYH cDNA was within a 1.6-kbBamHI fragment in one of the clones. This fragment was isolated and transferred to pUC19 to generate pSPMYH19. Based on the restriction map of pSPMYH19, the 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment containing the C-terminal domain of SpMYH and 21 base pairs of pUC19 sequence was isolated and ligated with the 5.76-kb fragment of pSP11a-2.3 that contained the vector pET11a and the N-terminal portion of SpMYH to yield the plasmid pSPMYH11a-4. The SpMYHsequence of pSPMYH11a-4 (accession no. AF053340) was exactly the same as the predicted sequence for the S. pombe MYH cDNA. The recombinant expressed a 52-kDa protein in GBE943(DE3) (lacIp4000(LacIq)lacZp4008(Lac L8)srlC-300::Tn10λ−IN(rrD-rrnE)1micA68::Tn10Kan) cells following induction with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The expression host, GBE943 with λDE3 lysogen, was constructed according to the procedures described by Invitrogen. Independent overnight cultures of each strain were grown to an A 590 of 0.7 in LB medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin when necessary. After 2.5 h of induction by the addition of 0.1 mm IPTG, 0.1 ml of cells from each culture was plated onto LB agar containing 0.1 mg/ml rifampicin. The cell titer of each culture was determined by plating a 10−6 dilution onto LB agar. The ratio of Rifrcells to total cells was the mutation rate. Eighteen liters of E. coliGBE943/De3 cells harboring overproduction plasmid pSPMYH11a-4 were cultured to an A 590 of 0.7 in LB broth containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The cells were induced by adding IPTG to 0.4 mm and cultured overnight at 28 °C and harvested by centrifugation. All column chromatography was conducted in a Waters 650 FPLC system at 4 °C, and centrifugation was done at 16,5000 × g for 30 min. Cells (54 g of cell paste) were resuspended in 200 ml of buffer A (20 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 50 mm KCl and disrupted with a bead beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) using 0.1-mm glass beads. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was treated with 5% streptomycin sulfate. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was centrifugated, and the supernatant was collected as fraction I (595 ml). Ammonium sulfate (134 g) was added to fraction I, and the protein was precipitated for 1 h. After centrifugation, 126 g of ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant and the protein pellets collected by centrifugation were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm KCl and dialyzed against two changes of 3 liters of the same buffer for 4 h each. The dialyzed protein sample was diluted 2-fold with buffer A containing 50 mmKCl as fraction II (140 ml). Fraction II was loaded onto a 50-ml phosphocellulose column, which had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl. After washing with 100 ml of equilibration buffer, proteins were eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.05–0.6 m) in buffer A. Fractions that eluted between 0.2 and 0.4 m KCl were pooled (fraction III, 50 ml). Fraction III was loaded onto a 30-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with buffer B (0.01 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing with 60 ml of equilibration buffer, the flow-through and early elution fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl and 10% (v/v) glycerol for 2 h (fraction IV, 53 ml). Fraction IV was loaded onto a 5-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05m KCl and 10% glycerol. After washing with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, the column was developed with a 50-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.05–0.6 m) in buffer A with 10% glycerol. Fractions containing the MYH nicking activity, which eluted between 0.15 and 0.3 m KCl, were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl and 10% glycerol to yield fraction V (78 ml). Fraction V was then applied to a 1-ml Mono S column that had been equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl and 10% glycerol. After washing with 20 ml of equilibration buffer, the column was eluted with a step gradient of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m KCl in 20 ml of buffer A each with 10% glycerol. Fractions containing the MYH nicking activity, which eluted between 0.1 and 0.3 m KCl, were pooled (fraction VI, 8.5 ml), divided into small aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. Cleavage of A/G-containing 44-mer DNA was assayed during the purification of the recombinant SpMYH enzyme. One unit of activity is defined as that resulting in cleavage of 0.018 fmol of labeled DNA in 30 min at 30 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides of 19-mer and 40-mer containing base mismatches were labeled as described by Luet al. (30Lu A-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The nicking activity of SpMYH, which is the combined action of the glycosylase and AP lyase activities, was assayed similarly as described (31Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.45% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.8 fmol of labeled DNA in a total volume of 20 μl. SpMYH protein, diluted in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% glycerol, was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were analyzed on 8 or 14% polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gels. Kinetic analyses were performed using a concentration range of DNA substrates with 0.4 nm SpMYH. Following autoradiography, bands corresponding to cleavage products and intact DNA were excised from the gel and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.K m and V max values were obtained from results of three experiments by a computer-fitted curve generated by the Enzfitter program (32Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Non-linear Regression Analysis Program for IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam1987Google Scholar). The binding of SpMYH to various oligonucleotides was assayed by gel retardation. 3′ end-labeled 44-bp or 20-bp oligonucleotides (1.8 fmol) were incubated with various concentrations of SpMYH in a 20-μl binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.15% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 ng of poly(dI-dC) at 30 °C for 30 min. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels in 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA as described previously (19Lu A-L. Chang D.-Y. Cell. 1988; 54: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constants (K d values) of SpMYH and DNA were determined using a range of protein concentrations. Following autoradiography, bands corresponding to enzyme-bound and free DNA were excised from the gel and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. K dvalues were obtained from results of three experiments by a computer-fitted curve generated by the Enzfitter program (32Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Non-linear Regression Analysis Program for IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam1987Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out as described in the SpMYH cleavage assay except that the reactions were performed in the presence of NaBH4. A NaBH4 stock solution was freshly prepared immediately prior to use. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, SDS dye was added to the samples, which were heated at 90 °C for 2 min and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar), and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The SpMYH gene encodes a protein of 461 amino acid residues that displays 28 and 31% identity and 59 and 62% conservation to the E. coli MutY and human MYH, respectively, by comparison using an ALIGN program. The eukaryotic MYH sequences contain extra amino acid stretches at the N- and C-terminal regions as compared with the bacterial MutY sequences. The amino acid sequences of the N-terminal part of the SpMYH share significant homology to other DNA glycosylases including E. coli endonuclease III (endo III) (Fig. 1). Two regions of highest similarity shared among these enzymes can be identified in the known three-dimensional structure of E. coli endo III (34Kuo C.-F. McRee D.E. Fisher C.L. O'Haandley S.F. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Science. 1992; 258: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 35Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar): the helix-hairpin-helix domain (residues 147–181 of SpMYH) and the iron-sulfur domain (residues 213–242 of SpMYH). There are also distinct residues (shaded in gray boxes in Fig. 1) in the MutY family that are different from that of endo III family. Interestingly, when these residues are placed on the structure of E. coli endo III, they are located at the edge of the cleft between the iron-sulfur domain and the six antiparallel α-helices. To demonstrate that the open reading frame of putativeSpMYH gene encodes a functional MYH protein, we have expressed this Sp-cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter in pET11a in E. coli. E. coli GBE943 (mutY) harboring the plasmid pSPMYH11a-4 were induced to express the SpMYH protein by addition of IPTG to the growth medium, and the mutation rate was measured. As shown in Table I,mutY mutant (GBE943/DE3) exhibited a 40-fold higher mutation rate than the wild-type E. coli. GBE943/DE3 cells expressing SpMYH had mutation rates almost as low as the wild-type cell, whereas the vector (pET11a) alone had no effect on the mutation rate (Table I). Expression of SpMYH in wild-type E. coli cells caused a slightly lower mutation rate than cells with vector alone (Table I).Table IMutation rate of E. coli mutY mutant expressing MYH from S. pombeStrainMutation rate RifR colonies/108 cells-FoldGBE791/DE3 (wt)1.81GBE791/DE3/pET11a1.50.8GBE791/DE3/pSPMYH11a-40.60.3GBE943/DE3 (mutY)76.242GBE943/DE3/pET11a53.230GBE943/DE3/pSPMYH11a-45.23 Open table in a new tab To further demonstrate that the putative SpMYH encodes a functional MYH protein, we purified the recombinant SpMYH from the overproducing E. coli GBE943(DE3) strain harboring the plasmid pSPMYH11a-4. The SpMYH protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, heparin-agarose, and Mono S chromatographic separation. We recovered 19 mg of SpMYH protein from 54 g of cell paste with about an 18-fold increase in specific activity. The purity of the products at different stages of the procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2. As judged on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the protein was purified to a very high degree. The mobility of SpMYH in the gel matched the predicted size (52 kDa). SpMYH appears as a monomer because it was eluted at a molecular mass of about 45 kDa through a gel-filtration column (Superose 12) (data not shown). When SpMYH was initially assayed in the MutY buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm NaCl, and 2.9% glycerol), there was little cleavage activity (Fig. 3, lane 4). This prompted us to find the optimal conditions for SpMYH. The SpMYH glycosylase activity was reduced by adding 40 mm NaCl to the reaction buffer (Fig. 3, lane 8) and was abolished at NaCl concentration higher than 80 mm (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10). SpMYH cleavage activity was not inhibited by 8 mm EDTA (Fig. 3, lane 13) but was abolished by 32 mm EDTA (Fig. 3, lane 15). The effects of salt and EDTA on the SpMYH binding to 20-mer DNA containing an A/G mismatch were similar to that on the SpMYH cleavage except 40 mm NaCl had little effect on binding (data not shown). Therefore, the low SpMYH activity in MutY buffer is due to the presence of 80 mm NaCl. As shown in Fig. 4, SpMYH can cleave a 20-mer oligonucleotide containing an A/G mismatch in a dose-dependent manner. Heating the samples at 90 °C for 2 min before loading to the sequencing gel enhanced the cleavage activity (Fig. 4, compare A and B). However, further treatment of the products with piperidine at 90 °C (a condition promotes β-elimination) did not significantly increase the extent of cleavage (Fig. 4, compare B and C). Thus, SpMYH does contain intrinsic AP lyase activity, although it is not strictly coupled to the glycosylase activity. These properties of SpMYH are similar to the E. coli MutY protein, which contains both DNA glycosylase and AP lyase activities. If SpMYH has an AP lyase activity and uses the similar mechanism like MutY (23Lu A-L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24138-24143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Gogos A. Cillo J. Clarke N.D. Lu A-L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16665-16671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), an imino intermediate should be reduced by NaBH4 to form a stable covalent protein-DNA complex. Thus, DNA containing an A/G mismatch was incubated with SpMYH in the presence of different concentrations of NaBH4. As shown in Fig. 5, SpMYH can be trapped in two covalently linked protein-DNA complexes as a doublet in the presence of NaBH4 although not as efficiently as MutY. The reason for the formation of two complexes is not quite clear. The optimal trapping concentration of NaBH4 is about 20–30 mm (Fig. 5 A) (less trapping is observed at 10 mmNaBH4 with data not shown). The covalent complexes of SpMYH and DNA migrated slower than the MutY-DNA complex due to the larger size of SpMYH protein (the molecular mass of SpMYH is 52 kDa and that of MutY is 39 kDa). At 100 mm NaBH4, E. coli MutY can be trapped efficiently but the trapping ability of SpMYH is minimal (data not shown). The effect of NaBH4 is consistent with the inhibition of SpMYH cleavage activity by 80 mm NaCl that is present in the MutY reaction (Fig. 3). In the presence of 30 mm NaBH4, DNA containing an A/G mismatch was tested in the trapping assay with increasing amount of SpMYH protein (Fig. 5 B). At enzyme:DNA molar ratios ranging from 10 (Fig. 5 B, lane 3) to 320 (Fig. 5 B, lane 8), covalent complexes were detected. Because Schiff's base formation is an important criteria for the class of DNA glycosylase with AP lyase activity, our results strongly suggest that SpMYH protein possesses AP lyase activity. We have shown that E. coli MutY can cleave several mismatches with different efficiencies (30Lu A-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To compare the SpMYH with MutY, we tested the glycosylase activity on different mismatches. As shown in Fig. 6, both enzymes cleave A/G, N/G, and A/GO in a similar order and have very weak or no cleavage on I/G, A/I, C/GO, and C/G. However, SpMYH has greater activity on 2AP/G and A/2AP but weaker activity on A/C than E. coli MutY. Because SpMYH and MutY have different glycosylase activities on different substrates, we then determined the apparent dissociation constants (K d) of SpMYH from different mismatches. The apparent dissociation constants (K dvalues) of SpMYH and DNAs were determined using a range of protein concentrations with a fixed DNA concentration (90 pm). Representative autoradiograms of the binding assays and the corresponding binding curves for SpMYH to A/G- and A/GO-containing 44-mer DNA are shown in Fig. 7. When the concentration of SpMYH protein was higher than 50 nm, an extra slower migrating complex was observed in binding assays with A/G-44 DNA (Fig. 7 A). SpMYH binding is saturated below 70% of A/GO-44 DNA at the highest MutY concentration tested (Fig. 7 D). As shown in Table II, SpMYH has great affinity to A/GO-containing DNA as does MutY, but the binding affinity to A/G-containing DNA is substantially lower for SpMYH than MutY. The difference in the binding affinity of SpMYH with A/G-44 and A/GO-44 is 155-fold and with A/G-20 and A/GO-20 is 700-fold. The difference in the binding affinity of MutY with A/G-44 and A/GO-44 is 13-fold and with A/G-20 and A/GO-20 is 80-fold. SpMYH has higher nonspecific binding to 44-mer homoduplex than MutY. Therefore, SpMYH has only a 4–7-fold higher binding affinity to A/G mismatch than C/G pair, whereas MutY has a 70–175-fold higher binding affinity to A/G mismatch than C/G pair. As shown above, SpMYH has greater cleavage activity on 2AP/G and A/2AP than MutY; however, the binding affinities of SpMYH to these two mismatches were not greater than that of MutY.Table IIApparent dissociation constant (Kd) of SpMYH and E. coli MutY for mismatch-containing DNADNA duplexSpMYH K dMutYK dnmnmA/G-4419.1 ± 2.51.8 ± 0.3A/GO-440.123 ± 0.0150.141 ± 0.008C/G-4487.4 ± 10.1315 ± 49A/G-20168 ± 265.3 ± 0.5A/GO-200.239 ± 0.0150.066 ± 0.013C/G-20715 ± 89370 ± 802AP/G-20163 ± 1012 ± 3A/2AP-20812 ± 9894 ± 14Binding constants for MutY are derived from Luet al.

The cleavage efficiencies of 20-mer oligonucleotide containing A/G or A/GO by SpMYH and MutY were compared (Table III). As measured at 0.4 nm protein concentration, the K m values for SpMYH on both substrates were slightly higher than that of MutY. The turnover number (K cat) for SpMYH on an A/G 20-mer is 2 times lower than that of the MutY. SpMYH has similar reactivity (K cat/K m) to both A/G- and A/GO-containing DNA; however, MutY cleaves A/G-containing DNA about 3-fold more efficiently than it does A/GO-containing DNA. When 44-mer DNA substrates were tested for cleavage, SpMYH also displays similar specificity constants (K cat/K m) with both A/G and A/GO mismatches. The specificity constants of SpMYH with 44-mer is 3–4 times higher than with 20-mer DNA substrates.Table IIIKinetic parameters of SpMYH and E. coli MutYEnzymeDNAK mV maxk catk cat·"

The CD28 molecule has been demonstrated to act as an effective costimulatory molecule upon binding by B7.1 or B7.2 present on antigen-presenting cells. The CD28 signal acts in concert with the TCR signal to significantly augment activation of the NF-κB family of transcription factors. The interleukin-2 gene is regulated by NF-κB among other transcription factors, in part, via a CD28 responsive element (CD28RE) present in the IL-2 promoter. Enhanced activation of NF-κB by CD28 is mediated by rapid phosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of the NF-κB inhibitory proteins IκBα and IκBβ, which allows for accelerated nuclear expression of the liberated NF-κB. Herein, we provide evidence that the catalytic activities of two recently identified IκB kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, are significantly elevated when T cells are stimulated through CD28 in addition to mitogen treatment. Catalytically inactive forms of IKKs are able to block the in vivo phosphorylation of IκBα induced by mitogen and CD28. Furthermore, CD28-mediated reporter gene transactivation of the CD28RE/AP-1 composite element is consistently attenuated by the IKK mutants. These findings suggest that cellular signaling pathways initiated at the TCR and CD28 converge at or upstream of IKK, resulting in more robust kinase activity and enhanced and prolonged NF-κB activation.

T cell activation and IL-21 production is critically dependent on the transmission of signals derived from the cell surface to the nucleus in order to modulate changes in gene expression (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1054-1083Crossref Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It is now well established that activation and signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR) alone is not sufficient for IL-2 production or proliferation (2Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Ledbetter J.A. Kunkel S.L. Young H.A. Emerson S.G. Leiden J.M. June C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Antigen-presenting cells achieve maximal activation of the antigen-reactive T cells by binding accessory molecules present on the T cell surface in addition to antigen presentation to the TCR via the context of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. One of the most intensively studied accessory molecules, CD28, binds to the B7.1 and B7.2 molecules present on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells (3Linsley P.S. Ledbetter J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 191-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). CD28 has been demonstrated to act as a costimulatory signal for T cells since IL-2 production and proliferation are enhanced when CD28 is engaged in addition to the TCR (4Schwartz R.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 1065-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). CD28 also confers post-transcriptional mechanisms to enhance T cell activation by prolonging the half-life of IL-2 mRNA (5Lindstein T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, engagement of CD28 alone has no measurable effect on T cell activation. The IL-2 gene promoter contains an enhancer known as the CD28 responsive element (CD28RE) which functions as an integrator of transcription factors activated through the TCR and CD28 and is essential for IL-2 transcription mediated through CD28 (6Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The CD28RE enhancer also forms a composite element with a juxtaposed AP-1 binding site, and it has been shown that this composite element mediates CD28 responsiveness (7Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Studies by several laboratories suggest that members of the NF-κB, AP-1, and ATF-CREB transcription factor families bind to the CD28RE/AP-1 composite element (7Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors is composed of a set of structurally related, evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding proteins consisting of p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The NF-κB complexes are sequestered in the cytosolic compartment as latent complexes by members of the IκB family, all of which have characteristic ankyrin repeat domains required for interactions with NF-κB proteins (reviewed in Refs. 10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar and 11Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The two major IκB proteins, IκBα and IκBβ, both have two regulatory N-terminal serine residues that are phosphorylated in response to a wide array of signals (12Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 13Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.A. Mol. Cell.

The phosphorylated IκBs are then ubiquitinated and targeted to the proteasome for proteolytic degradation (15Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Signals such as TNF-α or mitogens such as PMA, which selectively induce the degradation of only IκBα, are associated with the transient activation of NF-κB since the IκBα gene is positively regulated by NF-κB factors (16Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 17Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Granzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, signals such as lipopolysaccharide, αCD3 + αCD28, IL-1, or the Tax protein of type I human T-cell leukemia virus-I induce a persistent NF-κB activation, which appears to be due to both prolonged IκBα degradation (20Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kalli K. Huntoon C. Bell M. McKean D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3140-3148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and degradation of IκBβ (22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

The IκBβ gene is presumably not under the control of NF-κB since the protein is not rapidly replenished as is seen with IκBα (22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Recently two serine kinases termed IKKα and IKKβ, which are part of a large multiprotein complex known as the IKK signalsome have been cloned and demonstrated to phosphorylate both IκBα and IκBβ in response to cytokines and other signals known to activate NF-κB (25DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 26Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). An upstream kinase, NIK, has also been identified and shown to stimulate NF-κB in response to distinct stimuli such as TNF-α and IL-1 (30Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The mechanism may be direct since NIK has been demonstrated to phosphorylate IKKα on Ser176 (31Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Although the CD28 signaling pathway has been shown to accelerate TCR-induced nuclear expression of various NF-κB/Rel transcription factors, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. We and others have previously demonstrated that ligation of CD28 initiates a potent costimulatory signal leading to the rapid and persistent degradation of IκBβ and enhanced degradation of IκBα (20Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known if CD28 is mediating enhanced IκB kinase activity. We report here that CD28 potentiates the kinase activity of IKKα and IKKβ, which are only weakly activated by mitogen or TCR signals alone. Jurkat T cells (ATCC) and Jurkat cells expressing the SV40 large T antigen (Jurkat Tag) (32Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Human peripheral blood T cells were prepared from lymphocyte-enriched human blood (Biological Specialty Corporation, Colmar, PA) with a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by negative selection with human T cell enrichment immunocolumns (Biotex Laboratories Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). C305 (anti-clonotypic Jurkat TCR) was provided by Dr. Arthur Weiss (University of California, San Francisco) and used at a 1:1000 dilution. The monoclonal antibody for human CD28 (clone 9.3) was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and used at a 1:10,000 dilution (0.3 μg/ml). The antibody against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (anti-HA) and protein A- agarose was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-IKKα (H744) and anti-IKKβ (H470) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-IκBα antiserum was provided by Dr. Warner Greene. HA-IKKα (K44M) and HA-IKKβ (K44A) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). GST-IκBα 1–55 and GST-IκBα 1–55 A32/A36 was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal 55 amino acids from the IκBα and IκBα A32/A36 cDNAs (33Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Kealiher A. Uhlik M. Sun S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-IκBβ 1–82 was constructed by ligating a 300-base pair NaeI and BamHI fragment derived from HA-IκBβ with pGEX-4T-3 digested with SmaI and BamHI. Jurkat Tag cells (5 × 106) were transfected using DEAE-dextran (34Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with 2 μg of HA-IκBα and the indicated amounts of HA-IKKα (K44M) expression vector. Between 40 and 48 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and αCD28 (1:10,000) for 30 min and then subjected to whole-extract preparation and immunoblotting analyses as described below. In vitro kinase assays were done essentially as described previously (25DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with specific antisera (IKKα or IKKβ) for 1 h, and then 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim) was added and incubated for an additional 3 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cell lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:100 of a protease inhibitor mixture. The immunoprecipitates were then washed once with cell lysis buffer + 8 m urea, and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes and 20 mm magnesium chloride). Kinase reactions were then performed at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and either GST-IκBα 1–55 or GST-IκBβ 1–82. The reactions were terminated upon addition of 5× sample buffer followed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and autoradiography. Jurkat cells, or transiently transfected Jurkat-Tag cells were stimulated with the indicated inducers and then collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Whole cell and subcellular extracts were prepared as described previously (35Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2385-2392PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting analyses, whole cell extracts (∼15 μg) were fractionated by reducing 8.75% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then analyzed for immunoreactivity with the indicated primary antibodies using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with DEAE-dextran with 2 μg of the CD28RE/AP-1 reporter and either empty vector or the indicated amounts of IKKα K44M or IKKβ K44A. Transfectants were split into two and either left untreated or treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) or PMA and anti-CD28 (1:10,000 dilution) for 8 h. The extracts were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and then measured for luciferase activity as described previously (23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have previously demonstrated that IκBα degradation is enhanced by CD28 costimulation (20Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. We examined whether CD28 potentiates mitogen-mediated IKKα activation. We first performed in vitro kinase assays with Jurkat T cells utilizing GST-IκBα 1–55 as a substrate. The kinase activity of IKKα was slightly induced by PMA treatment as described previously (26Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbose M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, upper middle panel). However, when cells were treated with CD28 antibody in addition to mitogen treatment, the kinase activity of IKKα was significantly elevated (lane 3), although CD28 alone had no effect on the kinase activity (lane 4). Autophosphorylation of IKKα was also strongly induced by PMA plus anti-CD28 treatment (lane 3, upper panel). It should be noted that the time of each stimulation for this and subsequent experiments was 7 min, which represented maximal kinase activity as exerted by each stimulus. In a time course experiment, the kinase activity was highest at 7 min, was sustained for at least 15 min, and finally subsided by 30 min (data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with TPCK, a chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitor, known to block IκBα phosphorylation by unknown mechanisms (37DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), abolished all kinase activity associated with PMA and anti-CD28 treatment (Fig. 1 A, lane 5, upper middle panel). To ensure that IKKα kinase activity was directed to the two N-terminal serine residues of IκBα (serine 32 and 36), we used a GST-IκB protein with alanine residues substituted for the two serines as substrate. Importantly, this substrate was not phosphorylated by IKKα in Jurkat cells treated with mitogen and anti-CD28 (lane 6). Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated IKKα revealed equal amounts of IKKα for all samples (Fig. 1 A, lower middle panel). In addition to IKKα kinase activity, we examined the fate of endogenous IκBα from the same extracts used for kinase assays. Immunoblots of IκBα revealed that PMA only slightly induced IκBα phosphorylation as assessed by a slower migrating band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, lower panel). When CD28 antibody was added in addition to PMA, a strong phosphorylated band was readily observed (lane 3), and as expected, CD28 alone did not induce IκBα phosphorylation (lane 4). TPCK also inhibited the inducible phosphorylation of IκBα (lane 5). Taken together, IKKα kinase activity is enhanced by PMA and CD28 treatment and is well correlated with in vivo IκBα phosphorylation. To confirm the physiological relevance and generality of these findings, we recapitulated our experiments in primary T cells. To this end, we purified T cells from human peripheral blood, treated with either PMA alone or PMA together with anti-CD28, and performed IKKα kinase assays with GST-IκBα as a substrate. As observed in Jurkat cells, the untreated human primary T cells exhibited no detectable IKK kinase activity (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Treatment with PMA alone induced moderate IKKα kinase activity (lane 2), which was markedly enhanced in the presence of CD28 antibody (lane 3). Autophosphorylation of IKKα was also evident when the cells were treated with both PMA and anti-CD28 (lane 3) Therefore, CD28-mediated IKK kinase activation occurs in both Jurkat and primary human T cells. To confirm that these findings were not specific to the mitogen PMA but rather reflected signaling through the TCR in a more physiological manner, we also used C305 ascites (anti-clonotypic Jurkat TCR) (38Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As seen with PMA, treatment of Jurkat cells with C305 resulted in a small degree of IKKα kinase activity (Fig. 1 C, lane 2, upper panel). This was significantly enhanced when CD28 was present (lane 3). The levels of IKKα protein were similar in all samples as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C, lower panel). We conclude that CD28 mediates a costimulatory signal resulting in enhanced IKKα mediated IκBα phosphorylation. Given that IκBβ is also rapidly degraded when T cells receive a costimulatory signal (23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of CD28 ligation on IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of IκBβ. For these purposes, we used GST-IκBβ 1–82, which contains the two IKK phosphorylation sites at serines 19 and 23. As expected, IKKα from untreated Jurkat cells displayed no kinase activity toward IκBβ (Fig. 2, lane 1). When treated with PMA, there was slight kinase activity toward IκBβ (lane 2). Importantly, when Jurkat cells were treated with both PMA and CD28, there was a significant up-regulation of kinase activity directed toward IκBβ (lane 3). Once again, CD28 alone had no effect on IKKα kinase activity (lane 4), emphasizing the requirement for two signals to achieve maximal IKKα kinase activity. Together, it appears that CD28 potentiates IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of both IκBα and IκBβ. We next focused on the other cytokine-responsive IκB kinase IKKβ to determine if it had a similar activation response to CD28 costimulation. First, we examined the effects of endogenous IKKβ on GST-IκBα. In untreated Jurkat cells, there was no IKKβ activity toward IκBα (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). Upon treatment with PMA, there was slight IKKβ activation (lane 2), which was subsequently elevated with CD28 treatment (lane 3). As expected, CD28 alone had no effect on IKKβ kinase activity (lane 4). These results suggest that IKKβ activation is reminiscent of IKKα as shown in Fig. 1. We also tested the kinase activity of IKKβ toward IκBβ. Similarly, PMA alone induces a degree of phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lane 2), which is augmented by CD28 (lane 3). We conclude that IKKβ, in addition to IKKα, is responsive to the CD28 costimulatory signal. CD28 synergizes with TCR signaling to accelerate IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (20Lai J.-H. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role played by IKKα in the in vivophosphorylation of IκBα mediated by CD28 we utilized a catalytically inactive IKKα mutant. This mutant, which has been previously demonstrated to inhibit TNF-α- induced RelA nuclear translocation (28Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), has a methionine substituted for a lysine at position 44, resulting in defective ATP binding. We transiently transfected Jurkat-Tag cells with an HA-tagged IκBα construct, and split the transfection into two, leaving one sample untreated and treating the other sample with a combination of PMA and anti-CD28. As expected, we observed an unphosphorylated IκBα by immunoblotting when the cells were not treated (Fig. 4,lane 2). When the cells were treated with PMA/CD28, two bands were readily detected, with the slower migrating band representing the phosphorylated form (lane 3). Interestingly, when the catalytically inactive form of IKKα was cotransfected with IκBα, the phosphorylation induced by PMA and CD28 was completely blocked (lanes 5 and 7). This result suggests that IKKα is required for CD28-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. It has been previously reported that CD28 responsiveness within the IL-2 promoter is mediated by a CD28RE/AP-1 composite element (7Butscher W.G. Powers C. Olive M. Vinson C. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We transfected a luciferase reporter construct driven by this composite element into Jurkat cells and either treated with PMA alone or PMA together with anti-CD28. PMA alone was unable to substantially activate this reporter gene (Fig. 5 A, lane 2), but when CD28 was added in conjunction with PMA, reporter activity rose to approximately 12-fold above that observed with untreated cells (lane 3 versus lane 1). We next cotransfected the catalytically inactive IKKα with the CD28RE/AP-1 reporter and treated it with PMA and CD28. Interestingly, transfection of a moderate amount (150 ng) of IKKα K44M cDNA reduced the reporter activity by approximately 50% (Fig. 5 B, lane 3). With a higher dose (300 ng) transfection of this IKK mutant, more pronounced inhibition was observed (lane 4). It should be noted that this catalytically inactive mutant was previously demonstrated to block TNF-α-induced IKK activation by about 2- or 3-fold (28Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), suggesting the role of other compensatory factors to account for the activity observed. The catalytically inactive IKKβ K44A also inhibited reporter gene activity by about 50% at the first dose tested (100 ng) (Fig. 5 C, lane 3). However, a higher dose of IKKβ K44A (200 ng) acted as an even more potent inhibitor of CD28-mediated reporter gene activation, reducing the activity to about 25% of the control (lane 4 versus lane 2). When both IKKα K44M and IKKβ K44A were cotransfected, the inhibition observed was only slightly greater than the inhibition seen with a high dose of IKKβ K44A alone (data not shown). The lack of complete inhibition of reporter gene activity by the dominant negative IKKs is likely due to the high sensitivity of this assay, but we cannot preclude the involvement of additional IκB kinases in CD28-mediated NF-κB activation. From these experiments we conclude that both IKKα and IKKβ are required for CD28-mediated transactivation of a CD28RE/AP-1 composite element. The NF-κB transcription factors are activated by a diverse array of signals that target the inhibitory proteins IκBα and IκBβ for phosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The T cell auxiliary molecule, CD28, which provides a costimulatory signal for T cell activation and IL-2 production, is a potent inducer of NF-κB (23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bryan R.G. Li Y. Lai J.-H. Van M. Rice N.R. Rich R.R. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although CD28 promotes the rapid degradation of both IκBα and IκBβ, the mechanism has not been elucidated to date. Possibilities include synergy of IκB kinase activity, activation of an IκB kinase unique to the CD28 pathway, or perhaps enhanced ubiquitination and/or direct degradation. In this study, we report that CD28 specifically enhances the kinase activity of IKKα and IKKβ, two recently identified cytokine-responsive IκB kinases. Specifically, we found that the kinase activities of IKKα and IKKβ were elevated for both IκBα and IκBβ when T cells were treated with mitogen and anti-CD28. In addition, a catalytically inactive mutant of IKKα effectively inhibited in vivo CD28-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. Inactive forms of IKKα and IKKβ also attenuated CD28RE/AP-1 luciferase gene reporter activity induced by PMA and CD28. This study provides strong evidence that signaling through the TCR and CD28 converge at or upstream of IKKα and IKKβ, resulting in enhanced kinase activity and NF-κB activation. Where could the TCR and CD28 pathways possibly converge? Kinases upstream of IKK include the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-related molecule, NIK, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1, MEKK1 (40Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that MEKK1 preferentially activates IKKβ, while NIK activates IKKα and IKKβ equally well (41Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that MEKK1 is a downstream target of CD28 signaling, and that its kinase activity is up-regulated when stimulated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (42Faris M. Kokot N. Lee L. Nel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27366-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 43Kaga S. Ragg S. Rogers K.A. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4182-4189PubMed Google Scholar). It is not likely that MEKK1 is solely responsible for the CD28-mediated up-regulation of IKK kinase activity since we consistently observed stronger kinase activity associated with IKKα rather than IKKβ. NIK is a potential candidate to mediate the signal integration between the TCR and CD28 if the signals do in fact converge upstream of IKK. NIK is already known to integrate signals from pathways initiated by IL-1 and TNF-α to activate NF-κB (30Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating any potential role NIK may play in CD28 mediated NF-κB activation. Besides MEKK1, several other kinases have been identified which have up-regulated kinase activity when T cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Full activation of JNK in T cells is dependent on integration of the two signals (44Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). As expected, kinases within the JNK pathway such as p21-activated kinase (43Kaga S. Ragg S. Rogers K.A. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4182-4189PubMed Google Scholar), SEK (45Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and MKK7 (45Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) are similarly dependent on T cell costimulation for full activation. The transactivation capacity of the c-Jun protein, one of the AP-1 components, is activated as a result of signaling through the JNK pathway (46Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). The vital role that AP-1 plays in IL-2 transcriptional regulation is underscored by the finding that mice deficient in SEK1, a direct activator of JNK, are impaired in CD28-mediated IL-2 production (47Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I. Fischer K.D. Odermatt B. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Takimoto H. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, it is also known that NF-κB is a critical regulator of the IL-2 gene as demonstrated by gene targeting of the c-rel gene (48Köntgen F. Grumont R.J. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Li R. Tarlinton D. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). To date, kinases solely within the NF-κB pathway have not been identified to be targets of CD28 mediated activation. Our finding that IKKα and IKKβ have enhanced kinase activity when T cells are costimulated is the first such demonstration. It is likely that other kinases within the NF-κB pathway are also targeted by CD28. We have observed an excellent correlation between in vitrokinase activities of IKKα and IKKβ and in vivophosphorylation of IκBα mediated by CD28 (see Figs. 1 and 3). IκBβ is also strongly phosphorylated in vitro by both IKKα and IKKβ due to CD28 (Figs. 2 and 3). With regard to thein vivo phosphorylation of IκBβ, it is more difficult to address this question, since a band shift is not apparent after cellular stimulations. Rather, IκBβ is degraded partially within 15 min and completely in 30 min in response to mitogen and CD28 treatment (23Harhaj E.W. Maggirwar S.B. Good L. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6736-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that IκBβ is not phosphorylated as wellin vivo due to the folding of the protein or perhaps due to the binding of other proteins that may interfere with the accessibility of IKKs to the two N-terminal serine residues. Further studies within vivo 32P-labeling of IκBβ will more directly answer this question. In conclusion, we have determined the mechanism of CD28-mediated NF-κB activation to be at the level of enhanced IκB kinase activity. It appears that CD28 targets the two cytokine-responsive IκB kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, which are able to respond to multiple signals. It is therefore not likely that CD28 induces an IκB kinase distinct from IKKα or IKKβ, which is unique to the CD28 pathway. We also consider it unlikely that CD28 directly enhances the ubiquitination or degradation of IκBα and IκBβ. Studies are in progress to further delineate the TCR and CD28 pathways and to pinpoint the convergence of the two pathways in NF-κB activation. We thank Dr. Michael Karin for the IKKα and IKKβ mutant cDNAs, Dr. Arthur Weiss for the C305 antibody, and Dr. Warner Greene for the IκBα antiserum."

Previous work has located the acceptors but not the principal iodotyrosine donors. We incorporated [14C]tyrosine into beef thyroid slices, isolated and iodinated the [14C]thyroglobulin (Tg I), separated its N-terminal ∼22-kDa hormone-rich peptide, and digested the latter with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C (EC3.4.21.19). Nonlabeled thyroglobulin (Tg II) was isolated from the same glands and processed similarly, without iodination in vitro. Tg I was used to initially recognize pyruvate in peptide fractions, and Tg II was used to then identify its location in the thyroglobulin polypeptide chain. Sequencing of a tryptic peptide by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation showed a cleavage after Val129. An endoproteinase Glu-C-generated peptide had the predicted molecular mass of a fragment containing residues 130–146 with Tyr130 replaced by pyruvate; the identification of this peptide was supported by obtaining the expected shortened fragment after tryptic digestion. 14C-labeled pyruvate was identified in the same fraction as this peptide. We conclude that Tyr130 is an important donor of the outer iodothyronine ring. Its likely acceptor is Tyr5, the most important hormonogenic site of thyroglobulin, because Tyr5 and Tyr130 are proximate, because they are the most prominent early iodination sites in this part of thyroglobulin, and because the N-terminal region was previously found capable of forming T4 by itself.

Thyroid hormone synthesis involves a two step modification of tyrosyl residues within the 2750-residue polypeptide chain of bovine Tg1 (1Taurog A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid. 7th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 47-81Google Scholar). First, certain tyrosyls are iodinated to form the hormone precursors MIT and DIT, and then two iodinated tyrosyls couple to form the biologically active iodothyronines T3 and T4. In this latter reaction, a tyrosyl donates its iodinated phenyl group to become the outer ring of the iodothyronine residue at an acceptor site, leaving DHA or its derivative at the donor position (2Gavaret J-M.

Gavaret et al. (3Gavaret J-M. Nunez J. Cahnmann H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5281-5285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using14C-labeled Tg from pig thyroid slices, concluded that the residual side chain of the donor existed as DHA while in peptide linkage and was converted to Pyr after its release from Tg by enzymatic digestion, or to acetate after acid hydrolysis. Locating the origins of these donors within Tg has been difficult. Proposed sites, all resting on indirect evidence, have included the Tyr2469 or Tyr2522 of bTg, based on the conversion of DHA either to labeled Ala by boro[3H]hydride reduction or to labeled Asp by Na14CN (14Palumbo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17182-17188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Tyr residues 5, 926, 986, 1008, and 1375 of bTg, from 4-aminothiophenol modification of DHA residues (15Ohmiya Y. Hayashi H. Kondo T. Kondo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9066-9071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Marriq et al. (16Marriq C. Lejeune P-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) iodinated in vitro a CNBr-derived peptide from low iodine hTg and concluded that Tyr130 was converted to DHA with donation of an iodophenyl ring for iodothyronine formation at Tyr5. However, Xiaoet al. (17Xiao S. Pollock H.G. Taurog A. Rawitch A.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using the same substrate under similar experimental conditions, found that Tyr130 served as acceptor rather than donor, suggesting that the CNBr peptide is not a good model for hormonogenesis in intact Tg. Using a different approach based on graded iodination in vitro of low iodine hTg, we identified three potential donors, at Tyr residues 130, 847, and 1487 in hTg (9Lamas L. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These represented sites that were iodinated early but did not form hormone with further iodination. More recently, Gentileet al. (12Gentile F. Ferranti P. Mamone G. Malorni A. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggested from mass spectrometry of a peptide of bTg that Tyr1375 is an outer ring donor, probably to a neighboring minor hormonogenic site at Tyr1290. In the present paper we looked for an outer ring donor in the N-terminal part of Tg, the region of its most important hormonogenic site Tyr5, and offer evidence that Tyr130 is the dominant donor site. Fresh bovine thyroids were obtained from a local abattoir, transported to the laboratory in iced Earle's medium, and used within 1–3 h of death. We made two Tg preparations: Tg I, from thyroid slices incubated with [14C]Tyr and subsequently iodinated in vitro; and Tg II, isolated directly from the same beef thyroid without [14C]Tyr incorporation and without subsequent iodination. For Tg I, 2 g of thyroid slices were incubated in 10 ml of a tyrosine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Selectamine) containing 500 μCi of uniformly labeled [14C]Tyr (500 μCi/μmol, NEN Life Science Products) at 37 oC in a water-saturated atmosphere of air-CO2 (95:5) for 20 h, then rinsed and briefly homogenized in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by centrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 1 h. Thyroglobulin was isolated from the resultant supernatant fraction at 4 oC on a Sephacryl S300 column (2.5 × 100 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. To obtain Tg II, we processed 5 g of thyroid tissue in the same manner without prior incubation. The protein content of isolated Tg was determined using bovine serum albumin as standard (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its iodine content by a modification of the Sandell-Kolthoff method (19Dunn J.T. Crutchfield H.E. Gutekunst R. Dunn A.D. Thyroid. 1993; 3: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Iodination was carried out by exposure of Tg to iodine at a ratio of 20 atoms of iodine/molecule of 660-kDa Tg. We incubated 3.5 mg (5.3 nmol) of 14C-labeled Tg in 4 ml of 0.025 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing: 1.6 mg of glucose (Calbiochem); 15 μg of glucose oxidase, 296 units/mg (Calbiochem); 17.6 μg (106 nmol) of KI; and 162 μg of lactoperoxidase (Sigma). The reaction was started by the addition of glucose oxidase. Carrier-free K125I (0.05 μCi) was added to an aliquot (50 μl) of this mixture at the beginning of the incubation. Iodination, with and without added 125I, was carried out at 37 oC for 1 h and the reaction stopped by the addition of 0.02% sodium azide. The 125I-labeled sample was used directly to determine protein bound 125I and 125I iodoamino acid distribution after Pronase digestion by paper chromatography (4Dunn J.T. Kim P.S. Dunn A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 88-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excess reagents and unreacted iodine in the non-125I-labeled sample were removed by chromatography on a column (1.5 × 100 cm) of Sephacryl S300 in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% sodium azide. The peptide composition of 14C-labeled Tg (Tg I) following iodination and of nonlabeled Tg (Tg II) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels under reducing conditions (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and 14C-labeled gels subjected to autoradiography after treatment with EN3HANCETM (NEN Life Science Products). Molecular mass markers were myosin (200 kDa), galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21 kDa), and lysozyme (14 kDa). Samples of Tg I and Tg II were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol at a 40-fold molar excess in 8m urea at pH 8.5 and alkylated with acrylonitrile as described previously (21Dunn A.D. Myers H.E. Dunn J.T. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resultant peptides were separated on a Sephacryl S200 column in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 6 m urea and 0.02% sodium azide. Isolation of the 22-kDa N-terminal peptide is described under “Results.” The 22-kDa peptide fractions from Tg I and from Tg II were each digested with l-1-tosylamide 2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) in 0.1 mNH4HCO3, 0.1 mm CaCl2for 1 h at 37 oC and the reaction stopped with soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Tryptic peptides were first fractionated on a column (1.5 × 60 cm) of Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad), and selected fractions were further separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C8 column in a 0.1 mNH4HCO3:acetonitrile gradient. The 22-kDa peptide fractions from Tg I and from Tg II were also separately digested with endo-Glu-C (sequencing grade, Promega), enzyme to substrate ratio 1:50 (w/w), in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 for 2 h at 37 oC, the reaction was stopped with 1.3-dichloroisocoumarin, and the resultant peptides were separated by HPLC under conditions similar to those for tryptic peptides. Samples from Tg I were digested with Pronase, substrate:enzyme ratio 1:10, in 50 μl of 0.1 mNH4HCO3 for 16 h at 37 °C, and the products were passed through a Centricon 10 membrane with several rinses of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 14C-labeled compounds from the digestion were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Sephasil C8 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a gradient of 0–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Standards used were Tyr, MIT, DIT, T3, T4, and Pyr or 14C-labeled Pyr (16 μCi/μmol, NEN Life Science Products). The fraction corresponding to Pyr was then eluted isocratically on an ion exclusion column (Aminex HPX-87H, Bio-Rad) with 0.0025 N H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Oxalic, citric, malic, succinic, formic, and acetic acids (Bio-Rad) were used as standards in addition to Pyr and 14C-labeled Pyr. Detection was by 14C-label content orA 210. Pyruvate eluted with a retention time of 7.70 min, between citrate (7.50 min) and malate (9.04 min). Tg I was used to identify [14C]Pyr-containing peptides. The same fractions isolated in parallel from Tg II were then used for further analysis by mass spectrometry. The molecular masses of selected peptides were determined in a Finnigan-MAT TSQ7000 system with an electron spray ion source interfaced to a 10 cm x 75 μm id POROS 10RC reversed-phase capillary column. Peptides were eluted from the column by 0.1 macetic acid-acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 0.6 μl/min. Sequences of peptides were determined by CAD using electron spray-tandem mass spectrometry with argon as the collision gas and in some cases by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 470A Protein Sequencer as described previously (7Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox F.W. Fassler C.A. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16948-16952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained 9 mg of Tg I (1.2 million dpm/mg of protein) from thyroid slices incubated with [14C]Tyr. Twenty-three percent of 14C in the soluble fraction of labeled slices was recovered in Tg (Fig. 1 A). The yield of Tg II was 130 mg (Fig. 1 B). We iodinated 8.1 mg of Tg I using 20 atoms of iodine/molecule 660-kDa Tg. The insets in Fig. 1 show the pattern on gel of Tg I (Fig. 1 A) after iodination and of Tg II (1B). A small aliquot of Tg I, iodinated in the same way but with added carrier-free Na125I, showed 91% incorporation of125I into protein, including 14% as T4 and 8% as T3. Tg I contained 7.9 ng of iodine/μg of protein before in vitro iodination and 9.2 ng of127I/μg of protein afterward, compared with 9.8 ng of127I/μg of protein in Tg II. Fig. 2 and Table I (top two lines) compare the distribution after Pronase digestion of14C in Tg I before iodination with that after iodination. Two peaks are apparent in noniodinated Tg I (Fig. 2 A), the major one corresponding to Tyr and a second minor unknown peak labeledUnk in Fig. 2. Digestion of iodinated Tg I (Fig. 2 B) released MIT, DIT, and thyroid hormones as well as an additional 14C-labeled peak eluting early on HPLC with a retention time corresponding to that of Pyr. This peak was absent in noniodinated Tg I. We established the identity of the compound in this peak by showing in a subsequent separation step by ion exclusion chromatography that it co-eluted with authentic Pyr.Table IDistribution of C-labeled compounds in intact Tg I and its peptidesFractionPyrTyrUnkMITDITTHTg(non-iodinated)0.191.24.61.10.20.1Tg(iodinated)0.769.24.211.75.02.6FI (67%)0.568.24.810.55.91.7FII (22%)0.658.96.112.66.62.1FIII (8.1%)2.766.43.27.83.68.0FIV (2.5%)2.359.13.45.33.414.6Iodinated Tg I was reduced and alkylated and then separated into fractions I-IV on an S200 column (Fig. 3).14C-labeled Tg I was iodinated at 20 atoms of iodine/molecule of Tg as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Percentage in parentheses represents the fraction of total14C recovered from the S200 column.

Tg I and Tg II were individually reduced and alkylated, and then each was separated into four fractions (FI-FIV) by size exclusion chromatography (shown in Fig. 3 for Tg I). Fractions I and II contained primarily peptides of >200 kDa (Fig. 3, inset) and several intermediate bands of 200–40 kDa. Fraction III contained a major band of ∼22 kDa and several smaller bands. Our designation of ∼22 kDa is based on its migration on gel; it appears the same as the 30 kDa described by Gregg et al.(22Gregg J.D. Dziadik-Turner C. Rouse J. Hamilton J.W. Rawitch A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5190-5196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who perhaps calculated that mass from its constituents. We identified the ∼22 kDa as an N-terminal peptide normally released from Tg by reduction, on the basis of its size, its high hormone content (Table I), and from sequencing some of its tryptic peptides (see below). Fraction IV contained a major band of ∼10 kDa, together with bands of ∼22 and 20 kDa. Its high TH content suggested this fraction also contained N-terminal peptides of Tg. Both fractions III and IV had a high Pyr content after Pronase digestion (Table I). Fractions III from both Tg I and Tg II were selected for further study, separately but in parallel. Each was digested with trypsin, and the resultant peptides were separated into three fractions on a size-exclusion column (Fig. 4 for Tg I). Of these, fraction IIIc (from Tg I) had the highest [14C]Pyr content (2%, compared with 1% in fractions IIIa and IIIb), and on HPLC it resolved into at least 20 peptides (Fig. 5 A) and 814C-labeled peaks (Fig. 5 B, A-H). Fractions corresponding to each of the 14C-labeled peaks were analyzed by one or more methods, including the distribution of14C in Pronase-digested material (from Tg I) and sequencing by Edman degradation (from Tg I) or by mass spectrometry (from Tg II) (Table II), and were related to the theoretical tryptic peptides of N-terminal bTg, shown in Fig. 6. The high [14C]Pyr content of Peak B suggested that it included a donor-containing peptide. It was well separated from a free Pyr standard in this HPLC system. Edman degradation identified several peptides in this peak but none had Tyr in the cDNA-derived sequence of bTg, suggesting that the putative donor peptide may have been blocked at its N terminus and therefore unreadable. Peptide T8 (Fig. 6) was identified in truncated form ending immediately before residue 130 (Tyr) by Edman degradation of material from Tg I and by mass spectrometry of this peptide from Tg II. The measured molecular mass of the latter was 1459.6 ± 0.5 Da, identical to the theoretical mass of residues 118–129 with the N-terminal Gln residue converted to a pyrolline carboxylic acid, an expected consequence of the acidic conditions used during the analysis. The CAD spectrum for this peptide from Tg II confirmed its sequence and the absence of residues after Val129.Figure 5Separation of tryptic peptides of FIIIc from Tg I (Fig. 3) on HPLC using a C8 column and an ammonium bicarbonate:acetonitrile gradient.

Samples of fraction IIIc (Fig. 4) from both Tg I and Tg II were also digested with endo-Glu-C, and the resultant peptides were separated on HPLC into 18 or more fractions (Fig. 7 A for Tg II) and 514C-labeled peaks (Fig. 7 B, for Tg I). The distribution of radioactivity after Pronase digestion of each peak from Tg I is summarized in Table III. Peak C2 had a high [14C]Pyr content. On capillary HPLC, peak C2 from Tg II separated into five peptide peaks (Fig. 8 A), and the molecular masses of peaks 1–4 in Fig. 8 A were determined by mass spectrometry. The measured molecular mass of peptide 1 was 1981.6 ± 1.3 daltons, which corresponds closely to the mass of a modified endo-Glu-C peptide (1980.02 daltons) of bTg (Fig. 9 A) with the expected loss of Val129 from the cleavage described above and the substitution of Pyr or DHA at Tyr130 (Fig. 9 B). Pyr is more likely than DHA because the mass spectrum shows a fragmented form of the peptide (Fig. 8 B) corresponding to a loss of 43 daltons, consistent with removal of the acetyl group of Pyr. A Pyr at residue 130 would explain our inability to sequence the donor peptide in peak B of the tryptic digest, because loss of the amino group at the N-terminal would block Edman degradation. The CAD spectrum for peptide 1 (Fig. 8 A) was not readable because of its highly charged ions, expected from its high Arg content (four residues). To confirm the identification of this peptide (peak 1, Fig. 8 A), we digested it further with trypsin. The resultant fragment had a measured mass of 1608.3 ± 0.9 daltons, which corresponds to the loss of the C-terminal triplet of the modified endo-Glu-C peptide, an expected product of trypsin digestion (Fig. 9 C) with a theoretical mass of 1607.7 daltons. The mass spectrum for this peptide also showed it in fragmented form with a 43 dalton loss. Peak 3 (Fig. 8 A) was identified by molecular mass and CAD/MS, as Tg residues 212–225, an expected product of endo-Glu-C digestion. Peaks 2 and 4 did not contain identifiable peptides and peak 5 was not analyzed.Table IIIDistribution of C in peptides of endo-Glu-C-digested 22 kDa from Tg I (Fig. 7), expressed as percent of total in each peptidePeakPyrTyrUnkMITDITTHA3624863B2734752C19780230C213640233D33867428E344111555 Open table in a new tab Figure 8Analysis of Pyr-containing fraction (Peak C2, Fig. 7), from Tg II.

First we isolated peptide fractions containing [14C]Pyr after in vitro iodination of Tg labeled with [14C]Tyr. This led to the identification of Pyr-containing peptides from naturally iodinated Tg isolated in parallel to the 14C-labeled Tg, using mass spectrometry and referring to the cDNA-derived primary structure (23Mercken L. Simons M-J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The Pyr is presumably a derivative of DHA (2Gavaret J-M. Cahnmann H.J. Nunez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11218-11222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gavaret J-M. Nunez J. Cahnmann H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5281-5285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results identify the Tyr130 of bTg as donor of an outer iodothyronine ring. We base this conclusion on the following: (a) a truncated tryptic peptide ending immediately before residue 130, as identified in Tg I by Edman degradation and in Tg II by CAD/MS, suggested an unstable modification of this residue; (b) an endo-Glu-C peptide from Tg II had the predicted molecular mass of a peptide containing residues 130–146, with Tyr130 replaced by Pyr; (c) tryptic digestion shortened this peptide to a size predicted from the loss of a cleaved tripeptide consisting of residues 144–146; and (d) the same HPLC fraction (Fig. 7 B, peak C2) from endo-Glu-C digested FIII of Tg I contained [14C]Pyr. This direct identification of Tyr130 as donor agrees with predictions made from indirect evidence by Marriq et al. (16Marriq C. Lejeune P-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and by us (9Lamas L. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Support for the physiological importance of this donor site comes from a goitrous hypothyroid family described by Ieiri et al. (24Ieiri T. Cochaux P. Targovnik H.M. Suzuki M. Shimoda S-I. Perret J. Vassart G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); its members lacked exon 4 of Tg, which codes for a 70-residue segment including Tyr130, suggesting that Tyr130 was necessary for adequate production of thyroid hormone. Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation sequencing of tryptic peptide T8 of bTg (Fig. 6) showed the expected sequence only through residue 129, suggesting peptide cleavage between it and residue 130. The mechanism for this cleavage and its relation to iodination are not clear. Reduction of iodinated Tg has produced hormone-rich N-terminal peptides of 10–30 kDa in all species studied. Gregg et al.(22Gregg J.D. Dziadik-Turner C. Rouse J. Hamilton J.W. Rawitch A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5190-5196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have localized these cleavages in reduced bTg to precede residues 81 and either 234 or 235. The cleavage we report here following Val129 appears different in type and location. Marriqet al. (25Marriq C. Lejeune P-J. Venot N. Vinet L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) also reported a cleavage between residues 129 and 130 in a CNBr-generated fragment of hTg. Although we do not discount the possibility that the break we describe occurs simultaneously with iodotyrosyl coupling at that site, we think it more likely that the formation of DHA with the loss of the phenyl ring at the time of coupling makes the 129–130 bond susceptible to breakage during subsequent experimental manipulation. We do not have evidence that this cleavage occurs in the thyroid in vivo. An N-terminal peptide comprised of residues 1–129 has not been reported in reduced Tg after various degrees of iodination. Gavaret et al. (2Gavaret J-M. Cahnmann H.J. Nunez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11218-11222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that instability of the peptide bond associated with the DHA residue could lead to its hydrolytic cleavage and the transformation of DHA to Pyr at the N terminus of the resultant peptide. Our mass spectral data favor the presence of Pyr rather than DHA in the donor peptides, at least by the time it was isolated and studied. Our inability to sequence the tryptic peptide containing residues 130–133, with the putative donor at 130, is consistent with Pyr blocking the Edman degradation. The work of Gentile et al. (12Gentile F. Ferranti P. Mamone G. Malorni A. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggests that cleavage of the peptide bond and the accompanying transformation of DHA to Pyr at the donor site are not universal consequences of the iodotyrosyl coupling reaction because they reported intact DHA at residue 1375 in bTg within a peptide comprising residues 1366–1381, as identified by mass spectrometry. In this study, we concentrated on the N-terminal region of bTg because it contains the most important hormonogenic site (Tyr5) of Tg and can be isolated by chemical reduction after iodination. Most of the N terminus was in fractions III and IV (Fig. 3 and Table I), which together contained similar portions of the total [14C]Pyr of Tg and of its total labeled hormone. We did not locate the [14C]Pyr in fraction IV, but suspect at least some was at residue 130 because this fraction contained appreciable amounts of 22 kDa on autoradioautography (Fig. 3, insert); also FIV would be expected to include a residual peptide encompassing residues 81–234 after cleavage of the 22 kDa to produce an ∼10 kDa, as shown in Fig. 6 (22Gregg J.D. Dziadik-Turner C. Rouse J. Hamilton J.W. Rawitch A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5190-5196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed Tyr5 and Tyr130 to be the only important early iodination sites in the first 240 residues of hTg (9Lamas L. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13541-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is strongly homologous to bTg, although Xiao,et al. (26Xiao S. Dorris M.L. Rawitch A.B. Taurog A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) did not find early iodination at Tyr130 in their in vitro system. Several reports suggest that the N terminus is sufficient by itself to form T4; for example, goitrous Dutch goats, with a hereditary defect leading to termination of Tg message transcription at residue 296, were still able to synthesize sufficient hormone for euthyroidism (27Veenboer G.J.M. de Vijlder J.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, Tyr130 and Tyr5 are prominently involved in hormone synthesis in several experimental models (16Marriq C. Lejeune P-J. Venot N. Vinet L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Xiao S. Pollock H.G. Taurog A. Rawitch A.B. Arch. Biochem.

Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) although the applicability to in vivoconditions is uncertain. We believe these considerations make Tyr5 the most likely acceptor for the donated iodotyrosyl from position 130. Further study of hormone formation in the remainder of the Tg molecule is necessary to match donors and acceptors definitively.

This paper focuses on a ribosome-associated protein with the properties of a c-myc mRNA-degrading ribonuclease. The significance of mRNases stems from the fact that mRNA stability affects gene expression in virtually all organisms (1Higgins C.F. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1992; 2: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 3Ross J. Microbiol.

Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 217-240Google Scholar). Moreover, mRNA stability is regulated, because the half-lives of many mRNAs fluctuate as a function of cell growth, environmental factors, and the stage of cell differentiation. mRNases must play a central role in these fluctuations. Unfortunately, we know little about mammalian mRNases, and no enzyme has yet been proved to be a mammalian mRNase. There are many unresolved issues about these enzymes. How many of them are present in each mammalian cell? In what critical ways do mRNases differ from RNA-processing enzymes? Do mRNases also process RNA or attack other classes of RNAs? How do mRNases distinguish mRNA from rRNA and tRNA? Does each mRNase attack only a subset of mRNAs? Genetic approaches have made it feasible to identify mRNases in lower organisms and to analyze the phenotype of cells with mRNase gene mutations (1Higgins C.F. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1992; 2: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,2Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In contrast, vertebrate cells with mRNase gene mutations have not been generated. Several candidate vertebrate mRNases have been identified using other strategies as follows: (i) incubating cell extracts with deproteinized mRNA substrates or (ii) analyzing mRNA decay in polysome-containing cell-free mRNA decay systems (reviewed in Refs. 3Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schoenberg D.R. Chernokalskaya E. mRNA Metabolism and Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation. Wiley Interscience, New York1997: 217-240Google Scholar, 5Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Some of these enzymes are endonucleases, and others are exonucleases. Based on the findings in yeast and prokaryotes, it is likely that vertebrate cells contain only a few mRNases. Our laboratory has been investigating the regulation of c-myc mRNA stability. By using cell-free mRNA decay assays and transfection, we and others (6Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) have suggested that c-myc mRNA can be degraded by alternative pathways involving at least two mRNases. One mRNase is involved in a 3′ to 5′ decay pathway in which the poly(A) tail is removed first, and then the body of the mRNA is degraded. The second mRNase is an endonuclease that we initially identified using a polysome-based cell-free mRNA decay assay. This endonuclease attacks the C-terminal coding region of endogenous, polysome-associated c-myc mRNA. We refer to this endonuclease cleavage target as the c-myc coding region determinant or CRD,1 because it is a major determinant of c-myc mRNA stability in cells (7Wisdom R. Lee W. J. Biol.

It is also a binding site for a protein that is thought to shield the mRNA from endonuclease attack (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J.

A. R. Doyle, N. A. Betz, P. Leeds, A. J. Fleisig, R. D. Prokipcak, and J. Ross, manuscript submitted for publication. The relationship of the endonuclease to the c-myc CRD and to c-mycmRNA stability is further supported by the finding that c-myc mRNA can be degraded endonucleolytically in cells (16Swartwout S.G. Kinniburgh A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Ioannidis P. Havredaki M. Courtis N. Trangas T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the partial purification of a polysome-associated endonuclease with the properties of the c-myc mRNase. The soluble enzyme was isolated from a high salt extract of rat liver polysomes. It is a magnesium-dependent protein that is resistant to the RNase A class of RNase inhibitors. Therefore, it is not a member of the RNase A family. It cleaves deproteinized c-myc CRD RNA with high specificity and preferentially attacks one RNA segment that is rich in A residues. Although these data do not prove that this enzyme is the c-myc mRNase, the enzyme we have purified does share several properties with the polysome-associated c-myc mRNase. The subcloning of the c-myc DNA fragments corresponding to all or part of the CRD of c-myc mRNA has been described (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Prokipcak R.D. Herrick D.J. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9261-9269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of these DNAs generates RNAs corresponding to nucleotides 1705–1792 and 1705–1886 of c-myc mRNA, respectively (diagrammed in Fig. 1 A, top). The 1705–1886 RNA is the full-length CRD and is designated FL-CRD RNA in the text. The shielding protein or CRD-binding protein (CRD-BP) binds with high specificity to FL-CRD RNA (10Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Prokipcak R.D. Herrick D.J. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9261-9269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA corresponding to c-myc nts 1705–1792 is referred to as 5′-CRD RNA. 5′-CRD 32P-RNA was used as the substrate for purifying and characterizing the liver endonuclease. Unlabeled CRD RNA was synthesized by linearizing the 5′-CRD plasmid or the FL-CRD plasmid with EcoRI and transcribing the DNA with SP6 RNA polymerase. As a control, plasmid pBSmyc, which contains full-length human c-MYC cDNA cloned into pBluescript, was digested with EarI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate an RNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–217 of c-MYC mRNA. Transcriptions were performed using Megascript kits (Ambion). Each in vitro transcribed RNA (10 μg) was dephosphorylated with 40 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction according to the maufacturer's instructions. Dephosphorylated RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. One μg of it was incubated in a 25-μl reaction with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 6000 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 1 h with 50 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated label was removed by a G-50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. To prepare 3′-32P-labeled CRD RNA, 65 pmol of the 88-nt CRD RNA was incubated in a 20-μl reaction containing 90 pmol of [5′-32P]pCp (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3000 Ci/mmol), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 200 ng of BSA, 10% (v/v) Me2SO, 1 mm ATP, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 120 units of T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs), 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, for 18–20 h at 4 °C. The resulting RNA was 3′-end-labeled and 3′-phosphorylated (RNA-32P-C-P). Unincorporated label was removed, and the RNA was purified as described above. The pH of all buffers for these experiments was determined at room temperature. The standard 20-μl reaction mixture included 2 mm DTT, 1 unit of RNasin (Promega), 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mm spermidine, 1 ng of 5′-end-labeled 32P-RNA (∼5 × 104 cpm), 11 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. These components were first assembled on ice, and enzyme was added last. Unless otherwise noted, reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, placed in dry ice for 10 min, and then lysophilized. Five μl of loading dye (80% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 12.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) were added, and the samples were denatured at 65 °C for 10 min and electrophoresed at 250 V for 2 h in an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 15 min, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). One major endonuclease decay product of ∼30 nt was generated (see Fig. 1 B). One endonuclease unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to cleave 30% of the input RNA substrate into this decay product in a 10-min reaction at 37 °C. Under these conditions, the amount of decay product formed was linear with enzyme concentration. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) each weighing 175–200 g were sacrificed. Their livers (average weight 11 g) were excised. One ml of Buffer A per 0.4 g of tissue was added (Buffer A, 1 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). The livers were homogenized for 30 s using a Polytron and were further hand-homogenized with 15 strokes to increase the percentage of broken cells. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 24,500 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was layered over a 10-ml cushion of 30% (w/v) sucrose in Buffer A and centrifuged in the SW28 rotor at 96,500 ×g for 2 h to pellet the polysomes. The polysomes were resuspended in Buffer A, and 4 m potassium acetate was added slowly with gentle mixing to a final concentration of 0.5m. Gentle mixing was continued for an additional 15 min, avoiding bubbles. The material was then ultracentrifuged as described above. The supernatant above the sucrose pad contained salt-eluted polysomal proteins and is designated ribosomal salt wash (RSW). This RSW was used for endonuclease purification as described below. Typically, between 50 and 75 mg of RSW protein were obtained from one liver. RSW can be stored at −80 °C for at least 6 months without loss of endonuclease activity. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Approximately 4 g of RSW protein were mixed with 6 volumes of 25% (v/v) glycerol. Three hundred mg of RSW protein were loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a 2.5 × 12 cm phosphocellulose column (Sigma) equilibrated with 0.05 m KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. The column was washed until the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) returned to base line. Bound proteins were then eluted with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m KCl in the same buffer. Seven-ml fractions were collected, and an aliquot of each was assayed for endonuclease activity as described above. For reasons we do not understand, RNase recovery was higher on smaller phosphocellulose columns than on larger ones. Therefore, to deal with 4 g of RSW from 70 livers, 14 separate chromatography runs were performed using 2.5 × 12 cm phosphocellulose columns. The results were highly reproducible. To plot the data, the fraction containing the highest activity was set at 100%, and the relative activity of all other fractions was calculated (Fig. 2). Pooled phosphocellulose fractions (Fig. 2 A) were diluted to 0.1 m KCl by adding 1 volume of 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 60 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4. The sample was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to a 2.5 × 16 cm reactive blue-3 dye affinity column (Sigma) equilibrated with 0.1m KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4 (Buffer B). After washing the column until the A 280 returned to base line, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0m KCl in Buffer B. Three separate reactive blue-3 columns were performed, and similar results were obtained from each. Active fractions from reactive blue-3 columns were diluted to ∼0.1m KCl by adding 1 volume of 25% (v/v) glycerol. The sample was applied at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min onto 1.2 × 2.0-cm Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with Buffer B. The flow-through containing the RNase activity was collected until a base-line A 280 was reached. To ensure that no RNase remained on the column, the column was washed with buffer containing 1 m KCl to elute bound proteins. No RNase activity was detected in this wash (data not shown). The Q-Sepharose flow-through was loaded at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min onto a 2.5 × 4.0 cm reactive green-19 column (Sigma) previously equilibrated with Buffer B. After washing until theA 280 returned to base line, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m KCl in Buffer B. Three-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 150 μg of carrier carbonic anhydrase (Sigma), which was included from this stage on at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to maintain endonuclease activity. Active fractions from reactive green-19 were pooled and diluted to ∼0.1 m KCl by adding 5 volumes of 25% (v/v) glycerol containing 100 μg/ml carbonic anhydrase. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min onto a pre-packed 5 ml heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The column was washed until theA 280 returned to base line, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m KCl in the same buffer. Fractions of 1.4 ml were collected into tubes containing 100 μg of carrier carbonic anhydrase. RSW (0.1 ml; 1 mg of protein) was layered onto a 10–30% (v/v) glycerol gradient (4 ml, 11 × 60-mm tubes) made in 0.25m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and was centrifuged for 18 h, 4 °C, 200,000 ×g (44, 100 rpm) in a Beckman SW 60 rotor. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected manually from the top, and 5 μl of each fraction were assayed for endonuclease activity. A separate 10–30% glycerol gradient was centrifuged in the same manner and contained the following proteins as molecular mass standards: β-galactosidase (116.4 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). The protein standards were identified by SDS-PAGE. RSW (0.4 ml; 4 mg of protein) was chromatographed on a SEC 2000 high pressure liquid chromatography column (Beckman) equilibrated with 0.25 m KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4. The column was run at 0.4 ml/min, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing carrier carbonic anhydrase to give a final concentration of 100 μg/ml protein. A 4-μl aliquot of each fraction was assayed for endonuclease activity. The column was calibrated with Bio-Rad SDS-PAGE low molecular weight markers, the elution of which was determined by SDS-PAGE. We analyze the in vitro decay of endogenous, polysome-associated mRNAs by incubating polysomes in an appropriate buffer at 37 °C (5Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Ross J. Kobs G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To investigate the properties of the polysome-associated c-myc mRNA-degrading endonuclease, HeLa cell polysomes expressing GMG mRNA were used. The construction of the GMG gene and culturing and transfection of HeLa cells have been described (10Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GMG gene is driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, and the major features of GMG mRNA are diagrammed in Fig. 1 A, bottom. GMG mRNA includes 419 nt from the human β-globin mRNA cap site to the EcoRI site in the coding region, 249 nt from the C-terminal coding region of human c-myc mRNA, 6 nt from an EcoRI linker, and 207 nt from the β-globin EcoRI site to the mRNA 3′ terminus. The c-myc segment is inserted in frame and includes the 182-nt c-myc CRD plus 67 coding nts 5′ of the CRD. mRNA decay reactions contained polysomes from GMG-expressing HeLa cells and were performed as described previously (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 10Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Ross J. Kobs G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Where indicated, excess c-myc CRD competitor RNA was added to the reactions at 1 μg of competitor per 10 μg of polysomal RNA. The CRD competitor RNA activates the c-myc endonucleolytic decay pathway and causes the mRNA to be cleaved within the CRD (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for various times, total RNA was prepared by phenol extraction and was blotted to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized with a [32P]ApaLI-EcoRI fragment of human β-globin cDNA prepared by random priming. This probe anneals to the 5′ region of GMG mRNA and recognizes both undegraded GMG mRNA and the 5′-endonuclease decay product. The method of Zaug et al.(19Zaug A.J. Lingner J. Cech T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 532-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used, with slight modifications. Eight ng of 5′32P-labeled 5′-CRD RNA (c-myc nucleotides 1705–1792) were cleaved by 1 unit of heparin-Sepharose-purified endonuclease. The reaction was terminated at several time points, and the RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. A 1.5-ng aliquot of each RNA sample was electrophoresed in an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to confirm that the endonuclease had cleaved the RNA. The remainder of each sample (6.5 ng) was poly(A)-tailed with yeast poly(A) polymerase (550 units; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a 20-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The poly(A)-tailed RNA was then reverse-transcribed with 25 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) using 0.5 μg of primer T (5′-dAACCCGGCTCGAGCGGCCGC(T18)-3′) in a 20-μl reaction containing 8 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm each of the 4 dNTPs, 4 units of RNasin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The underlined nucleotides in the primer T sequence denote theXhoI restriction site used for cloning. The reaction was incubated first at room temperature for 15 min and then at 50 °C for 15 min. Reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating the reaction mix to 95 °C for 5 min, and unincorporated dNTPs were removed with a G-50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amplification by PCR was performed using primers T and Myc. The Myc primer (5′-dCTCGGATCCATTTAGGTGACACTATAGACCAGATCCCGGAGTTGG-3′) includes c-myc nucleotides 1705–1722. The underlined nucleotides indicate a BamHI restriction site. Two DNAs were detected following PCR. One corresponded to undegraded 5′-CRD RNA and the other to the endonucleolytic degradation product (see Fig. 10 B). Each DNA was gel-purified, cleaved withXhoI and BamHI, cloned into pGEM7Z, and sequenced using a T7 primer. The existence of a polysomal c-myc mRNA-degrading endonuclease was revealed in previous studies using a cell-free mRNA decay assay (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The assay reaction includes polysomes from tissue culture cells, and the decay of endogenous, polysome-associated mRNAs such as c-myc and histone is monitored. Under certain reaction conditions, polysome-associated c-myc mRNA is cleaved endonucleolytically in a c-myc segment designated the coding region determinant or CRD. The CRD is the last 180–250 nt of the coding region (Fig. 1 A; Ref.9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two additional findings strengthened the connections among an endonuclease, the CRD of c-myc mRNA, and c-myc mRNA stability. (i) The CRD is a major determinant of c-myc mRNA expression and stability in vivo (7Wisdom R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19015-19021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wisdom R. Lee W. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 10Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Yeilding N.M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2698-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). (ii) c-myc mRNA is cleaved endonucleolytically in at least some cells (16Swartwout S.G. Kinniburgh A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Ioannidis P. Havredaki M. Courtis N. Trangas T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4969-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In view of these findings, we undertook to purify and characterize the responsible enzyme. The strategy was to solubilize polysomal proteins using high salt extraction and to incubate the extract with a deproteinized c-myc CRD 32P-RNA substrate. Since endonucleolytic cleavage of endogenous c-myc mRNA occurred in the 5′ one-half of the CRD (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 10Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Prokipcak R.D. Herrick D.J. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9261-9269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RNA from this segment of the CRD was used as substrate (designated 5′-CRD RNA; Fig. 1 A). A high salt ribosomal salt wash extract (RSW) from rat liver polysomes was chosen as the starting material for these studies for three reasons. (i) c-myc mRNA abundance is regulated post-transcriptionally in rodent liver cells during fetal development and during liver regeneration (20Steer C.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21Steer C.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The c-myc coding region is required for proper regulation to occur (22Morello D. Asselin C. Lavenu A. Marcu K.B. Babinet C. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 955-961PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morello D. Lavenu A. Babinet C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1511-1519PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lavenu A. Pistoi S. Pournin S. Babinet C. Morello D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4410-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Pistoi S. Roland J. Babinet C. Morello D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5107-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed reasonable to search for an endonucleolytic c-mycmRNase in liver tissue. (ii) Liver provides an abundant source of starting material. (iii) Crude liver extract contains an endonuclease with the expected properties of the c-myc mRNase. When c-myc 5′-CRD 32P-RNA was incubated with rat liver RSW, the RNA was cleaved endonucleolytically, generating a single major degradation product of ∼30–40 nts (Fig. 1 B, filled arrowhead). In gels with greater resolving power, this band migrates at ∼30 nt (Fig. 6). The region of the RNA that was cleaved by the liver enzyme corresponded to the region of polysome-associated c-myc mRNA that was cleaved by the c-mycmRNase in cell-free mRNA decay reactions (9Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 10Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Prokipcak R.D. Herrick D.J. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9261-9269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation implied that the solubilized liver endonuclease might correspond to the polysomal c-myc mRNase. The liver endonuclease was purified through five column steps (Fig. 2, Table I, and “Experimental Procedures”). Two peaks of endonuclease activity were consistently observed in the reactive blue-3 column. The major peak that was eluted at 0.2 m KCl was purified further (overlined in Fig. 2 B). We have not characterized the smaller enzyme peak, but it did generate the same endonucleolytic decay product as the major peak (data not shown). Therefore, it might be a modified form of the enzyme or a complex of the endonuclease with itself or with other proteins. The approximate salt concentrations at which the enzyme was eluted in the five columns of Fig. 2 were 0.2, 0.25, 0.1 m or less, 3The enzyme did not bind to Q-Sepharose at 0.1m salt. 0.6, and 0.4m, respectively. Since the endonuclease lost activity when the protein concentration fell below 50 μg/ml (data not shown), carrier carbonic anhydrase was added to all fractions in the final two purification steps (reactive green-19 and heparin-Sepharose). As a result, endonuclease activity was maintained, but it became impossible to determine the fold purification of the enzyme (Table I). The endonuclease activity recovered from the heparin-Sepharose column contained many proteins (Fig. 3). However, a comparison of enzyme activity with the protein elution profile suggested that the endonuclease corresponded to the ∼39-kDa protein denoted by the arrow in Fig. 3. The major peak of endonuclease activity was detected in heparin-Sepharose fractions 17–19; there was also considerable activity in fractions 20–22 (Fig. 4 B). Of all the proteins in these fractions, the only one whose intensity correlated with enzyme activity was the ∼39-kDa band (Fig. 4 A, arrow). Note also that some of the other bands in these lanes were derived from the added carrier protein.Table IPurification of rat liver endoribonucleaseStepProteinVolumeActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgmlunitsunits/mg%-foldRibosomal salt wash403518494.8 × 1061175100 1Phosphocellulose47416353.9 × 106821082 7Reactive blue-3242005.3 × 10521,9301119Q-Sepharose11.54009.3 × 10580,8902069Reactive green 19393 × 1056Heparin-Sepharose5.21.1 × 1052Endoribonuclease activity was determined in the linear range at each step.

We now show that CLN2 overexpression can also repress FUS1 induction if the signaling pathway is activated at the level of the β-subunit of the G-protein (STE4) but not when activated at the level of downstream kinases (STE20 and STE11) or at the level of the transcription factor STE12. This epistatic analysis indicates that repression of pheromone signaling pathway by Cln2-Cdc28 kinase takes place at a level around STE20. In agreement with this, a marked reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of the Ste20 protein is observed at the time in the cell cycle of maximal expression of CLN2. This mobility change is constitutive in cells overexpressing CLN2 and absent in cells lackingCLN1 and CLN2. These changes in electrophoretic mobility correlate with repression of pheromone signaling and suggest Ste20 as a target for repression of signaling by G1cyclins. Two morphogenic pathways for which Ste20 is essential, pseudohyphal differentiation and haploid-invasive growth, also requireCLN1 and CLN2. Together with the previous observation that Cln1 and Cln2 are required for the function of Ste20 in cytokinesis, this suggests that Cln1 and Cln2 regulate the biological activity of Ste20 by promoting morphogenic functions, while inhibiting the mating factor signal transduction function.

Binding of mating factor to a specific receptor in haploidSaccharomyces cerevisiae cells activates a signal transduction pathway that prepares for conjugation with cells of the opposite mating type. The transduction of the signal starts with binding of the peptide mating factor to a seven-transmembrane domain receptor (Ste2 in a mating type cells and Ste3 in α-cells), which then activates a heterotrimeric G-protein by releasing an active β-γ complex from the inhibitory α-subunit (α-, β-, and γ-subunits are encoded, respectively, by theGPA1, STE4, and STE18 genes). The activated G-protein transmits the signal to a set of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated in a sequential order. The first of these is Ste20, a member of the family of p21-activated kinases (PAKs),1 and then Ste11 (a MAP kinase kinase kinase), Ste7 (a MAP kinase kinase), and finally a MAP kinase (Fus3 or in some cases Kss1) are activated. Activation of the MAP kinase (i) stimulates the transcription of many genes involved in the conjugation process through the transcription factor Ste12, (ii) results in arrest in G1-phase of the cell cycle through the Far1 protein, and (iii) leads to specific morphological changes that are required for efficient cell fusion.

Some of the components of the mating factor signal transduction pathway are required for functions other than sexual differentiation. Agar-invasive growth of haploid cells (haploid-invasive growth) and pseudohyphal growth of diploid cells both require Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, and Ste12 (5Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 6Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R.

In addition, from the lethal phenotype of cells that are deleted for both Ste20 and Cla4, a related PAK family member, Ste20, appears to share a function in the budding/cytokinesis cycle with Cla4 (8Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The overlap in function is only partial, as Cla4 has no known function in mating factor signal transduction. Therefore, Ste20 is not only critical for sexual differentiation in response to mating factor but can also play a role in morphogenesis during the vegetative cell cycle. The small G-protein Cdc42 can interact with a specific domain in the N terminus of Ste20 that is conserved among PAK family members (2Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20 is dispensable forin vitro kinase activity and the mating factor signal transduction functions of Ste20 but appears critical for the vegetative morphological roles of Ste20 (9Peter M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8556-8559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similarly, full morphogenic function of Cla4 also requires interaction of Cla4 with Cdc42 (12Benton B.K. Tinkelenberg A. Gonzalez I. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5067-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both the basal activity (in absence of ligand stimulation) and the mating factor-induced activity of the mating factor signal transduction pathway are cell cycle-regulated (13Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the absence of mating factor stimulation, fluctuations are observed for transcripts of many genes that are involved in the mating reaction and whose transcription involves Ste12 (13Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Oehlen L.J.W.M.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A common pattern for transcription of such genes is that transcription is high in G1-phase and then declines as cells enter S-phase (15Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The activity of the Fus3 protein kinase shows a similar cell cycle pattern (17Wassmann K. Ammerer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13180-13188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this regulation is likely to be required for the cell cycle regulation of basal transcription. The mating factor-induced signal transduction activity is also strictly regulated, with maximal activation during M/G1-phase, and reduced activation in S-phase (13Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This regulation of the induced signal transduction activity depends specifically on the G1 cyclins CLN1 and CLN2 (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cyclins are expressed in late G1-phase, and when Cln1 and Cln2 associate with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Cdc28, they help to promote the transition of cells from G1- to S-phase (18Cross F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). High level expression of CLN2 strongly reduces induction of mating specific genes by mating factor or by deletion of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggest that regulation of mating factor signal transduction activity by Cln1/2-Cdc28 takes place at a level downstream of the mating factor receptor and the α-subunit. Here we present a more detailed analysis of the regulation of the mating factor signal transduction pathway by the G1 cyclinsCLN1 and CLN2. A combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological observations suggests that Cln1/2-Cdc28 regulate the function of the Ste20 protein kinase. The genotypes of the strains used in this study are given in Table I. Strains were isogenic to BF264-15D (trp1-1a leu2-3, 112 ura3 ade1 his2) except where indicated.

Cells were grown in YEP medium or synthetic dropout medium with raffinose, galactose, or dextrose as described (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Assays for pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells and agar-invasive growth in haploid cells were performed as described (5Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R.

Cell cycle synchronization of cln1−, cln2−, and cln3− cells by conditional cyclin expression from theGAL1 promoter and synchronization protocols for strains with thermosensitive cdc15-2 and cdc28-13 alleles were as described (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression was followed by determining the fraction of unbudded cells or by analysis of transcripts with known patterns of cell cycle regulation. Procedures for RNA hybridization (“Northern”) mRNA analysis were as described previously (16McKinney J.D. Chang F. Heintz N. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). FUS1 and CLN2 DNA restriction fragments were excised from low melting point agarose gels, and SST2, TCM1, and H2A fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction as described (15Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were radiolabeled by random-prime labeling using a Prime-It kit (Stratagene), and transcript levels were visualized and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphorImager system. Immunoblot (“Western”) protein analysis by enhanced chemiluminescence was essentially as described (15Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies, which were raised against residues in kinase-domains VI or XI of Ste20 (Kinetek, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), were used at a dilution 1:2000. We have previously shown that constitutive expression of CLN2 from the strong GAL1 promoter can effectively block the response to mating factor (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of the mating factor pathway by deletion of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein can also be repressed by overexpression of CLN2 (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This latter observation suggests that inhibition of the mating factor pathway by CLN2 takes place at a level downstream of the mating factor receptor and the α-subunit of the G-protein. We wanted to determine the site of action of Cln2 on the mating factor pathway more precisely. For this epistatic analysis, we used expression constructs of particular genes, whose high level expression has been shown to induce the mating factor response pathway. Among these are STE4 (the β-subunit of the G-protein) (32Whiteway M. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), activated alleles of the STE20 and STE11kinases (24Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 34Cairns B.R. Ramer S.W. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the “scaffolding” protein STE5(36Akada R. Kallal L. Johnson D.I. Kurjan J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 103-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hasson M.S. Blinder D. Thorner J. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transcription factor STE12 (35Dolan J.W. Fields S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of simultaneous expression of CLN2 and these activators of the mating factor response pathway (Fig. 1). In all cases the signal transduction activity of wild type cells and GAL1::CLN2 cells without the expression construct served as a control. As shown in Fig. 1 A, overexpression of CLN2 from theGAL1 promoter can prevent the induction of FUS1transcription caused by overexpression of STE4. Even whenSTE4-overexpressing cells were treated with mating factor, simultaneous overexpression of CLN2 could prevent the induction of FUS1. In contrast, overexpression of a truncated allele of STE20 (STE20ΔN, Fig. 1 B), a truncated allele of STE11(STE11ΔN, Fig. 1 D) and STE12 (Fig. 1 E), resulted in elevated levels of FUS1transcription in the presence of high levels of CLN2. In all these cases, expression of CLN2 from the GAL1promoter also failed to prevent the additional elevation of FUS1 transcript levels by addition of mating factor (Fig. 1,B, D, and E). (It should be noted that, in a previous publication (14Oehlen L.J.W.M. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we have referred to preliminary results that appeared to show epistasis of GAL1::STE4 to GAL1::CLN2. These data now turn out to be incorrect and were probably due to a mix-up of plasmids. We wish to apologize for any problem that this may have caused.). We found that high level CLN2 expression not only failed to down-regulate elevated FUS1 transcription induced byGAL1::STE11ΔN (Fig. 1 D) but alsoSST2 transcription (the transcript is regulated similarly toFUS1 (38Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4169-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) induced by activated STE11 alleles (STE11-1 and STE11-4 (24Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)) expressed from their own promoter (Fig. 2 D). In fact, high level CLN2 expression may somewhat enhance the effect of the STE11-4 allele on SST2transcription. This finding is in contrast to results that were recently reported by others (17Wassmann K. Ammerer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13180-13188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Even using the same strains that were used in that study (17Wassmann K. Ammerer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13180-13188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we have been unable to reproduce the result that high level CLN2 expression represses the elevation of FUS1 transcription caused by the activated allelesSTE11-1 and STE11-4 (data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 2 D cannot be explained by ineffective expression of CLN2, as mating factor-induced transcription of SST2 is effectively blocked by high level CLN2expression in these cells (Fig. 2 E). We have no explanation at present for this discrepancy. The GAL1::STE20ΔN construct fails to complement the mating defect of ste4, ste5, ste11, ste7, and ste12 cells (33Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To provide additional epistatic information, we determined the effects of overexpression of GAL1::STE20ΔN onFUS1 transcription in strains that were deleted for various components of the mating factor signal transduction pathway (Fig. 2 A). Induction of FUS1 byGAL1::STE20ΔN was observed in cells lacking the mating factor receptor (STE2), components of the heterotrimeric G-protein (STE4 and STE18), and STE5. However, other components of the signal transduction pathway were required for GAL1::STE20ΔN-inducedFUS1 transcription. These data are consistent with the established epistatic position of STE20 downstream of the G-protein and upstream of the STE11-STE7-MAP kinase cassette (23Leberer E. Dignard D. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and thus demonstrate the usefulness of theGAL1::STE20ΔN construct for epistatic analysis. The epistatic position of STE5 in the mating factor response pathway is complicated, possibly because of the many proteins with which Ste5 interacts (39Elion E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 322-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A GAL1::STE5 construct has been used previously in epistatic experiments, but when plating efficiency of cells containing a GAL1::STE5plasmid was monitored, this yielded rather complex results (36Akada R. Kallal L. Johnson D.I. Kurjan J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 103-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the FUS1 induction by theGAL1::STE5 construct in strains deleted for various components of the signal transduction pathway (Fig. 2 B). FUS1 induction by overexpression of STE5 required, with the exception of STE2, the presence of all the tested components of the mating factor signal transduction pathway. Activated alleles of STE5 were previously shown to partially complement the mating defect of strains deleted for the mating factor receptor, components of the heterotrimeric G-protein or Ste20, but not deletion of components of the STE11-STE7-MAP kinase cassette (23Leberer E. Dignard D. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 37Hasson M.S. Blinder D. Thorner J. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirm the findings of Hasson et al. (37Hasson M.S. Blinder D. Thorner J. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and extend previous analyses (37Hasson M.S. Blinder D. Thorner J. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Hougan L. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by showing that induction of FUS1by high level expression of STE5 also requiresSTE20. The failure of induction of FUS1 byGAL1::STE5 in ste20− cells suggests that slow growth of such cells that was observed by Akada et al. (36Akada R. Kallal L. Johnson D.I. Kurjan J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 103-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is not due to increased transcriptional activity of the mating factor response pathway. On the whole, the data obtained withGAL1::STE5 constructs yield rather complex results that are difficult to place in an epistatic series and therefore are of limited use in establishing the position of the negative effect of Cln2-Cdc28 on the mating factor signal transduction pathway. Because of this, the observation that GAL1::CLN2 expression represses the signal generated by GAL1::STE5 only in the absence, and not in the presence of mating factor (Fig. 1 C), is also difficult to interpret. The epistatic position of Ste11 in relation to most other components of the mating factor signal transduction pathway is fairly well established by transcriptional-induction and mating-complementation assays using STE11-1 and STE11-4 alleles (24Stevenson B.J. Rhodes N. Errede B. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) or the GAL1::STE11ΔN construct (34Cairns B.R. Ramer S.W. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The observation that STE11-1 and STE11-4 also induce significant levels of SST2 in ste20 cells (Fig. 2 C) is consistent with the general notion that Ste11 acts downstream of Ste20. Taken together, the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 show thatGAL1::CLN2 represses the mating factor pathway at a level which is at or downstream of STE4 and at or upstream of STE20. The observations that mating factor-induced hyperphosphorylation of Ste7 (41Zhou Z. Gartner A. Cade R. Ammerer G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2069-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of Fus3 (42Errede B. Gartner A. Zhou Z. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G. Nature. 1993; 362: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (assayed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in immunoprecipitates of Fus3), and Fus3 kinase activation can be prevented by high level expression of CLN2 (data not shown (15Oehlen L.J.W.M. McKinney J.D. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) are consistent with this epistatic placement of the negative effect of Cln2-Cdc28 on the mating factor response pathway. Since the Ste20 protein is one of the potential targets suggested by epistatic analysis and since studies of the Ste20 homolog Cla4 suggest a potential genetic interaction between Ste20 and the G1cyclins CLN1 and CLN2 (8Cvrckova F. De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Benton B.K. Tinkelenberg A. Gonzalez I. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5067-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we focused on Ste20 as a potential site for repression of mating factor signal transduction. We first looked at the abundance of the Ste20 protein at various cell cycle stages. For this purpose, temperature-sensitivecdc15-2 cells were arrested in late M-phase at restrictive temperature, and synchronous cell cycle progression was then initiated by lowering the temperature. Ste20 appears to be present at all cell cycle positions, but there are marked changes in the mobility of the protein when cells progress through the cell cycle (Fig."

Studies have shown that antibody cross-linking of CD59 induces a series of intracellular signaling events including the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK). To further characterize these events, antibodies and complement 8, one of the natural ligands of CD59, were used to activate CD59. Antibody-induced cross-linking of CD59 on the surface of THP-1 and U937 hematopoietic cell lines as well as exposure to complement 8 induces a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins within the cell. Consistent with an early role for the Src family PTKs in these signaling events, we found that transient activation of Hck- and CD59-mediated signaling was abrogated in the presence of the Src family PTK-selective inhibitor PP1. Although the molecular mechanism by which CD59 communicates to Hck is unknown, cellular fractionation studies indicated that both CD59 and Hck are compartmentalized in plasma membrane microdomains. We also detected tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins p120 and Shc, and the cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk. The identification of CD59-mediated signaling events may help explain why paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients, who are deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins including CD59, are susceptible to proliferative disorders.

CD59 is one of a large family of proteins that are attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 moiety attached to their C-terminal ends (1Lublin D.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD59 on various hematopoietic cells induces a cascade of intracellular signaling activities including events such as calcium influx and release of calcium from intracellular stores, generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (8Morgan B.P. van den Berg C.W.

These events are not unique to CD59, since many other GPI-anchored proteins induce a series of similar intracellular signaling events when cross-linked or upon binding of appropriate ligand. Other GPI-linked molecules expressed on hematopoietic cells include the lipopolysaccharide receptor (CD14) (15Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar,16Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J.

However, GPI-linked proteins have been shown to cluster in detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains (DIGs (19Brown D. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar)), which may be analogous to caveolae in some cell types. In addition to the enrichment of GPI-linked proteins, DIGs are enriched in other molecules including glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and the resident structural protein caveolin (20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, DIGs have been isolated, but the absence of both caveolin and morphologically defined caveolae leaves their designation equivocal in these cells. DIGs contain other molecules involved in signal transduction, including the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (21Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 3535-3541PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the Src family PTKs to co-precipitate with GPI-anchored proteins such as CD55 requires them to be palmitoylated (26Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Timson Gauen L.K. Kwong J. Shaw A.S. Lublin D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6385-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), a fatty acid modification also required for the Src family PTKs to localize to caveolae or DIGs (21Rodgers W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, since neither molecule spans the plasma membrane, their exact connection remains obscure.In this report, we show that antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD59 on the surface of the human myelomonocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 induced a rapid and robust increase in the total tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins within the cell. We have demonstrated for the first time that one of CD59's natural ligands, C8, induces the accumulation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins virtually indistinguishable from that obtained with antibody cross-linking. Concomitant with the activation of the Src family PTK Hck, there is the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including the signaling adaptor proteins, Cbl and Shc, and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Syk. Consistent with Hck playing an early proximal role in CD59 signal transduction, the Src family PTK-selective inhibitor PP1 abrogated the downstream signaling events observed. The activation of diverse signaling molecules may explain the phenotypic consequences of CD59 activation.DISCUSSIONIn order to define the mechanism by which GPI-anchored proteins mediate signal transduction in hematopoietic cells, we used the complement receptor CD59 as a model. CD59 activation was achieved by cross-linking antibodies or by stimulation with one of CD59's natural ligands, C8. CD59 is an 18–20-kDa GPI-anchored glycoprotein, which, because of its method of cell surface anchoring, does not span the plasma membrane (1Lublin D.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 141-162PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, we have shown that antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD59 on the surface of human hematopoietic cells resulted in a rapid and robust increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins. In addition, we showed for the first time that the binding of one of the natural ligands, C8, to CD59 mimics the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern obtained with antibody-mediated cross-linking, suggesting that this technique may be a relevant indicator of CD59 function. As well, we have identified several of the major proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD59 activation.Many groups have reported an association of GPI-linked proteins with Src family PTKs (25Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 26Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Timson Gauen L.K. Kwong J. Shaw A.S. Lublin D.M. Mol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20725-20728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so we initially examined the activation of one of the Src family PTKs that is abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, Hck (48Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. LeBeau M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of both isoforms of Hck (p59 and p61) transiently increased upon CD59 cross-linking, indicating activation of Hck and establishing its role in CD59-mediated signal transduction.In addition to the activation of Src family PTKs, CD59 activation also initiates a cascade of tyrosine kinase activation including the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase p72. Syk and its close relative Zap-70 have both been shown to be downstream of the activation of the Src family PTKs (43Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 49Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that p120 is a downstream target of Src family PTKs including Hck,2 and we find that c-Cbl is tyrosine-phosphorylated in conjunction with the activation of Hck upon CD59 cross-linking. Although Cbl is phosphorylated in response to a number of extracellular ligands (36Bowtell D.D. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1561-1567PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cory G.O. Lovering R.C.

Shc also functions as an adaptor protein and is also phosphorylated in response to diverse extracellular signals. By virtue of its phosphorylation-dependent interaction with Grb2, Shc is one means to activating the MAP kinase pathway (reviewed in Ref. 51Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We find that two isoforms of Shc, p46 and p52, are phosphorylated upon CD59 activation, and we have evidence that the MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2) pathway is activated. We also detected phosphorylation of a 145-kDa protein, consistent with the inositol-5-phosphatase SHIP (52Damen J.E. Lui L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), in immunoprecipitations of Shc upon CD59 activation. SHIP is phosphorylated in response to various growth factors and cytokines (52Damen J.E. Lui L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).The cellular consequences of the signaling events we observe are unknown except that CD59 activation results in the stimulation of a cascade of tyrosine kinases that serves, in part, to recruit a variety of adaptor molecules and potentially may activate at least one negative regulator. These signaling events were similar for both THP-1 cells and U937 cells. We have also observed a similar increase of cellular phosphotyrosine levels upon CD59 cross-linking in freshly isolated human neutrophils, indicating that this effect is not an artifact of the hematopoietic cell lines (data not shown).The mechanism by which GPI-linked CD59 sends messages is unknown. It is possible that CD59 needs a transmembrane-spanning co-receptor to send signals. Two reports have described the presence of an 80-kDa glycoprotein present in immunoprecipitations of the activated complement-binding proteins CD55 and CD59, a possible transmembrane link of the intracellular kinases to the extracellular receptor (13Stefanova I. Horejsi V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1587-1592PubMed Google Scholar,28Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Kwong J. Fujita T. Olszowy M.W. Shaw A.S. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3535-3541PubMed Google Scholar). The association of a transmembrane component with a GPI-linked receptor is not uncommon. Both ciliary neurotrophic factor and glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor are GPI-linked receptors complexed with transmembrane receptors to transmit signals upon binding of their specific ligands (54Stahl N.

The up-regulation of Hck in differentiated U937 cells (48Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. LeBeau M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell.

Alternatively, differentiating U937 cells may up-regulate an accessory receptor subunit that couples CD59 with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases.Controversy exists regarding the localization of GPI-linked proteins into microdomains such as caveolae and DIGs (59Mayor S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1948-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We did not cross-link CD59 to induce clustering on these cells prior to microdomain isolation; thus, our results would contradict those who suggest that GPI-linked proteins translocate to these microdomains only after antibody cross-linking. However, the use of nonionic detergents to isolate these membrane microdomains may impart some effects on localization. It is unclear what role clustering of GPI-linked proteins and their co-localization with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases may play in GPI-linked protein signaling, but, regardless of the mechanism used by GPI-linked proteins to send signals across a membrane, the signals they send appear to be unique for the different GPI-linked proteins. For example, we see phosphorylation of Cbl upon CD59 activation, yet activation of CD14 (the GPI-linked lipopolysaccharide receptor) by bacterial lipopolysaccharide does not result in Cbl phosphorylation. 3C. Howlett, A. Tigley, and S. M. Robbins, unpublished observations. In addition, PP1 inhibits phosphorylation from CD59 activation but has no effect on CD14 signaling, despite their colocalization in detergent-insoluble microdomains.Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired somatic defect of the PIG-A gene in hematopoietic stem cells that results in a defect in the expression of GPI-linked proteins (including CD59) on the cell surface, giving rise to blood cells that are more susceptible to host complement-mediated lysis (60Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 61Rosse W.F. Ware R.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, these patients are more susceptible to leukemia (62Horikawa K. Nakakuma H. Kawaguchi T. Iwamoto N. Nagakura S. Kagimoto T. Takatsuki K. Blood. 1997; 90: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is unclear why the loss of GPI-linked proteins can lead to proliferative disorders. Recently, it was shown that the mutations in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria cells confer resistance to apoptosis, thereby allowing clonal expansion of the GPI-defective cells (63Brodsky R.A. Vala M.S. Barber J.P. Medof M.E. Jones R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8756-8760Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, upon activation of CD59 we see phosphorylation of a 145-kDa protein presumed to be the inositol phosphatase SHIP, a negative regulator of cell signaling that is involved in the induction of apoptosis (53Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It will be important to investigate the role CD59 and other GPI-linked proteins have in regulating hematopoietic cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis and how this may be altered in various malignant diseases. CD59 is one of a large family of proteins that are attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 moiety attached to their C-terminal ends (1Lublin D.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 141-162PubMed Google Scholar). It is abundantly expressed on a wide variety of cells, including many cells of hematopoietic lineage (2Hatanaka M. Seya T.

Lachmann P.J. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 12: 258-275Google Scholar). The natural ligands for CD59 include the α-chain of complement 8 (C8) and the “b” domain of complement 9 (7Ninomiya H. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD59 on various hematopoietic cells induces a cascade of intracellular signaling activities including events such as calcium influx and release of calcium from intracellular stores, generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (8Morgan B.P. van den Berg C.W.

These events are not unique to CD59, since many other GPI-anchored proteins induce a series of similar intracellular signaling events when cross-linked or upon binding of appropriate ligand. Other GPI-linked molecules expressed on hematopoietic cells include the lipopolysaccharide receptor (CD14) (15Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar,16Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and THY-1, a regulatory molecule in T-cell activation (17Malek T.R. Fleming T.J. Codias E.K. Semin.

Since GPI-anchored proteins adhere to cells through their acyl chains and do not span the membrane, the mechanism by which this family of proteins transduce their signal into the cell remains unknown. However, GPI-linked proteins have been shown to cluster in detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains (DIGs (19Brown D. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar)), which may be analogous to caveolae in some cell types. In addition to the enrichment of GPI-linked proteins, DIGs are enriched in other molecules including glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and the resident structural protein caveolin (20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, DIGs have been isolated, but the absence of both caveolin and morphologically defined caveolae leaves their designation equivocal in these cells. DIGs contain other molecules involved in signal transduction, including the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (21Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 22Draberova L. Draber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Src family PTKs may be involved in transmission of the GPI-linked signals, since they have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with various GPI-anchored molecules (23Parolini I. Sargiacomo M.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 3535-3541PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the Src family PTKs to co-precipitate with GPI-anchored proteins such as CD55 requires them to be palmitoylated (26Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Timson Gauen L.K. Kwong J. Shaw A.S. Lublin D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6385-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), a fatty acid modification also required for the Src family PTKs to localize to caveolae or DIGs (21Rodgers W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, since neither molecule spans the plasma membrane, their exact connection remains obscure. In this report, we show that antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD59 on the surface of the human myelomonocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 induced a rapid and robust increase in the total tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins within the cell. We have demonstrated for the first time that one of CD59's natural ligands, C8, induces the accumulation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins virtually indistinguishable from that obtained with antibody cross-linking. Concomitant with the activation of the Src family PTK Hck, there is the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including the signaling adaptor proteins, Cbl and Shc, and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Syk.

To determine cell-specific human renin gene control elements, the transcriptional activity of promoter regions up to position −8876 was studied in renin-expressing cells. A positive regulatory region conferring ∼57-fold higher transcriptional activity to the human renin gene promoter in chorionic cells was identified between nucleotides −5777 and −5552. It had the orientation-independent activity typical of classical enhancers. It also conferred ∼59-fold higher transcriptional levels from the heterologous simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter in chorionic cells and ∼6-fold higher transcriptional levels in Calu-6 and As4.1 cells, whereas no effect was measured in non-renin-expressing cells. DNase I footprinting showed that this enhancer contains three binding sites for chorionic cell nuclear extracts. Functional analysis suggested that the activity of the enhancer is regulated by differential mechanisms in the three renin-expressing cells involving a complex arrangement of AP-1 motifs binding cell-specific members of the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Thus, our results demonstrate that this enhancer plays a key role in the expression of the human renin gene in the chorion and may also be involved in its regulated expression in other tissues.

Renin, a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system regulates blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. The juxtaglomerular (JG)1 cells of the kidney are the principal site of renin synthesis, but renin is also synthesized in a variety of non-renal tissues. Chorionic tissue is one of the main extrarenal sites at which a local renin synthesis has been demonstrated at the protein (1Skinner S.L. Lumbers E.R. Symonds E.M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1968; 101: 529-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Poisner A.M. Wood G.W. Poisner R. Inagami T. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the gene levels (3Soubrier F. Panthier J.-J. Corvol P. Rougeon F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7181-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, cultured chorionic cells (4Pinet F. Corvol M.T. Bourguignon J. Corvol P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have been a model of choice for studying the regulation of the human renin gene transcription. Efforts to dissect human renin gene transcriptional regulation have focused mainly on the proximal promoter. Duncan et al. (5Duncan K.G. Haidar M.A. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) demonstrated by transient transfections in chorionic cells that the first 584 bp of the human renin 5′-flanking region are able to direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression. We then studied two elements, the cyclic AMP responsive element (−229 to −220) and a sequence similar to that of homeodomain-containing transcription factor binding site, located from nucleotides −79 to −69, which are responsible for basal renin gene promoter activity in chorionic cells (6Borensztein P. Germain S. Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Germain S. Konoshita T. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have also shown that renal and chorionic tissues contain similar nuclear binding proteins recognizing the same regions in the human renin proximal promoter (8Konoshita T. Germain S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1515-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More distal human renin promoter regions up to nucleotide −2824 have been studied but no cis-acting element functionally important for promoter activity was identified (7Germain S. Konoshita T. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These distal regions were less efficient at directing reporter gene expression, suggesting that there may be a discrete silencer between nucleotides −2824 and −892. Transgenic animal studies have also failed to produce a coherent description of the human renin gene control elements in the coding, 3-kb 5′-flanking region and 1.2-kb 3′-flanking region (9Fukamizu A.

Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Catanzaro D.F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that a 220-bp region located 12 kb upstream from the transcription start site of the human renin gene gave up to 47-fold higher transcription rates when associated with the proximal promoter and used to transfect mouse As4.1 cells. Differential regulation of the proximal promoter has been reported in human renin-producing chorionic cells (7Germain S. Konoshita T. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Calu-6 cells (13Lang J.A. Yang G. Kern J.A. Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Germain S. Philippe J. Fuchs S. Lengronne A. Corvol P. Pinet F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the differential regulation of transcription may be involved in cell-specific expression of the human renin gene in the chorion. We isolated a genomic clone containing the human renin gene and its surrounding sequences. The functional activity of the promoter until position −8876 was determined by transient transfections of human chorionic cells, Calu-6 cells, and mouse As4.1 cells. An enhancer element was discovered far upstream from the transcription start site (−5777 to −5552). It conferred an ∼59-fold activation of transcription in chorionic cells and gave smaller but significant increases in Calu-6 cells (∼6-fold) and As4.1 cells (∼6.5-fold). When used with a heterologous promoter, enhancer transcriptional activity was selectively increased in renin-producing cells. DNase I footprinting experiments detected at least three specific DNA-protein interactions with chorionic cell nuclear extracts, the functional activity of which was assayed in the three cell types either by reconstitution experiments with oligonucleotides encoding each protected sequence or by site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report of a human renin gene enhancer with a chorionic cell-marked effect, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of the transcription of the renin gene in the chorion and that it may be responsible for the expression of the renin gene in different tissues. The pGL3-892 and pGL3-2824 plasmids have been described elsewhere (14Germain S. Philippe J. Fuchs S. Lengronne A. Corvol P. Pinet F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human renin gene 5′-flanking regions were isolated from a pWE15 cosmid (Stratagene) containing the human renin gene and were inserted into pGL3-892. The fragment (−5777 to −892) was inserted in the sense orientation into the HindIII site of pGL3-892, creating pGL3-5777. Plasmids pGL3-4713 and pGL3-3463 were created by digesting pGL3-5777 with BglII and XmnI, respectively. The (−5777 to −4713) fragment was excised from pGL3-5777 by BglII digestion and was inserted in the sense or antisense orientation into pGL3-892, creating pGL3-892+(−5777 to −4713) sense and antisense. pGL3-892+(−5339 to −4955) was created by inserting the DraI/SmaI fragment (−5339 to −4955) into pGL3-892. pGL3-892+(−5552 to −5339) was created by inserting theXmnI/DraI fragment (−5552 to −5339) into pGL3-892. Then, pGL3-892+(−5777 to −5552) was constructed by insertion of the 1340 bp fragment obtained byXmnI digestion of pGL3-5777 into pGL3-892 digested by XmnI/SmaI. Plasmids pGL3-892+(−8876 to 7476) and pGL3-892+(−7476 to −5777) were created by isolatingHindIII fragments from the pWE15 cosmid and ligating them in the native orientation into the HindIII site of pGL3-892. Human renin gene 5′-flanking regions were inserted into the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) that contains the SV40 promoter upstream from the luciferase gene. The pGL3-promoter+(−5777 to −5552) plasmid, also named pGL3-promoter-enhancer was constructed by inserting the 1340-bp fragment obtained as described above upstream from the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector digested byXmnI/SmaI. Each construct was sequenced and verified to be correct. DNase I protected regions were inserted upstream from the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector. The sequence of the renin oligonucleotide corresponding to footprint A (−5766 to −5743) was 5′-CTCGAGATCTCCTAAAAGATATTACCCCTGGGGG-3′, that corresponding to footprint B (−5747 to −5719) was 5′-CTCGAGATCTGGGGGTCAGAGGCAAAATGGAGTCAGTCA-3′, that to footprint AB (−5766 to −5719) was 5′-CTCGAGATCTCCTAAAAGATATTACCCCTGGGGGTCAGAGGCAAAATGGAGTCAGTCA-3′, that to footprint C (−5656 to −5615) was 5′-CTCGAGATCTGGATTGGGGAAAATGAGACATCATTACTCACCTGGCTAC-3′, and that to footprint ABC was CTCGAGATCTCCTAAAAGATATTACCCCTGGGGGTCAGAGGCAAAATGGAGTCAGTCATTGGGGAAAATGAGACATCATTACTCACCTGGCTAC. These oligonucleotides were flanked by a XhoI and aBglII site that facilitated the oriented insertion of the fragments upstream from the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector digested by BglII and XhoI, creating plasmids pGL3-promoter+A, pGL3-promoter+B, pGL3-promoter+AB and pGL3-promoter+C, and pGL3-promoter+ABC. Each construct was verified by sequencing. Primary cultures of chorionic cells (4Pinet F. Corvol M.T. Bourguignon J. Corvol P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Calu-6 cells, derived from a pulmonary carcinoma (ATCC HTB-56) (14Germain S. Philippe J. Fuchs S. Lengronne A. Corvol P. Pinet F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were cultured as described previously. As4.1 cells (ATCC CRL2193), a mouse renin-expressing cell line obtained from a kidney tumor of a transgenic mouse harboring a mouseren-2 5′-flanking region/SV40 antigene, were cultured as described by Sigmund et al. (15Sigmund C.D. Okuyama K. Ingelfinger J. Jones C.A. Mullins J.J. Kane C. Kim U. Wu C.Z. Kenny L. Rustum Y. Dzau V. Gross K.W. J. Biol.

Chorionic, Calu-6, As4.1, and COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were plated in 12-well plates. For chorionic cells, 3.4 μl of FuGENETM6 plus 1.5 μg of renin reporter construct and 200 ng of pCH110 (16Norton P.A. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 281-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) were used. For Calu-6 and COS-7 cells, 200 ng of renin reporter construct and 30 ng of pCH110 were used with 0.92 or 0.46 μl of FuGENETM6, respectively. For As4.1 cells, we used 4.6 μl of FuGENETM6 plus 2 μg of renin reporter construct and 300 ng of pCH110. The cells were incubated overnight with DNA, and the medium was then replaced by fresh medium for 24 h. Transfected cells were washed three times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by adding 200 μl of reporter gene assay lysis buffer (Boehringer Mannheim). A 50-μl aliquot to which 50 μl of luciferase reporter buffer (Promega) was added in a microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Top Count, Packard) to measure luciferase activity. Calu-6 cells lysate was incubated 1 h at 50 °C to destroy high endogenous β-galactosidase activity, and each cell type β-galactosidase activity was estimated by measuring the luminescence of a 50-μl aliquot using β-galactosidase reporter gene assay (Boehringer Mannheim). All results are given as the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments ± S.E. Human chorionic cell and COS-7 cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (17Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The radioactive (−5777 to −5552) fragment used for DNase I footprinting of the renin gene promoter was obtained by PCR amplification using the following primers: 5′-TGCAGGTGCCAGAACATTTCTC-3′ and 5′-AATCCCCGCCCTGATACCAACG-3′ hybridizing to plasmid pGL3-promoter+(−5777 to −5552). These primers were labeled with [32γP]dATP by T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase before PCR amplification. DNase I footprint analysis was performed as described previously (6Borensztein P. Germain S. Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Circ.

The renin gene double-stranded oligonucleotides used for gel shift assays were as described in the plasmid constructs section. The AP-1 and NF-E2 oligonucleotides were as described by Andrews et al. (18Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H.

These double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32γP]dATP by T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase. Each binding reaction was performed with 7 μg of human chorionic cell nuclear extracts incubated with 25,000 cpm end-labeled oligonucleotides for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 μl of buffer containing 6 mmMgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 60 mmKCl, 30 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 5% Ficoll 400, 1 mmDTT, 175 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. When performing electromobility supershift assays, antisera directed against c-Jun, c-Fos, JunB, fra-2, kindly provided by Dr. Lallemand (CNRS, URA 1644, France), MafG/K, and p45NFE-2, kindly provided by Dr. Deveaux (INSERM U 91) were added to the reaction mixture and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before electrophoresis. The mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in nondenaturing conditions in 5% polyacrylamide gels in 22 mm Tris borate/0.5 mm EDTA. For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were used at a 50- to 200-fold molar excess. To destroy the NF-E2 and AP-1 binding sites in footprint C, two PCR reactions, one using sense and GL2 primer (Promega) and the other using reverse and RV3 primer (Promega) were performed (mutations are indicated in italics and underlined). These two PCR products were mixed and subjected to a new PCR reaction with GL2 and RV3. The overlap containing the mutated sites allowed efficient recombinant PCR of the whole fragment which was inserted into pGL3-promoter vector and fully sequenced. The following oligonucleotides were used: NF-E2mut sense, GAAAATGAGAtgTCATTACT; NF-E2mut reverse, AGTAATGAcaTCTCATTTTCC; C/AP-1mut sense, TCATTACTtgCCTGGCTACTTC; and C/AP-1mut reverse, AAGTAGCCAGGcaAGTAATGA. Double mutants were obtained by the same strategy. To destroy the AP-1 sequence of the B footprint, B/AP-1mut reverse (GGAGGCTTAGCATGACcaACTCCATTTTG) and RV3 were used to perform a PCR using pGL3-promoter-enhancer. The PCR product was digested byBlpI and SacI and inserted into pGL3-promoter vector. To create AB(892)-pGL3-promoter-enhancer, a PCR reaction usingBlpI reverse primer (AGTGGAGGGAGGCTTAGCATG) and RV3 was performed using pGL3-892. PCR product was digested by BlpI and SacI and ligated into pGL3-promoter-enhancer. The remaining digested vector was blunt-ended and self-ligated to create ΔAB-pGL3-promoter-enhancer. Transcriptional activity of the human renin gene distal promoter was performed by transient transfections of various regions, up to position −8876, inserted upstream from a promoterless luciferase gene construct in human renin-expressing chorionic cells. The activity measured was compared with that in human Calu-6 cells and in mouse As4.1 cells (Fig. 1). When the renin gene 5′-flanking region was lengthened from −892 to −4713, promoter activity, expressed as a percentage of pGL3-892 activity, decreased in human cells whereas it increased progressively in mouse As4.1 cells. When the promoter region was lengthened from −4713 to −5777, the resulting plasmid pGL3-5777 had a very high level of transcriptional activity in chorionic cells (4412 ± 489)versus (77 ± 6) for pGL3-4713. These results suggest that there is an enhancer between −5777 bp and −4713 bp that confers ∼57-fold higher transcription rates in human chorionic cells. We also studied more distal fragments to −8876 and found that the (−7476 to −5777) region containedcis-acting regions that were functional only in As4.1 cells. The (−8876 to −7476) region had no transcriptional activity in any cell type. The highest level of transcription of the pGL3+(−7476 to −5777) construct in As4.1 cells was consistent and reproducible but was not investigated further because no such stimulation was observed in human cells. To determine more precisely the location of the (−5777 to −4713) enhancer, this fragment was inserted upstream of the first 892 bp of the human renin gene promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene, creating pGL3-892+(−5777 to −4713) plasmid. The (−5777 to −4713) fragment conferred an ∼39-fold higher activity to the pGL3-892 plasmid in chorionic cells compared with an ∼6-fold higher activity in Calu-6 cells and ∼3-fold higher activity in As4.1 cells. Enhancer activity was observed in each cell type when the (−5777 to −4713) fragment was inserted in the sense or antisense orientation. Its activity was sometimes higher in the antisense than in the native orientation, demonstrating the orientation-independent classical enhancer activity of this fragment. Serial deletion mutant fragment of this 1-kb region were produced, and it was found that the more distal 225-bp region of the (−5777 to −5552) fragment had full enhancer activity with 56-fold higher transcriptional activity in chorionic cells compared with a 5-fold and an 8-fold higher transcriptional activity in Calu-6 cells and As4.1 cells, respectively (Fig. 1). To test whether the activity of the human renin enhancer was confined to renin-expressing cells, the 225-bp enhancer fragment activity was studied using the heterologous SV40 promoter to drive luciferase gene expression. When it was cloned upstream from the SV40 promoter (Table I), its effect was similar to that observed with the native promoter with a 59-fold increase in reporter gene activity in chorionic cells, 6-fold in Calu-6 cells, and 6.5-fold in As4.1 cells. Therefore, the activity of the enhancer was cell-specific and promoter-independent. There was no difference in the activity of the pGL3-promoter and pGL3-promoter+(−5777 to −5552) reporter plasmids in COS-7 cells (Table I), suggesting that the effect of the enhancer on the transcription of the human renin gene may be specific to renin-expressing cells.Table ICell specificity of the human renin gene enhancerRenin promoter/luciferase constructsPercentage of pGL3-promoter relative luciferase activityChorionic cellsCalu-6 cellsAs4.1 cellsCOS-7 cellspGL3-promoter vector100 ± 11100 ± 5100 ± 2100 ± 2pGL3-promoter-enhancer5920 ± 637604 ± 133656 ± 26108 ± 7pGL3-promoter vector+A178 ± 49153 ± 11115 ± 1090 ± 3pGL3-promoter vector+B240 ± 8160 ± 2097 ± 597 ± 2pGL3-promoter vector+C289 ± 10250 ± 55150 ± 1078 ± 7pGL3-promoter vector+AB362 ± 82490 ± 80180 ± 12115 ± 11pGL3-promoter vector+ABC315 ± 31234 ± 8344 ± 9110 ± 7Reporter plasmids were transfected into chorionic cells, Calu-6 cells, As4.1 cells that produce renin, and COS-7 cells that do not produce renin.

The results are the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate wells. To further determine the sequences involved in enhancer activity, an in vitro DNase I footprinting assay was performed using chorionic cell nuclear extracts. Three regions were protected by nuclear proteins (−5766 to −5745), (−5743 to −5719), and (−5651 to −5619), named A, B, and C, respectively (Fig. 2, panel I). These three footprints were specific to chorionic cells because DNase I footprinting experiments performed with COS-7 cell nuclear extracts showed only one footprint in the B region, slightly shorter than B and named B′ (Fig. 2, panel III). To detect consensus matches in protected nucleotide sequences, the enhancer sequence was subjected to a screen of consensus matches against a library of transcription factor binding sites (19Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). This analysis allowed us to identify a putative binding site for NF-E2 (18Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H.

To analyze the specificity of the DNA-protein interactions, we performed gel shift assays with oligonucleotides spanning the three protected sequences and chorionic cell nuclear extracts. No specific interactions were detected with an oligonucleotide corresponding to footprint A (data not shown). A weak interaction was detected with the oligonucleotide containing the footprint B (−5747 to −5719), which was, however, specific because unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide competed for binding (Fig. 3). This interaction was not competed by a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides corresponding to footprints A (−5766 to −5743) or C (−5656 to −5615) but was competed by a 50- to 100-fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide containing footprint AB (−5766 to −5719). It was not competed by a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides containing consensus recognition sites for AP-1 or NF-E2. A specific interaction was observed with an oligonucleotide corresponding to footprint C containing both NF-E2 and AP-1 consensus binding sites (Fig. 4). It was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotide containing footprint C but not by a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides corresponding to footprints A, B, or AB. In addition, both AP-1 and NF-E2 oligonucleotides competed for binding to the footprint C sequence.Figure 4Gel mobility shift analysis with human chorionic cell nuclear extracts and the human renin gene promoter (−5656 to −5615). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the 5′-CTCGAGATCTGGATTGGGGAAAATGAGACATCATTACTCACCTGGCTAC-3′ region of the human renin promoter corresponding to footprint C (−5656 to −5615) was used as a probe. Competition experiments were performed with a 50- to 200-fold molar excess of homologous DNA or with a 100-fold molar excess of the (−5747 to −5719) oligonucleotide (footprint B), the (−5766 to −5743) oligonucleotide (footprint A), the (−5766 to −5719) oligonucleotide (footprint AB), or the AP-1 and NF-E2 binding site oligonucleotides. Specific DNA· protein complexes are indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine further the interactions at this motif, gel shift assays were performed with labeled oligonucleotides corresponding tobona fide NF-E2 and AP-1 binding sites. Specific interactions also occurred because bindings were competed specifically by molar excesses of both unlabeled AP-1 and NF-E2 oligonucleotides and by the footprint C sequence (Fig. 5). To discriminate between an AP-1 and/or NF-E2 binding activity to the NF-E2 motif, gel shift experiments were conducted with HumanErythroid Leukemia (HEL) cell nuclear extracts and labeled NF-E2 probe, showing two shifted complexes as described by Deveaux et al. (22Deveaux S. Cohen-Kaminsky S. Shivdasani R.A. Andrews N.C. Filipe A. Kuzniak I. Orkin S.H. Romeo P.H. Mignotte V. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Only the upper AP-1 complex was competed by the footprint C sequence, whereas the lower NF-E2 complex was not competed (data not shown), demonstrating that the interaction with the NF-E2 binding site of the footprint C motif is related to AP-1. Supershift experiments were performed to characterize further the proteins present in chorionic cell nuclear extracts that bind to motif C. Experiments conducted with antisera directed against c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, fra-2, MafG/K (23Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and p45NF-E2 (18Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) showed no supershift (data not shown). Positive controls were performed with the AP-1 probe and chorionic cell nuclear extracts for antisera directed against c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and fra-2 and with HEL cell nuclear extracts binding to the NF-E2 probe for antisera directed against MafG/K and p45NF-E2 (data not shown). These data suggest that tissue-specific transcription factors expressed in the chorion, but different from typical members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, are involved in regulating the activity of the enhancer. We addressed the relative importance of each binding site by reconstitution experiments where one copy of each footprint motif was inserted upstream from the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector. These constructs were transiently transfected into the three renin-expressing cell types and COS-7 cells. None of these fragments had any effect on SV40 promoter activity in COS-7 cells (Table I). In chorionic cells, the activity of pGL3-promoter+A, pGL3-promoter+B, pGL3-promoter+C, pGL3-promoter+AB, and pGL3-promoter+ABC constructs were respectively 2-, 2.5-, 3-, 4-, and 3-fold greater than that of pGL3-promoter vector. As described in Table I, none of the footprint motifs alone or in combination was responsible for the enhancer activity in any of the cell types studied (chorionic cells, Calu-6 cells, and As4.1 cells). Therefore, to study each footprint motif in its native context, point mutations were performed in each of the identified regions,i.e. the AP-1 motif in the B region (B/AP-1mut), the AP-1 motif in the C region (C/AP-1mut), and the AP-1 part of the NF-E2 motif in the C region (NF-E2mut) in pGL3-promoter enhancer. In chorionic cells, mutations of the C/AP-1 motif or the NF-E2 motif in footprint C are responsible for the loss of 85 and 82% of the enhancer activity (Fig. 6). When both mutations were performed in the same fragment (C/AP-1mut + NF-E2mut), enhancer activity was abolished. In addition, mutation in the AP-1 motif of the B region had not effect alone but enhanced the effects of mutations in the C region. In renin-producing Calu-6 and As4.1 cells, a roughly similar pattern could be observed except that the smaller enhancer activity was never abolished in any single or double mutants. As expected, any of the mutations had no effect on pGL3-promoter-vector activity in COS-7 cells (data not shown). To detect putative secondary structures and sequence repeats, the enhancer region was further analyzed. An optimal alignment between the (−5777 to −5552) region encompassing the footprint sites of the enhancer and the (−892 to −717) region showed that footprints A and B are very well conserved in the proximal promoter with 91 and 100% identity, respectively. In contrast, the footprint C sequence is only 42.4% conserved with the (−763 to −731) region (Fig. 7). To determine whether these conserved sequences are functionally interchangeable, the AB(892) region was inserted instead of the AB(5777) within the enhancer sequence. A 2-fold loss of activity was observed in chorionic cells, which is comparable with the effect of deleting the AB sequence. In other renin-expressing cell types, either the replacement or the deletion of the AB sequence had no effect. Transgenic animal studies (9Fukamizu A. Seo M.S. Hatae T. Yokoyama M. Nomura T.

Functional analysis of the human renin gene proximal promoter identified positive and negative regulatory elements in chorionic cells (6Borensztein P. Germain S. Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Calu-6 cells (14Germain S. Philippe J. Fuchs S. Lengronne A. Corvol P. Pinet F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and a transcriptional silencer specific to renin-producing cells in the first intron (14Germain S. Philippe J. Fuchs S.

Physiol. 1996; 271: F94-F100PubMed Google Scholar). From these studies, it has been suggested that there may be cis-acting regions conferring differential and specific renal and extra-renal human renin gene expression located far upstream from the transcription start site, in the distal promoter. Recently, Yan et al. (12Yan Y. Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Catanzaro D.F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) identified an enhancer in the 5′-flanking region of the human gene that is very similar to that of the enhancer-mediating mouse ren-1c gene expression in As4.1 cells (25Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to identify the regulatory elements in the distal regions of the human renin gene promoter responsible for renin expression in the chorion. A 225-bp enhancer located between bases −5777 and −5552 of the human renin gene was shown to activate transcription although to different degrees in the three renin-expressing cell models described until now. The degree of activation mediated by the enhancer was 57-fold stimulation in chorionic cells and was weaker in Calu-6 cells (∼5-fold) and As4.1 cells (∼8-fold). In human cells, regulatory elements were strictly restricted to this 225-bp fragment because no cis-acting regions were detected either downstream, between bases −5552 and −2824, or upstream to bases −8876. Species differences may be responsible for the differences in the activity of the (−7476 to −5777) fragment, which activated transcription in mouse As4.1 cells but not in human cells. The enhancer activity of the 225-bp fragment was promoter-independent because it was roughly similar either with the SV40 promoter or the proximal renin promoter. The (−5777 to −5552) region acted typically as a classical enhancer in each renin-expressing cell type in both sense and antisense orientations. DNase I footprinting assays showed that three regions within the 225-bp fragment were protected by chorionic cell nuclear extracts, whereas only one is protected by non-renin-producing COS-7 cell nuclear extracts. A functional analysis of each footprint motif showed that the overall level of stimulation can be accounted for by the addition of the functional effects of each of the protected regions in Calu-6 and As4.1 cells but cannot account for the final 59-fold stimulation of the transcription in chorionic cells. There were no consensus binding sites for known transcription factors in footprint A, but footprints B and C contained a motif similar to the AP-1 binding site that interacts with bZIP factors of the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors (20Bos T.J. Bohmann D. Tsuchie H. Tjian R. Vogt P.K. Cell. 1988; 52: 705-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,21Angel P. Allegretto E. Okino S. Hattori K. Boyle W. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Specific interactions with the footprint B motif were only competed by homologous DNA but not by oligonucleotides spanning consensus AP-1 binding sites, showing that the AP-1 consensus binding site of the footprint B motif is not involved. In addition to its characterized AP-1 binding site, footprint C also contains a consensus binding site for NF-E2, a member of the AP-1 superfamily (18Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Transcription factor NF-E2 is a heterodimeric protein comprising the erythroid- and megakaryocytic-restricted p45 NF-E2 and the small bZIP p18 (26Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), also known as MafK present in most, if not all tissues (27Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) or the recently described MafG (23Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assays with anti-p45 NF-E2 and anti-MafG/K antisera did not show, either by supershift or binding inhibition, any related binding activity to the footprint C motif. Gel shift assays with antisera directed against c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and fra-2 did not block or supershift the motif C·chorionic cell nuclear extracts complex. These results strongly suggest that chorionic nucleoproteins binding to the footprint C motif are related but distinct from well characterized AP-1 family members. The strong enhancer activity observed in chorionic cells seems to be conferred by footprint C since point mutations in the NF-E2 or thebona fide AP-1 binding site strongly reduced enhancer activity. In addition, enhancer activity was disrupted by both mutations in chorionic cells. Nevertheless, reconstitution experiments showed that footprint C alone cannot confer the enhancer activity. Contacts between proteins bound at nonadjacent sites on a short DNA fragment may be facilitated by distortion of the DNA structure that enhance the recruitment of proteins to their DNA targets (28Travers A.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The transcription factors binding to this region in chorionic cells may affect the architecture assembly and function of the regulatory nucleoprotein complex. Alternatively, this human renin enhancer activity may result from the cooperative binding of transcription factors to their respective cognate sites. A chorionic-specific AP-1-related bZip transcription factor or a chorionic cell-restricted intermediary factor recruited by the binding of transcription factors may be responsible for the 59-fold enhancer activity in renin-producing chorionic cells. In summary, this study presents a more complete picture than was previously available of the overall spatial arrangement of regulatory sequences responsible for the human renin gene expression. Moreover, although different levels of enhancer activity were observed in all three renin-producing cell models, interactions with tissue-specifictrans-acting factors binding to this enhancer may be responsible for the differential transcriptional regulation of the human renin gene in extra-renal and renal tissue. This is the first case that such a sequence has been shown to be efficient and active in chorionic renin-producing cells. Isolation of the transcription factors involved in the regulation of this enhancer should provide important new insights into the molecular events responsible for the differential levels of renin gene expression in the chorion and other tissues.

Chem. 271, 8818–8823), a domain swapping approach demonstrated that a region of amino acids found in human α1,3/4-fucosyltransferase III (FucT III) conferred a significant increase in α1,4-FucT acceptor substrate specificity into α1,3-fucosyltransferase V (FucT V), which, under the same assay conditions, has extremely low α1,4-FucT acceptor substrate specificity. In the current study, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to identify which of the eight amino acids, associated with α1,4-FucT acceptor substrate specificity, is/are responsible for conferring this new property. The results demonstrate that increased α1,4-FucT activity with both disaccharide and glycolipid acceptors can be conferred on FucT V by modifying as few as two (Asn86 to His and Thr87 to Ile) of the eight amino acids originally swapped from FucT III into the FucT V sequence. Neither single amino acid mutant had increased α1,4-FucT activity relative to that of FucT V. Kinetic analyses of FucT V mutants demonstrated a reduced K m for Galβ1,3GlcNAc (type 1) acceptor substrates compared with native FucT V. However, this was about 20-fold higher than that found for native FucT III, suggesting that other amino acids in FucT III must contribute to its overall binding site for type 1 substrates. These results demonstrate that amino acid residues near the amino terminus of the catalytic domain of FucT III contribute to its acceptor substrate specificity.

Interestingly, the acceptor substrate specificity of different forms of the human FucTs with highly homologous amino acid sequences can differ significantly (1de Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M.M.

For example, FucT III has a very high level of activity with a type 1 disaccharide acceptor (Galβ1,3GlcNAc), whereas FucT VI appears to be a true α1,3-FucT and utilizes exclusively type 2 acceptors (1de Vries T.

It is important to point out that different investigators have obtained somewhat different results in terms of the acceptor substrate specificity of FT III and that this enzyme appears to utilize type 2 acceptors when assayed in vitro with high concentrations of simple acceptors and that antibody staining of cells transfected with full-length FT III bind antibodies that recognize type 2 substrates (e.g. anti-Lex) (e.g. see Ref. 10Kukowska-Latallo J.F.

Nevertheless, FucTs do have significantly different acceptor substrate specificities when assayed in vitro with disaccharide acceptors despite the fact that they share >90% amino acid sequence homology (10Kukowska-Latallo J.F.

For example, mammalian cells transfected with FucT V can produce cell surface antigens recognized by anti-VIM 2 and anti-difucosyl-sLex, whereas cells transfected with FucT VI express antigens recognized by anti-difucosyl-sLex but not anti-VIM 2 (11Weston B.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that truncated forms of FucT III and FucT V, containing ∼300 amino acids and differing at less than 25 positions, have dramatically different acceptor substrate specificities when assayed with simple disaccharide substrates (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the swapping of an NH2-terminal segment of FucT III, containing eight amino acids unique to FucT III, for the corresponding area of the FucT V amino acid sequence produced a protein (see Fig. 1) that could efficiently transfer fucose to both type 1 and type 2 disaccharides (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have produced a series of FucT V mutants that contain one or more of the eight FucT III amino acid substitutions and characterized them for acceptor substrate specificity. The results demonstrate that a FucT V mutant containing two amino acids characteristic of the FucT III amino acid sequence has significantly higher levels of α1,4-FucT activity compared with FucT V. All of these studies were completed with truncated, soluble forms of the enzymes that are fused to the IgG-binding domain of protein A. This allowed us to utilize highly purified forms of the enzymes for our kinetic analyses. In a previous study (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the attachment of the fusion partner does not significantly alter the acceptor substrate specificity of the enzymes. Rabbit IgG-agarose, anti-goat IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, goat IgG, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and nitro blue tetrazolium were obtained from Sigma. Fetal calf serum was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. (Logan, Utah). Trans-blot transfer medium (0.45 μm), kaleidoscope prestained standards, 12% Tris/glycine gels, and Dowex AG 1-X2 resin (200–400-mesh Cl− form) were obtained from Bio-Rad. GDP-fucose was kindly provided by Dr. Ole Hindsgaul (Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta) or purchased from Calbiochem. GDP-[3H]fucose (7.57 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Mutant forms of FucT V were prepared as described previously (17Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar), using a plasmid containing the coding region corresponding to amino acids 76–374 of FucT V as the template. A series of synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to create six FucT V mutant constructs. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were used in PCR reactions to replace specific amino acid(s) of FucT V with the corresponding amino acid(s) in the FucT III amino acid sequence. The primers used were as follows: for the mutant containing Asn86 → His, Thr87 → Ile, and Pro92 → Ser substitutions, 5′-GGAATTCGCTACTGATCCTGCTGTGGACGTGGCCTTTTCACATACCCGTGGCTCTGTCTAGATGCTCAGA-3′ and 5′-CATGATATCCCAGTGGTGCACGAT-3′; for the mutant containing Asn86 → His and Thr87 → Ile substitutions, 5′-GGAATTCGCTACTGATCCTGCTGTGGACGTGGCCTTTTCACA TACCCGTGGCTCTGTCTAGA-3′ and 5′-CATGATATCCCAGTGGTGCACGAT-3′; for the mutant containing Asn86 → His substitutions, 5′-GGAATTCGCTATTAATCCTGCTGTGGACGTGGCCTTTTCACA CACCC-3′ and 5′-CATGATATCCCAGTGGTGCACGAT/3′; for the mutant containing Thr87 → Ile substitutions, 5′-GGAATTCGCTATTAATCCTGCTGTGGACGTGGCCTTTTAACATACCC-3′and 5′-CATGATATCCCAGTGGTGCACGAT-3′; for the mutant containing Ala101 → Thr, Asn105 → His, Ser110 → Arg, Ser111 → Lys, and Ala118 → Thr substitutions (mutant A101T,N105H,S110R,S111K,A118T), 5′-TCCCCGCGGTGCTCAGAGATGGTGCCCGGTACCGCCGAGTGCCACATCACTGCCGACCGCAAGGTGTACC-3′ and 5′-CATGATATCCCAGTGGTGCACGATGACCGT-3′; and for the mutant containing Ser110 → Arg, Ser111 → Lys, and Ala118 → Thr substitutions, 5′-GGAATTCGCTACTGATCCTGCTGTGGACGT-3′ and 5′-CATGATATCCCAGTGGTGCACGATGACCGTGTCTGCCTGTGGGTACACCTTGCGGTCCGCGGTGATGTGG-3′. The PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the vector, pPROTA (1de Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M.M. Swiedler S.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8712-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and sequences of the inserts were confirmed by sequencing (San Francisco State University Sequencing Facility) both strands of the constructs (results not shown). COS-7 cells were used for enzyme expression. The recombinant enzymes were expressed as soluble proteins with an NH2-terminal protein A, IgG binding domain. The fusion proteins were purified from the cell culture medium by IgG-agarose column chromatography. The recombinant FucTs were eluted from the IgG-Agarose resin as follows. IgG-agarose beads were briefly suspended in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.3, and the resulting supernatant was immediately removed and placed in a tube containing neutralizing buffer (1 m bis-Tris-propane, pH 8.0, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The enzyme was either used immediately or stored at 4 °C and used within 7–10 days. Enzymes retained full activity during storage under these conditions. Recombinant FucTs were detected and quantified via Western blot analysis. Recombinant FucTs were detected and quantified via Western blot analysis (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 12% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with an IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and the blot was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Quantitative analysis of the resulting bands was done by scanning the blot with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet II C scanner and analyzing the resulting image with the NIH Image 1.41 program (National Institutes of Health public domain program). Quantification of the amount of FucT was accomplished by comparing the band intensities of samples to those obtained for known quantities of IgG. The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, 6.25 mm MnCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 3.0 nmol of GDP-fucose, 0.01 μCi of GDP-[3H]fucose, varying amounts of acceptor, and 5 μl of soluble enzyme. Reactions were terminated by adding 400 μl of water, and the radioactive substrate and product were separated by Dowex anion exchange chromatography and quantified as described previously (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants given here were determined with the computer program KinetAssyst. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by an iterative fitting routine. Assays with glycolipid acceptors were done as previously reported (18Stroud M.R. Holmes E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Swapping an NH2-terminal segment of the FucT III catalytic domain, containing eight amino acids unique to FucT III, for the corresponding area of the FucT V amino acid sequence produces a protein (see Fig. 1) that can efficiently transfer fucose to both type 1 and type 2 disaccharides (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Domain Swap). To determine which of the amino acids in this segment contributed the new acceptor substrate specificity, a series of FucT V mutants were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”). Initially, four FucT V mutants were prepared containing amino acids at the amino (HIS substituted for NTP and HI for NT) or the carboxyl (THRKT substituted for ANSSA and RKT for SSA) terminus of the sequence of the original domain swap. After an initial characterization of these mutants, two single amino acid mutants (His substituted for Asn and Ile for Thr) were prepared and analyzed. Time course analyses with type 1 and 2 disaccharide acceptors were conducted with each mutant. All of the mutants catalyzed transfer of fucose to both acceptor substrates but at vastly different rates (see Fig. 2 and Table I). Under the assay conditions used, FucT III has no detectable activity with a type 2 disaccharide, whereas FucT V has very low activity with a type 1 compared with a type 2 acceptor substrate (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the domain swap construct has substantial activity with both type 1 and 2 disaccharides (Fig. 2 A). The results indicate that FucT V mutants containing amino acids from the NH2-terminal region (HIS and HI) of the original domain swap had significant activity with both type 1 and 2 disaccharides (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, mutants with amino acids from the COOH-terminal region (THRKT and RKT) of the original domain swap had significant activity with the type 2 disaccharide but very little activity with the type 1 disaccharide (Fig. 2 C). Based on these results, two other mutants (H and I) were created. As shown in Fig. 2 D and Table I, neither single amino acid FucT V mutant had the acceptor substrate properties of the HI mutant. Thus, the two adjacent amino acids (equivalent to positions His73and Ile74 of FucT III) must be present to give rise to a FucT that can catalyze fucose transfer to a type 1 acceptor substrate at a significant rate.Table IActivity measurements of FucT constructs with various acceptor substratesFucT constructActivityDisaccharideGlycolipidType 1Type 2Lc4nLc4FucT III100ND1004FucT V41005100HISTHRKT (FucT III8/V)49100——THRKT7100——RKT8100——HIS4010010048HI3710010045H9100—— I810010100Assays were done with either a disaccharide substrate (Galβ1,3GlcNAc (type 1) or Galβ1,4GlcNAc (type 2)) or a glycolipid substrate (Lc4Cer (Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,3Glcβ1,1Cer) or nLc4Cer (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,3Glcβ1,1Cer)).None detected.Constructs were produced in which one or more amino acid residues were inserted into FucT V by domain swapping or site-directed mutagenesis.Dashes indicate that assays were not done. Open table in a new tab Assays were done with either a disaccharide substrate (Galβ1,3GlcNAc (type 1) or Galβ1,4GlcNAc (type 2)) or a glycolipid substrate (Lc4Cer (Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,3Glcβ1,1Cer) or nLc4Cer (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,3Glcβ1,1Cer)). None detected. Constructs were produced in which one or more amino acid residues were inserted into FucT V by domain swapping or site-directed mutagenesis. Dashes indicate that assays were not done. Additional assays were carried out with glycosphingolipid acceptor substrates to determine if the specificity displayed was substrate-specific. FucT III catalyzed the transfer of fucose to the type 1 glycolipid Lc4 (see Table I and Fig. 3, lane 1) at a significant rate, but not to the type 2 glycolipid nLc4(Fig. 3, lane 2). FucT V displayed the opposite acceptor substrate specificity (lanes 3(Lc4) and 4 (nLc4) of Fig. 3). In contrast to the restricted acceptor substrate specificities of the parent enzymes, the FucT V HIS and HI mutants had significant activity with both glycolipid substrates (Table I and Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). Consistent with the findings with the disaccharide substrates, the single amino acid mutant (I) had more activity with the type 2 than with the type 1 glycolipid substrate (Fig. 3,lanes 9 and 10). Interestingly, the HI and HIS mutants displayed an even more remarkable alteration of acceptor specificity compared with FucT V when glycolipidversus disaccharide substrates were utilized. Thus, both mutant enzymes had approximately 2-fold higher activity with Lc4 than with nLc4 (Table I). Comparison of the kinetic properties of the FucT V mutants and the parent enzyme resulted in GDP-fucose saturation curves for each of the enzymes that were essentially identical, resulting in K m values for each of 35 ± 5 μm (Fig. 4). In contrast to FucT V (which was only saturable with a type 2 disaccharide), the FucT V mutants (HIS and HI) could be saturated with both type 1 and 2 disaccharides when assayed with substrate concentrations up to 60 mm. Apparent K mand K cat values were obtained and are presented in Table II. As previously reported, FucT III has a relatively high affinity for a type 1 disaccharide substrate. Both FucT V mutants had K m values 20-fold higher than FucT III for the type 1 substrate. In contrast, the mutations had a relatively minor (∼2-fold higher) affect on theK m values for a type 2 substrate when compared with the value obtained for FucT V. Overall, the catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) of the mutants was poorer when compared with FucT III and V. In the case of the type 1 acceptor, the difference in catalytic efficiency is primarily aK m effect, whereas the reduction in catalytic efficiency with a type 2 acceptor is based on both aK m and K cat effect. Finally, although there is little difference in the K m values obtained for the FucT V mutants with either a type 1 or type 2 acceptor substrate, there is a measurable difference in theK cat value when a type 1 acceptor substrate is used. Thus, the HI mutant has a higher K catvalue (∼2-fold) than the HIS mutant when a type 1 acceptor is used, whereas they have similar K cat values with type 2 substrates.Table IIKinetic parameters for FucTs with type 1 and type 2 acceptor substratesEnzymeK mK catK cat/K mmmminmm× minType 1 disaccharide acceptor FucT III1.0 ± 0.45.2 ± 0.25.20 FucT V>60.0 HI21.5 ± 3.56.1 ± 1.00.28 HIS25.1 ± 4.52.7 ± 0.20.11Type 2 disaccharide acceptor FucT V3.4 ± 0.49.3 ± 1.32.74 HI7.6 ± 0.93.5 ± 0.30.46 HIS8.1 ± 0.94.3 ± 0.30.53Although activity was measurable, the enzyme was not saturated even at the highest substrate concentration tested. Open table in a new tab Although activity was measurable, the enzyme was not saturated even at the highest substrate concentration tested. The predicted amino acid sequences for FucT III and V contain two and four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, respectively (10Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.D. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 11Weston B.W. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these sites are conserved (Asn167 and Asn198 in FucT V; Asn154 and Asn185 in FucT III). The other two potential N-linked glycosylation sites exist at Asn60 and Asn105 of FucT V. Asn60occurs outside of the catalytic domain of FucT V (as would the corresponding Ser in FucT III), and Asn105 of FucT V is substituted by a His residue in FucT III (His92). Lowe and co-workers (10Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.D. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that when FucT III is expressed in anin vitro translation system it is glycosylated with endoglycosidase H-sensitive carbohydrate residues. Their results suggest that both potential N-linked glycosylation sites are utilized. Similar information for FucT V is unavailable. One of the FucT V mutants (THRKT) does not contain the potentialN-linked site at residue 105 of FucT V due to a His substitution at this site. This provided an opportunity to determine if this substitution affected the overall molecular weight of the FucT V mutant compared with FucT V. Plasmids containing the FucT V and the THRKT mutant (both as protein A chimeras) were transfected into COS cells, and the resulting proteins were purified by IgG-agarose affinity chromatography and analyzed by Western blot. No significant difference in the relative mobility of the wild-type and mutant proteins occurred, suggesting that Asn105 of FucT V is not glycosylated in the COS cell expression system (data not shown). The initial cloning of FucTs III and V demonstrated that these two enzymes shared substantial amino acid sequence homology yet differed in their acceptor substrate specificities (10Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.D. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 11Weston B.W. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent cloning of a third, highly homologous FucT (i.e. FucT VI) demonstrated a similar relationship (12Koszdin K.L. Bowen B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, each of these enzymes has distinct acceptor substrate specificities although they have remarkably similar predicted amino acid sequences. Our previous work has focused on defining the minimal catalytic domains of FucT enzymes (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our characterization of the catalytic domains of FucTs III and V demonstrated that these distinct acceptor substrate specificities are due to differences occurring at 23 out of ∼300 amino acids (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most notably, FucT III was found to be essentially an α1,4-FucT, whereas FucT V is much more active with type 2 than type 1 acceptor substrates. Using a domain swapping approach, we (16Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate that the incorporation of as few as eight amino acids unique to the NH2 terminus of the catalytic domain of FucT III into FucT V produced a FucT with both type 1 and type 2 acceptor specificity (Fig. 1). In the current study, we have shown that two of these eight amino acids can account for the enhanced type 1 acceptor substrate specificity. It is interesting to note that these two amino acids lie next to each other (i.e. His73 and Ile74) in the FucT III sequence. Substitution of only one of these two amino acids (His or Ile) into the FucT V sequence is insufficient to incorporate the new acceptor substrate specificity into the resulting mutant. Thus, in the FucT V sequence Asn (the normal amino acid in FucT V) cannot substitute for His even when the other site is an Ile residue, and Thr (the normal amino acid in FucT V) cannot substitute for Ile even when the other site is a His residue. Based on these results, we can conclude that a polar, uncharged amino acid substitution at either position is insufficient to produce the enhanced acceptor substrate specificity obtained with the FucT V HI mutant. Additional mutational studies will be required to determine if a specific or general (e.g. negatively charged or neutral) amino acid side chain substitution at these sites is required for the new acceptor substrate specificity. Only one other study has been published in which the acceptor specificity of FucTs has been evaluated with respect to the enzymes' amino acid sequence. Legault et al. (19Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) used a domain swap approach with full-length forms of FucTs III and VI to identify a discrete sequence of amino acids that distinguishes acceptor specificity (i.e. type 1 versus type 2). Based on an extensive set of experiments in which various coding sequences of FucTs III and VI were swapped, Legault et al. (19Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) concluded that segments encoding amino acid differences between residues at 105–151 of FucT III and residues 104–150 of FucT VI (referred to as subdomains 4 and 5) influence type 1 acceptor specificity. Thus, the substitution of subdomains 4 and 5 of FucT VI for the corresponding regions in FucT III eliminated type 1 acceptor specificity, whereas the complementary construct (i.e. subdomains 4 and 5 of FucT III substituted into the FucT VI coding region) produced an enzyme with both type 1 and 2 acceptor specificity. However, it should be noted that the latter chimera had very poor activity compared with the wild-type enzymes. Since these studies utilized FucT VI in combination with FucT III sequences, it is difficult to directly compare them to our results. However, Legault et al. (19Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y.

Another good candidate for this role is PC5-A that has been shown to be present in the regulated secretory pathway of certain neuroendocrine tissues, but evidence that it can process prohormones is lacking. To determine whether PC5-A could function as a prohormone convertase and to compare its cleavage specificity with that of PC1 and PC2, we stably transfected the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line with PC5-A and analyzed the biosynthesis and subcellular localization of the enzyme, as well as its ability to process pro-neurotensin/neuromedin N (pro-NT/NN) into active peptides. Our data showed that in transfected PC12 cells, PC5-A was converted from its 126-kDa precursor form into a 117-kDa mature form and, to a lesser extent, into a C-terminally truncated 65-kDa form of the 117-kDa product. Metabolic and immunochemical studies showed that PC5-A was sorted to early compartments of the regulated secretory pathway where it colocalized with immunoreactive NT. Furthermore, pro-NT/NN was processed in these compartments according to a pattern that differed from that previously described in PC1- and PC2-transfected PC12 cells. This pattern resembled that previously reported for pro-NT/NN processing in the adrenal medulla, a tissue known to express high levels of PC5-A. Altogether, these data demonstrate for the first time the ability of PC5-A to function as a prohormone convertase in the regulated secretory pathway and suggest a role for this enzyme in the physiological processing of pro-NT/NN.

Pro-neuropeptide/hormone cleavage at basic residues (most often dibasic sequences) is a general phenomenon by which active peptides are processed from their precursor in neuroendocrine tissues. The identity of the cellular proteases that effect these cleavages has long remained elusive. Recently, a family of proprotein convertases (PCs)1 with the ability to cleave protein precursors at basic residues was identified by homology with the yeast Kex2 protease (reviewed in Refs 1Steiner D.F.

Furthermore, the two enzymes were found to differ in their cleavage site specificity, thus leading to differential processing of these precursors. More recently, another member of the PC family, PC5 (also designated PC6), has also been proposed to play the role of a prohormone convertase (17Lusson J. Vieau D. Hamelin J. Day R. Chrétien M.

Two PC5 isoforms generated from a single gene by alternative splicing have been identified (17Lusson J. Vieau D. Hamelin J. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6691-6695Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Nakagawa T. Hosaka M. Torii S. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem.

PC5-A is a soluble form that exhibits a widespread distribution in endocrine and non-endocrine tissues, being particularly abundant in the intestine and adrenals. PC5-B is membrane-bound, and its distribution is restricted to the lungs, intestine, and adrenals (3Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Ray R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 17Lusson J. Vieau D. Hamelin J. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A recent study showed that PC5-A and PC5-B were sorted to different subcellular compartments when stably transfected in AtT-20 cells (20De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, PC5-A was stored into regulated secretory vesicles, whereas PC5-B was retained in the Golgi. In addition, PC5-A was found to colocalize with pro-glucagon and PC2 in the secretory granules of the pancreatic α-cell (20De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that PC5-A might function as a prohormone convertase in the regulated secretory pathway. However, in contrast to PC1 and PC2, virtually nothing is known about the ability of PC5 to process neuropeptide/hormone precursors in neuroendocrine cells. Recent studies have suggested that PC5 could be involved in the bioactivation of Müllerian inhibiting substance in the Sertoli cells of the developing testis (21Nachtigal M.W. Ingraham H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in the proteolytic processing of the membrane-associated receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase μ in vascular endothelial cells (22Campan M. Yoshizumi M. Seidah N.G. Lee M.E. Bianchi C. Haber E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3797-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ability of PC5 to cleave these two proteins, which cannot be considered as classical prohormones, was demonstrated by cotransfecting enzyme and substrate into non-endocrine cells. A useful neuroendocrine cell model to investigate the role of PC5 as a prohormone convertase is the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. PC12 cells have been shown to be devoid of both PC1 and PC2 and to express very low levels of PC5 (3Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Ray R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In addition, PC12 cells synthesize a number of neuropeptide precursors including the neurotensin/neuromedin N (NT/NN) precursor which they poorly process (23Carraway R.E. Bullock B.P. Dobner P.R. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24Rovère C. de Nadai F. Bidard J.N. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P.

Pro-NT/NN, the structure of which is depicted in Fig. 1, is predominantly expressed in the brain and in the distal small intestine (26Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. Spaulding G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Pro-NT/NN processing in the brain, gut, and adrenals yields different combinations of biologically active peptides (26Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. Spaulding G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 668: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. Joyce T.J. Regul. Pept. 1993; 43: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as summarized in Fig. 1. Undifferentiated PC12 cells do not express pro-NT/NN but can be induced to express very high levels of the precursor by a combination of nerve growth factor (NGF), forskolin, dexamethasone, and lithium (36Dobner P.R. Barber D. Villa-Komaroff L. McKiernan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 37Kislauskis E. Bullock B. McNeil S. Dobner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4963-4968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that stable transfection of PC12 cells with either PC1 or PC2 led to differential processing of pro-NT/NN, PC1 mimicking the pro-NT/NN processing pattern observed in the gut and PC2 reproducing that observed in the brain (38Zhou Y. Rovère C. Kitabgi P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,39Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol.

In order to determine whether PC5-A may function as a prohormone convertase in the regulated secretory pathway and to compare its cleavage specificity with that of PC1 and PC2, we stably transfected the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line with PC5-A and analyzed the biosynthesis and subcellular localization of the enzyme, as well as its ability to process pro-NT/NN into active peptides. Our data show that in PC5-A-transfected PC12 cells the convertase is sorted to early compartments of the regulated secretory pathway where it colocalizes with immunoreactive NT and processes pro-NT/NN with a pattern that differs from that previously described in PC1- and PC2-transfected PC12 cells (39Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This pattern resembles that observed for pro-NT/NN processing in the adrenal medulla (26Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. Spaulding G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Pept. 1993; 43: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a tissue known to express high levels of PC5-A (3Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Ray R.

Altogether, these data demonstrate for the first time the ability of PC5-A to function as a prohormone convertase in the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells and suggest a role for this enzyme in the physiological processing of pro-NT/NN. PC12 cells were grown as described previously (24Rovère C. de Nadai F. Bidard J.N. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. The mPC5-A cDNA was subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3(Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). PC12 cells were transfected by electroporation as previously reported for PC1 and PC2 transfections (39Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two PC12/PC5 clones (E5.9 and E5.C) were selected for the studies reported here by Western blotting with anti-PC5-A antiserum. Wild type and transfected PC12 cells at 60–80% confluency were stimulated with optimal concentrations of NGF (200 ng/ml), dexamethasone (1 μm), forskolin (1 μm), and LiCl (20 mm) for 48 h. The cells were extracted and analyzed for PC5-A expression and pro-NT/NN processing as described below. Cells were washed with PBS and homogenized in phosphate buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P40, and 0.9% NaCl. The extracts were centrifuged, and the protein content of the supernatants was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Western blotting was performed as described previously (39Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using an antiserum directed against the sequence DYDLSHAQSTYFNDPK representing residues 116–132 consisting of the PC5 N-terminal sequence following the potential activation site RTKR (20De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This antiserum has been shown to recognize pro-PC5-A (126 kDa), mature PC5-A (116 kDa), and a C-terminally truncated form of mature PC5-A (65–70 kDa) (17Lusson J. Vieau D. Hamelin J. Day R.

In some experiments, the PC5 antiserum was preadsorbed by incubation with its synthetic antigen (5 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS. Total RNA from the cell lines was extracted and submitted to Northern blot analysis as described previously (39Rovère C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). mPC5 and rpro-NT/NN (gift from Paul R. Dobner, Massachusetts University, Worcester) were radiolabeled by random priming with 5′-[α-32P]dCTP (>3000 Ci/mmol; ICN). The labeled probes were added to the prehybridization mix at a concentration of 1–3 × 106cpm/ml and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. In some experiments, the blots were washed out and rehybridized with a control labeled probe encoding GAPDH. The films were scanned, and mRNA bands were quantified by densitometry relative to GAPDH mRNA. Biosynthetic analyses of the metabolic fate of PC5 were performed as described previously (40Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells that had reached 80% confluency were stimulated for 48 h, washed with PBS, and then switched for 1 h to a methionine-free medium (RPMI 1640) (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 0.5% calf serum. Subsequently, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) (Mandel Scientific Co., Ontario, Canada). At the end of the incubation period, the media were removed, and cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by incubation on ice for 20 min. The media and cell lysates were pre-cleared in two steps using normal rabbit serum and protein A-agarose and immunoprecipitated with the PC5 antiserum described above. All immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (40Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation products were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels followed by treatment with Entensify (NEN Life Science Products) and autoradiography. For stimulation of granule content release, PC5-A-transfected PC12 cells and AtT-20 cells (20De Bie I. Marcinkiewicz M. Malide D. Lazure C. Nakayama K. Bendayan M. Seidah N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1261-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) (Mandel Scientific Co., Ontario, Canada), then chased for 30 min in methionine-free medium. This medium was replaced for 50 min with fresh methionine-free medium without inducers and without or with 5 mm 8-Br-cAMP. The media were immunoprecipitated and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. For metabolic studies of pro-NT/NN biosynthesis, PC12 cells that had reached 80% confluency were stimulated for 48 h, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h in a methionine-free medium (ICN Biomedicals, France). The cells where then labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml) (ICN Biomedicals) for 5 min. At the end of the pulse period, the cells were chased for different times in complete medium, washed with PBS, and homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All incubations were carried out at 37 °C with optimal concentrations of NGF, dexamethasone, forskolin, and LiCl as described above. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was pre-cleared using normal rabbit serum 1:100 and 10% pansorbin (Calbiochem). After pre-clearing, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with a pro-NT/NN antiserum (gift from Paul Dobner, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) at a 1:500 dilution and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The pro-NT/NN antiserum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein containing amino acids 8–169 of prepro-NT/NN fused to the bacterial Trp E protein (23Carraway R.E. Bullock B.P. Dobner P.R. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation products were resolved by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels and revealed by autoradiography. PC5 and NT antigens were visualized either separately (single label) or jointly (double label) in transfected and non-transfected (wild type) PC12 cells using indirect immunofluorescence. In a separate set of experiments, PC5 immunostaining was combined to the immunodetection of either MG-160, a membrane sialoglycoprotein associated with the medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus (41Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or Syntaxin-6, a newly discovered member of the syntaxin family predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi network (42Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For both series of experiments, cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips. At approximately 50% confluence, they were stimulated or not for 48 h as described above. After stimulation, cells were rinsed twice in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 15 min at room temperature. They were then washed with 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, and blocked for 20 min in TBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 3% normal goat serum. For single labeling experiments, cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either PC5 or NT primary antibody diluted in TBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1% normal goat serum. The PC5 antiserum (raised in rabbit) was the same as the one used for Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitation, and was utilized at a dilution of 1:4000. The anti-NT antibody (raised in rat) was purchased from Eugene Tech International (Ridgefield Park, NJ) and used at a dilution of 1:1000. After thorough rinsing in TBS, cells immunolabeled with the PC5 antiserum were revealed with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and cells immunolabeled with the NT antiserum with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Both secondary antibodies were diluted 1:100 with TBS and applied for 45 min at room temperature. Specificity controls included omission of either primary antibody or use of primary antisera preabsorbed for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 μm antigenic peptide. For double-labeled experiments, cells were co-incubated overnight at 4 °C with PC5 and either NT, MG-160, or Syntaxin-6 antibodies diluted in TBS containing 0.02% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum. PC5 and NT antibodies were the same as above and were used at dilutions of 1:2000 and 1:000, respectively. The MG-160 antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody 10A8) was a generous gift from Dr. N. K. Gonatas (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) and was used at a dilution of 1:200. The Syntaxin-6 antibody (monoclonal mouse IgG1 isotype) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and was used at a dilution of 3 μg/ml. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a mixture of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rat IgGs (for PC5/NT double-labeling experiments) or of Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs (for PC5/MG-160 and PC5/Syntaxin-6 experiments). All secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:100 and purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. All cells were then rinsed in TBS, mounted in Aquamount, and examined by confocal microscopy. Labeled cells were visualized with either a Leica CLSM or a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal microscope each equipped with an argon/krypton laser. FITC signals and Texas Red signals were imaged by exciting samples with 488 and 568 nm, respectively. All images were acquired as single optical sections through the middle of the cells and averaged over 32 scans/frame. Imaged were stored on optical discs and archived and labeled using Adobe Photoshop. The specificities of the NT (29G), NN (NN-Ah), and K6L (K6L-Af) antisera used here as well as the radioimmunoassay procedures employing these antisera have been previously described in detail (43Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovère C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the NT antiserum reacts with the free C terminus of NT; the NN antiserum recognizes the free N terminus of NN; and the K6L antiserum detects the free N terminus of the sequence that follows the Lys85–Arg86 site in rat pro-NT/NN. These antisera cross-react weakly (<1%) with antigenic sequences that are internal to proneurotensin or proneurotensin fragments. Another anti-NN antiserum (NMN, kindly provided by Robert Carraway, Worcester) was used. This antiserum detects the free C terminus of NN and cross-reacts poorly (<3%) with NT or with C-terminally extended NN sequences (28Carraway R.E. Mitra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8627-8631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Portions of acid extracts from PC12 cells were citraconylated, submitted to Arg-directed tryptic digestion (24Rovère C. de Nadai F. Bidard J.N. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P.

J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and assayed for N-terminal immunoreactive NN (iNN). The value of CTiNN thus obtained provides an index of the total amount of pro-NT/NN (either processed or unprocessed) that was synthesized and stored in the cells at the time of extraction. Cell extracts were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC as described elsewhere (24Rovère C. de Nadai F. Bidard J.N. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The fractions were assayed for their content in iNT, C-terminal iNN, N-terminal iNN, and iK6L. Because of the above-described antisera specificity, these assays measure the amounts of precursor products that are processed at the Lys163–Arg164, Lys148–Arg149, Lys140–Arg141, and Lys84–Arg85 sequences, respectively. The products detected after HPLC were NT, NN, large NT, and large NN that eluted with retention times of 40, 43, 69, and 71 min, respectively. The results were normalized for the amount of protein in each extract. The percentages of cleavage at the Lys163–Arg164, Lys148–Arg149, Lys140–Arg141, and Lys84–Arg85 s"

This high level of gene expression results from cooperation between a weak but liver-specific promoter and an intronic activator. A deletional study of this activator present in the first intron allowed us to ascribe the maximal enhancer function to a 400-base pair (bp) fragment (+1916 to + 2329). This enhancer is highly liver-specific and enhances the activity of heterologous minimal promoters in a position and distance-independent fashion in transiently transfected Hep G2 hepatoma cells. The aldolase B enhancer is composed of two domains, a 200-bp module (Ba) inactive by itself but which synergizes with another 200-bp module (Bb) that alone retains 25% of the total enhancer activity. The Bb sequence is 76% homologous between human and rat genes and contains several binding sites for liver-enriched nuclear factors. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that elements 5 and 7 bind hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), whereas element 2 binds hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4).

Aldolase B, one of the three known aldolase isoenzymes, is the only expressed isoform in highly differentiated hepatocytes (1Schapira F. Hatzfeld A. Weber A. Markert C.L. Isozymes. 3. Academic Press, New York1975: 987-1003Crossref Google Scholar) and is also found in kidney and small adult intestine where it is associated with aldolases A or C (2Guder W.G. Ross B.D. Kidney Int. 1984; 26: 101-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Aldolase B catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose 1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde; therefore, it is involved in both glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. In human, hereditary fructose intolerance is a potentially fatal autosomal recessive disease resulting from aldolase B deficiency. In addition aldolase B gene transcription is regulated by hormones and diet; it is partially repressed by glucagon and cyclic AMP and stimulated 4-fold by glucose and insulin (3Munnich A. Besmond C. Darguy S. Reach G. Vaulont S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The aldolase B gene proximal promoter was shown to be liver cell-specific as judged from transient transfection experiments in the hepatoma cell line Hep G2 and in hepatocytes in primary culture (4Grégori C. Ginot F. Decaux J.F. Weber A. Berbar T. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However the promoter activity of the −192-bp1 5′-flanking fragment was always very low in these cells. Recently we explained this result by a dominant restriction of the transcriptional activity due to binding of the hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) to the PAB element of the promoter (5Grégori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This PAB element binds in a mutually exclusive fashion either hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), which stimulates promoter activity, or HNF3 that, on the contrary, restrained the aldolase B promoter activity (6Grégori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice transgenes directed by the −232-bp proximal promoter fragment were totally silent. The addition of 1.8 kb of sequences located in the first intron of the aldolase B gene (+685 to +2514) led to a 50-fold stimulation of the promoter activity ex vivo in Hep G2 cells and allowed for a correct, tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice (7Sabourin J.-C. Kern A.-S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.-P. Kahn A. Pichard A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The purpose of this work was to delineate the minimal intronic fragment responsible for the enhancer activity and to characterize DNA elements and cognate trans-acting factors involved in both activity and tissue specificity of this enhancer. Among various DNA elements detected in a 400-bp fragment endowed with a liver cell-specific enhancer activity, two HNF1-binding sites were shown to be indispensable for this activity. In addition, a conserved HNF4-binding site also behaved as a positive cis-acting element of the enhancer. For generation of the internal deletion, we started with the −232 A100B/CAT construct previously described (7Sabourin J.-C. Kern A.-S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.-P. Kahn A.

The −232A100B1200/CAT and −232A100B600/CAT plasmids were obtained by excision of a fragment between sites StuI (located within the B fragment) and KpnI or BamHI (located within the plasmid linkers). The −232A100Ba/CAT, −232A100Bb/CAT, −232A100Bc/CAT, and −232A100Ba+b/CAT plasmids were obtained by cloning in both orientations, into the SmaI site of the −232A100/CAT plasmid (7Sabourin J.-C.

The a+b polymerase chain reaction fragment was also subcloned in the AflIII site (located upstream from the promoter) or in the ClaI site (located downstream of the CAT gene) of the previously described pECAT vector (4Grégori C.

Plasmids with block mutations in elements 5 and 7 or deletions in elements 2 and 4 were constructed by inserting the mutated fragments, obtained by a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure (5Grégori C.

All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. The primer sequences used are available upon request. Hep G2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified medium in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 μml-triiodothyronin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 10 nm insulin, at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2. Mouse 3T6 cells were grown under the same conditions without hormones. Transfection were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (11Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J.

The pRSV luciferase standardization plasmid was used to monitor variations in transfection efficacy. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay (12Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell.

Labeling and gel shift assays in 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel were performed as described (23Raymondjean M. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in the presence of poly(dI·dC) (2 μg/sample, as a mean) as a nonspecific competitor. Supershift analysis was performed by incubating the reaction mix with anti-HNF1 or anti-HNF4 antisera (a generous gift from F. Reigeisen and M. Yaniv) at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA constructs were digested with restriction enzymes ClaI (cutting in 3′ in the vector) and HindIII (cutting in 5′ in the plasmid linker). The fragments of interest were isolated by electrophoresis, electroeluted, and purified by using elutip-d columns (Schleicher & Schuell), and then microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs according to Gordon and Ruddle (24Gordon J.W. Ruddle F.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 411-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The progeny was analyzed for the presence of the transgene by Southern blot. In our previous studies we identified a 1.8-kb B region (+685 to +2514) localized in the first intron of the aldolase B gene that was absolutely required for transgene expression in the liver of transgenic mice (7Sabourin J.-C. Kern A.-S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.-P. Kahn A. Pichard A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In transient transfection experiments in hepatoma Hep G2 cells, this B fragment stimulated about 50-fold the basal activity of a 232-bp proximal aldolase B promoter (4Grégori C. Ginot F. Decaux J.F. Weber A. Berbar T. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine the cis-active sequences in this region, a series of deleted mutants were constructed, and their activity was tested in transient transfection experiments in Hep G2 cells (Fig. 1). Taking advantage of a uniqueStuI restriction site in the B fragment, we first analyzed the effects of the upstream 1200-bp (+685 to +1915) and of the downstream 600-bp (+1916 to +2514) parts of the B fragment. The B1200 subfragment did not change expression of the reference construct devoid of the B element (−232A100CAT construct) whereas, in contrast, the B600 downstream subfragment led to a 120-fold stimulation of the basal activity. This subfragment seemed to be more efficacious than the complete B fragment, perhaps due to its closer position with respect to the minimal promoter. Further subdivision of these 600 bp in three short DNA fragments of 200 bp each, designated fragments Ba, Bb, and Bc, showed that fragments Ba and Bc alone were totally inactive, whereas the Bb fragment (+2118 to +2329) retained 25% of the activation observed with the B600 subfragment. Finally association of the fragments B (a+b) restored the full activation reached with the B600 fragment (Fig. 1). These results indicated that the 400-bp region, spanning from +1916 to +2329 bp, is able to recapitulate the enhancer activity of the intronic B element of the aldolase B gene. This 400-bp enhancer can be divided into downstream 200 bp, conferring by themselves part of the enhancer activity, and upstream 200 bp by themselves inactive but cooperating with the downstream part to confer a full enhancer activity. To verify in vivo the relevance of results obtained ex vivo, we generated transgenic mice harboring the constructs studied above (Table I). The transgene bearing the upstream B1200 subfragment was totally inactive in all 7 lines obtained. In contrast, transgenes including either the downstream B600 subfragment or parts B(a+b) of this subfragment were detectably active in 8 out of 10 lines studied and were specifically expressed in the liver and kidney but not in the spleen and brain. As previously reported (7Sabourin J.-C. Kern A.-S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.-P. Kahn A. Pichard A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), transgene expression is highly dependent on a position effect, thus explaining the various levels of transgene activity and their total inactivity in two lines (once with each construct). In any case, these results confirm in vivo the delineation of the enhancer region of the aldolase B gene established from ex vivo experiments.Table IExpression of the aldolase B/CAT transgenes in different tissuesTransgeneMouseCopy numberLiverKidneyIntestineSpleenBrainCAT activity (cpm/μg wet tissue/45 min)232A100/CAT4016<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1232A100B/CAT91075690.81.10.4 18004535.23.70.10.52.452150.34.80.44.60.417100.350.9<0.1<0.1<0.17200.398.25<0.1<0.1<0.1232A100B/CAT528<0.1<0.1NDNDND 120017100<0.1<0.1NDNDND163<0.1<0.1NDNDND381<0.1<0.1NDNDND40100.160.13NDNDND478<0.1<0.1NDNDND3570<0.1<0.1NDNDND232A100B/CAT661001016ND<0.1<0.1 600(a + b +621207.62.18ND<0.1<0.1 c)645<0.1<0.1ND<0.1<0.1232A100B/CAT831070.91<0.1 400(a + b)145110.40.20.20.22121265110.2261<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.133182.30.7<0.1<0.1<0.160500.170.25<0.1<0.1<0.141300.250.3<0.1<0.1<0.1Transgene expression is expressed by CAT activity, in cpm/mg wet tissue/45 min; all results correspond to the means of three independent measurements (in the organs of the founders mice).ND, not determined.

To answer this question we placed the a+b fragment in both orientations in its normal intronic position or in a distal position, 1.2 kb upstream from the promoter or 1 kb downstream of the CAT gene. The activity of all these constructs was tested by transient transfections in Hep G2 cells, and the results are reported in Table II. The fold activation observed was totally independent of the forward or backward orientation of the (a+b) fragment and almost independent of its position with respect to the cap site, either upstream from the promoter or downstream of the CAT gene or in its natural intronic position, in agreement with canonical enhancer properties (25Banerji J. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Cell. 1981; 27: 299-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). However, when the enhancer strength was tested on a construct consisting of the aldolase B promoter spanning from −194 to + 14 bp, and lacking the first 100 bp and the last 120 bp of the intronic sequence (i.e. both splice sites), the level of activation was reduced. We do not know if this reduction results from a specific cooperation between the enhancer and intronic sequences located in the extreme 5′ and 3′ parts of the first intron or from a general increase in the level of transgene expression linked to the presence of a functional intron, already documented in mice but not in transient transfection experiments (26Whitelaw B. Archibald A.L. Harris S. McClenaghan M. Simons J.P. Clark A.J.

When more than four independent experiments were performed, the results are given as means ± S.E.; otherwise, the means are given, and in parentheses are the number of experiments. The activity of the B(a+b) enhancer fragment was also tested on heterologous promoters, either the liver-specific −183-bp proximal promoter of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene (8Cognet M. Bergot M.O. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7368-7375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the ubiquitous 105-bp promoter of the thymidine kinase (tk) gene (9Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The B(a+b) fragment enhanced the activity of these promoters by 18- and 15-fold, respectively (Table II). It is noteworthy that stimulation of the L-type pyruvate kinase promoter by the aldolase B enhancer was approximately similar to that by the SV 40 enhancer, previously reported (8Cognet M. Bergot M.O. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7368-7375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the enhancer activity of the a+b fragment was by itself specific to liver cells, the constructs containing either the aldolase B or the L-type pyruvate kinase or the tk promoter, with or without the B(a+b) enhancer, were transiently transfected in mouse 3T6 cells that do not express the aldolase B gene. The enhancer was unable to turn on the liver-specific aldolase B orL-type pyruvate kinase promoters as well to activate the ubiquitous tk promoter. These results indicate that the aldolase B(a+b) enhancer was clearly cell-specific. A computer analysis of the a+b enhancer sequence using the recently published Matinspector program (27Paca-Uccaralertkun S. Zhao L.-J. Adya N. Cross J.V. Cullen B.R. Boros I.M. Giam C.-Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 456-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed. Only the analysis of the Bb (+2118 to +2329) enhancer fragment gave relevant information indicating potential binding sites for liver-enriched nuclear factors such as HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, and CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) and for the ubiquitous AP1 complex. Since this Bb short fragment alone also retained part of the enhancer function and is 76% conserved between human and rat aldolase B genes, we focused our attention on these 200 bp. To confirm that elements of the Bb fragment actually interact with DNA-binding proteins, we first used in vivo DNase I footprinting experiments. The in vivo footprint revealed protein occupancy all over the fragment (not shown), such that it was rather difficult to deduce from this pattern well delineated windows. However, we used this experiment together with the identification of potential binding sites to design seven oligonucleotides that were used for gel shift assay experiments. Fig. 2summarizes features of sequence analysis and in vivofootprinting experiments and shows the elements whose binding activity was then individually analyzed by gel shift assays. We found that elements 1 and 3 bind factors present in both liver and brain nuclear extracts; in contrast, elements 2, 4, 5, and 7 have a different binding activity in liver and brain (Fig. 3). To determine whether elements 2, 4, 5, and 7 bind previously identified liver-specific transcription factors, we used oligonucleotides of known binding specificity as competitor in the gel retardation experiments. Binding to element 2 was only competed for by the HNF4 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, a), whereas binding to elements 5 and 7 were highly competed for by the HNF1 oligonucleotide and by each other (Fig. 3,c and d). In addition, binding activity of element 2 was specifically supershifted by anti-HNF4 antibodies (Fig. 3, a), whereas binding activities of elements 5 and 7 were both supershifted by anti-HNF1 antibodies (Fig. 3, c and d).Figure 3Gel shift analysis of elements B2, B4, B5, and B7 of the enhancer fragment Bb.

Competition experiments using oligonucleotides with different affinity for either HNF4 and/or COUP-TF were performed (Fig. 3, b), and none of them totally competed for the binding to element 4. The element 4 binding activity was also insensitive to anti-HNF4 antibodies. In contrast, element 4 as well as element 2 were effective in displacing HNF4 bound to the L3 L-PK site (Fig. 3, b). Therefore element 4 could bind factor(s) of the nuclear receptor superfamily different from HNF4 and could bind HNF4 with a low affinity. These element 4-binding factors are not likely to correspond mainly to COUP-TF (28Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardasses D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is expressed in the brain as well as in the liver. Moreover element 4, whose sequence was reminiscent of an HNF3 recognition site, failed to bind this nuclear factor in our experiments as judged from competition experiments with an authentic HNF3-binding oligonucleotide. These results establish that the aldolase B enhancer is modular in nature, possessing binding sites for at least two liver-specific transcription factors, HNF1 and HNF4. The relative contribution of elements 2, 4, 5, and 7 to the enhancer strength in Hep G2 cells was tested by transient transfection of mutant constructs in which each of these element were mutated separately or in combination. The mutations were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the a+b-mutated fragments were introduced into an intronic position of the −232 A100 CAT aldolase B vector. We verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that mutated element 5 did not bind HNF1 (not shown). Mutation in this element as well as deletion of the other HNF1-binding site, element 7, rendered the enhancer totally inactive. Surprisingly, when both HNF1-binding sites were deleted, we observed an a"

Understanding the regulation and control of central metabolism in molecular terms is still a global challenge in cell biology. Central metabolism provides the living cells with readily usable forms of energy and with building blocks for biosynthesis. It also plays a major role in the biochemical transformation of cells in response to external signals, or in programmed differentiation. In multicellular eucaryotes, the physiological necessity of biochemical adaptation, including changes in enzyme machinery, is widely recognized and actively studied, and models are available (1Hochachka P.W. Somero G.N. Biochemical Adaptation. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1984: 8-20Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms are known to operate at distinct cellular levels, and are characterized by different time constants (2Fell, D. A. (1997) Understanding the Control of Metabolism, Chap. 1, Portland Press, London, EnglandGoogle Scholar). Schematically, enzyme concentrations are known to change on long time scales, due to processes ranging from gene expression to protein synthesis and degradation. This is referred to as genomic, or coarse, regulation (3Lefebvre D.D. Gellatly K.S. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Lefebvre D.D. Layzell D.B. Plant Metabolism. Longman, Harlow, England1997: 3-16Google Scholar, 4Ko K. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Lefebvre D.D. Layzell D.B. Plant Metabolism. Longman, Harlow, England1997: 17-25Google Scholar, 5Hatfield P.M. Vierstra R.S. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Lefebvre D.D. Layzell D.B. Plant Metabolism. Longman, Harlow, England1997: 26-36Google Scholar). The enzyme activities are modulated on medium and short time scales by covalent modifications and in response to variations of metabolite concentrations. This is called metabolic, or fine, regulation (6Plaxton W.C. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Lefebvre D.D. Layzell D.B. Plant Metabolism. Longman, Harlow, England1997: 50-68Google Scholar). There is a permanent interplay between genomic and metabolic regulations, and, following a perturbation, the induced processes may involve a broad range of time scales, from fast allosteric responses to slow changes in enzyme concentrations. In any given physiological condition, the integration of these control and regulation mechanisms eventually leads to a steady state. Stationary as well as transient states are systemic properties of cellular systems. At this level, the metabolic network is usually described with macroscopic variables and analysis is based on the assumption that control is shared between pathways and distributed among enzymes (7Kacser H. Davies D.D. The Biochemistry of Plants. 11. Academic Press, San Diego1987: 39-67Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations and activities constitute the parameters of the system, while metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes are the variables. The variables take values that are a function of the system parameters on one side, of external parameters on the other side. The latter are independent variables and include environmental factors. Metabolite concentrations and net metabolic fluxes, either at steady state or as transients, are usually measured in cell extracts. With assumptions and modeling, it may also be possible to determine unidirectional fluxes from extract analysis. The net metabolic fluxes determine the function of the cell factory, whereas the unidirectional reaction rates characterize the production units. Both are outstanding dynamic properties of cell metabolism expressing the flow of energy through the cell. The ideal way to find out how they are really distributed is to observe them directly in vivo. Non-destructive and non-invasive, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used to investigate the physiology and metabolism of living systems, from microorganisms to plants (8Pfeffer P.E. Gerasimowicz W.V. NMR in Agriculture. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989Google Scholar), from animals to humans (9Gillies R.J. NMR in Physiology and Biomedicine. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar), and from organelles to organs (10Gupta R.K. NMR Spectroscopy of Cells and Organisms. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987Google Scholar). The method, based upon the observation and characterization of the magnetizations of nuclear spins in different chemical environments, allows identification of molecules in vivo as well as in crude extracts. Absolute concentrations of the more abundant mobile metabolites (11Tofts P.S. Wray S. NMR Biomed. 1988; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and their time course during biochemical transformations (12Brindle K.M. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1988; 20: 257-293Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar) can be measured in intact cells. Additionally, NMR is the only available method for measuring unidirectional enzymatic fluxes in situ in living systems at steady state (13Alger J.R. Shulman R.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1984; 17: 83-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Kuchel P.W. NMR Biomed. 1990; 3: 102-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is due to the fact that, for any chemical or enzymatic reaction involving translocation of a nucleus with a spin, magnetization transfer directly reflects mass transfer (15MacConnell H.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1958; 28: 430-431Crossref Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The unidirectional rate constant of the chemical exchange process can then be measured with NMR if the rate constant is comparable to the longitudinal relaxation rate constants of the exchanging spins. This rather sophisticated method yields invaluable information, since the measured parameters characterize enzyme activities in situ. Among the NMR techniques used to study chemical exchange, two-dimensional NMR exchange spectroscopy (EXSY)1 (16Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) has the potential to monitor several unidirectional enzymatic reactions at steady state in living systems simultaneously. It has only been used to demonstrate the equality of ATP and phosphocreatine fluxes through creatine phosphokinase in rat brain and leg (17Balaban R.S. Kantor H.L. Ferretti J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12787-12789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated perfused rat heart (18Garlick P.B. Turner C.J. J. Magn. Res. 1983; 51: 536-539Google Scholar), but its capacity to measure fluxes of different pathways directly is appealing when studying the regulation of metabolic networks. The plant cell constitutes a suitable and elaborate model to study the regulation of central metabolism in eucaryotes as a function of external factors using NMR methods (19Ratcliffe R.G. Shachar-Hill Y. Pfeffer P.E. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in Plant Biology. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD1996: 1-26Google Scholar). Plant cell metabolism has evolved remarkable properties of compartmentation and flexibility in response to terrestrial constraints, and the response and acclimation of higher plants to large variations in environmental factors is spectacular (20Larcher W. Physiological Plant Ecology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 321-409Crossref Google Scholar, 21Smirnoff N. Environment and Plant Metabolism. Bios Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford, England1995Google Scholar). At the molecular level, heterotrophic higher plant cells share a universal strategy to produce ATP and building blocks from oxidation of “fuel” molecules (22Dennis D.T. The Biochemistry of Energy Utilization in Plants. Blackie, Glasgow, Scotland1987Crossref Google Scholar, 23Taiz L. Zeiger E. Plant Physiology. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Redwood City, CA1991: 265-284Google Scholar, 24Salisbury F.B. Ross C.W. Plant Physiology. Wadsworth Publishing Co., Belmont, CA1992: 267-297Google Scholar). Carbohydrates are first converted into a pool of hexose phosphates (25ap Rees T. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants. 14. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 1-33Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), then transformed through glycolysis into pyruvate (26Plaxton W.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 185-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Under oxygen deprivation, fermentation is carried out in the cytoplasm (27Drew M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 223-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), whereas, if oxygen is available, the last steps of respiration occur in the mitochondria (28Douce R. Mitochondria in Higher Plants: Structure, Function and Biogenesis. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1985Google Scholar). The enzymes composing the pathways of central metabolism catalyze numerous chemical reactions where phosphorus atoms change their molecular environment between substrates and products. Using NMR EXSY, we show for the first time that at least 10 of these unidirectional exchange processes can be detected simultaneously in maize root tips. The measurements of the unidirectional fluxes in this plant tissue, as a function of temperature and external oxygen concentration, highlight the acclimation of higher plant cell metabolism to modifications of these environmental factors. ATP turnover and glycolytic flux increase with temperature up to the point where oxygen availability limits the respiratory rate. At 21 °C, in relation to the resumption of growth and increasing hypoxia, we observed an increase in the net flux of glucose 6-phosphate to UDP-glucose synthesis. Since the amount of oligo- or polysaccharides that can be built up from UDP-glucose is far greater than that needed for growth, these observations are discussed in relation to the turnover of sucrose or polysaccharides. The associated production of pyrophosphate (PPi) leads us to suggest that PPi may be used to feed pyrophosphate:fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase acting as a glycolytic enzyme in these hypoxic growing plant cells. About 3000 maize (Zea mays L.) seeds (variety DEA, Pioneer France), were soaked for 3 h in aerated running tap water, and arranged on wet filter paper in several layers. During the 3 days of germination, in the dark, at 23 °C, the filter papers were kept humid with a solution of 5 mm Ca (NO3)2 in distilled water. Glass beads covering the bottom of the basins prevented the risk of hypoxia from any excess water. Excised root tips, 2–3 mm long, were thoroughly washed in a nutritive medium composed of 100 mm glucose, 5 mm Ca (NO3)2, and 1 mmPIPES buffer, at pH 7.0 and 10 °C for 2 h before being used for measurements. The sample, typically 6–8 g fresh mass, was then placed in an NMR tube fitted to a tightly closed perfusion system allowing the regulation of pH, temperature, and oxygen content in the circulating medium. A 100 ml/min flow rate was used, renewing the nutritive medium about 14 times/min around the root tips. The respiration rate was monitored continuously during the NMR experiment with a bypass system, allowing measurement of partial oxygen pressure in the medium, successively before and after the sample with the same electrode. At the end of the NMR measurements, the fresh mass was determined and the sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen for perchloric acid extraction of the metabolites. The NMR data were acquired with a Bruker AMX400 WB spectrometer at 162 MHz. D2O added to the nutrient medium (0.75% v/v) provided a signal to lock and shim the magnetic field. One-dimensional31P spectra of living root tips were registered interleaved with the two-dimensional spectroscopy. They were obtained over 15 min, from the accumulation of 1500 NMR signals (FIDs) with a radiofrequency pulse angle of 45° and a repetition period of 0.6 s. A Lorentz-Gauss apodization was applied to the resulting FID acquired over 2000 points with a frequency window of 5000 Hz. A phosphorus spin is detected first on one molecule, substrate of a given enzymatic reaction, then on a second molecule, product of this reaction. Each spin situation is described by its 31P nuclear magnetization, characterized by frequency and intensity. Between these two observation phases, a flow of magnetization, due to chemical exchange, occurs during a fixed delay called the mixing time. This delay has a typical value of 1.0 s and is the first important time constant of this experiment. It is used to monitor the timing of the enzymatic reaction responsible for the passage of the spin from one molecule to the other. This magnetic labeling is analogous in principle to isotopic or radioactive labeling (12Brindle K.M. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1988; 20: 257-293Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The NMR technique is not as sensitive as these tracer techniques, but its advantages are outstanding. First, the biochemical system is studied in its natural composition without artificial probes or concentration gradients of labeled molecules. Second, the system is monitored at steady state directly without the need for subsequent assay procedure. Third, the transient non-equilibrium state necessary for observation is introduced on a magnetic property which has no influence upon the chemical functions. Fourth, with a living system at steady state, this transient labeling scheme can be repeated many times to allow detection of a signal. The decay constant of the magnetic label is the relaxation rate constant, R 1, of its magnetization, the order of magnitude for which is 1.0 s−1. Due to the small fraction of cytoplasm in a plant cell, the signal-to-noise ratio of an EXSY spectrum is intrinsically low and must be increased by repetition of the elementary acquisition scheme (see below). Thus, the total measurement time necessary to obtain a useful EXSY spectrum, ranging from 12 to 29 h, is the second important time constant of this experiment. The resulting data reflect average values of the unidirectional reaction fluxes detected during this total measurement time, which one-dimensional spectra prove to be at steady state with respect to metabolite concentrations. The EXSY (or nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) pulse sequence is composed of three 90° radiofrequency pulses and four delays: t R, 90°, t 1, 90°, τm, 90°,t 2 (16Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar). Nuclear magnetizations are labeled according to their precession frequency duringt 1 and are detected duringt 2. The longitudinal components of the magnetization can exchange during the mixing time τm, and this is the time scale on which the biochemical processes are monitored. For a given τm value, the cross-peak intensities in the NMR spectrum are a monotonic function of the rates of magnetization exchange, themselves proportional to chemical fluxes (29Ernst R.R. Bodenhausen G. Wokaun A. Principles of NMR in One and Two Dimensions. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1987: 495-501Google Scholar). The optimum τm value is a compromise between the time necessary for the exchange to occur and the sensitivity loss due to relaxation. In the case of slow exchange, it is approximately equal to the average relaxation time constant T 1 for each cross-peak. In our experiment, the T 1values of the exchanging resonances measured by inversion recovery ranged from 0.3 s to 3.4 s and an optimum τmvalue was chosen to be 1.0 s. An elementary two-dimensional spectrum was obtained by repeating the sequence with i = 64 different values of t 1. The relaxation periodt 2 + t R was set to 1.13 s to maximize signal per unit time. For each value of t 1, n = 16 experiments were added, corresponding to the appropriate phase cycle. Thus, the duration of an elementary EXSY spectrum was 36 min. The absence of t 1 noise in the spectra is a proof of stability of both chemical shifts and intensities of the nuclear magnetizations during the elementary, 36-min-long, two-dimensional experiment. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the elementary two-dimensional experiment was repeated r times according to the scheme: (((t R, 90°, t 1, 90°, τm, 90°,t 2)N)i)r. The resulting experimental time ranged from 12 to 29 h, depending on the type of information sought. The raw data were processed with forward linear prediction in the indirect dimension, and Lorentz-Gauss apodization was applied in both dimensions to increase the signal-to-noise ratio without decreasing resolution. Before quantification of the signals, the base plane was corrected. The intensities of cross-peaks and diagonal peaks of each spectrum were measured as integrals over same-sized surfaces (voxels). Similarly, the noise was statistically characterized by the arithmetic mean and standard deviation from 20 different voxels. Assuming that a steady state of reaction rates was correlated to the observed steady state in metabolite concentrations, we determined these rates from the spectral intensities. Reaction rates were calculated from peak intensities using the procedure of Abel et al.(30Abel E.W. Coston T.P.J. Orrell K.G. Šik V. Stephenson D. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 70: 34-53Google Scholar), modified for input of the measured relaxation time constantsT 1. Their measurement can be achieved accurately and precisely when the resonance lines are well resolved in the one-dimensional in vivo spectra (31Roscher, A. (1997) Studying Plant Energetic Metabolism with P Chemical Exchange NMR. Development and Application of the 2D EXSY Technique. Ph.D. thesis, J. Fourier University, Grenoble, FranceGoogle Scholar). This is not the case of the Glu-1-P line, and the relaxation rate constant of Glu-1-P is difficult to measure in vivo from one-dimensional experiments. We did not take approximate R 1values such as that of the molecule in cell extracts or theR 1 value of Glu-6-P in vivo. Instead, for 10 EXSY spectra, we calculated the T 1 value, which gives the same net flux value through the enzymes phosphoglucomutase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. This assumption is valid since Glu-1-P does not accumulate and has no other known major metabolic implications than the ones seen in the EXSY spectra. Furthermore, potential compartmentation effects related to the hexose phosphate pool can be neglected in root tips since plastid development is very limited. The 10 T 1 values covered a range of 2.0–3.9 s, giving an average of 2.6 ± 0.5 s which, by the way, is close to the T 1 value of Glu-6-Pin vivo. This average value was then used to calculate the unidirectional reaction rates of the two quoted enzymes. Due to the optimized fast acquisition procedure, all the resonances in the spectra (cross-peaks as well as diagonal peaks) were partially and nonuniformly saturated (32Köck M. Griesinger C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 332-334Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, all intensities were corrected by a saturation factor taking into account theT 1 of the magnetization before exchange, measured in vivo, and the exchange rate constant. To compare different spectra, each cross-peak intensity was then normalized by the sum of all the intensities in the spectrum,i.e. the total mobile phosphate content. This quantity has been estimated from the acid extract one-dimensional spectrum of the sample to be 3.6 μmol/g fresh mass. It gives the absolute scale needed to express reaction rates in normalized units. One-dimensional 31P NMR spectra, commonly used to characterize the energetic status of living cells (33Roberts J.K.M. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. 2. Springer Verlag, Berlin1986: 43-59Google Scholar), give a static overview of cellular energetics. They were used here to monitor the stability of the sample's energetic status over the whole time needed to acquire the EXSY data. The chemical shifts of in vivoone-dimensional spectra (Fig. 1 A, spectrum 1) were interpreted from published data (34Roby C. Martin J.B. Bligny R. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5000-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Saint-Ges V. Roby C. Bligny R. Pradet A. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and, in case of resonance overlap, were confirmed by analysis of the corresponding in vitro spectrum (Fig. 1 A, spectrum 2). When necessary, identification was achieved by observing co-resonances on addition of pure compounds to the extract, and the pH titration behavior of the chemical shifts. Heteronuclear 31P- 1H chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (36Kessler H. Griesinger C. Zarbock J. Loosli H.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 57: 331-336Google Scholar) was used to ascertain the existence and position of the resonance of glucose 1-phosphate in the one-dimensional31P spectrum of living root tips (Fig. 1 B). For Glu-1-P, the chemical shift of the anomeric proton magnetically coupled to phosphorus is indeed very characteristic. The resonance positions and intensities of the one-dimensional NMR31P spectra, interleaved between 31P EXSY spectra, were stable throughout the duration of the two-dimensional experiment, which was 12–29 h in general. The intensities being proportional to the concentrations of phosphorylated metabolites, their constancy was taken as a criterion to ascertain that the tissue was at steady state with respect to energetics during the total experimental time. Fig. 2 A shows a typical phosphorus EXSY spectrum of living maize root tips, where discrete peaks are characterized by two frequencies and one intensity, indicated by contour lines. The frequency on the vertical axis indicates the origin of the magnetization, when the spins belong to the substrate. The horizontal axis gives the frequency of the magnetization after the mixing time, when the spins are part of the product. The peaks on the diagonal have the same substrate and product frequencies. They correspond to magnetizations or fractions of them which have not been exchanged during the mixing time. Their intensities are different from a one-dimensional phosphorus spectrum, but their positions are identical, and the assignment of the diagonal peaks is identical to the resonance assignment of a one-dimensional spectrum. The substrate and the product frequencies differ for the peaks outside the diagonal, called cross-peaks. They are attributed to chemical exchange of phosphorus atoms between different molecules, during the mixing time, through enzyme activity. The cross-peak intensities are interpreted as magnetization flows, linked to mass flow, between the two diagonal species they interconnect. Each cross-peak is assigned to a reaction on the basis of the chemical shift of the two exchanging resonances and on established biochemical data (Fig. 5) (37Kruger N.J. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Lefebvre D.D. Layzell D.B. Plant Metabolism. Longman, Harlow, England1997: 83-104Google Scholar, 38Dennis D.T. Huang Y. Negm F.B. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Lefebvre D.D. Layzell D.B. Plant Metabolism.

In this way, we were able to assign the following chemical exchange processes and related enzymatic activities.Figure 5Cytosolic pathways of carbohydrate metabolism in heterotrophic higher plant cells. This network applies specially to the case of glucose-fed excised maize root tips at 21 °C under hypoxia. Neither the consumption of hexose phosphates through the pentose phosphate pathway, nor their transport into the plastids, have been indicated. Thick arrow lines indicate the unidirectional reactions detected with31P NMR EXSY. Dark arrowheadsindicate the directions of the net fluxes either directly observed or in accord with the observations made in hypoxic maize root tips. It is suggested that PPi formed by UDPGPP is used by PFP working as a glycolytic enzyme. The enzymes are: inv, invertase;spp, sucrose 6-phosphate phosphatase; sps, sucrose phosphate synthase; ss, sucrose synthase;udpgpp, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; hk, hexokinase; pgm, phosphoglucomutase; hpi, hexose-phosphate isomerase; pfk, phosphofructokinase;pfp, PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase; ald, aldolase; pglm, phosphoglyceromutase; eno, enolase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the phosphorus resonances of the different nucleotide triphosphates (NTP) are not resolvedin vivo, peak A corresponds to phosphorus spins in γ-NTP, which become cytoplasmic inorganic phosphate (PiC) phosphorus spins. This chemical exchange reflects all processes of ATP, or other NTP hydrolysis that release inorganic phosphate into the cytoplasm. Peak B corresponds to the reverse process, the transfer of PiC to γ-NTP. This occurs only during ATP synthesis and, in the presence of oxygen, it essentially reveals the activity of mitochondrial ATP synthase (40Roberts J.K.M. Wemmer D. Jardetzky O. Plant Physiol. 1984; 74: 632-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peaks C and D correlate the diagonal peak of uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPG) β-phosphate with the group of resonances that includes the resonance of cytoplasmic inorganic phosphate (PiC). These resonances are resolved in acid extract spectra and attributed without any ambiguity to inorganic phosphate (Pi), glucose 1-phosphate (Glu-1-P), and myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate). Therefore, the most direct interpretation of cross-peaks C and D is that they arise from the chemical exchanges of phosphorus atoms between UDPG and Glu-1-P. They identify the reactions catalyzed by uridine triphosphate:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, EC 2.7.7.9): Glu-1-P + UTP ↔ UDPG + PPi. A two-step exchange from UDPG to Glu-1-P to PiC to explain peak C is ruled out because the activities of cytosolic hexose-phosphate phosphatases in this material cannot account for such an intense cross-peak. Furthermore, precise measurements of the positions of cross-peaks A and C show clearly a difference in their abscissa. This had also been demonstrated previously, using frequency dependent saturation transfer (41Roberts J.K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cross-peaks E and F are attributed to the interconversion between glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) and Glu-1-P, catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2). Cross-peak F cannot be explained by cytosolic glucose 6-phosphate activity for the reasons mentioned above. Peak G arises from the two-step reaction Glu-6-P → Glu-1-P → UDPG, catalyzed by the enzymes responsible for peaks F and D. Note how this two-step exchange is characterized by a much lower intensity than the one-step exchange. The cross-peaks L and"

Three consecutive peptides with a common 5-mer sequence YHNGA were competitive inhibitors of congopain. A shorter synthetic peptide consisting of this 5-mer sequence flanked by two Ala residues (AYHNGAA) also inhibited purified congopain. No residue critical for inhibition was identified in this sequence, but a significant improvement in K i value was obtained upon N-terminal elongation. Procongopain-derived peptides did not inhibit lysosomal cathepsins B and L but did inhibit native cruzipain (from Dm28c clone epimastigotes), the major cysteine proteinase of Trypanosoma cruzi, the proregion of which also contains the sequence YHNGA. The positioning of the YHNGA inhibitory sequence within the prosegment of trypanosomal proteinases is similar to that covering the active site in the prosegment of cysteine proteinases, the three-dimensional structure of which has been resolved. This strongly suggests that trypanosomal proteinases, despite their long C-terminal extension, have a prosegment that folds similarly to that in related mammal and plant cysteine proteinases, resulting in reverse binding within the active site. Such reverse binding could also occur for short procongopain-derived inhibitory peptides, based on their resistance to proteolysis and their ability to retain inhibitory activity after prolonged incubation. In contrast, homologous peptides in related cysteine proteinases did not inhibit trypanosomal proteinases and were rapidly cleaved by these enzymes.

Cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily have very similar sequences and a common catalytic mechanism; they are found in bacteria, protozoa, plants, and mammals (1Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 2Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These enzymes play a critical role in the life cycle of protozoan parasites, in host invasion and alteration of the host immune response (3North M.J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 270-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4Authié E. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 360-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Parasite cysteine proteinases from the genus Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, have been reported as putative targets for chemotherapeutic inhibitors (5McKerrow J.H. McGrath M.E. Engel J.C. Parasitol.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The main drawback of this strategy is that cysteine proteinases have a broad substrate specificity, which makes it difficult to develop inhibitors that target individual proteinases. Congopain is a cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinase of Trypanosoma congolense, and cruzipain is the equivalent fromTrypanosoma cruzi. These protozoan parasites cause bovine trypanosomiase in Africa and Chagas disease in South America respectively (3North M.J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Parasitol.

Cruzipain (also called cruzain) is a highly mannosylated glycoprotein and an immunodominant antigen (GP57/51) that is among the best characterized of parasitic cysteine proteinases (7Scharfstein J.

The three-dimensional structure of its recombinant central catalytic domain (215 residues) is very similar to those of papain and cathepsin L (11Gillmor S.A. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J.

Biol. 1995; 247: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Congopain differs only slightly from cruzipain in its enzymatic specificity due to the presence of a Leu instead of Glu at position 205 (papain numbering) in the S2 subsite (13Mbawa Z.R. Gumm I.D. Shaw E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Chagas J. Authié E. Serveau C. Lalmanach G. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian cathepsins B, H, L, S, and K, and falcipain, the related hemoglobin-degrading cysteine proteinase of Plasmodium falciparum (15Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Banerjee D. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which is also a putative target for antimalarial therapy, cruzipain and congopain have a long C-terminal extension that is linked to the catalytic domain by a repeated sequence (poly(Thr) in cruzipain, poly(Pro) in congopain) whose function is unclear (16Åslund L. Henriksson J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C.C. Pettersson U. Cazzulo J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Like mammalian cysteine proteinases, parasite proteinases are synthetized as zymogens that are converted to the mature form by proteolytic cleavage and the release of the proregion. The propeptide of mammalian and vegetal cysteine proteinases takes part in the proper folding, intracellular trafficking, or secretion of the mature proteinase, and in the control of proteolytic activity by blocking the active site (17Tao K. Stears N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.-I. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Kopitar G. Dolinar M. Strukelj B. Pungercar J. Turk V. Eur. J.

Isolated propeptides may still bind and inhibit their mature enzyme even when released from the proenzyme (20Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C.

The recent x-ray elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of procaricain and procathepsins B and L has provided evidence that the prosegments inhibit papain-like proteinases in a similar fashion, although they differ slightly in length, fold, and sequence (22Groves M.R.

One is a prosegment binding loop involving mainly aromatic side chains in hydrophobic interactions, and the other is along the substrate binding cleft but in the opposite direction to that of the substrate. The relative contribution of each region of cathepsin L propeptide to binding to mature enzyme has been measured by successive truncations of the recombinant propeptide (25Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 26Carmona E. Dufour É. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We have used a different approach, based on the construction of synthetic peptides overlapping the sequence of the prosegment of cathepsin B, to identify the critical residues interacting with the active site of the mature enzyme (27Chagas J.R. Ferrer-Di Martino M. Gauthier F. Lalmanach G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). But the primary sequences of the proregion of parasite cysteine proteinases differ significantly from those of their mammalian and plant homologues, raising the question of whether the proteolytic activity of parasite proteinases is similarly regulated by their proregion. In addition, we do not know whether the presence of a C-terminal extension in trypanosomal cathepsin L-like proteinases modifies the overall folding of the proenzyme, leading to a different interaction of the prosegment with the catalytic site. A series of overlapping peptides spanning the proregion of congopain was synthetized and used to investigate their ability to inhibit the mature enzyme and thus identify residues specifically interacting with the active site. Any such sequence within the prosegment of parasite cysteine proteinases could be used to develop new compounds for the diagnosis or chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis. l-3-Carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane (E-64) and dl-dithiothreitol (DTT)1 were purchased from Sigma. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-AMC was from Bachem Biochimie (Voisins-Le-Bretonneux, France). Unless otherwise stated, amino acids were all of the l configuration. Peptides Pcp1-Pcp23 and peptides Pcp28-Pcp31 and Pcp34 were prepared as peptidyl amides by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (multisynthesizer Shimadzu PSSM-8) (28Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach..in: Rickwood D. Hames B.D. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Peptide homogeneity was checked by reverse-phase chromatography on a Brownlee C18 OD 300 column using a 30-min linear (0–60%) acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was monitored by an Applied Biosystems 1000S diode array detector (Perkin-Elmer). Peptides Pcp24-Pcp27 and Pcp32-Pcp33 were synthetized by Fmoc chemistry (ABI 431A synthesizer, Perkin- Elmer) using a Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem). Peptides Pcp24, Pcp25, Pcp26, and Pcp27 were deprotected and cleaved, then purified by semipreparative reverse phase chromatography (Aquapore octyl 20-μm, Brownlee-Perkin-Elmer) column using a 45-min linear (0–90%) acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide Pcp32 was purified by reverse phase-HPLC using a 20-min linear (0–60%) acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (μBondapak C18 column, Vydac). Peptide Pcp33 was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 5% acetic acid. Peptides Pcp24, Pcp25, Pcp26, Pcp27, Pcp32, and Pcp33 were analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC (Brownlee C18 OD 300 column) as indicated above. Finally, peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (Brüker), and the experimental data were compared with calculated molecular weights (Enzfitter software, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The results are: Pcp 25, M rcalculated = 1947.3, found = 1947.9; Pcp 26:M r calculated = 2507.0, found = 2508.1; Pcp 27, M r calculated 3848.6,M r found 3847.6; Pcp 32,M r calculated 2002.5, found 2006.3; Pcp 33,M r calculcated = 2191.5, found = 2192.7. The composition of Pcp24 was checked by amino acids analysis (Applied Biosystems 420A analyzer). The procathepsin B-derived peptide PB8 was synthetized as previously reported (27Chagas J.R. Ferrer-Di Martino M. Gauthier F. Lalmanach G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The peptide HIV1-V3-13 is derived from the V3 loop of Gp120 (29Plantier J.C. Le Pogam S. Poisson F. Buzelay L. Lejeune B. Barin F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the 17-mer peptide Pcp25 (40 μm) and 34-mer peptide Pcp27 (20 μm) were measured at room temperature (25 °C) over 280–200 nm using a Jobin-Yvon Mark IV discometer. The 29-mer peptide HIV1-V3-13 (26 μm) was used as a control (29Plantier J.C. Le Pogam S. Poisson F. Buzelay L. Lejeune B. Barin F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The path length of the cell was 1 mm, and data from repeated scans were averaged. Experiments were made in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, or in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 50% TFE (v/v). Prediction of the secondary structure of the three peptides was performed by the Chou and Fasman method, running the MacPromass software (Beckman Research Institute). Congopain from T. congolense was purified as reported by Authié et al. (30Authié E. Muteti D.K. Mbawa Z.R. Lonsdale-Eccles J. Webster P. Wells C.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cruzipain was purified from Dm28c clone epimastigotes of T. cruzi according to Lima et al. (31Lima A.P.C.A. Scharfstein J. Storer A.C. Ménard R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The recombinant catalytic domain of cruzipain was a gift from Dr. James McKerrow (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Cathepsins B and L were purified from rat liver (32Moreau T. Gutman N. El Moujahed A. Esnard F. Gauthier F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The activation buffers for enzyme assays were 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 6 mm DTT and 2 mm EDTA for congopain, and 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10 mmDTT for cruzipain, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT for cathepsins B and L. Titration of the active site was made using E64 (33Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The activities of trypanosomal enzymes were measured with acetyl-Phe-Arg-AMC. K m values were determined from Hanes linear plot (triplicate experiments). The activities of mammalian cathepsins were recorded with benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-AMC (32Moreau T. Gutman N. El Moujahed A. Esnard F. Gauthier F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteinases were activated for 5 min at 37 °C in their respective assay buffer before kinetic measurements (using a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter, with excitation and emission wavelenghts of 350 and 460 nm). Peptides Pcp1-Pcp23 were first screened for their capacity to inhibit congopain by microfluorimetry (Dynatech microreader). Congopain (3.3 nm) was incubated with peptide (10 and 100 μm) in the activating buffer at 37 °C for 5 min (final volume in the microfluor plate = 100 μl), and the enzymatic reaction was triggered by adding acetyl-Phe-Arg-AMC (10 μm); the residual enzymatic activity was recorded. The inhibitory constants (K i) were determined (triplicate experiments) for all the peptides that showed significant inhibition under the above conditions. Congopain (3.3 nm) was incubated with inhibitory peptides for 5 min at 37 °C before adding substrate (1–10 μm). The K iwere calculated by plotting 1/v against [I]. TheK i of peptides Pcp25, Pcp26, Pcp27, and Pcp33 toward cruzipain Dm28c (3.3 nm) and the recombinant catalytic domain of cruzipain (1 nm) were determined under the same experimental conditions, and their abilities to interact with cathepsin B (4 nm) and cathepsin L (4 nm) were measured using benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-AMC (10 μm) as substrate. A mixture of peptide Pcp25 (60 μm) and parasite proteinase (congopain/cruzipain (3.3 nm)) was incubated in the activation buffer at 37 °C for 0 to 5 h. At various times, two aliquots were removed, one for measuring the residual enzymatic activity by spectrofluorimetry after adding acetyl-Phe-Arg-AMC (10 μm), and the other was mixed with E64 (10 μm) to inactivate the enzyme. This sample was chromatographed by reverse phase-HPLC on a C18 OD 300 Brownlee column using a linear 0–60% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution profiles were analyzed by the software Spectacle (ThermoQuest, les Ulis), and cleavage sites were located by N-terminal sequencing (ABI 477A sequencer, Perkin-Elmer). The same experiments were done with peptides Pcp24, Pcp26, Pcp27, and Pcp33, the procathepsin B-derived peptide PB8 (60 μm), and the profalcipain-derived peptide Pcp34 (60 μm). Cathepsin L (4 nm) was incubated for 5 min to 1 h with peptide Pcp25 (60 μm) at 37 °C in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT. The reaction was stopped by adding E64 (10 μm), and proteolysis products were fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography, as described above. A critical segment that inhibits the catalytic domain of mature rat cathepsin B was previously identified using overlapping peptides spanning the whole proregion (27Chagas J.R. Ferrer-Di Martino M. Gauthier F. Lalmanach G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The almost simultaneous elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of human and rat procathepsin B has shown that this segment lies close to essential residues within the active site cleft (23Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We looked to see if this could occur for trypanosomal cysteine proteinases using 15-mer peptidyl amides spanning the whole pre-proregion of congopain. These overlapping peptides (peptides Pcp1-Pcp23), prepared by Fmoc solid-phase multisynthesis, are reported in Table I. They were assayed (final concentration: 0.1 mm) for their ability to inhibit purified congopain using acetyl-Phe-Arg-AMC as substrate (K m = 10 ± 1 μm). Three consecutive peptides Pcp19, Pcp20, and Pcp21 inhibited congopain competitively with K i values of 40, 8, and 60 μm. Peptides Pcp19, Pcp20, and Pcp21 have a common pentapeptide sequence: Tyr74p-His75p-Asn76p-Gly77p-Ala78p (procathepsin L numbering). This short sequence flanked by Ala residues (Pcp24) is also inhibitory, although the K iis higher (K i = 225 μm). Replacements by Ala of single amino acids from position 74p to 77p (peptides Pcp28–31), or substitution of Gly77p by a bulky isoleucyl residue (Pcp32) did not significantly change the K i values (4, 5, 5, 7, and 7 μm, respectively). This would indicate that no single residue of the inhibitory sequence is essential for peptide binding to mature congopain unless detection is impaired by the weakness of the interactions between short peptides and the protease active site. The pentapeptide YHNGA sequence in procongopain is in the same position relative to the C terminus of the procongopain sequence, as are the residues that contact the substrate binding cleft of cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and caricain (Fig. 1) (22Groves M.R. Taylor M. Scott M. Cummings N.J. Pickersgill R.W. Jenkins J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1193-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that they interact similarly and that the structural organization of the prosegment of trypanosomal cathepsin l-like proteinases is comparable with that of related plant and mammalian proteinases. However the primary sequences of these segments are completely different, suggesting that the interaction with the cognate enzyme is specific.Table ISynthetic peptides derived from the proregion of congopainPre-pro region of congopain: MPRSEMTRTL RFSVGLLAVA ACFVPVALGV LHAEQSLQQQ FAAFKQKYSR SYKDATEEAF RFRVFKQNME RAKEEAAANP YATFGVTRFS DMSPEEFRAT YHNGAEYYAA ALKRPRKVVN VSTGKPcp1 → Pcp14Pcp15 RAKEEAAANPYATFGPcp16 AAANPYATFGVTRFSPcp17 YATFGVTRFSDMSPEPcp18 VTRFSDMSPEEFRATPcp19 DMSPEEFRATYHNGAPcp20 EFRATYHNGAEYYAAPcp21 YHNGAEYYAAALKRPPcp22 EYYAAALKRPRKVVNPcp23 ALKRPRKVVNVSTGKPcp24 AYHNGAAPcp25 EFRATYHNGAEYYAAALPcp26 DMSPEEFRATYHNGAEYYAAALPcp27 NPYATFGVTRFSDMSPEEFRATYHNGAEYYAAALPcp28 EFRATAHNGAEYYAAALPcp29 EFRATYANGAEYYAAALPcp30 EFRATYHAGAEYYAAALPcp31 EFRATYHNAAEYYAAALPcp32 EFRATYHNIAEYYAAALPcp33 EEFRSRYHNGAAAHFAAAEEPcp34 ELKEYFKTLLHVPNHPB8 SYLKKLCGTVLGGPKAll peptides have been synthetized as peptidyl amides.

The three-dimensional structure of procathepsin L indicates that additional residues take part in the interaction of the prosequence with the catalytic domain. This is the case for residues Phe63p and Phe71p through aromatic interactions in the vicinity of the active site and for residue Phe56p, which contribute to the stabilization of the prosegment via interactions with two tyrosyl residues of an aromatic cluster of the protein binding loop (Tyr-146 and Tyr-151) (25Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Because these aromatic residues are also present in procongopain, their contribution to congopain binding was investigated using longer peptides derived from peptide Pcp20 (Table I). The inhibitory activity of peptide Pcp27, which includes both the YHNGA sequence and the aromatic amino acids reported above, was assayed toward congopain to investigate the effect of the 17-residue N-terminal extension. This extension significantly enhanced the binding to the mature enzyme (Student's t test; p < 0.01) (Table II). The aromatic residues Phe63p and Phe56p, which tightly contact cathepsin L via its protein binding loop, may provide a secondary anchoring site for congopain/Pcp27 interaction, thus stabilizing the complex. But peptides Pcp25 and Pcp26 inhibited congopain similarly to peptide Pcp20. Coulombe et al. (25Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) have shown that residues 68p-75p in procathepsin L form a two-turn α-helix (α3p helix) (Fig. 1). A Chou and Fasman analysis of the secondary structure of the congopain proregion predicted that a similar arrangement could occur (Fig. 1). Accordingly, the CD spectra of the N-terminal-extended peptide Pcp27 (residues 51p-85p) showed a partial α-helical conformation that was amplified by the presence of TFE (34Lazo N.D. Downing D.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This was not the case for the shorter peptide Pcp25 (Fig. 2) and for HIV1-V3–13 (29Plantier J.C. Le Pogam S. Poisson F. Buzelay L. Lejeune B. Barin F. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 677-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), used as a control peptide of similar length, that did not show any α-helical structure, even in 50% TFE (v/v) (data not shown).Table IIInhibition constants of T. congolense and T. cruzi cysteine proteinases by their proregion-related peptidesPeptidesK iCongopainCruzipainRecombinant cruzainCathepsin BCathepsin LμmPcp255.9 ± 0.312 ± 1.24.9 ± 0.1nsinsiPcp266.9 ± 0.210.4 ± 0.69.4 ± 0.8nsinsiPcp272 ± 0.54 ± 0.22 ± 0.4nsinsiPcp335.9 ± 0.228.5 ± 1.17.5 ± 0.2nsinsiPB8hydr.hydr.hydr.4.6nsiK i values were expressed as the mean ± S.E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of papain-related proenzymes shows that this part of the prosegment, which is in close contact with the active-site cleft, is positioned in a reverse direction to that of a substrate, which probably makes it more resistant to proteolysis (24Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). But whether short synthetic peptides derived from the prosequence of cysteine proteinases also obey this reverse binding mode is not known. Measurements of their resistance to proteolysis would suggest an orientation similar to that of the whole prosegment, all the more that peptides contain a Phe-Arg dipeptide, which is one of the preferred pairs of residues accomodated at S2 and S1 subsites in papain-like cysteine proteinases (35Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Procongopain-derived peptides (60 μm) were incubated with congopain (3.3 nm) for 0–5 h at 37 °C, and the mixtures were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and by measuring their inhibitory potential. Peptide Pcp24 (AYHNGAA) was completely resistant to proteolysis by congopain as shown by reverse phase-HPLC and retained its full inhibitory capacity after incubation for 5 h. Longer peptides containing the Phe-Arg pair (Pcp25–27, Pcp28–31) also inhibited congopain after incubation for 5 h. But N-terminal sequencing revealed some cleavage after the Phe-Arg pair. This hydrolysis, however, was much slower than that of peptides derived from procathepsin B (peptide PB8) and profalcipain (Pcp34) from P. falciparum, which did not inhibit mature congopain, and were totally degraded by congopain in less than 30 min under the same experimental conditions. Such a rapid cleavage was also observed reacting procongopain-derived peptide Pcp25 with cathepsin L. This supports the hypothesis that peptides Pcp25–27 and Pcp28–31 bind to congopain in a reverse binding mode, leading to enzyme inhibition and conferring resistance to proteolysis but that there may be some minor, substrate-like binding, leading to slow proteolysis. By contrast, the unrelated peptides PB8 and Pcp34 bind to congopain as substrates, as does procongopain-derived peptide Pcp25 when interacting with cathepsin L. The active-site-interacting sequences of the proregions of papain-like proteinases from plants, mammals, and parasites differ significantly. However, the procongopain Y74pHNGA78p sequence (procathepsin L numbering) is a consensus sequence in the propeptides of trypanosomal cysteine proteinases (Fig. 3). This suggests that YHNGA-containing peptides can specifically inhibit cysteine proteinases from other trypanosomal species but not mammalian lysosomal cathepsins. We checked this by measuring the activities of the procongopain-derived peptides Pcp25 to Pcp27 toward cruzipain, the homologous cysteine proteinase of T.cruzi (13Mbawa Z.R. Gumm I.D. Shaw E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Chagas J. Authié E. Serveau C. Lalmanach G. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and cathepsins B and L. The corresponding YHNGA-containing peptide from the cruzipain prosegment (peptide Pcp33) was also synthesized and assayed with congopain. None of the procongopain-derived peptides altered the enzymatic activity of mammalian cathepsins B or L, but peptides Pcp25, Pcp26, and Pcp 27 all inhibited cruzipain Dm28c, acting as competitive inhibitors with theK i comparable with those reported for congopain (Table II). A recombinant form of cruzipain (also called cruzain) corresponding to the catalytic domain, which therefore lacks the C-terminal extension (12McGrath M.E. Eakin A.E. Engel J.C. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was inhibited as well as the full-length cruzipain Dm28c by Pcp25, Pcp26, and Pcp27. Therefore, the C-terminal extension does not impair the catalytic activity of cruzipain, suggesting that the C-terminal domain is not in the vicinity of the active site of cruzipain. As expected, the procruzipain-derived peptide Pcp33 inhibited cruzipain Dm28c, recombinant cruzain, and congopain, with K i values in the same range as those for Pcp25, Pcp26, and Pcp27 (Table II), but it did not affect the enzymatic activity of cathepsins B and L. Peptide Pcp33 was also fully inhibitory after incubation with cruzipain for 5 h. The almost identical positioning of the inhibitory sequences in the prosequences of congopain and cruzipain with those in mammal and plant cysteine proteinases whose three-dimensional structures are known suggests that the prosegments of the trypanosomal enzymes are folded similarly despite the presence of a C-terminal extension. Although proregion-derived peptides can specifically interact with their cognate enzyme, the K i values are too high to make these peptides efficient inhibitors. Nevertheless these values compare with those found for procathepsin-B-derived peptides (27Chagas J.R. Ferrer-Di Martino M. Gauthier F. Lalmanach G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Chen Y.M. Plouffe C. Ménard R. Storer A.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data have shown that this part of the proregion, which is flexible and fits into the active site of the catalytic domain, contributes weakly to the overall binding energy of interaction between the enzyme and the propeptide (25Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Experiments carried out with recombinant truncated proregions of cathepsin L have demonstrated that the two N-terminal α-helices (α1p and α2p) are essential for propeptide binding and contribute greatly to stability (25Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 26Carmona E. Dufour É. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The short α3p helix (residues 68p-75p), which is close to the active-site-interacting sequence, also helps anchor the residues dipping into the substrate binding site. This could explain why peptide Pcp27 from procongopain, which has a partial α-helical structure, unlike the related inhibitory peptide Pcp25, is also a slightly better inhibitor. The sequence YHNGA represents a promising new feature that may contribute to the design of proteinase-directed antiparasitic drugs of therapeutic interest. We thank Dr. M.

In order to pass the ER quality control system and become transported to their final destinations, many of them are also assembled into oligomers. We have recently determined the three-dimensional structure of lysosomal aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA), which belongs to a newly discovered family of homologous amidohydrolases, the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases. Members of this protein family are activated from an inactive precursor molecule by an autocatalytic proteolytic processing event whose exact mechanism has not been thoroughly determined. Here we have characterized in more detail the initial events in the ER required for the formation of active AGA enzyme using transient expression of polypeptides carrying targeted amino acid substitutions. We show that His124 at an interface between two heterodimers of AGA is crucial for the thermodynamically stable oligomeric structure of AGA. Furthermore, the side chain of Thr206 is essential both for the proteolytic activation and enzymatic activity of AGA. Finally, the proper geometry of the residues His204–Asp205 seems to be crucial for the activation of AGA precursor polypeptides.

N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase aspartylglucosaminidase castanospermine endoplasmic reticulum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type. N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases (Ntn hydrolases)1 form a novel class of hydrolytic enzymes. They are activated from an enzymatically inactive precursor polypeptide by a proteolytic processing step in which one peptide bond is hydrolyzed, creating a new N-terminal residue. Several prokaryotic amidohydrolases belonging to the Ntn hydrolases have been described with very different substrate specificities and functions (1Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.

Littlechild J.A. Teplyakov A. Structure. 1996; 4: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) all have a similar central four-layer sandwich of α-helices and β-sheets (αββα) as a catalytic domain and an N-terminal nucleophile responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of an amide bond. The Ntn hydrolases display distinct structural similarity to human aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA), the structure of which we have recently determined to 2.0-Å resolution (6Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The N-terminal residue, which is exposed upon the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor polypeptide, has been shown to be essential for the enzymatic activity in the Ntn hydrolases. This residue is threonine in AGA and proteasome β-subunit, serine in penicillin acylase, and cysteine in glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase and glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase. All of these residues can function as a catalytic nucleophile and are located at the beginning of a β-strand. In the case of AGA and penicillin acylase activation, the precursor polypeptide chain is cleaved into two polypeptide subunits of the active protein, whereas in proteasome and glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, the activation results in the removal of a propeptide. Recently, a number of studies have suggested that the breaking of this critical peptide bond occurs autocatalytically (7Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol.

Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen R. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2954-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although there is no sequence similarity within the Ntn hydrolase family, all of the above mentioned amidohydrolases utilize a similar core structure for the amide bond hydrolysis in highly heterogenous substrates (6Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is therefore probable that the autocatalytic activation mechanism would be similar among different Ntn hydrolases, although comparative studies are still missing. The only mammalian Ntn hydrolase whose crystallographic structure is known, aspartylglucosaminidase (glycosylasparaginase,N 4-(β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl)-l-asparaginase; EC 3.5.1.26), is a lysosomal amidohydrolase that cleaves asparagine from the oligosaccharide as one of the final steps in the breakdown of glycoproteins (12Makino M. Kojima T. Ohgushi T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 63: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). AGA is activated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from a single chain precursor by a cleavage that creates the 27-kDa pro-α- and 17-kDa β-subunits and exposes the active site N-terminal threonine in the beginning of the β-subunit (13Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The active enzyme is a heterotetramer consisting of two α- and two β-subunits, and we have earlier suggested that dimerization of two precursor polypeptides actually precedes the proteolytic activation step (14Riikonen A. Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21340-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The maturation of AGA is completed in lysosomes where a small peptide is cleaved from the C terminus of both subunits (Fig. 1). The intracellular events allow easy monitoring for the lysosomal entry of the AGA polypeptides. AGA is transported into lysosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway, which is based on the recognition of the mannose 6-phosphate marker in the oligosaccharide chains of soluble lysosomal hydrolases by a specific receptor in the Golgi and consequent transport of the complex into a prelysosomal compartment. The mannose 6-phosphate marker is generated by a Golgi-resident enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase, which recognizes lysosomal enzymes on the basis of a three-dimensional determinant in the protein. The phosphotransferase recognizes several distinct regions of native AGA that are located far apart at the surface of the molecule, and the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharides of AGA requires correct spatial position of these lysine-containing structures (15Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in the human AGA gene lead to aspartylglucosaminuria (16Ikonen E. Baumann M. Gron K. Syvänen A.C. Enomaa N. Halila R. Aula P. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The majority of the mutations produce either a truncated polypeptide or cause defective folding and phosphorylation of the polypeptides (17Peltola M. Tikkanen R. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This study was designed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the initial events upon the formation of the catalytically active AGA enzyme in the ER. By using site-directed mutagenesis we wanted to 1) characterize the dimerization of AGA and 2) define the amino acid residues critical for the autocatalytic activation mechanism itself. The amino acid sequences were retrieved using the Sequence Retrieval System at EMBL, and the program Gene-Works was used for sequence alignment. The AGA activity assay is based on colorimetric measurement of liberated N-acetylglucosamine and was performed as described earlier (17Peltola M. Tikkanen R. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed with the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as suggested by the manufacturer. As a template, we used the full-length coding region of AGA cDNA (18Ikonen E. Enomaa N. Ulmanen I. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1991; 11: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) cloned into theBamHI site of mammalian expression vector SVpoly containing the SV40 early promoter. After mutagenesis, the insert was sequenced to exclude the possibility of unwanted mutations. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed with the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described by Luthman and Magnusson (19Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The cells were metabolically labeled or analyzed for AGA activity 72 h after transfection. Labeling with [35S]Cys (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described earlier (18Ikonen E. Enomaa N. Ulmanen I. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1991; 11: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were labeled 1 h followed by a 1–24-h chase. Labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out for 2.5 h with 300 μCi of [32P]Pi/ml, which was followed by a 3-h chase. For chaperone analysis, 1 mm castanospermine (CST; Boehringer Mannheim) was used in the culture medium 2 h before and during the labeling and chase periods. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Immunoprecipitin, Life Technologies, Inc.; Pansorbin, Calbiochem) or protein A -Sepharose (Sigma) as described previously (20Proia R.L. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3350-3354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using AGA-specific polyclonal antibody against the native enzyme (21Halila R. Baumann M. Ikonen E. Enomaa N. Peltonen L. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The labeled polypeptides were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) digestion was performed as described previously (23Tikkanen R. Enomaa N. Riikonen A. Ikonen E. Peltonen L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For gel filtration experiments of in vitro expressed AGA polypeptides, 2.5 × 106COS-1 cells were plated on a 10-cm cell culture dish and transfected with 20 μg of cDNA construct using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method. The cells were labeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]Cys for 1 h, chased for 3–6 h, and harvested with trypsinization. For mutant clones having a low expression level, two parallel transfections and labelings were performed at each experiment. The medium collected from the cells was concentrated to 150 μl with Centrex UF-2 30-kDa microconcentrators (Schleicher & Schuell). Gel filtration on a Superdex 75 (10/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described by Riikonen et al. (14Riikonen A. Rouvinen J. Tikkanen R. Julkunen I. Peltonen L. Jalanko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21340-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). AGA polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from the collected fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The amino acid sequences of glycoasparaginases and asparaginases were aligned (Fig. 2). Based on the information of the three-dimensional structure of human aspartylglucosaminidase, we analyzed the conservation of the active site, lysosomal targeting, and glycosylation residues among nine species. The important residues, regarding the AGA enzyme activity, are conserved from bacteria to mammals. This alignment reveals only 10% overall sequence identity (33 residues), while the catalytic Thr206 is absolutely conserved. Based on the alignment, we observed that there were two clusters in the three-dimensional structure of the native human AGA in which amino acids show high conservation (Fig. 3, B and C). One of these regions is located on the interface between the two αβ dimers, and another is located on the active site area, suggesting functionally essential roles for these areas of the molecule. These regions were selected as targets to in vitro mutagenesis followed by functional analysis of polypeptides coded by the mutagenized cDNAs.Figure 3The conserved amino acid residues of AGA. The alignment was constructed using reported glycoasparaginase and asparaginase amino acid sequences. The conserved amino acid residues are shown in white. A, the AGA molecule, consisting of two identical αβ heterodimers (dimers are drawn in light green and yellow); conserved amino acid residues are drawn in one dimer. B, enlargement of an αβ heterodimer. C, the conserved amino acids represented in Fig. 3 B are located in two regions, which are depicted with ovals. The a region contains the active site residues of AGA. The b region contains residues on the packing interface between the two αβ dimers. Only five residues lie outside these two regions.

The mutant plasmids were transfected into mammalian COS-1 cells, and the expressed polypeptides were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys and/or [32P]Pi. The labeled polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antiserum raised against native AGA and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the results were verified with analysis of total AGA protein by Western blotting. In addition, all mutant polypeptides were metabolically labeled with [35S]Cys and chased for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h to monitor their intracellular processing and lysosomal targeting (data not shown). To analyze the dimerization event, the cell culture medium was gel-filtrated, and fractions corresponding to the molecular masses of labeled polypeptides between 125 and 20 kDa were collected and immunoprecipitated. The numeric values of expression level, secretion, and activity (activity being corrected with the expression level) were measured for each mutant (Tables I and II).Table ISummary of analyzed substitutions: the substitutions of His and Thr located at the interface between the two αβ dimers of AGAClonePolypeptides in the cells (c) and medium (m)Expression levelSecretionActivity in the cellsDimerization of the precursor polypeptidePrecPro-ααββ′% WT% total% WTWTc,mc,mcc,mc10046 ± 7100DimerCOSBG30 ± 3BGNDH124Sc,mc,mcc,mc211 ± 1139 ± 243DimerH124Rm7 ± 1100PFDimer + monomerH124Wm7 ± 1100PFDimer + monomerT125Ac,mc,mcc,mc120 ± 544 ± 168DimerT125Yc,mc,mcc,mc33 ± 529 ± 775DimerT125Cc,mc,mcc,mc148 ± 1051 ± 470DimerThe effect of selected amino acid substitutions on the processing of [35S]Cys-labeled AGA polypeptides was determined by analyzing the samples by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.

We focused the production of amino acid substitutions on two molecular regions: 1) the dimer interface and 2) the autocatalytic processing site (Fig. 4). The dimer interface of AGA is a relatively wide area containing a number of hydrophobic residues. In the three-dimensional structure, the interface is quite flat except for one clear protrusion of a loop in one αβ dimer that penetrates into the other αβ dimer of the native enzyme. In this loop region, His124 is completely conserved and Thr125 is conserved in mammals. Arginine and tryptophan substitutions were produced for His124, and alanine, tyrosine, and cysteine substitutions were produced for Thr125. In addition, the H124S construct previously cloned into the pCD-X expression vector was analyzed (13Ikonen E. Julkunen I. Tollersrud O-K. Kalkkinen N. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As a general practice, the replacing residues were chosen to be of equal size or smaller than the original residue so that the packing of the molecule should not be disturbed. This practice was not followed with H124R, H124W, and T125Y replacements in which we introduced a bulkier side chain in order to study whether a residue occupying more space affects the dimerization of precursor polypeptides. Two substitutions were found to affect the dimerization of AGA, namely H124R and H124W. In the case of H124R and H124W mutants (shown for H124R, Fig. 5), the original amino acid side chain is replaced by a larger one. Due to a processing failure, these mutants produced only the nonprocessed precursor polypeptide, which was secreted to the culture medium, and thus no enzyme activity beyond the background level was detected. Both of these substitutions affected the dimerization of the precursor molecules, and both dimeric and monomeric precursor could be observed after gel filtration (shown for H124R, Fig. 6). H124R- and H124W-transfected cells produced only precursor polypeptides into the culture medium, indicating that the processing was completely prevented. However, when labeled with [35S]Cys and [32P]Pi, the oligosaccharides of mutant precursors were found to be normally phosphorylated (Fig. 7). This would suggest that these substitutions do not result in severe misfolding of AGA in the ER, since only correct positioning of the three phosphotransferase recognition regions results in the phosphorylation of the oligosaccharides of AGA (15Tikkanen R. Peltola M. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6684-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since no polypeptides could be detected intracellularly in metabolic labeling experiments, immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing H124R and H124W mutants was performed. This analysis revealed retention of AGA polypeptides in the Golgi and ER, which were intensively immunostained. Western blotting using antibodies against denatured subunits of AGA further demonstrated that a small quantity of degradation products existed intracellularly, suggesting slight instability of the AGA polypeptides carrying these substitutions. However, when His124 was replaced with serine, which has a small side chain compared with histidine, arginine, and tryptophan, the dimerization or activation of the precursor polypeptides was not affected (Fig. 5).Figure 6SDS-PAGE analysis of the gel-filtrated AGA polypeptides. [35S]Cys-labeled secreted polypeptides were concentrated from the medium and gel-filtrated with a Superdex 75 column. Fractions corresponding to polypeptides with molecular weights between 125 and 20 kDa were collected and immunoprecipitated using antibodies against native AGA.

Polypeptides were analyzed as described in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) T125Y mutant produced polypeptides comparable with the WT (Fig. 5), but the expression levels were only 33% of the WT as determined by scanning of autoradiographs (Table I). The low expression level was not a result of low transfection efficiency as confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of T125Y-transfected cells (data not shown). In addition, Western blotting using antibodies against the denatured subunits of AGA demonstrated that WT levels of subunits existed intracellularly and that large quantities of the precursor polypeptide were secreted. T125Y substitution did not affect the dimerization of precursor molecules. The construct carrying the T125C substitution was expressed efficiently (Table I), and the mutant produced polypeptides with slightly higher electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE in addition to the normal pro-α- and α-subunits (Fig. 5). Endoglycosidase H digestion showed that this was not due to differences in glycosylation (data not shown). The β-subunit was expressed in two different glycosylation forms, corresponding to the sizes of the WT β-subunit, and the difference in electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE disappeared after the cleavage of oligosaccharides by endoglycosidase H digestion. This would suggest that partial misprocessing of the precursor polypeptide caused the existence of the extra α polypeptides. T125C substitution did not affect the dimerization of precursor molecules. Moreover, T125A substitution introduced an amino acid with a smaller side chain incapable of hydrogen bonding and was found to affect neither the processing nor the dimerization of AGA precursor polypeptides. During the autocatalytic activation of AGA, the peptide bond between Asp205 and Thr206 is cleaved. At this site, we mutagenized three residues: His204 and Asp205before the cleavage site and Thr206 immediately a"

We used Glut1 as a model multispanning membrane protein to test the Charge Difference Hypothesis (Hartmann, E., Rapoport, T. A., and Lodish, H. F. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 5786–5790), which asserts that the topology of a eucaryotic multispanning membrane protein is determined solely by the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment. The charge difference across the first transmembrane segment of Glut1 was progressively inverted in two independent series of mutants, one series in which only the number of positively charged amino acid residues in the two flanking domains was altered and the other in which only the number of negatively charged residues in the two flanking domains was changed. The results indicate that the charge difference across the first transmembrane segment does affect the topology of the protein, but that contrary to the hypothesis, it only dictates the orientation of the first transmembrane segment and the disposition of the amino terminus and the first linker domain. Charge inversion resulted in the formation of aberrant molecules in which either the first or second transmembrane segment failed to insert into the membrane. The topology of downstream regions of Glut1 was unaffected by charge inversion across the first transmembrane segment, indicating that downstream sequences are important in determining the local topological disposition of the molecule.

The structural determinants for the membrane topology of bitopic and polytopic proteins expressed in Escherichia coli have been systematically and comprehensively explored by von Heijne (1von Heijne G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2von Heijne G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3von Heijne G. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 22: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The topological assembly of membrane proteins is exceedingly complex and is influenced by a number of factors. However, the primary determinant of sec-dependent membrane protein topology in E. coli appears to be the distribution of positively charged amino acid side chains, with the positive charges apparently acting to prevent translocation of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments as well as the connecting loops of bitopic or polytopic proteins. This “positive-inside” rule is at least in part explainable by the negative-inside electrical charge across the E. colicytoplasmic membrane. In contrast, less is known about the topological determinants of eucaryotic membrane proteins, especially the more structurally complex multispanning proteins. Statistical analysis of a data base of inferred eucaryotic membrane protein topologies suggested that somewhat different rules may apply to eucaryotic multispanning proteins in comparison with their bacterial counterparts (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 5Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based on their analysis, Hartmann et al. (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) proposed the Charge Difference Hypothesis, wherein the net amino acid electrical charge across the first transmembrane segment of a eucaryotic polytopic membrane protein determined its orientation: a net positive-cytoplasmic charge was proposed to dictate a cytoplasmic disposition for the amino terminus, and a net negative-cytoplasmic charge was proposed to dictate the opposite (extracytoplasmic) disposition. The remaining transmembrane segments were proposed to fold into the membrane in a passive, processive manner, such that downstream structural elements play little if any role in determining the final topology of the protein. Although this hypothesis is at least in part consistent with experimental observations made on an artificially constructed multispanning membrane protein (6Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it has not yet been systematically tested for a single, native, eucaryotic multispanning membrane protein. This is likely due to the fact that, until recently, the detailed topology of very few eucaryotic polytopic proteins had been experimentally established. Although the results of experiments conducted on the yeast Ste2p G protein-coupled receptor (7Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and artificial polytopic membrane proteins (8Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J.

Mirels L.F. Czarnota G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7761-7769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the charge difference across a hydrophobic segment may not be the sole determinant of transmembrane orientation even for these topologically simpler proteins. We have recently (11Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis to verify the 12-transmembrane helix topological model originally proposed for the Glut1 glucose transporter based on a hydrophobicity algorithm (12Mueckler M.

The 12-helix model for Glut1 is also consistent with a number of other experimental observations (13Mueckler M. Hresko R.C. Sato M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Glut1 is the structural prototype for a large family of membrane transporters, all of which are predicted to possess the same 12-helix topology (14Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). We have used Glut1 as a model to systematically investigate the charge difference hypothesis as it applies to a native multispanning membrane protein. We report herein that, consistent with the charge difference hypothesis, the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment is important in determining the disposition of the soluble amino-terminal domain, the first transmembrane segment, and the first exofacial loop. However, in contradiction to the charge difference hypothesis, downstream elements also play an important role in determining the final topology of this native multispanning membrane protein. Human Glut1 cDNA was previously subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pSP64T (15Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 14: 7057-7070Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The aglyco-Glut1 construct (Asn45 mutated to Thr), into which the glycosylated exofacial domain of rat Glut4 was inserted independently into each of the putative hydrophilic soluble domains using engineered KpnI restriction sites, was previously subcloned into either the vector pSP64 or pSP64T and used as a probe for determining the protein topology (11Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the inserted epitope was as follows: GTNAPQKVIEQSYNATWLGRQGPGGPDSIPQGTLTTLWAGT. The epitope contains an N-linked glycosylation site, underlined above, and is flanked by Gly-Thr, the translated amino acid sequence corresponding to the KpnI restriction site. Two positively charged residues and two negatively charged residues shown in bold type were mutated to glycine residues in order to neutralize the charges within the marker sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the CLONTECH Transformer Site Directed Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The sequences of the mutant transporters were verified using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mutant Glut1 mRNAs were synthesized from pSP64 or pSP64T cDNAs linearlized at a unique restriction site in the polylinker using the MEGAscript SP6 In Vitro Transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Manufacturer's conditions were modified by adding 4 mm GpppG and 0.625 mCi/ml [35S]UTPαS1(Amersham) and by reducing the GTP concentration to 1 mm. Ovarian lobes were resected from adult female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) anesthetized with 3-aminobenzonic acid ethyl ester (1 g/liter) in ice-cold water. The lobes were digested with 2 mg/ml Type I collagenase (Worthington) in calcium-free modified Barth's saline (MBS) at room temperature for 2 h. The oocytes were washed six times in MBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and incubated at 4 °C in the same medium until injection. Stage V or IV oocytes were visually selected, injected with 50 nl of mRNA (1 μg/μl), and then incubated at 18 °C for 3 days in the same medium. Intracellular membranes were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described previously (16Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 30 μg of intracellular membranes prepared from oocytes were solubilized in 1% SDS, adjusted to a final concentration of 0.25% SDS, 1.9% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then digested with 0.25 unit of N-glycanase (Genzyme, Boston, MA) overnight at 37 °C. Groups of 15 oocytes were microinjected with the appropriate mutant Glut1 mRNA, incubated at 18 °C for 2 h, and then labeled with 2 mCi/ml Tran35S–label (ICN, Irvine, CA) in MBS at 18 °C for 1 h. The oocytes were extensively washed with MBS supplemented with 5 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 15 mm cold methionine, and 2 mm cysteine, and then intracellular membranes were prepared as described previously (16Garcia J.C.

Membranes were solubilized in 80 μl of 1% SDS and then diluted with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Transporters were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1.25 μg of a monoclonal Glut1 antibody (17Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8668-8675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr. G. E. Lienhard, Darthmouth Medical School) precoupled to 40 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG affinity gel (Cappel, Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA). After washing the resin six times in phosphate-buffered saline, transporters were eluted with 50 μl of 1% SDS. Twenty μl of eluted transporters were digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) at 37 °C for 1 h with the addition of 0.5 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 0.3 milliunit of enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gels were destained and then radiochemically enhanced with 1 msalicylic acid. The charge difference hypothesis states that the membrane topology of a polytopic protein is determined solely by the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The Glut1 glucose transporter conforms to the charge difference rule in that the net amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment is −2.5 (exoplasmic with respect to cytoplasmic) when counting the 15 amino acid residues flanking the first charged residue predicted to lie outside of the membrane. This hypothesis makes at least two predictions that are readily testable by experimental manipulation: 1) inversion of the charge difference across the first transmembrane segment should result in a complete 180° inversion of the membrane topology; 2) the effect of the charge inversion should be independent of whether the number of positively charged residues or negatively charged residues is altered in the two hydrophilic flanking domains. We proceeded to test these two predictions by site-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the human Glut1 glucose transporter, expression of the resulting mutant transporters in a Xenopus oocyte expression system, and determination of the membrane topology usingN-linked glycosylation as a marker for the disposition of specific sites on the protein. The charge difference mutations were initially introduced into either wild-type Glut1, which contains a naturally occurring site of N-linked glycosylation at Asn45 within the first exofacial loop, or a glycosylation-scanning mutant containing the glycosylated exofacial loop of Glut4 inserted into the amino terminus of Glut1 after Lys6 (see Fig. 1). These constructs will be referred to as the first exofacial loop reporter (L1) and the amino terminus reporter (NT), respectively. We demonstrated previously that the Glut4 exofacial loop marker provides the precise pattern of glycosylation predicted by our original 12-helix topological model when a comprehensive series of insertion mutants was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (11Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exofacial loop of Glut4 used as the glycosylation marker was mutated to remove its charged residues so that it acted as a neutral marker with respect to the charge difference across the transmembrane segment. Two series of charge difference mutants were introduced into each of the two Glut1 reporter molecules (see Table I). In the “P” series, the charge difference across the first transmembrane segment was progressively inverted from −2.5 to +2.5 for the first exofacial loop reporter or from −1.5 to +2.5 for the amino terminus reporter by progressively changing positively charged residues to neutral glycine residues in the amino-terminal domain and by changing uncharged residues in the first exofacial loop domain to lysine residues. In the “N” series, the charge difference was inverted by progressively changing negatively charged residues in the first exofacial loop domain to neutral asparagine residues and by changing uncharged residues in the amino-terminal domain to glutamate residues. The charge difference was determined according to the algorithm defined by Hartmann et al. (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), in which only the 15 residues flanking the first charged residue outside of the membrane were included in the calculation. Comparison of the results obtained with the P versus the N series should thus allow an evaluation of the relative importance of flanking positive charges versus flanking negative charges in determining the orientation of a membrane helix.Table IMutations introduced into Glut1 for testing the effect of the charge difference across the first transmembrane helix on the membrane topologyMutant identificationAmino acid changesNet charge differenceLoop 1 reporterNone−2.5P1/L1K6G−1.5P2/L1K6G, K7G−0.5P3/L1K6G, K7G, A35K+0.5P4/L1K6G, K7G, A35K, V39K+1.5P5/L1K6G, K7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N1/L1E41N−1.5N2/L1E41N, E42N−0.5N3/L1E41N, E42N, G10E+0.5N4/L1E41N, E42N, G10E, T9E+1.5N5/L1E41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+2.5Amino terminus reporterNone−1.5P2/NTK7G−0.5P3/NTK7G, A35K+0.5P4/NTK7G, A35K, V39K+1.5P5/NTK7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N2/NTE41N−0.5N3/NTE41N, E42N+0.5N4/NTE41N, E42N, G10E+1.5N5/NTE41N, E42N, G10E, T9E+2.5N6/NTE41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+3.5Loop 2 reporterNone−2.5P5/L2K6G, K7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N5/L2E41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+2.5Loop 3 reporterNone−2.5P5/L3K6G, K7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N5/L3E41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+2.5Loop 6 reporterNone−2.5P5/L6K6G, K7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N5/L6E41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+2.5Loop 9 reporterNone−2.5P5/L9K6G, K7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N5/L9E41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+2.5Carboxyl terminus reporterNone−2.5P5/CTK6G, K7G, A35K, V39K, I40K+2.5N5/CTE41N, E42N, G10E, T9E, L8E+2.5Amino acid residues are indicated by the single-letter code.

The mutant Glut1 mRNAs were transcribed in vitro and then injected into Xenopus oocytes. Three days postinjection, total oocyte membranes were prepared and dissolved in a detergent buffer, and equal aliquots were either treated or not treated with N-glycanase and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using Glut1-specific antibody. The mobility of glycosylated Glut1 protein was increased by treatment with N-glycanase, which cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins. Surprisingly, the data in Fig. 2demonstrate that inversion of the charge difference had no discernible effect on the glycosylation status of either reporter construct, suggesting that the mutations had no apparent effect on the cytosolic disposition of the amino terminus or the exoplasmic disposition of the first loop. However, increasing the charge difference from −2.5 or −1.5 to more positive values resulted in a decreased level of steady-state proteins, until a dramatic reduction in mutant Glut1 proteins was observed at a charge difference of +2.5 for the first loop or amino terminus reporter constructs. We suspected that inversion of the charge difference was indeed altering the topology of the mutant proteins and that the molecules with aberrant topologies had a decreased stability in oocytes relative to molecules with the normal topology. In fact, long-term exposure of the autoradiogram revealed the presence of small quantities of aberrantly glycosylated amino terminus for the P5 mutant in the amino terminus reporter (P5/NT), indicating that the charge inversion did indeed alter the topology of Glut1. In order to bypass problems caused by decreased stability of topologically aberrant molecules, we examined the topology of mutant proteins pulse-labeled for 1 h with Tran35S–label. The presence of the high mannose core oligosaccharides on the newly synthesized, pulse-labeled mutant transporters was detected by digestion of membrane protein with endoglycosidase H. As with the N-glycanase digestions described above, cleavage of the high mannose core oligosaccharide from the glycosylated protein increased the mobility of glycosylated transporter on SDS gels. Fig. 3demonstrates that mutant molecules with altered topologies were detected after pulse labeling. A small fraction of the first loop reporter was unglycosylated in the P4/L1 mutant with a charge difference of +1.5, and ∼75% of the P5/L1 mutant with a charge difference of +2.5 remained unglycosylated, indicating that a fraction of the molecules had first loop domains that were not translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and were therefore not exposed to the glycosylation machinery. In comparison, ∼50% of the N5/L1 mutant with a charge difference of +2.5 remained unglycosylated. These data demonstrate that both positively and negatively charged amino acid residues can influence the topology of Glut1. Similarly, the amino terminus reporter showed aberrant glycosylation behavior as the charge difference was inverted by altering the number of positive or negative charges in the two flanking domains. In this case, however, the amino terminus of the reporter construct started to exhibit some core glycosylation at a charge difference of +1.5 (N4/NT) or +0.5 (P3/NT), and nearly complete glycosylation was observed at a charge difference of +2.5, indicating that the normally cytoplasmically disposed amino terminus had “flipped” into the exoplasm. Again, both positive and negative charges affected the topology, but alteration of the distribution of positive charges appeared to be somewhat more effective. The data for the two amino-terminal series constructs are presented quantitatively in Fig. 3 B. In order to determine whether the topological disruptions induced by the charge inversions represented a complete 180° inversion of Glut1 topology (see Fig. 5 D) or only local perturbations in topology (see Fig. 5, B and C), we examined the disposition of downstream loops in the N and P series mutants exhibiting the most extreme alterations in charge difference. The glycosylation marker was placed individually into loops 2, 3, 6, or 9, or into the carboxyl terminus of the Glut1 mutants (see Fig. 1 and Table I). The data in Fig. 4 demonstrate that neither the N5 nor P5 charge mutant exhibited any aberrant downstream topology. That is, the predicted downstream cytoplasmic domains (loops 2 and 6 and the carboxyl terminus) remained cytoplasmic and the predicted exoplasmic domains (loops 3 and 9) remained exoplasmic for both the P and N series mutants according to the observed patterns of glycosylation.Figure 4Endo H digestion of mutant transporters immunoprecipitated from solubilized intracellular membranes purified from metabolically labeled oocytes for the orientation of the downstream flanking domains.

Although some progress has been made in understanding the assembly of eucaryotic multispanning membrane proteins (18Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von H.G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the precise molecular events involved in the folding of proteins into the membrane have yet to be defined. Our data demonstrate that charge inversion across the first transmembrane segment only caused a local disruption in Glut1 topology, most likely corresponding to molecules in which either the first or second transmembrane domain failed to insert into the membrane (see Fig. 5, B and C). The structures shown in Fig. 5, B and C, are consistent with the following observations for the N5 or P5 mutants exhibiting a charge difference of +2.5. About 75% of the molecules (in the case of the P series mutant) possessed an amino terminus that had aberrantly “flipped” into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and possessed a first loop domain that had aberrantly failed to translocate and therefore remained in the cytoplasm. The other ∼25% of the molecules also possessed an aberrantly exoplasmic amino terminus, but possessed a normally disposed exoplasmic first loop domain. Because the downstream topology of both types of molecules appeared to be completely normal, the first class of molecules must correspond to the structure shown in Fig. 5 C,and the second class of molecules must correspond to the structure shown in Fig. 5 B. These “frustrated” topologies, in which a transmembrane segment is “pulled out” of the membrane, have been observed previously for mutant bacterial membrane proteins whose topologies have been subjected to experimental manipulation by charge alterations (19Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Cell. 1994; 77: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Despite our ignorance of the mechanisms involved, the positive-inside rule has proven to be very successful at predicting the topology of bacterial polytopic proteins (2von Heijne G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, statistical analyses (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and experimental results (8Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have suggested that somewhat different rules may apply for eucaryotic proteins, perhaps reflecting the lack of an electrical potential across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Hartmann et al. (4Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) suggested that the total amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment, rather than only the distribution of lysines and arginines, is critical for determining the topology of eucaryotic polytopic proteins. Although the charge difference hypothesis was proposed nearly a decade ago, until now it has not been systematically tested on a native, eucaryotic multispanning membrane protein. Our results with Glut1, a protein with 12 presumably α-helical transmembrane segments, confirm some aspects of the charge difference hypothesis, but also indicate that the determinants of eucaryotic polytopic membrane topology are more complex than suggested by this hypothesis alone. Consistent with the charge difference hypothesis, our data demonstrate that the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment is important in determining the topology of Glut1, and that, unlike the situation in E. coli, the distribution of both positive and negative charges contributes to the overall effect, although positive charges were somewhat more influential with respect to topology than negative charges. However, contrary to the hypothesis, the effect of this charge difference is limited to determining the disposition of the amino-terminal domain, the first transmembrane segment, and the first linker domain. In fact, inverting the amino acid charge difference across the first transmembrane segment resulted in the production of aberrant molecules in which either the first or second transmembrane segment failed to insert into the membrane, whereas the topology of the molecules from the second linker domain to the carboxyl terminus was normal. These observations indicate that downstream sequences are involved in determining the topology of Glut1. Interestingly, each transmembrane segment of Glut1 obeys the charge difference rule as well as the positive-inside rule, with the exception of segment 4, which has a net amino acid charge across it of 0. It is quite possible that, depending on the lengths of the flanking linker domains for a given protein, the charge difference across each transmembrane helix is important in determining the orientation of that helix and the disposition of its flanking domains. This is a hypothesis that is now readily testable for Glut1."

Nuclear receptors constitute a super family of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in a wide variety of biological processes such as growth, differentiation, and development. These transcription regulators modulate the transcription efficiency of their target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of these target genes, thereby recruiting corepressors or coactivators to the transcription machinery (1Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The most common form of receptor-DNA interaction is the binding of repeated DNA sequences, either in a direct or an inverted orientation, by dimeric receptors. In most cases, nuclear receptors preferentially form heterodimeric pairs with a common partner, one of the retinoid receptor X (RXR)1 family members (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that RXR family provides the common partners for all the nuclear receptors that are able to form heterodimers. The orphan receptors belong to the super family of nuclear receptors; however, the biological significance of these orphan members has been debated because of the lack of specific ligands for these receptors. Recently, the biological functions of several orphan receptors have been revealed in gene-targeted mice and by linkage analysis. For example, mice deficient in COUP-TFII or hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 displayed embryonic lethality (3Philippe K. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), and chromosomal deletion of the RORα gene resulted in a staggered phenotype (4Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrbrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. Fitzhugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Berkel V.V. Birren B.W. Kruglyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the signaling pathways of some orphan receptors can be coupled to certain established biological pathways, such as the orphan receptor COUP-TFII in the bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) pathway (5Feng J.Q. Chen D. Cooney A.J. Tsai M.-J. Harris M.A. Tsai S.Y. Feng M. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28364-28373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated and characterized a mouse orphan receptor TR2–11 gene that is expressed most abundantly in the developing germ cells (6Lee H.-J. Young W.-J. Shih C.C.-Y. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Later, we have identified two isoforms of this receptor, one encoding 590 amino acid residues designated as TR2-11-f (full-length) (designated as TR2 hereon) and the other encoding 256 amino acid residues as a result of early termination, designated as TR2–11-t (truncated form) (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The TR2 expression is most abundant in the advanced male germ cells, whereas TR2-11-t is only weakly expressed in somatic cells and early germ cells (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In several reporter systems, such as a reporter controlled by a direct repeat-5 (DR5)-type RA response element (RARE) of the RARβ gene (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a reporter controlled by a DR4-type hormone response element of the mouse cellular retinoic acid binding protein I (CRABP-I) gene, we have shown that TR2, but not TR2-11-t, strongly represses the activities of these reporters (8Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other studies have also demonstrated a predominantly repressive effect of TR2 in other putative target gene systems, such as the SV40 promoter (9Lee H.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5434-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the erythropoietin gene promoter (6Lee H.-J. Young W.-J. Shih C.C.-Y. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying TR2 actions and to shed light on its associate proteins, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment using the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of TR2 as the bait. From an adult testis cDNA library, we have identified several positive clones, including the orphan receptor TR4, or TAK1 (10Chang C. Lopes da Silva S. Ideta R. Lee Y. Teh S. Burbach J.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Hirose T. Fujimoto W. Yamaai T. Kim K.H. Matsuura H. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1667-1680PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an interaction between TR2 and TR4 mediated by the LBD. Interestingly, TR4 receptor has also been shown to function as a repressor for several reporters, including SV40 promoter and RAR/RXR- and T3R-mediated signaling pathways (11Hirose T. Fujimoto W. Yamaai T. Kim K.H. Matsuura H. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1667-1680PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We then ask whether TR2 and TR4 are able to form receptor heterodimersin vitro/in vivo and if these heterodimers are biologically functional. In this study, we present several lines of evidence supporting the notion that TR2 and TR4 are able to mediate a unique nuclear receptor dimerization pathway. Neither TR2 nor TR4 forms heterodimer with the RXR members. Instead, these two receptors preferentially interact with each other and exert a synergistic biological activity when both receptors are present. In addition, these two receptors are coexpressed in the same testicular cell populations and exhibit a temporally parallel pattern of expression in developing testis. The implication of this unique nuclear receptor heterodimerization pathway is discussed. For the yeast two-hybrid system, the full-length mouse TR2, TR4, RARα, and RXRα cDNA were each amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the bait and prey vectors, pBD-GAL4 Cam and pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), at EcoRI and SalI site. To construct the C-terminal deletions and the point mutation, the DEF domain (residue 166–590) of TR2 (13Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was first cloned into the pBD-GAL4 Cam vector at EcoRI and SmaI sites (construct TR2DEF), and fragments of various C-terminal deletions were generated by PCR, flanked by HindIII and SmaI sites, and used to replace the HindIII/SmaI fragment of the wild type vector. The TR2DEF construct was also used as the bait to screen the library described as follows. The LLL(537–539)YPP mutant, with the consecutive three leucine residues (537–539) replaced by YPP, was generated by using a PCR-based point mutagenesis protocol (14Zhao L.-J. Zhang Q.X. Padmanabhan R. Wu R. Recombinant DNA Methodology II. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 323-332Crossref Google Scholar). For the mammalian two-hybrid system, the same DEF domain, C-terminal 40 amino acid deletion, and LLL/YPP mutant fragments of TR2, as well as a TR4 DEF domain (183–596) (10Chang C. Lopes da Silva S. Ideta R. Lee Y. Teh S. Burbach J.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions were constructed by placing the cDNAs of the full-length TR2, TR4, and the TR2 DEF domain downstream of the GFP, at BglII and SalI sites (for TR2 and TR4) or SmaI(for TR2DEF) sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). The glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion was constructed by inserting the full-length TR2 to the BamHI site of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reporter constructs for the mammalian two-hybrid system were made by placing five copies of the GAL4 binding site (5′-CGGAGGACAGTACTCCG3′) upstream of the tk-luciferase reporter. All the expression vectors for transfection experiments in COS-1 cells are under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The full-length TR2, TR4, and A/B deletion of TR2 (99–590) were cloned into pSG5 vector atBglII site for in vitro transcription/translation reactions. The yeast two-hybrid screening (HybriZAP two-hybrid system from Stratagene) was conducted according to the manufacture's instruction. Briefly, the phagemid library, from an adult mouse testis mRNA source, was prepared in the HybriZAP two-hybrid λ vector. The primary HybriZAP λ library, containing a total of 5 × 107 individual clones, was amplified and converted into the pAD-GAL4 plasmid libraries by in vivo mass excision. A portion of the amplified library (109) was transformed into XLOLR Escherichia coli cells, and the DNA representing the library of target plasmids was isolated. To screen the interacting proteins of TR2, 10 mg each of pBD-TR2DEF and the library cDNA was cotransformed into YGR-2 yeast cells containing a his 3 marker and a lacZreporter. Approximately 5 × 106 cotransformants were plated on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. The positive clones were confirmed by LacZ filter lift assay (15Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). For the interaction assay, different combinations of the baits and the preys as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were cotransformed into YGR-2 yeast cells and plated on triple selection medium. The liquid LacZ assay was performed as described (16Fagan R. Flint K.J. Jones N. Cell. 1994; 78: 799-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and one unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside too-nitrophenol and d-galactosidase per min.Figure 2Helix 10 is critical for heterodimer formation. A series of TR2 C-terminal deletions and a point mutation were constructed in the GAL4BD vector for interactions with GAL4AD-TR4 in the yeast two-hybrid system. The upper panelshows the reporter and all the constructs. The numbersindicate the amino acid positions of TR2. The region of putative helices 10–12 is indicated, and the leucine mutation is marked with anasterisk. The yeast two-hybrid tests were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GST fusion protein was purified according to the manufacture's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitro interaction, 5 μg of GST-TR2 fusion protein or GST control made in bacteria was bound to a glutathione-Sepharose column and incubated with 35S-labeled TR4 protein produced in a TNT (in vitrotranscription/translation) system (Promega, Madison, WI) in a binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 60 min at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by five washes with a binding buffer without BSA and protease inhibitors, and specifically bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. The COS-1 culture technique and transfection experiment were conducted as described (17Wei L.-N. Chang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5073-5078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). RA (10−7m) induction and luciferase and LacZ assays were performed as described previously (17Wei L.-N. Chang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5073-5078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate cultures, and at least three independent experiments were conducted to obtain the means and standard error of the mean (S.E.). For the expression of GFP fusion proteins, COS-1 cells were grown on a cover glass in a 3-cm dish and supplemented with DMEM containing dextran charcoal-treated serum (DCC medium). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and visualized by microscopy. The mobility shift assay was conducted according to an established protocol (18White R. Parker M. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 143-179Google Scholar). Briefly,in vitro translated protein was incubated with 1 ng of probe in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), and 5 mg/ml BSA at 4 °C for 60 min. The protein-DNA complex was analyzed by a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 0.001m EDTA). The probe was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides containing a RARE of the DR5 type derived from the RARβ gene (5′-AGCTTAAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCGCATATATTAGCT-3′) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. For competition experiments, 10–100 ng of unlabeled RARE oligonucleotides was included in the reactions. To determine whether the receptors bind DNA as monomers, 100 ng of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing a half-site of the repeat (5′-CCGAAAGTTCACTCGCATATATTAGCT-3′) was included in the reaction. Germ cells from mouse testes were collected and separated by using a CelSep apparatus as described previously (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mouse Sertoli cells were isolated by unit gravity separation (19Hugly S. Roberts K. Griswold M.D. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1390-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult testes were decapsulated, incubated with enzyme solution I (0.1% collagenase, 0.2% hyaluronidase, 0.03% DNase, 0.03% soybean trypsin inhibitor in F-12/DMEM) and solution II (0.1% collagenase/dispase, 0.2% hyaluronidase, 0.03% DNase, 0.03% soybean trypsin inhibitor in F-12/DMEM) each for 30 min at 34 °C with gentle shaking. The testicular cells were subjected to centrifugation, resuspended in 2% BSA in F-12/DMEM, and sedimented for 30 min at 34 °C. The sedimented cells, which contained most of the Sertoli cells, were filtered through a 53-μm nylon cloth, and separated from germ cells by continuing sedimentations five to seven times. The methods for RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and primers for TR2 and actin were as described previously (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The primers for TR4 were: 5′-TCTCCAGGGATGACCAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGGTTGGCCAAAGAGGT-3′. By screening a mouse testis cDNA library with the LBD of TR2 as the bait, a total of 61 positive clones was isolated. Among these, four individual clones appeared to be derived from the same mRNA species of the mouse TR4 orphan receptor. Sequence comparison between these two receptors revealed a high homology in helix 10 of the putative LBD, which contained the ninth haptad repeat and was known to contribute to the dimer interface (Fig. 1 A) (20Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Because of the strong interaction between the TR2 bait and TR4 clones, we then examined the potential interactions among TR2, TR4, and RAR and RXR first in the yeast two-hybrid interaction tests. The “baits” and “preys” used in this system were constructed by placing each full-length TR2, TR4, RARα, and RXRα cDNA downstream of the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) and activation domain (GAL4AD), respectively. Two reporters, UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-HIS3 and UASGAL4-TATACYC1-lacZ, could be activated only when a specific interaction occurred between the bait and the prey, as indicated by the growth on histidine-deficient medium and an β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity. Different combinations of the baits and the preys were cotransformed into the yeast, which was then plated on a selection medium. A liquid LacZ assay was performed to examine the interaction. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the homodimeric interaction of TR2 or TR4 and the heterodimeric interaction of RARα/RXRα result in 30–50 units of β-galactosidase activities in the protein interaction tests. Interestingly, the interaction between TR2 and TR4 induces a β-galactosidase activity of 75 units, indicating a much stronger interaction between TR2 and TR4. Surprisingly, neither TR2 nor TR4 interacts with RARα or RXRα, the common heterodimer partner, in the presence or absence of retinoic acid. As expected, the negative control (GAL4BD/GAL4AD) induces no LacZ activity and the positive control (p53/SV40) induces a moderate LacZ activity. To confirm the heterodimerization of TR2/TR4, a GST pull-down assay was performed. The full-length TR2 was fused to a GST expression vector, expressed in E. coli, applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column, and subsequently incubated with in vitro translated35S-labeled TR4. Following an extensive washing procedure, the bound protein was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 C, TR4 is coeluted with the GST-TR2 fusion, but not the control GST protein, indicating a specific interaction between TR2 and TR4. To further examine if TR2 and TR4 could heterodimerize on the putative DNA response element, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a commonly used DNA element for these receptors, the DR5-type repeat derived from the RARβ promoter (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Radioactive labeled DNA fragments containing the DR5 were incubated with in vitro translated receptor proteins, separated by a polyacrylamide gel, and examined by autoradiography. To differentiate the two receptors that migrated at very similar positions when bound to this DNA element, we constructed an A/B domain deletion of TR2 that retained the ability to bind DNA. As shown in Fig. 1 D, TR2 (the A/B deletion), as well as TR4, each binds DNA as homodimers (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). As expected, a major band representative of the heterodimers of TR2 and TR4 is observed in the reaction that the DNA fragments are coincubated with both receptors (lane 3). Interestingly, the bands representing either TR2 or TR4 homodimers appear as minor bands, indicating preferential formation of TR2/TR4 heterodimers on the DNA elements. To demonstrate a specific interaction of this heterodimeric receptor pair with the DNA element, a competition experiment was included as shown in lanes 5–7. The retarded band representing TR2/TR4 heterodimers is competed, in a dose-dependent manner, by the addition of the cold DNA fragments (lanes 5–7), but not by DNA fragments containing only a half-site of the repeat (lane 8). Lane 1shows the reaction containing the reticulocyte lysate and the probe, as a control of nonspecific interaction in this system. These results demonstrate that although both TR2 and TR4 can form homodimers as reported by all the pervious studies (8Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Hirose T. Apfel R. Pfahl M. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), they preferentially form heterodimers on the putative DNA response element. Taken together, it is concluded that TR2 and TR4 preferentially heterodimerize with each other, although both are able to form homodimers of their own, in solution as well as on DNA elements. Unlike most nuclear receptors that are able to form heterodimers, TR2 and TR4 do not form heterodimers with RXRs, the common partners in nuclear receptor heterodimerization. Dimerization of nuclear receptors is mediated primarily by their LBD. The crystal structures of RXRα, RARγ, and T3Rβ reveal the dimer interface formed mainly by the helix 10 of their LBDs (20Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 22Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 23Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Mcgrsth M.E. Wesr B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). To determine the heterodimer interface of TR2, a series of C-terminal deletions and a point mutation of the LBD (the DEF domain) of TR2 were constructed in GAL4-BD fusions (Fig. 2, upper panel). These GAL4-BD fusions of TR2 were tested for their abilities to interact with GAL4AD-TR4 in the yeast by using a liquid LacZ assay. As shown in Fig. 2, TR2 mutations with deletion of 40 and 50 amino acid residues from the C terminus (constructs CΔ40 and CΔ50, respectively), which are truncated in either the entire helices 11 and 12 (CΔ40) or parts of the helix 10 (CΔ50), lose the abilities to interact with TR4. In contrast, the 10, 20, and 30 amino acid deletions (constructs CΔ10, CΔ20, and CΔ30, respectively), in which only helix 12 and parts of helix 11 are disrupted, have no effect on the interaction with TR4. Like other receptors (20Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), the conserved leucine residues within the ninth heptad repeat of the helix 10 are also important for this heterodimeric interaction, as evidenced by the failure of interaction between a TR2 point mutation with the 3 leucine residues changed to YPP (the construct LLL/YPP) and TR4. It is concluded that helix 10 of TR2 is important for the formation of heterodimers. To determine whether TR2/TR4 interact in mammalian cells, a mammalian version of the two-hybrid interaction test was conducted. The wild type and mutated TR2 as well as TR4 were each fused to the bait and the prey vectors in the same manner as in the yeast system, with the GAL4AD replaced by the VP16AD (24Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The upper panel of Fig. 3 shows the reporter, a tk-luciferase reporter containing five copies of the GAL4 binding site and the expression vectors under the control of the SV40 promoter. The reporter and different combinations of GAL4BD and VP16AD fusions were cotransfected, along with a SV40-lacZ as an internal control, into COS-1 cells. The relative luciferase unit (RLU) was calculated by normalizing the luciferase units to the lacZ units. As shown in Fig. 3, the interaction of the TR2 with itself (BD-TR2DEF and VP16-TR2DEF) results in a 2.5 higher reporter activity, whereas the interaction between TR2 and TR4 (BD-TR2DEF and VP16-TR4DEF) results in a 12.5-fold higher reporter activity (Fig. 3), again indicating a stronger interaction between TR2 and TR4 than the homodimers in mammalian cells. As predicted, both of the C-terminal 40-amino acid deletion (BD-TR2CΔ40) and the leucine point mutation (BD-TR2LLL/YPP) fail to interact with TR4. A similar result was obtained when TR2 and TR4 were switched between the bait and the prey vectors (BD-TR4 and VP16-TR2) (data not shown). It is concluded that an intact helix 10 is required for efficient TR2/TR4 heterodimerization in both the yeast and the mammalian cells, since all mutations (deletion or point mutation) that disrupt helix 10 of TR2 lose their abilities to heterodimerize with TR4. In addition, the interaction of TR2/TR4 heterodimers is approximately six times stronger than that of either TR2 or TR4 homodimers. Both TR2 and TR4 have been shown to repress RA induction of reporters containing a DR5-type retinoic acid response element (RARE) derived from the RARβ promoter through specific DNA binding of homodimeric receptors (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Hirose T. Apfel R. Pfahl M. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since TR2 and TR4 preferentially formed heterodimers when both receptors are present (Fig. 1 D), we then examined the effects of TR2/TR4 heterodimers on the RA signaling pathway using this reporter system. The RARE-tk-luciferase reporter was cotransfected with the TR2 vector, the TR4 vector, or the combination of TR2 and TR4, along with a SV40-LacZ internal control, into COS-1 cells. RA was added to a final concentration of 10−7m. The fold of reporter induction by RA was calculated by comparing the RLU in the presence of RA to that in the absence of RA. RA consistently induces this reporter for approximately 100-fold. Consistent with the previous reports, expression of TR2 or TR4 alone represses the induction level in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the combination of TR2 and TR4 exerts a stronger repression on RA induction of this reporter (with an equal amount of total receptor DNA added in each transfection). Furthermore, this synergism is also dose-dependent, and the repression of RA induction is abolished when the wild-type TR2 expression vector is replaced with the vector carrying the point mutation (TR2-LLL/YPP) that cannot heterodimerize with TR4. From these data, it is concluded that the presence of both TR2 and TR4 exerts a synergistic repression of RA signaling pathway, and this synergism is mediated by heterodimeric TR2/TR4 binding to a specific DNA sequence. Nuclear receptors can be divided into two categories based upon their subcellular distributions. The steroid hormone receptors are present in the cytosol, and ligand binding induces their nuclear translocation. On the other hand, most other receptors such as T3Rs, RARs, and RXRs are localized in the nuclei. We have determined a specific nuclear localization signal of TR2 within the DNA-binding domain of this receptor and found that truncation of the DNA-binding domain resulted in predominantly cytosolic localization. 2Yu, Z., Lee, C.-H., chinpasial, C., and Wei, L.-N. (1998) J. Endocrinol., in press. To determine TR4 localization and to examine the interaction of TR2 and TR4 in vivo, we employed a GFP fusion strategy to tag these receptors. The full-length TR2, TR4, and a truncated TR2 with its A/B/C domain deleted, were each fused downstream to the GFP vector, transfected into COS-1 cells maintained in medium supplemented with dextran-charcoal-treated serum (DCC medium), and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. In these experiments, both TR2 and TR4 exhibit a constitutive nuclear localization pattern (Fig. 5,A and B), the GFP fusion of truncated TR2 is predominantly cytosolic (Fig. 5 C), whereas the GFP itself is distributed evenly within the cells (Fig. 5 E). Interestingly, the truncated TR2 is accumulated in the nuclei in the presence of untagged TR4 (Fig. 5 D), indicating trapping of the otherwise cytosolic, truncated TR2 inside the nuclei by TR4. This phenomenon cannot be seen in parallel experiments using either the RAR or RXR expression vectors (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that both TR2 and TR4 are localized in the nuclei and that TR2 and TR4 are able to interact in vivo, mediated by the LBD. TR2 was most abundant in the adult testis, whereas TR4 was expressed in most tissues examined, including testis (10Chang C. Lopes da Silva S. Ideta R. Lee Y. Teh S. Burbach J.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Hirose T. Fujimoto W. Yamaai T. Kim K.H. Matsuura H. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1667-1680PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these two receptors were expressed in the same cell populations of the testis, RT-PCR experiments were conducted to examine the expression patterns of these two receptors in purified testicular cells and in mouse testes at different developmental stages. Total RNAs were isolated from pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, Sertoli cells, and testes collected from animals at different ages. RT-PCR experiments were performed by using primer pairs flanking the C-terminal and the N-terminal portions of the TR2 and TR4 cDNAs. The primers for actin were included for an internal control. The products were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to probes specific to TR2, TR4, and actin, respectively. Fig. 6 A shows one typical result following hybridization, and Fig. 6 B represents a semiquantitative result after quantifying the signals with a phosphorimager and normalizing to the actin control. The highest relative value of TR2 and TR4 after normalization is each given an arbitrary value of one. It appears that the expression of TR2 or TR4 is closely associated with germ cell development, as the expression levels of both receptors start to elevate at the age of postnatal day 20, a stage when active meiosis began, and remain high throughout adulthood (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, the expression of both receptors is most abundant in pachytene spermatocytes, levels off in round spermatids, and is almost absent in Sertoli cells. This expression pattern indicates that the expression of TR2 and TR4 may be involved in regulating the expression of genes important for spermatogenesis at the stage of late meiotic prophase. Heterodimerization of these two receptors may contribute a unique pathway for gene regulation that is critical for spermatogenesis. This is the first demonstration of heterodimer formation of two different orphan nuclear receptors, which interact both in vitro and in vivo, dimerize on RA response elements, and exert synergistic biological activities without the participation of RXR family members. In studies presented here, we provide several lines of evidence for this unique nuclear receptor heterodimerization pathway. These two receptors preferentially form heterodimers with each other in solution as well as on DNA elements, although they both can also form homodimers of their own. The dimerization is mediated by their LBDs and the three leucine residues on helix 10 of TR2 are important for this interaction. In addition, these two receptors exhibit a synergistic biological activity as demonstrated by the stronger repression of the reporter activity in the presence of both receptors. In the developing testis, TR2 and TR4 are coexpressed in the same testicular cell populations and exhibit a parallel pattern of expression along development, suggesting a physiological role of TR2/TR4 heterodimers in germ cell development. Dimerization is essential for most nuclear receptor functions. Steroid hormone receptors and orphan receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 and germ cell nuclear factor form homodimers, whereas RAR, T3R, vitamin D receptor, and orphan receptors LXR and FXR all form heterodimers with the common partner RXR. Exceptions are isoforms of COUP-TF, which form both homodimers and heterodimers (with RXR), and ERR, which binds DNA as monomers (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, neither TR2 nor TR4 is able to interact with RXRs despite a highly homologous helix 10 among these receptors. It is suggested that TR2 and TR4 family members constitute a unique receptor dimerization pathway without the participation of RXR family members. However, it remains to be determined whether TR2/TR4 heterodimers are able to heterodimerize with other receptors. Recent studies have reported that heterodimers can be formed between estrogen receptors α and β, as well as between glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor, based upon gel mobility shift assays (25Cowley S.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our studies provide several lines of direct evidence for TR2 and TR4 heterodimer formation both in vitro and in vivo. The homodimers of TR2 and TR4 bind to the DNA elements that are also the targets of different receptor pairs involving RXR, such as RAR/RXR and T3R/RXR (7Lee C.-H. Chang L. Wei L.-N. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N.

Commun. 1995; 211: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of TR2 or TR4 to these DNA elements is much stronger than those using the RXR as heterodimeric partners (8Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol.

Many putative target genes for TR2 and TR4 have been examined, including the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I gene (8Chinpaisal C. Chang L. Hu X. Lee C.-H. Wen W.-N. Wei L.-N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14088-14095Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the erythropoietin gene (6Lee H.-J. Young W.-J. Shih C.C.-Y. Chang C. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 152: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the SV40 promoter (9Lee H.-J. Chang C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The discovery of TR2/TR4 heterodimeric pathway raises questions as to whether the regulations of these genes by TR2 and TR4 are mediated by homodimers or heterodimers and how the TR2/TR4 dimeric pathway may modulate hormonal regulation of these genes under a physiological condition. The coexpression of TR2 and TR4 in particular germ cell populations suggests a physiological role of these heterodimeric receptors in specific spermatogenetic or meiotic events. Since TR4 is highly expressed in most tissues including germ cells, whereas TR2 is specifically elevated only in meiotic germ cell populations, it is possible that the specificity of TR2/TR4 heterodimers is contributed primarily by TR2. Many regulatory events must take place in these cells to control the stability of genetic material and proper cellular differentiation. Vitamin A is essential for these events, since vitamin A depletion results in germ cell arrest at the preleptotene stages and the loss of meiotic cell populations (28Siiteri J.E. Karl A.F. Linder C.C. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These orphan receptors may modulate vitamin A signaling pathways by employing a separate signaling system, mediated by their unique heterodimers, in the developing germ cells. Both TR2 and TR4 have been shown to repress promoter activities of several genes in a DNA binding-dependent manner in the presence of regular or dextran charcoal-depleted serum (6Lee H.-J.

This finding suggests a repressive signaling pathway that may have been adopted by TR2 and differs from that utilized by other receptors such as RARs or T3Rs (1Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L.

Most orphan receptors are found to be repressive, including TR2 and TR4; however, examples exist that can activate target genes in the absence of potential ligands, such as hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (2Mangelsdorf D.J.

It is highly possible that orphan nuclear receptors could encode activating or repressing activities in vivo, depending upon the nuclear environment such as the status of ligands and specific cofactors in certain cell types or during a particular developmental stage.

During mouse embryogenesis, Tlx-2 is expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation, in the neural ectoderm and the neural fold during neurulation, and later in the developing nervous system.1To obtain insight into the regulation of TLX-2 function, we searched for proteins that associate with TLX-2 in vivo. This paper describes an in vitro and in vivo interaction between TLX-2 and the mouse 14-3-3η protein. The biological relevance of this interaction has been established at multiple levels: 14-3-3η enhances the nuclear localization of TLX-2; Tlx-2 and 14-3-3η are coexpressed in the developing PNS2 and in PC12 cells; and TLX-2 and 14-3-3η cooperatively suppress neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Our findings provide the first evidence that a 14-3-3 protein can act as a cofactor for homeodomain transcription factors and suggest that the function of the TLX-2 homeodomain protein is modulated by specific signaling mediated by 14-3-3 proteins.DISCUSSIONIn vitro and in vivo interactions between the TLX-2 homeodomain and 14-3-3η proteins have been demonstrated in this study. The biological significance of the interaction is supported by several observations: 14-3-3η increases the nuclear localization of TLX-2; Tlx-2 and 14-3-3η are coexpressed in the developing PNS and in PC12 cells; and TLX-2 and 14-3-3η cooperatively suppress neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells induced by NGF. Recent studies have suggested that 14-3-3 proteins can bind to the phosphoserine in an RSXpSXP or RX(Y/F)XpSXP motif in various signaling proteins (46Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

However, such motifs are not present in the amino acid sequence of TLX-2, indicating that a different binding mechanism or motif mediates its interaction with 14-3-3η. Notably, these motifs are also not found in the peptide of platelet glycoprotein Ib-α that mediates its interaction with 14-3-3 (48Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the two motifs (NRHpSLP and RLGpSTF) that are implicated in 14-3-3 binding of CbI share little homology with the above consensus binding sites, but can cooperatively confer stable binding to 14-3-3 (49Liu Y.-C.

Nonetheless, serine-rich regions are present in both the N- and C-terminal portions of TLX-2 (32Raju K. Tang S. Dubé I.D. Kamel-Reid S. Bryce D.M. Breitman M.L. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It will be interesting for further experiments to determine whether the interaction between TLX-2 and 14-3-3η proteins is also phosphoserine-dependentRecent studies have identified a variety of cofactors for homeodomain transcription factors; many of them are also involved in transcription regulation (see the Introduction). Although modulation of the DNA binding affinity and specificity of homeoproteins by their cofactors has been strongly suggested, the functional significance of their interactions is often unclear in a biological context. Our findings of the association of 14-3-3η with TLX-2 define a new class of cofactor for homeodomain transcription factors. Given the well established role of 14-3-3 proteins in signaling, our data provide a direct connection between the homeodomain transcription factors and cell signaling and suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of the function of homeodomain proteins during development.The biological functions of 14-3-3 proteins are poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested that, through interacting with Cdc25C, 14-3-3 regulates entry into the cell cycle (50Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thomas R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) and that, through interacting with BAD, 14-3-3 prevents apoptosis by releasing Bcl-XL (51Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Our finding of the association of 14-3-3η with the TLX-2 homeodomain protein suggests a role of 14-3-3 proteins in regulation of developmental processes. Indeed, we observed a cooperative suppression of neurite outgrowth by these two factors (Fig. 5 B). The requirement of 14-3-3 proteins for specific developmental pathways has also been demonstrated recently in both yeast and Drosophila(28Kockel L. Vorbruggen G. Jackle H. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in which the amino-terminal helices of the two subunits contact one another (25Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that such dimeric molecules may function as adaptors or scaffolds to mediate interactions between different proteins (22Conklin D.S. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24Braselmann S. McCormick F.

For instance, it has been shown that 14-3-3 proteins mediate the interaction between Raf and Bcr proteins and probably between Raf and Cdc25 and between Raf and A20 (22Conklin D.S. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 24Braselmann S. McCormick F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20029-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The association between 14-3-3η and TLX-2 suggests that the 14-3-3 protein may bridge an interaction between TLX-2 and another as yet uncharacterized protein. Given that 14-3-3 proteins are associated with numerous signaling kinases, it is likely that TLX-2 may interact with one or more of those kinases. Since phosphorylation and dephosphorylation serve as a major mechanism regulating the nuclear localization of transcription factors (53Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the observed enhancement of TLX-2 nuclear localization by 14-3-3η may be attributed to a 14-3-3η-mediated interaction between TLX-2 and a signaling kinase that modulates the phosphorylation state of TLX-2. Taken together, our results suggest that one likely mechanism that controls the developmental function of TLX-2 is the regulation of its cellular distribution by signaling mediated by 14-3-3 proteins.

During mouse embryogenesis, Tlx-2 is expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation, in the neural ectoderm and the neural fold during neurulation, and later in the developing nervous system.1To obtain insight into the regulation of TLX-2 function, we searched for proteins that associate with TLX-2 in vivo. This paper describes an in vitro and in vivo interaction between TLX-2 and the mouse 14-3-3η protein. The biological relevance of this interaction has been established at multiple levels: 14-3-3η enhances the nuclear localization of TLX-2; Tlx-2 and 14-3-3η are coexpressed in the developing PNS2 and in PC12 cells; and TLX-2 and 14-3-3η cooperatively suppress neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Our findings provide the first evidence that a 14-3-3 protein can act as a cofactor for homeodomain transcription factors and suggest that the function of the TLX-2 homeodomain protein is modulated by specific signaling mediated by 14-3-3 proteins. DISCUSSIONIn vitro and in vivo interactions between the TLX-2 homeodomain and 14-3-3η proteins have been demonstrated in this study. The biological significance of the interaction is supported by several observations: 14-3-3η increases the nuclear localization of TLX-2; Tlx-2 and 14-3-3η are coexpressed in the developing PNS and in PC12 cells; and TLX-2 and 14-3-3η cooperatively suppress neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells induced by NGF. Recent studies have suggested that 14-3-3 proteins can bind to the phosphoserine in an RSXpSXP or RX(Y/F)XpSXP motif in various signaling proteins (46Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

However, such motifs are not present in the amino acid sequence of TLX-2, indicating that a different binding mechanism or motif mediates its interaction with 14-3-3η.

It will be interesting for further experiments to determine whether the interaction between TLX-2 and 14-3-3η proteins is also phosphoserine-dependentRecent studies have identified a variety of cofactors for homeodomain transcription factors; many of them are also involved in transcription regulation (see the Introduction). Although modulation of the DNA binding affinity and specificity of homeoproteins by their cofactors has been strongly suggested, the functional significance of their interactions is often unclear in a biological context. Our findings of the association of 14-3-3η with TLX-2 define a new class of cofactor for homeodomain transcription factors. Given the well established role of 14-3-3 proteins in signaling, our data provide a direct connection between the homeodomain transcription factors and cell signaling and suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of the function of homeodomain proteins during development.The biological functions of 14-3-3 proteins are poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested that, through interacting with Cdc25C, 14-3-3 regulates entry into the cell cycle (50Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Thomas R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Our finding of the association of 14-3-3η with the TLX-2 homeodomain protein suggests a role of 14-3-3 proteins in regulation of developmental processes. Indeed, we observed a cooperative suppression of neurite outgrowth by these two factors (Fig. 5 B). The requirement of 14-3-3 proteins for specific developmental pathways has also been demonstrated recently in both yeast and Drosophila(28Kockel L. Vorbruggen G. Jackle H. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D.

The association between 14-3-3η and TLX-2 suggests that the 14-3-3 protein may bridge an interaction between TLX-2 and another as yet uncharacterized protein. Given that 14-3-3 proteins are associated with numerous signaling kinases, it is likely that TLX-2 may interact with one or more of those kinases. Since phosphorylation and dephosphorylation serve as a major mechanism regulating the nuclear localization of transcription factors (53Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the observed enhancement of TLX-2 nuclear localization by 14-3-3η may be attributed to a 14-3-3η-mediated interaction between TLX-2 and a signaling kinase that modulates the phosphorylation state of TLX-2. Taken together, our results suggest that one likely mechanism that controls the developmental function of TLX-2 is the regulation of its cellular distribution by signaling mediated by 14-3-3 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2042995197,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has been implicated in various cardiovascular diseases; however, little is known about the ACE gene regulation in endothelial cells. We have investigated the effect of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on ACE activity and gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Our results showed a 3- and 5-fold increase in ACE activity in the medium and in the cells, respectively, after 24-h stimulation by PMA. We also observed an increase in the cellular ACE mRNA content starting after 6 h and reaching a 10-fold increase at 24 h in response to 100 ng/ml PMA as measured by ribonuclease protection assay. This effect was mediated by an increased transcription of the ACE gene as demonstrated by nuclear run-on experiments and nearly abolished by the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Our results indicate that PMA-activated PKC strongly increases ACE mRNA level and ACE gene transcription in HUVEC, an effect associated with an increased ACE secretion. A role for early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1) as a factor regulating ACE gene expression is suggested by both the presence of an Egr-1-responsive element in the proximal portion of the ACE promoter and the kinetics of the Egr-1 mRNA increase in HUVEC treated with PMA."

Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 493-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), Rhodopseudomonas blastica (4Kreusch A. Neubüser A. Schiltz E. Weckesser J. Schulz G.E.

Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) reveals the characteristic trimeric structure, each subunit consisting of 16–18 antiparallel β-strands. Recent studies employing circular dichroism spectroscopy indicate that the meningococcal PorB class 2 protein retains physicochemical properties similar to other porins, including the predominance of β-sheet structure and retention of native trimeric conformation at high temperature or increased concentrations of denaturants (7Minetti C.A.S.A.

Meningococcal class 2 and class 3 proteins are gene products of two alleles of the single-copy porB gene locus (8Hitchcock, P. J. (1989) Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2,(suppl.) S64–S65Google Scholar) and are thus mutually exclusive within different Neisseria meningitidisstrains (9Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Mocca L.F. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 69-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Frasch C.E. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Among the various class 2 and class 3 proteins sequenced to date, similarities in primary structure are on the order of 60–70%. The complete amino acid sequences of N. meningitidis PorB class 3 proteins derived from cDNA sequence analyses (11Butcher S. Sarvas M. Runeberg-Nyman K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Wolff K. Stern A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 83: 179-186Google Scholar, 13Ward M.J. Lambden P.R. Heckels J.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 283-289Crossref Google Scholar) reveal an average polypeptide molecular weight of approximately 34,000. Details regarding specific structural features of meningococcal porins have been gleaned primarily from indirect methods of analysis, including algorithmic generated topology models, epitope mapping, and gene sequence variability, whereby a significant amount of information has been acquired (14van der Ley P. Heckels J.E. Virji M. Hoogerhout P. Poolman J.T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2963-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zapata G.A. Vann W.F. Rubinstein Y. Frasch C.E. Mol.

(14van der Ley P. Heckels J.E. Virji M. Hoogerhout P. Poolman J.T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2963-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the PorA class 1 and PorB class 2 meningococcal porins contain surface-accessible linear epitopes that have been identified using monoclonal antibodies and overlapping peptides. As far as meningococcal PorB class 3-expressing serotypes are concerned, limited success has been achieved in determining surface-exposed linear epitopes, leading to the assumption that the surface epitopes in class 3, if present, are mainly conformational (15Zapata G.A. Vann W.F. Rubinstein Y. Frasch C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3493-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Feavers I.M. Suker J. McKena A.J. Heath A.B. Maiden M.C.J. Infect.

In fact, Mandrell and Zollinger (18Mandrell R.E. Zollinger W.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have described a procedure for restoration of binding electroblotted meningococcal outer membrane (OM) proteins to specific monoclonal antibodies generated against the respective native OM proteins. Recently, however, a linear B-cell epitope on class 3 has been identified within the putative loop I (residues 19–30) based on the finding that post vaccination human sera react with denatured class 3 protein in immunoblots (19Delvig A.A. Wedege E. Caugant D.A. Dalseg R. Kolberg J. Achtman M. Rosenqvist E. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Meningococcal porins have been studied extensively in terms of their genetic and immunological aspects, which have provided valuable information regarding their basic structural features. Recent investigations have furnished physicochemical evidence that PorB class 2 proteins behave as typical porins not solely in terms of function but also with respect to their overall resistance to detergents, chaotropes, and high temperatures (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The focus of the present study is to characterize the structural and functional properties of the PorB class 3 meningococcal porin family to determine their relatedness with the corresponding PorB alleles (i.e. class 2 proteins). This knowledge should shed significant light on the role that different domains play within these molecules and their resultant influence on functional and structural characteristics. The rather unusual SDS sensitivity observed for class 3 protein suggests that this porin represents an interesting model to evaluate the conformational stability of membrane proteins for which limited information is available to date (20Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The results derived from such studies should facilitate elucidation of the structural and physicochemical properties which dictate the unusually high stability of porins as a general rule. We have selected a wild type class 3-expressing meningococcal M981 strain that naturally lacks PorA class 1 expression and a genetically engineered mutant strain (i.e. 44/76 Δ1/Δ4) in which null gene replacements have been performed for PorA class 1 and reduction modifiable protein, both reported to interfere in the characterization of inherent functional and structural properties of PorB (21Tomassen J. Vermeij P. Stryvé M. Benz R. Poolman J.T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the use of DNA recombinant technology affords several advantages (22Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schimid B. Krömer M. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), including higher expression levels and the elimination of interfering components from meningococcal OMs, we have characterized the functional activity and conformational stability of recombinant PorB class 3 protein after ensuring equivalence to its native counterpart. Meningococcal strain M981 (serotype 4a) was obtained from Dr. Carl E. Frasch (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD). The mutant of meningococcal strain 44/76 (i.e. 44/76 Δ1/Δ4) was provided by Dr. Lee Wetzler (Maxwell Finland Laboratory, Boston City Hospital, Boston, MA), and the preparation procedure has been described previously (24Guttormsen H.K. Wetzler L.M. Naess A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4734-4742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The solid typing and liquid growth media for all the meningococci have been described elsewhere (25Porat N. Apicella M.A. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The growth media and conditions for the preparation of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)ΔompA harboring the expression plasmid pNV15 were similar to that of Qi et al. (22Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All reagents not described specifically were of the highest grade possible as supplied by Sigma. PorB class 3 protein from both meningococcal strains (i.e. 44/76 Δ1Δ4 and M981) was isolated employing the zwittergent-Ca2+ extraction procedure described by Wetzleret al. (26Wetzler L.M. Blake M.S. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1883-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following initial extraction, the class 3-enriched mixture was loaded onto a Hiload Q Sepharose HP ion exchange (2.6 × 20 cm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.05% zwittergent 3-14 (pH 8.0). A gradient of 0.2–1.0 m NaCl was applied and class 3 protein eluted as the major peak. The fractions containing class 3 protein were concentrated using an Amicon stirred cell fitted with a PM30 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and loaded onto a Sephacryl-S300 (XK 50/100) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, and 1.0 mmEDTA (pH 8.0). The procedure employed for the overexpression, refolding, and purification of PorB class 3 protein in E. coli has been described elsewhere (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Qi H.L. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2432-2439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Final purification was achieved by ion exchange chromatography as described for the native meningococcal porin (see above) using a gradient of 0.2 to 1.0 m NaCl, whereby refolded and purified class 3 protein eluted as the major peak. Protein concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 41,960 calculated on the basis of class 3 aromatic amino acid content according to Mach et al. (27Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The channel-forming activity of native and recombinant class 3 proteins was assessed by the liposome swelling procedure as described in detail elsewhere (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteoliposomes were prepared with lipids from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) at a ratio of 0.4 μg of protein/μmol of lipid. The oligosaccharides employed in this study were obtained from Sigma and included l-arabinose (M r 150), galactose (M r 180), rhamnose (M r 182), N-acetylglucosamine (M r 221), sucrose (M r342), raffinose (M r 504), and stachyose (M r 666). The permeability rates of class 3 proteoliposomes to the various sugars were monitored at 450 nm employing a Hewlett-Packard Model 8453 UV-visible rapid scan spectrophotometer equipped with a diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA), and the values were expressed as a percent of the rates obtained for l-arabinose. The secondary and tertiary structure of native and recombinant class 3 protein were evaluated by CD spectroscopy in the far UV (180–250 nm) and near UV (250–350 nm) regions, respectively. Concentrated stock solutions of protein were dialyzed exhaustively against a buffer system comprised of 10 mm NaPO4 and 0.05% zwittergent 3-14 (pH 8.0). Spectra of samples containing 1.0 mg/ml protein were recorded at 0.1-nm wavelength intervals on a JASCO Model 710 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Easton, MD) employing a scan speed of 5 nm/min and average response time of 1 s. A minimum of four consecutive scans were accumulated, and the average spectra stored. The temperature of the samples was maintained at 25 °C through the use of water-jacketed 0.01- and 1.0-cm path length cells in the far and near UV, respectively. The temperature-dependent stability of secondary and tertiary structure was monitored by heating the samples at a programmed rate of 60 degrees/h. Absorption spectra of samples containing 200 μg/ml protein were recorded over the range of 250–350 nm on a Hewlett-Packard Model 8453 UV-visible rapid scan spectrophotometer equipped with a diode array detector and Peltier junction temperature-controlled sample compartment. Exposure of tyrosyl residues was determined by plotting second derivative peak-trough absorbance differences as a function of chemical denaturant concentration as described elsewhere (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the case of PorB class 3 protein in the native state, the ratio of a(∂2 A 289 − ∂2 A 285) to b(∂2A295 - ∂2A291) was employed based on the spectral characteristics of this protein under native conditions. N-Acetyltyrosinamide and N-acetyltryptophanamide (Sigma) were employed as model compounds at a molar ratio of 15:4 to approximate the total content of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in class 3 protein. The aromatic amino acids were dissolved either in 100% anhydrous ethylene glycol (Aldrich) or in 6.0 m guanidinium HCl prepared from an 8.0m stock solution (Pierce) for calculation of 0 and 100% tyrosyl exposure, respectively. The degree of tryptophan exposure was also evaluated by monitoring the susceptibility of PorB class 3 tryptophan residues to oxidation by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) according to Bray et al. (30Bray M.R. Johnson P.E. Gilkes N.R. McIntosh L.P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2312-2318Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Aliquots of native PorB class 3 protein (0.25 mg/ml) were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of NBS under native conditions (i.e. 25 mmTris·HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% zwittergent 3-14) at 25 °C and in the presence of SDS at different temperatures. Absorption spectra were acquired on a Hewlett-Packard Model 8453 UV-visible rapid scan spectrophotometer equipped with a diode array detector. The resultant data were recast as the fourth derivative (∂4 A/∂λ4), and changes in the magnitude of the tryptophan specific trough were monitored at 294 nm (30Bray M.R. Johnson P.E. Gilkes N.R. McIntosh L.P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2312-2318Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since PorB class 3 trimers are highly sensitive to conventional SDS-PAGE analysis and dissociate under such conditions, we have evaluated and incorporated modifications to the procedure such as varying the temperature, ionic strength, and SDS concentration. The modified protocol permits visualization of class 3 trimers and consists of preincubating porin samples (1 mg/ml) with 0.1% SDS following a 1:1 dilution with a 2× Laemmli's native buffer (Novex). The sample is immediately loaded onto a Tris-glycine 8–16% gradient gel preequilibrated in running buffer at ∼10 °C, the latter consisting of Laemmli's native running buffer (Novex) containing 0.01% SDS. The samples were electrophoresed for 3 h under 90 V constant voltage. Trypsin resistance was conducted using tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:10 and incubations performed at 37 °C for 30 min. The effects of SDS on class 3 conformation were evaluated by conducting limited proteolysis using a staphylococcal V8 Glu-C-specific protease (Boehringer Mannheim). Following preincubation in the presence of different concentrations of SDS (i.e. 0 to 1%), an aliquot of the enzyme (at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:10) was added to the samples and subsequently incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The protease digestion reactions were terminated by incubation with SDS-loading buffer and heated to 95 °C prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed using 10% pre-cast gels in bis-Tris buffer (NuPAGE, Novex) and MES-SDS (pH 7.3) as running buffer at 200 V constant voltage. Preliminary experiments revealed that low ionic strength sodium phosphate buffer in the presence of zwittergent 3-14 (pH 8.0) represented the optimal choice for evaluating the effects of SDS on the various parameters analyzed in the present study. Accordingly, concentrated samples dialyzed against 10 mmNaPO4 and 0.05% zwittergent 3-14 (pH 8.0) were diluted to 1 mg/ml and incubated in the presence of different SDS concentrations for a minimum of 24 h to ensure that equilibrium was achieved prior to electrophoretic and spectroscopic measurements. The oligomeric state of class 3 protein and its protease susceptibility as a function of SDS were monitored by electrophoresis and subsequent densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels using an IS1000 Alpha Imager. SDS-induced conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of PorB class 3 were monitored by analyzing the far UV CD and second derivative UV spectra, respectively (29Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PorB class 3 proteins have been purified to homogeneity from meningococcal strain M981 (serotype 4a) or from a mutant strain (i.e. 44/76 Δ1/Δ4) engineered as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Isolation and purification of rclass 3 from E. coli as washed inclusion bodies, followed by protein refolding using a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, yields highly purified and refolded class 3 protein as described recently for PorB class 2 protein (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The refolded and purified protein exhibits a native-like structure, as determined by its functional activity and solution structure. Although non-SDS-resistant under conventional electrophoretic procedures, the purified native and recombinant class 3 proteins may be visualized in their trimeric state by a modified PAGE developed in the present study. The protease resistance observed for PorB class 3 proteins support the contention that these porins adopt a native trimeric structure. Since stachyose (M r 666) does not permeate at significant rates through class 3 protein channels, this oligosaccharide was employed for determination of isosmotic concentrations as described previously for class 2 protein (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inspection of the relative permeability rates tol-arabinose (M r 150) reveals that both native and rclass 3 protein channels exhibit exclusion limits of 400 Da (Fig. 1), which are equivalent to a pore radius of approximately 0.8 nm when analyzed by a nonlinear least squares fit to the Renkin equation (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PorB class 2 and class 3 proteins exhibit similar exclusion limits, suggesting that their channel characteristics and functional domains are conserved. The far UV CD spectrum permits assessment of the secondary structure of rclass 3 (Fig. 2 C), which may be compared with that of its native counterpart purified from strain 44/76 Δ1/Δ4 (Fig. 2 A). The far UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2 A) reveals that class 3 protein retains the basic secondary structural features characteristic of other porins from E. coli (31Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 8019-8029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Salmonella typhimurium (32Tokunaga M. Tokunaga H. Okajima Y. Nakae T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and meningococcal PorB class 2 protein (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The minima observed at 217 nm may be correlated with the native conformation of class 3 protein which is comprised predominantly of β-pleated sheet structures. It has been suggested that secondary structure prediction methods based either on the primary amino acid sequence or deconvolution of the CD spectrum should be used with caution when applied to membrane proteins (2Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent studies have reported that accurate determination of secondary structure can be obtained for porins using the CONVEX constraint algorithm for secondary structure predictions (33Park K. Perczel A. Fasman G.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1032-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Deconvolution of the PorB class 3 far UV CD spectrum employing this algorithm reveals a β-sheet content of approximately 37%, a value entirely consistent with that determined for PorB class 2 protein (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inspection of the near UV CD spectra of native and rclass 3 proteins in Fig. 2, B and D, respectively, reveals unique profiles characterized by a broad positive ellipticity, which is comparable to that obtained for PorB class 2 protein (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10710-10720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The similarity in spectral features observed for class 2 and class 3 proteins suggests that the aromatic residues of these proteins experience similar asymmetric environments in solution. Second derivative UV analysis has been used widely for the determination of aromatic residue exposure of proteins (7Minetti C.A.S.A. Tai J.Y. Blake M.S. Pullen J.K. Liang S.M. Remeta D.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The results reveal that class 3 tyrosyl residues are essentially buried and nonaccessible to solvent under native conditions. These results are identical irrespective of the protein source and differ from those obtained for PorB class 2 protein in which 1–2 tyrosyl residues appear to be both surface- and solvent-exposed (refer to Table I). In general, aromatic amino acid exposure is relatively low for other porins in detergent solutions such as E. coli (34Schindler M. Rosenbusch J.P. J.

We investigated the role of α-MPP in substrate recognition using a recombinant yeast MPP. Disruption of amino acid residues between 10 and 129 of the α-MPP did not essentially impair binding activity with β-MPP and processing activity, whereas truncation of the C-terminal 41 amino acids led to a significant loss of binding and processing activity. Several acidic amino acids in the region conserved among the enzymes from various species were mutated to asparagine or glutamine, and effects on processing of the precursors were analyzed. Glu353 is required for processing of malate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and adrenodoxin precursors. Glu377 and Asp378 are needed only for the processing of aspartate aminotransferase and adrenodoxin precursors, both of which have a longer extension peptide than the others studied. However, processing of the yeast α-MPP precursor, which has a short extension peptide of nine amino acids, was not affected by these mutations. Thus, effects of substitution of acidic amino acids on the processing differed with the precursor protein and depended on length of the extension peptides. α-MPP may function as a substrate-recognizing subunit by interacting mainly with basic amino acids at a region distal to the cleavage site in precursors with a longer extension peptide.

Most mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nucleus are synthesized as precursor proteins with extension peptides at the N termini and are targeted to the mitochondria. After import of the precursors into the mitochondria, the extension peptides are proteolytically cleaved off by a matrix-located metallopeptidase, mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP)1 (1Mori M.

The α- and β-subunits of the MPP are also homologous to core 2 and core 1 proteins, respectively, of the mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc 1 complex), a component of the respiratory chain (16Braun H.-P.

Sequence analysis of extension peptides of mitochondrial protein precursors revealed that the peptides vary in length and sequence and are rich in positively charged amino acids among hydrophobic amino acids (20Hartl F.U.

Studies using radiolabeled precursors and synthetic peptides as a substrate demonstrated that an arginine residue at −2 position and basic amino acid residues distal to the cleavage site are essential for specific cleavage by MPP (23Ou W-J.

Aromatic and bulky hydrophobic amino acids at position +1 and flexible linker regions containing proline and/or glycine between the two basic residues are also required (27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). β-MPP contains a metal-binding motif, HXXEH, an inverted sequence of HEXXH presented by a zinc-dependent protease thermolysin, and site-directed mutagenesis showed that this site is responsible for the catalytic activity of MPP (28Kitada S.

Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, β-MPP alone has no apparent activity, and both subunits are indispensable for MPP activity (28Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Saavedra-Alanis V.M. Rysavy P. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, α-MPP seems to participate in functions other than catalytic ones. Cross-linking analyses suggested that a substrate binding domain might reside in α-MPP (31Luciano P. Geoffroy S. Brandet A. Fernandez J-F. Géli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and key amino acid residues that undergo substrate binding in α-MPP remain to be determined. We report here that acidic amino acids in the C-terminal portion of α-MPP are involved in substrate recognition and are mainly responsible for binding of distal basic amino acids of longer extension peptides. DNAs of the precursor form of α- and β-MPP were obtained from the yeast genome by the polymerase chain reaction using as primers oligonucleotides synthesized with reference to the published sequence (8Witte C. Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Pollock R.A. Hartl F.-U. Cheng M.Y. Ostermann J. Horwich A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To obtain DNAs of the mature forms of α- and β-MPP, the NcoI site that has an initiation ATG codon was introduced before the first amino acids of these proteins. Both DNAs were finally inserted into expression vectors pET-3d or pACYC184. The hexahistidine tag was introduced to a C-terminal of either α- or β-MPP. A cDNA of bovine aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) was from a bovine liver cDNA library using as primers oligonucleotides synthesized with reference to the published sequence (35Palmisano A. Aurilia V. Ferrara L. Cubellis M., B. Sannia G. Marino G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Isolation of a cDNA of bovine adrenodoxin (Ad) has been published (36Kumamoto T. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A cDNA for mouse malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was a kind gift from Dr. T. Tsuzuki of Kyushu University (37Joh T. Takeshima H. Tsuzuki T. Shimada K. Tanase S. Morino Y. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNAs encoding α- and β-MPP were introduced into E. colistrain BL21, and the transformed cell was cultured in LB medium for 24 h at 25 °C. The harvested cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmMgSO4, 50 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was loaded on a 1-ml nickel-chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mmHEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20. The column was washed with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 30% glycerol, and a recombinant MPP was eluted with 500 mmimidazole in the same buffer. Purified MPP was stored at −20 °C until use. To obtain a cDNA of α-MPP(Δ10–129), α-MPP in pBluescript SK was digested at internalHindIII and ClaI sites, and the resultant larger fragment was self-ligated after filling with a Klenow fragment. To create the α-MPP(Δ144–450) precursor, a cDNA of α-MPP precursor was digested with ClaI and BamHI, and the larger fragment was self-ligated. C-terminal deletion mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA of α-MPP in pBluescript SK using appropriate oligonucleotides with stop codon as primers. Site-directed mutants of α-MPP were obtained by a polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension method using oligonucleotides with mutations and newly introduced restriction sites as primers (Table I). Mutation of the AAT precursor was directed to Arg8and/or His18. To introduce the mutation, we used the polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension method, as described above (Table I). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

The mRNAs for these precursor proteins were transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN Biomeds) (38Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled precursors were incubated with MPP at 30 °C for 10 min in reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5 mm MnCl2, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 mm EDTA. The processing products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Fluorogenic peptide modeled on the extension peptide of MDH precursor, 2-aminobenzoic acid-LARPVGAALRRSFSTY(NO2)AQNN, was incubated with MPP in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Excitation was at 315 nm, and emission was measured at 420 nm (27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorospectrometer. Synthetic peptide, MDH(1–24), MLSALARPVGAALRRSFSTSA was incubated with a native and a recombinant MPP in 400 ml of a reaction buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The processed products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a RPC-SC18 column (4.6 × 230 mm) (JASCO, Japan). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient established between 1 and 50% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 33 min. The substrate and product peptides were detected by monitoring at 215 nm. Michaelis constants (K m) and maximum velocities (V max) were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Molecular activity (k cat) was calculated by V max/[MPP]. The HPLC apparatus was used with Shimadzu LCA-10A. For N-terminal sequence analysis, about 400 pmol of purified sample was applied to Protein Sequencing System 491A (Perkin-Elmer). To reconstitute an active MPP, cDNAs for mature α- and β-MPP were inserted into pET-3d expression vector, and two proteins were co-expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. The recombinant MPP was purified using a nickel-chelating column through a hexahistidine tag attached to the C-terminal end of α-MPP. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that ratio of α- and β-MPP in the enzyme was nearly 1:1 (Fig. 1 B). The kinetic parameters of the recombinant enzyme were determined and compared with those of a native MPP partially purified from yeast mitochondria. Michaelis constants (K m) for a synthetic peptide modeled on the extension peptide of MDH were determined to be 0.24 and 0.44 μm for the native and recombinant MPP, respectively. Molecular activities (k cat) were 130 and 115 min−1 for the native and recombinant MPP, respectively. These results indicate that the recombinant MPP has substantially the same enzymatic properties as native MPP. To determine the functional domain of α-MPP, we constructed N- or C-terminal-deleted mutant and examined their activities. Mutants were co-expressed with β-MPP and purified with the nickel-chelating column, and interactions with β-MPP were analyzed. Recovery of the mutant α-MPP and β-MPP was analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels followed by protein staining or immunoblotting. An α-MPP(Δ10–129) mutant with amino acid residues from 10 to 129 deleted was co-purified with β-MPP that had a His tag at the C-terminal end (Fig. 1, A and C). The ratio of subunits in the purified complex was determined by immunoblotting using specific anitibodies. Although the extract from α-MPP(Δ10–129)/β-MPP-His-transformed cell contained similar amounts of the subunits, the recovery of co-purified α-MPP(Δ10–129) was lower than that of the counterpart (Fig. 1 D). The same held true for the α-MPP(Δ10–129)His·β-MPP complex, in which α-MPP(Δ10–129) was tagged (data not shown). We next constructed C-terminal deletion mutants in which 41, 84, and 122 amino acid residues were truncated from the C-terminal portion of α-MPP by introducing stop codons at appropriate positions (Fig. 1 A). After co-expression of the mutants with β-MPP-His, formation of the complex was examined using the nickel-chelating column as described above. In contrast to the N-terminal deletion mutant, none of the truncated mutants co-eluted with β-MPP-His (Fig. 1 C). Immunoblotting analysis showed that recovery of α-MPPDC41 into the extract was almost the same as that for the wild-type α-MPP, but α-MPPDC41 did not interact with β-MPP (Fig. 1 D). The wild-type and mutant MPP consisting of α-MPP(Δ10–129) and β-MPP-His were incubated with the fluorogenic peptide, then the processing activity was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme processed the fluorogenic peptide, although the activity was about 10% that of the wild-type enzyme. Taken together, deletion of the C-terminal portion resulted in a complete loss of the potential to interact with β-MPP and to exhibit enzyme activity, whereas that of the N terminus maintained those potentials to some extent. These results indicate that the C-terminal portion of α-MPP is more important for functions of α-MPP. Sequence alignment of MPPs revealed that α-MPP contains several highly conserved domains consisting of about 30 to 60 amino acids; some in the central and C-terminal portions of the subunit are characteristic in that they are rich in acidic amino acids. To determine whether these conserved residues interact with basic amino acids in the extension peptide of the precursors, five site-directed mutants with acidic amino acids replaced by neutral ones were constructed; mutations were aimed at a pair of glutamic acids at positions 197 and 201, a pair of glutamic acids at positions 351 and 353 and an aspartic acid at position 352, a pair of glutamic acids at position 377 and an aspartic acid at position 378, a glutamic acid at position 395, and a pair of aspartic acids at positions 405 and 406. Glutamic and aspartic acids were replaced by glutamine and asparagine, respectively. A hexahistidine tag was attached to the C-terminal end of each mutant, and the mutant protein was co-expressed with β-MPP in E. coli BL21 and then purified using the nickel-chelating column. All mutants were purified in a complex form at a ratio of nearly one to one between α- and β-MPP, which indicated that these mutations did not affect complex formation (data not shown). Processing activities of these mutants were examined for precursor proteins, yeast α-MPP, MDH, AAT, and Ad. Lengths of extension peptides of these proteins varied; the shortest one was 13 amino acids long (yeast α-MPP), and the longest one was 50 amino acids long (Ad). We first examined the effect of mutations in acidic amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of α-MPP on processing of p-α-MPP, a precursor with a short extension peptide. The precursor protein was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. It was difficult to clearly distinguish between the precursor and mature α-MPP, probably because of small difference in size (data not shown). We then used a truncated precursor, p-α-MPP(Δ140–450), as substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, the wild-type MPP processed about 20% p-α-MPP (Δ140–450) in 10 min, but the processed product migrated at a slower rate than in vitro synthesized authentic mature α-MPP(Δ140–450). All the mutant MPPs also processed the p-α-MPP(Δ140–450) with substantially the same processing efficiencies, indicating that the acidic amino acid residues mutated are not essential for processing of this precursor. The processed product was apparently larger in size than the authentic mature protein, which was constructed according to a report that p-α-MPP is cleaved at a peptide bond between Ile13 and Ala14 in the N-terminal sequence of Met-Leu-Arg-Asn-Gly-Val-Gln-Arg-Leu-Tyr-Ser-Asn-Ile-Ala (39Yang M. Geli V. Oppliger W. Suda K. James P. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we found that the arginine residue at the −2 position from a cleavage site is indispensable for recognition by MPP (24Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we asked if MPP would recognize a motif other than “−2 arginine” for the processing or would it cleave at a potential cleavage site, between Leu9 and Tyr10, upstream of this position. We then attempted to determine the correct cleavage site of p-α-MPP by MPP. The precursor bearing a His tag at its C-terminal end was constructed and was co-expressed with a non-His-tagged mature α- and β-MPP in E. coli cells. α-MPP precursor expressed was processed in situ by the active MPP complex expressed in the same cells. The His-tagged α-MPP was purified using a nickel-chelating column and subjected to analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence proved to be Tyr-Ser-Asn-Ile-Ala-Arg-Thr-Glu-Asn-Phe, corresponding exactly to the sequence from Tyr10 of the published N-terminal sequence of α-MPP precursor (39Yang M. Geli V. Oppliger W. Suda K. James P. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the primary processing site by MPP locates four amino acids upstream from the published N-terminal amino acid of the mature α-MPP. This implies that the “arginine −2 and hydrophobic +1 rule” (24Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is applicable to the α-MPP precursor. The difference in the N-terminal amino acid could be due to either a further processing by an unknown peptidase or to an artificial modification during a purification step of α-MPP from yeast cells. We next examined effects of mutation on processing of precursors with a longer extension peptide. When the MDH precursor was incubated with the wild-type MPP, about 70% pMDH was processed to the intermediate form in 10 min (Fig. 3 A). However, processing by the E351Q/D352N/E353Q mutant was never evident. Other mutants processed the precursor as a similar rate as seen with the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that acidic amino acid residues at position 351/352/353 have effects on the processing, and the processing mechanism of MDH differs from that of yeast α-MPP. When pAAT was incubated with wild-type MPP, it was processed to a mature form at a rate of 50% cleavage for 10 min (Fig. 3 B). The processing efficiency by either E351Q/D352N/E353Q mutant or the E377Q/D378N mutant was reduced to under 10% that of the wild type. Other mutants processed the substrate at a rate comparable with that seen with the wild type. Similar patterns were obtained in the case of processing of the adrenodoxin precursor. The wild-type MPP processed the pAd to an intermediate form at a rate of more than 70% cleavage in 10 min. Processing by the E351Q/D352N/E353Q mutant was significantly reduced, and processing products by the E377Q/D378N mutant were never evident (Fig. 3 C). Other mutant MPPs cleaved off the extension peptide at a rate similar to that seen with the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, effects of acidic amino acids on the processing vary with precursor. Replacements of acidic amino acid residues affected the processing of precursors that carry a longer extension peptide, which means that these acidic amino acids recognize distal basic amino acids in the extension peptide. To gain support for this thesis, we replaced basic amino acids in the extension peptide of pAAT and examined processing of these substrates by mutant MPPs. An arginine residue at position 8, a histidine residue at position 18, or both were mutated to alanine. These mutants are designated R8A, H18A, and R8A/H18A, respectively. When each of R8A and H18A was incubated with the wild-type MPP, the processing efficiency was reduced to a rate half that of pAAT (data not shown). In the case of the R8A/H18A mutant, processing was not evident. Therefore, two basic amino acid residues in the extension peptide of AAT are required for efficient processing, probably as distal basic amino acids. The relationship between distal basic amino acids and acidic amino acid clusters in α-MPP was investigated using E351Q/D352N/E353Q or E377Q/D378N or a double mutant, which carried both E351Q/D352N/E353Q and E377Q/D378N mutations. When the R8A substrate was incubated with the double mutant, there were essentially no processing products (Fig. 4). Although processing of R8A was at a comparable rate to that seen with the wild-type enzyme for the E377Q/D378N mutant, the E351Q/D352N/E353Q mutant processed the mutant precursor at a slow rate. These findings suggest that the cluster of Glu351-Asp352-Glu353 is effective for the recognition of His18 of pAAT. In case of the H18A substrate, little processing was detected by the double mutant, whereas E351Q/D352N/E353Q and E377Q/D378N mutants cleaved the substrate at almost half the rate of the wild-type enzyme. These observations indicate that both acidic clusters recognize Arg8 of pAAT. Taken together, Glu351-Asp352-Glu353 recognized basic amino acids at multiple sites in the extension peptide, thereby suggesting the possibility that orientation of Glu351-Asp352-Glu353 changes from His18 to Arg8 when His18 is replaced with alanine. To elucidate amino acid residues in acidic clusters critical for substrate recognition, single amino acid substituted mutants, E351Q, E353Q, E377Q, and D378N were constructed. Since Asp352 is not conserved among species, it was replaced by asparagine. When pMDH was incubated with the E351Q and E353Q mutants, the latter did not produce the intermediate form of MDH (Fig. 5 A). Thus, in the acidic cluster from 351 to 353, Glu353 is critical for recognizing distal basic amino acids in the extension peptide. The E353Q mutant also did not process pAd and pAAT. In the case of E377Q and D378N mutants, these two amino acids seemed to contribute equally to the processing. When either the E377Q or the D378N mutant was incubated with pAAT, the substrate was processed at half the rate seen with the wild type (Fig. 5 B). This reduction was also observed when pAd served as substrate (Fig. 5 C); therefore, the same recognition mechanism generally functions in case of different substrates.

We substituted acidic amino acid residues in the central or the C-terminal region of α-MPP, which are conserved in subunits among many species. The effects of this substitution on the processing differed with the precursor protein depending on length of the extension peptides (Fig. 6). Mutations affected only processing of precursors with longer extension peptides, and effects of mutations seem to correlate with location of distal basic amino acids in the extension peptides. A distal basic amino acid of yeast α-MPP precursor, which has a short extension peptide, does not seem to be required for the processing since Arg3 of yeast α-MPP could replace alanine without affecting the processing, 2K. Shimokata, unpublished data. and only one arginine residue at position −2 functioned as a basic amino acid interacting with MPP. In this case, there is no interaction between the extension peptide and these acidic residues in α-MPP. In contrast, Arg7 of pMDH, Arg13 and His18 of pAAT and a pair of Arg25 and Arg27 and another pair of Arg34 and Arg37 of pAd, which proved necessary for the processing (23Ou W-J. Kumamoto T. Mihara K.

The proximal (position −2) arginine and distal basic amino acids are not sufficient for specific recognition of extension peptides by MPP, because arginine and lysine residues are present at multiple positions in all proteins. We reported earlier that, in addition to these residues, an aromatic or hydrophobic amino acid residue at position +1 is important for processing of the precursors (27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hydrophilic amino acids like serine, threonine, and histidine at positions +2 and +3 are also important for effective processing. 3M.-C. Song, unpublished data. Thus, a combination of distal basic amino acids and residues around the cleavage site appears to be responsible for recognition of the substrates and for determination of the cleavage site by MPP. However, since not all the extension peptides have a full set of these elements, especially of distal basic residues, all the elements are not indispensable for the processing. A structure around the cleavage site that is formed of the proximal arginine and the residues at position 1, 2, and 3 is probably common to all the precursors, and number and position of distal basic residues vary among the extension peptides. The peptidase must have several substrate binding sites to cope with these distal basic residues, whereas each extension peptide seems to have structural elements corresponding to only some of these binding sites. Flexible linker regions rich in glycine and proline in the middle portion of the extension peptides seem to aid extension peptides in fitting into multiple binding sites in MPP, because the region is necessary for effective cleavage by MPP (27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concerted action of common and additional structural elements in the extension peptide may be able to render strict specificity and high affinity to MPP for precursors with structures little in common, and cooperative formation of the substrate binding pocket by two subunits could make it feasible. The α- and β-subunits of the MPP are homologous to core 2 and core 1 proteins, respectively, of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc1 complex), a component of the respiratory chain (16Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of the bc1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria has recently been reported (34Xia D., Yu, C-A. Kim H. Xia J-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Disenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Core 1 and core 2 proteins are structurally similar and consist of two domains of roughly equal size and almost identical folding topology. In dimer form, the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the core 1 and core 2, respectively, face each other, and they form a groove leading to the internal cavity, the wall of which is lined with mostly hydrophilic amino acid residues. From sequence similarity between core proteins and subunits of MPP and the finding that core 1 and core 2 proteins of the bc1 complex function as the processing peptidase of plant mitochondria (16Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Braun H.-P. Emmermanm M. Kruft V.

Acta. 1992; 1140: 208-214Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), one can expect that MPP is similar in structure to the core protein complex. We found that complex formation of the two subunits of MPP is essential for high affinity binding of substrates to the enzyme. 4K. Kojima, unpublished results. These findings, together with the present results, suggest that the substrate binding pocket of the MPP is formed by both subunits, and on the wall of the pocket, metal binding sites of the β-subunit and negatively charged amino acids in both subunits are present."

The results demonstrate that changing Asp336 of FucT III to Ala (as in FucT V) produced a protein (III/V1) with a reduced activity with a variety of acceptors. An analysis of the kinetic properties of FucT III and the III/V1 mutant demonstrated that III/V1 had a 40-fold reduction in its affinity for the H-type 1 acceptor substrate (Fucα1,2Galβ1,3GlcNAc) and 4-fold reduction in its affinity for GDP-fucose when compared with FucT III. Further, the overall catalytic efficiency of III/V1 was ∼100-fold lower than that of FucT III with an H-type 1 acceptor substrate. The complementary domain swap resulting from the change of Ala349 of FucT V to Asp (V/III1) produced a FucT that had higher enzyme activity with a range of acceptor substrates and had a higher affinity for an H-type 2 acceptor substrate (Fucα1,2Galβ1,4GlcNAc) with an 8-fold higher overall catalytic efficiency than that of FucT V. No significant change occurred in the K m for GDP-fucose for this protein when compared with FucT V. Kinetic parameters of two other FucT domain swaps (III8/V and V8/III), resulting in proteins that differed from FucT III and V at the NH2terminus of their catalytic domain, were not significantly different from those of the parental enzymes when H-type 1 and H-type 2 acceptor substrates were utilized.

Thus, FucT III has predominantly α1,4-FucT activity with disaccharide acceptors (having some activity with selected type 2 acceptor substrates, e.g.H-type 2), whereas FucTs VI appears to be a true α1,3-FucT. The acceptor substrate specificity of FucT V is more complex and depends on the type of acceptor substrate utilized. For example, when simple disaccharides are used in a “so called” Dowex assay as substrates, FucT V has very low α1,4-FucT activity (<5%) compared with α1,3-FucT activity. In contrast, FucT V catalyzes the transfer of fucose to a type 1 acceptor substrate with an aliphatic aglycone to a much greater extent than to the type 1 disaccharide (11de Vries T. Srnka C.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the catalytic domain of FucT III and V contained approximately 300 amino acids. These experiments utilized recombinant chimeric forms of the enzymes missing portions of the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem regions expressed as fusion proteins with the protein A Ig-binding domain. Analysis of the enzymatic and substrate specificity properties of these chimeric enzymes indicated they behaved very similarly to both full-length enzymes and the truncated form without the protein A domain (11de Vries T.

This information, coupled with the ease of purifying the expressed chimeric enzyme via IgG-agarose beads, makes this system very convenient for studying functional aspects of amino acid alterations in the catalytic domain on enzyme activity. In this earlier study (13Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol.

Thus, the acceptor substrate specificity of these FucTs can be altered by mutating a few amino acid residues (13Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol.

Thus far, the amino acids that have been shown to affect acceptor substrate specificity are located near the NH2 terminus of the catalytic domain of the FucTs. In the current study, we demonstrate that a single amino acid at the COOH terminus of FucTs III and V is important for the binding of H-type 1 and 2 acceptor substrate and their conversion to product.

Domain swaps between FucT III and V were prepared as described previously (13Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol.

Domain swaps were designed based on the presence of conserved restriction enzyme sites in FucTs III and V. The coding sequences for FucT III and V were each treated with the enzyme HaeII. This produced fragments encoding amino acids 62–131 and 132–361 of FucT III and amino acids 76–146 and 147–374 of FucT V. Digest fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with a QIAEX gel extraction kit. The fragments were ligated to give the chimeric FucTs FucT III-(62–131)/FucT V-(147–374) and FucT V-(76–146)/FucT III-(132–361) and inserted into the vector, pPROTA. The resulting plasmids were propagated in the JM109 strain of Escherichia coli and transfected into COS-7 cells. The recombinant enzymes were expressed as soluble proteins with an NH2-terminal protein A, IgG binding domain.

Presumably, FucTs have evolved from a common ancestral gene by mutational processes in a limited number of amino acids. We have prepared three sets of complementary domain swap proteins (Fig. 1) that retain fucosyltransferase activity to investigate the question of which of the amino acid differences that occur between FucT III and V account for their unique substrate specificities. Each was characterized with respect to pH optimum, metal ion requirements, and other reaction condition variables and found to resemble FucTs III and V in their optimal reaction conditions (results not shown). One set (III8/V and V8/III) has proven useful for probing amino acids that account for the observed difference in type 1 and type 2 acceptor substrate specificities (see accompanying article (15Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Another set (III14/V and V14/III) has been partially characterized and shown 2L. Vo and B. A. Macher, unpublished results. to catalyze the transfer of fucose to H-type 1 and 2 acceptor substrates but not to other neutral or sialylated acceptor substrates. The third set of chimeric FucTs (III/V1 and V/III1) contain a single amino acid change near the COOH terminus (Fig. 1); III/V1 contains an Asp to Ala substitution at amino acid 336 of the FucT III sequence, and V/III1 has the complementary substitution (i.e. Ala to Asp at amino acid 349 of the FucT V sequence). Preliminary analyses of these proteins, at a single concentration of the simple acceptor substrate Galβ1,3GlcNAc and Galβ1,4GlcNAc, have shown that they have an acceptor substrate specificity similar to the corresponding parental enzyme (13Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, III/V1 and FucT III are essentially α1,4-FucTs with disaccharide acceptors, whereas V/III1 and FucT V have higher activity with type 2 than with type 1 acceptor disaccharides. An interesting trend was noted when these chimeric enzymes were further characterized with a range of acceptor substrates as illustrated in Fig. 2. III/V1 consistently has a lower activity than FucT III for three different type 1 acceptor substrates (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast, the V/III1 chimera consistently showed a higher activity than FucT V with a set of type 2 acceptor substrates (Fig. 2,D–F). These results suggest that the single amino acid site (Asp336 of FucT III and Ala349 of FucT V), which constitutes the only difference in the sequence of FucT III and V over the final 210 COOH-terminal amino acid residues, impacts the acceptor substrate profiles of FucT III and V. To further characterize the effects of this amino acid substitution, substrate saturation curves with the favored acceptor substrates (H-type 1 for FucT III and III/V1, and H-type 2 for FucT V and V/III1) were carried out.Figure 2Enzyme activity measurements of various FucT constructs with three acceptor substrates.

The V m(app) (46versus 120 nmol/min mg) and K cat (see Table I) for III/V1 are approximately 2-fold lower than that for FucT III. An even larger difference (∼40-fold) was determined for the apparent affinity constant of FucT III versus III/V1 for the acceptor substrate. Overall, the catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) was reduced nearly 100-fold for III/V1 compared with that of FucT III. In contrast, a comparison of kinetic parameters for FucT III and a chimeric FucT resulting from the substitution of a portion of the NH2 terminus of the catalytic domain of FucT V for the corresponding region of FucT III (i.e. V8/III; see Fig. 1) shows that these two proteins have similar kinetic parameters (<2-fold change in K m(app)and K cat).Table IKinetic parameters for FucTs and domain swaps with an H-type 1 and H-type 2 acceptor substrateEnzymeK m(app)K catK cat/K mmmminmm× minH-type 1 FucT III0.1 ± 0.018.02 ± 0.6380.20 III/V13.8 ± 0.43.02 ± 0.260.82 V8/III0.4 ± 0.34.44 ± 0.2811.10H-type 2 FucT V3.9 ± 0.41.70 ± 0.150.44 V/III11.1 ± 0.13.60 ± 0.163.28 III8/V2.6 ± 0.41.08 ± 0.120.42 Open table in a new tab Similar analyses were carried out with FucT V and V/III1using an H-type 2 acceptor substrate (Fig. 4, A and B). TheV m(app) (54 versus 26 nmol/min mg) and K cat (see Table I) for III/V1 are approximately 2-fold higher than that for FucT V. A slightly larger difference (∼4-fold) was observed for the apparent affinity constant of V/III1 versus FucT V for the acceptor substrate. Overall, the catalytic efficiency was increased approximately 8-fold for V/III1 compared with that of FucT V. In contrast, a comparison of kinetic parameters for FucT V and a chimeric FucT resulting from the substitution of a portion of the NH2 terminus of the catalytic domain of FucT III for the corresponding region of FucT V (i.e. III8/V; see Fig. 1) shows that these two proteins have similar kinetic parameters and essentially identical catalytic efficiency constants. Substrate saturation curves for GDP-fucose were carried out for FucT III and V and the domain swap FucTs, and the K m for each is presented in Table II. The results demonstrate that all but one (III/V1) had a similar affinity for the nucleotide sugar donor substrate. TheK m(GDP-fucose) for III/V1was 4–5 times as large as that found for the FucTs, indicating that the single amino acid substitution near the COOH terminus of this protein (compared with FucT III) significantly reduces the protein's affinity for GDP-fucose.Table IIKm values for FucTs and domain swaps with GDP-fucoseEnzymeK mμmFucT III33.6III/V1114.5V8/III23.3FucT V18.8V/III123.3III8/V21.8 Open table in a new tab Among the five human FucTs that have been cloned, three (FucTs III, V, and VI) have a high degree of sequence homology, yet they have unique acceptor substrate specificities.

Interestingly, it appears that nonprimate mammals do not have the same complement of FucTs but have a single form of FucT, which shares considerable sequence homology (Fig. 5) with primate FucTs III, V, and VI (18Oulmouden A.

This enzyme has a specificity that is most like that of human and chimpanzee FucT VI. A comparison of amino acid sequences of the COOH-terminal half of the catalytic domains of FucTs III, V, and VI shows that these enzymes have a remarkable degree of homology within a given species and between species. Among the few amino acids that have not been conserved in the COOH-terminal half of the catalytic domain of FucTs III, V, and VI is one that exists as either an Ala or an Asp residue, depending on the enzyme. Thus, both human and chimpanzee FucT III enzymes have an Asp residue at this amino acid position (amino acid 336 and 347, respectively). Human FucT V has an Ala residue at the equivalent position (i.e. amino acid 349), whereas the chimpanzee FucT V contains an Asp residue. Both the human and chimpanzee FucT VI proteins have an Ala residue at the corresponding position (amino acid 335). Thus, all primate forms of FucT III, V, and VI contain either an Ala or Asp at this position. The results we present here demonstrate that this single amino acid can significantly affect the substrate binding and catalytic efficiency of the FucTs. Specifically, the substitution of Ala for Asp in FucT III produces an enzyme that is less active than the wild-type enzyme when tested with three different acceptor substrates. Furthermore, this substitution produces an enzyme with reduced apparent affinity for both of its substrates (i.e. H-type 1 and GDP-fucose) and with an overall reduction in catalytic efficiency. Interestingly, the complementary substitution in FucT V (Asp for Ala) in the corresponding position of the amino acid sequence generates an enzyme that is more active than FucT V and has a higher apparent affinity for the acceptor substrate. Based on the results we have obtained, it can be concluded that the substitution of a nonpolar amino acid for a negatively charged residue at amino acid 336 of the FucT III sequence significantly affects the enzyme's substrate binding properties. Thus, the presence of an Asp residue in FucT III and V produces an inherently more active enzyme. It is not clear whether a more conservative substitution (e.g. Asp to Glu, to maintain a similar charge; or Asp to Asn, to preserve a similar function group) would produce a protein with properties similar to those of the wild-type enzyme or if there is a high specificity for the side chain of Asp. Further mutational analyses are currently in progress to address these issues. Other single amino acid substitutions in the coding region of FucTs have been identified in the tissues and serum of individuals who are classified as Lewis- or plasma FucT-negative (19Nishihara S.

These mutations have been identified by sequencing the coding region of the FucT on the alleles of negative individuals and, in some cases, by evaluating the consequence of such mutations on the in vitro activity (enzyme assay and/or cell surface expression of Lewis antigens) of the FucT. Several mutations have been identified in FucT III. Among these mutations is one at amino acid residue 20 that appears to result in the mistargeting (secreted instead of Golgi retention) of the enzyme (26Mollicone R. Reguigne I. Fletcher A. Aziz A.

Another amino acid mutation in FucT III (Thr105 → Met), which has always been found in conjunction with the Trp68 → Arg mutation, does not lead to a reduction in enzyme activity compared with wild-type FucT III when expressed alone. However, Elmgren et al. (24Elmgren A. Mollicone R. Costache M. Börjeson C. Oriol R. Harrington J. Larson G. J. Biol.

The Trp68 → Arg mutant was found to dramatically decrease the enzyme's V max, but it did not affect the enzyme's affinity for either the acceptor or nucleotide sugar donor substrates. Some individuals who lack plasma FucT activity have been shown to have a mutation that results in the substitution of Lys for Glu at amino acid 247 of FucT VI (26Mollicone R. Reguigne I. Fletcher A.

Another mutation (Pro124 → Ser) has been found in the FT VI sequence (26Mollicone R. Reguigne I. Fletcher A. Aziz A. Rustam M. Weston B.W. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. Oriol R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12662-12671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrate that this mutation results in an enzyme with higher activity (2–3-fold) than wild-type enzyme. The mutations that result in FT III and VI inactivations are spread across the catalytic domain of these enzymes. The mechanism of inactivation is unknown. The mutations generally produce dramatic changes in the character of the amino acid (e.g. Ile356 → Arg). All mutations occur at sites where there is a high degree of sequence conservation (when comparing different FucTs from the same species as well as when comparing the same or different FucTs across species). Further studies are required to provide the information necessary to understand why such variant mutations all lead to enzyme inactivation. Studies of other glycosyltransferases have also demonstrated that single amino acid changes can affect substrate binding. For example, Datta and Paulson (27Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) established that the binding of CMP-sialic acid can be altered significantly by the mutation of single amino acid residues within the “sialylmotif.” Yamamoto and McNeill (28Yamamoto F.

Further studies of this type, along with protein chemical studies, are needed to establish the nature of the substrate binding sites in glycosyltransferases. The results we report here and in the accompanying papers (15Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol.

Although little is known about the disulfide bond pattern of glycosyltransferases, this possibility is consistent with what has been previously published. Thus, the disulfide bonding pattern of β1,4-galactosyltransferase (5Zu H. Fukuda M.N. Wong S.S. Wang Y. Liu Z. Tang Q. Appert H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1991; 266: 698-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been established, and it has been shown that among the five Cys residues found in human β1,4-galactosyltransferase sequence, only two (Cys134 and Cys245; amino acid numbering based on the sequence of the human enzyme) are involved in a disulfide bond. This disulfide bond brings together two segments of the protein that are more than 100 amino acids apart in the linear sequence. As shown in Fig. 5, two sets of highly conserved Cys residues are found near the NH2 and COOH termini of the catalytic domain of FucTs III, V, and VI. If the NH2 and COOH termini of FucTs are located near one another, it is possible that this arrangement is stabilized by a disulfide bond(s) between Cys residues at the ends of the catalytic domain of FucTs. We have initiated studies to determine if this hypothesis is true by creating Cys to Ser mutants at each conserved Cys residue. DNA sequencing was done by the San Francisco State University DNA Sequencing Facility."
https://openalex.org/W2022624295,"Abstract The iodothyronine deiodinases are a family of oxidoreductases that catalyze the removal of iodide from thyroid hormones. Each of the three isoforms contain selenocysteine at its active site and several cysteine residues that may be important for catalytic activity. Of particular interest in the type I deiodinase (D1) is Cys124, which is vicinal to the selenocysteine at position 126, and Cys194, which has been conserved in all deiodinases identified to date. In the present studies, we have characterized the functional properties of C124A, C194A, and C124A/C194A D1 mutants, which were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in COS-7 cells. In broken cell preparations, the sensitivity of the mutants to the selective D1 inhibitors propylthiouracil and aurothioglucose were unaltered. Mutagenesis at the Cys124 position was associated with a 7–11-fold increase in the K m of dithiothreitol, whereasV max values remained largely unchanged. However, both mutations resulted in marked decreases inV max values when glutathione or a reconstituted thioredoxin cofactor system were used in the assay. In contrast to the results of these in vitro studies, no impairment in deiodinating capability was noted in intact cells expressing equivalent levels of the mutant constructs. These studies demonstrate that Cys124 and Cys194 influence the reactivity of the D1 with thiol cofactors in in vitro assay systems but are not determinants of the sensitivity of the enzyme to propylthiouracil and aurothioglucose. Furthermore, the observation that the cysteine mutants are fully active in intact cells demonstrates that the results of commonly used broken cell assays do not accurately predict the activity of the D1 in intact cells and suggests that glutathione and thioredoxin are not the major thiols utilized in vivo to support D1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987606627,"Amino acid sequence alignment of human α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases (FucTs) demonstrates that three highly conserved Lys residues are present in the catalytic domain of FucTs III, IV, V, and VI. Two of these sites are conserved in FucT VII, with the third located within the α1,3-FucT motif as a conservative change to Arg at position 223. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were conducted to change Lys255 of FucT V (equivalent to Arg223 of FucT VII) to either Arg255 or Ala255. Enzyme assays demonstrate that the FucT V K255R mutant has a 34-fold lower specific activity than native FucT V and that the K255A mutant is inactive. Site-directed mutagenesis of FucT VII was also conducted to change Arg223 to Lys223 for analysis of the effect on enzyme kinetic parameters. No differences in acceptor specificities orK m values for either substrate were observed between native FucT VII and the R223K mutant; however, the purified R223K mutant enzyme had a 2-fold increased specific activity compared with purified native FucT VII. No change in GDP-fucose-protectable pyridoxal-P/NaBH4 inactivation was observed for native or mutant FucT V or VII, further supporting the absence of involvement of this residue in sugar nucleotide binding. The results indicate that a basic residue in this position is required for enzyme activity, with a Lys residue providing higher intrinsic activity. The lack of influence of this site on substrate binding parameters and its location within the α1,3-FucT motif suggest that at least some of the residues within this motif are involved in catalysis rather than substrate binding.

Analysis of their deduced amino acid sequences demonstrates that a variable number of Lys residues are present. FucTs III, V, and VI are highly homologous and contain 13, 12, and 12 Lys residues, respectively. In contrast, FucTs VII and IV contain only two and five Lys residues, respectively. Sequence alignment analysis of these forms demonstrate that nine of the Lys residues present in FucT III, V, and VI are in equivalent positions. Of these, three Lys residues can be aligned with Lys residues found in the FucT III, IV, V, and VI sequences. The FucT VII sequence contains two of these Lys residues, and a conservative substitution (Arg223) occurs at the third site. The sites corresponding to Arg223 and Lys240 of FucT VII are located in the so-called α1,3-FucT motif of amino acids that are highly conserved among FucT enzymes (15Martin S.L. Edbrooke M.R.

The highly conserved nature of these three amino acid sites strongly suggests that one or more are critical for enzymatic activity. We have previously shown that at least one catalytically essential Lys residue is present in human FucTs (17Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and is protected from PLP/NaBH4 inactivation by GDP or GDP-fucose. We have initiated a series of site-directed mutagenesis studies to investigate the importance of the Lys (or Arg) residues that are highly conserved among the FucTs. Initial mutagenesis studies were done to evaluate Lys255 in FucT V, which corresponds to Arg223of FucT VII, changing it to an Arg or Ala residue. Further site-directed mutagenesis experiments were conducted to convert Arg223 to Lys223 in FucT VII. The results of these investigations demonstrate that this Lys/Arg residue is critical for FucT activity and that even conservative amino acid substitutions significantly affect enzyme activity. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Sodium taurodeoxycholate, GDP-fucose, and DEAE-dextran were obtained from Sigma. Plasmid pZErO-1 was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), and plasmid pCDM8-FucT VII was kindly supplied by Dr. John Lowe (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). PCR primers were made on a Beckman Oligo 1000 Synthesizer or obtained from Operon (Alameda, CA). DNA sequencing was done using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit or the Sequenase PCR product sequencing kit obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. GDP-[14C]fucose (270 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [35S]dATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Sialosyllactoneotetraosylceramide 2Glycolipids are designated according to the recommendations of the IUPAC Nomenclature Committee (35IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature Lipids. 1977; 12: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), but the suffix OseCer is omitted. The major glycolipids considered in this study are as follows: sialosyllactoneotetraosylceramide (IV3NeuAcnLc4), NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1Cer; sialosylneolactonorhexaosylceramide (VI3NeuAcnLc6), and NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1→1Cer.and sialosylneolactonorhexaosylceramide were prepared from bovine erythrocytes (18Chien J.L. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4031-4035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Parental, native FucT coding sequences for site-directed mutagenesis were either full-length forms expressed in the pCDM8 vector or truncated catalytic domain forms in the pPROTA vector. Properties of pPROTA-expressed enzymes have been shown to be very similar to those of full-length enzymes (26De Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M.M. Swiedler S.L. van den Eijnden D.H. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8712-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of FucT V in pPROTA forming the two mutants K255R and K255A was conducted as follows via recombinant PCR (19Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The two flanking primers used for the two FucT V mutants were B14 (which contains an EcoRI site and nucleotides flanking the truncated form of FucT V, i.e. from Leu76) and C6 (containing nucleotides flanking the COOH-terminal end of FucT V,i.e. Thr374, a STOP codon, and anEcoRI site). The flanking primers were B14 (5′-CCCGAATTCGCTACTGATCCTGCTGTGGACG-3′) and C6 (5′-GCTGAATTCTCAGGTGAACCAAGCCGCTA-3′). K255R mutagenic primers were V5K255R (5′-ACGCTGTCCCGGTACAGGTTCTATCTGGCCTTC-3′) and V3K255R (5′-GAAGGCCAGATAGAACCTGTACCGGGACAGCGT-3′). K255A mutagenic primers were V5K255A (5′-ACGCTGTCCCGGTACGCGTTCTATCTGGCCTTC-3′) and V3K255A (5′-GAAGGCCAGATAGAACGCGTACCGGGACAGCGT-3′). In the first step, a specific mutation was introduced by using a pair of mutagenic primers and a pair of opposite end flanking primers. For the K255R mutant, for example, one PCR mixture included the B14 and V3K255R primers to generate the N-terminal half of the “mutated” FucT V; another PCR mixture included V5K255R and C6 primers to generate the C-terminal half of the “mutated” FucT V. The PCR products were gel-purified and used together with both flanking primers for the second-step PCR mixture. The resulting PCR product was a 916-base pair DNA fragment encoding the truncated FucT V (Leu76–Thr374). The 916-base pair DNA fragment was then purified, cut with EcoRI, and subcloned into pPROTA. Bacterial clones containing plasmids in the correct orientation were screened with HindIII and StuI double digestions. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencing system. Site-directed mutagenesis of FucT VII forming the R223K mutant was performed using the same approach with the following primers. The flanking primers produced a 939-base pair product encompassing amino acids Thr40–Ala342 of FucT VII in the pPROTA vector. Flanking primers were 5′-CTGAATTCGACCCCGGCACCCCAGCCC-3′ (upper) and 5′-TCCGAATTCCAGCGGATCTCAGGCCTG-3′ (lower). R223K mutagenic primers were VII5R223K (5′-GCCAGCTGCCTGGTGCCCACCGTGGCCCAGTACAAATTC-3′) and VII3R223K (5′-GTAGAATTTGTACTGGGCCACGGTGGGCAC-3′). The PCR product from the second step PCR mixture was briefly treated with mung bean nuclease and cloned into the EcoRV site of pZErO-1 plasmid, and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing system. The insert containing the desired mutation was then excised withEcoRI and cloned into pPROTA as described above for FucT V mutants. The correct orientation was established byHindIII/MscI double digestion. Plasmids were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum using the DEAE-dextran method (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar), and the expressed protein was isolated on IgG-agarose beads as described previously (21Holmes E.H. Xu Z. Sherwood A.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8145-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The pCDM8 FucT VII plasmid contains the full coding sequence of FucT VII plus approximately 0.78 kilobase pair of 3′-untranslated region. A NotI cassette of approximately 1.5 kilobase pairs, encompassing NotI (nucleotide 329) within the FucT VII gene through the end of the 3′-untranslated region was excised from parental pCDM8-FucT VII and replaced with a 0.718-kilobase pair NotI cassette from pZErO-1-FucT VII-R223K mutant. This cassette represents the same coding portion of the FucT VII gene (including the R223K mutation), minus the 3′-untranslated sequence. Orientation was established viaEcoRI/MscI digestion. The resultant plasmid, pCDM8-FucT VII-R223K, along with native pCDM8-FucT VII, was subsequently used in transfections using the DEAE-dextran method (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar) and harvested after 5 days. FucT activity using glycolipid acceptors was determined in reaction mixtures containing 2.5 μmol of HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 1 μmol of MnCl2, 100 μg of taurodeoxycholic acid, 20 μg IV3NeuAcnLc4 or VI3NeuAcnLc6, 15 nmol of GDP-[14C]fucose (15,000 cpm/nmol), and 300–400 μg of protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Cells expressing full-length enzymes were homogenized by two strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in a buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 25% glycerol. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h, terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH, 2:1, and quantitated as described previously (22Stroud M.R. Holmes E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FucT enzyme activities utilizing oligosaccharide acceptors were determined in reaction mixtures composed of 1 μmol of HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 6 nmol of GDP-[14C]fucose (15,000 cpm/nmol), 0.4 μmol of LacNAc or 0.072 μmol of 8-methoxycarbonyloctyl glycoside derivatives, 2 μmol of NaCl, 0.125 μmol of MnCl2, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.01 μmol of ATP, and chimeric enzyme bound to IgG-agarose beads in a total volume of 0.02 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and stopped and quantitated as described previously utilizing Dowex-1 for oligosaccharide acceptors (26De Vries T. Srnka C.A.

The pPROTA-expressed recombinant FucT enzymes were separated on 12% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed as described in an accompanying paper (34Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 0.5 g of PLP, was initially purified by Dowex-1 chromatography with elution by an acetic acid gradient. Fractions containing PLP were pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1 m NaHCO3, and adjusted to pH 7.0 for use in the following experiments, all conducted under subdued light. PLP treatment of enzymes expressed as pPROTA fusion proteins bound to IgG-agarose beads were conducted in reaction mixtures containing 5 μl of packed enzyme beads in a phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) slurry and PLP varying from 0.5 to 2 mm final concentration in a total volume of 50 μl. In some reaction mixtures, GDP-fucose was added at a final concentration of 300 μm. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, a 15-fold excess of NaBH4 dissolved in water was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 15 min. The enzyme activity remaining was then determined using assay conditions described above. Site-directed mutagenesis of FucT V was performed by replacing the sequence for codon 255 (AAG) with AGG for Arg or GCG for Ala and with FucT VII to change the sequence for codon 223 (CGC) to AAA for Arg. Sequencing on both strands of all mutants confirmed that there were no other nucleotide modifications compared with the respective native enzyme (results not shown). Table I shows the effect of the K255R and K255A mutations of FucT V on enzyme specific activity. For this comparison, the enzymes were expressed as soluble fusion proteins of the catalytic domain of the enzymes with the protein A Ig binding domain using the pPROTA vector. These enzyme forms have the important advantage of allowing convenient protein isolation and protein determinations needed for accurate specific activity measurements of the purified enzyme. Replacement of the Lys residue by Arg reduced the enzyme's specific activity 34-fold compared with the native enzyme. Replacement by an Ala residue inactivated the enzyme. Western blot analysis demonstrated that each mutant was expressed at levels comparable with that of the wild type enzyme and that each produced a single band with a molecular weight corresponding to that of the wild type enzyme (results not shown). The dramatic decrease in specific activity for the K255R mutant precluded a kinetic analysis of this enzyme to accurately determine the nature of the changes in kinetic parameters caused by this mutation. To test kinetic parameters and to determine if a Lys residue in this site was generally optimal for activity, an Arg to Lys mutant at the corresponding site of FucT VII (Arg223) was prepared for a kinetic evaluation.Table ISpecific activity of pPROTA-expressed native and mutant FucT V enzymesFucT V enzyme formActivitynmol/h/mg proteinNative48.0K255R mutant1.4K255A mutantNDAssays were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” using LacNAc as the acceptor.ND, none detected. Open table in a new tab Assays were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” using LacNAc as the acceptor. ND, none detected. An analysis of acceptor specificity and enzyme-specific activity of native FucT VII and the R223K mutant was conducted by expression of the catalytic domains for both enzymes in the pPROTA vector. The results shown in Table IIconfirm the requirement of a terminal sialyl substitution on the acceptor for optimal activity for both the native FucT VII and the R223K mutant. Product formation occurred with 3′-sulfo-LacNAc at a rate 20–25% of that found with 3′-sialyl-LacNAc. This demonstrates the importance of a negative charge at the nonreducing end of the acceptor for activity. The FucT VII R223K enzyme form had 2-fold higher specific activity than native FucT VII when assayed with sialyl-LacNAc-R1 acceptor. Overall, the results demonstrate that the change of Arg223 to Lys223 in FucT VII had no effect on acceptor specificity but had a substantial effect on the intrinsic activity of the enzyme in a manner predicted by the results with native FucT V and its K255R mutant.Table IIAcceptor specificity of pPROTA-expressed native and R223K mutant FucT VII enzymesAcceptorActivityNativeR223K mutantnmol/h/mg proteinFucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAc-R15.213.4SO4→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc-R118.030.8NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc-R171.2143.6Galβ1→4GlcNAc-R10.82.8Galβ1→3GlcNAc-R1NDNDacceptors used were the indicated oligosaccharides coupled to a hydrophobic tail composed of R1 = O-(CH2)8-COOCH3, each present at a final concentration of 3.6 mm.ND, none detected.

ND, none detected. Transfer of fucose into multiple glycolipid acceptors was also tested with full-length forms of the native FucT VII and R223K mutant enzymes expressed using the pCDM8 vector in COS-7 cells. Fig. 2 shows results from transfer of labeled fucose into glycolipid acceptors using crude homogenates of COS-7 cells expressing the full-length enzymes. Fucose transfer was only observed into sialylated acceptors IV3NeuAcnLcOse4Cer and VI3NeuAcnLcOse6Cer. No detectable product was observed with nLcOse4Cer as an acceptor or with mock-transfected COS-7 cell extracts (results not shown). Qualitatively identical results were obtained with both the native and R223K enzymes. However, transfer was always much greater with homogenates of COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the full-length R223K enzyme compared with native FucT VII, consistent with the observation from the pPROTA-expressed enzyme forms that the R223K mutant was an inherently more active enzyme. Only monofucosylated products were obtained with each enzyme, with transfer to VI3NeuAcnLcOse6Cer (lanes 3 and 4) yielding exclusively the product VI3NeuAcV3FucnLcOse6Cer (results not shown; see Ref. 22Stroud M.R. Holmes E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The increased specific activity of the FucT VII R223K mutant compared with the native form made it possible to conduct a kinetic analysis of these enzymes to determine if the increased specific activity of the R223K enzyme was due to a K m orV max effect on the enzyme. Saturation kinetics with both donor and acceptor substrates was studied for both pPROTA-expressed enzyme forms (Fig. 3). No differences in the K m for GDP-fucose was found for the mutant versus wild type enzyme, with observedK m values of 9.2 ± 0.3 and 10.8 ± 1.4 μm for the native FucT VII and R223K enzyme, respectively. Similarly, the K m for sialyl-LacNAc-R1 was the same for both enzymes at 0.70 ± 0.02 and 0.70 ± 0.05 mm for the native FucT VII and R223K enzymes, respectively. Thus, the increased specific activity of the R223K mutant is a V max effect and indicates that a Lys residue in this position creates an inherently more active enzyme. The presence of a PLP/NaBH4-sensitive Lys residue that lies in or near the GDP-fucose binding site has previously been demonstrated (17Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine if Lys255 of FucT V is this residue, a series of PLP inactivation studies were conducted with pPROTA-expressed mutant FucT V and VII enzymes. These enzymes were treated with increasing concentrations of PLP followed by NaBH4 reduction to determine if the Lys group in this position was associated with GDP-fucose-protectable enzyme inactivation. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Panels A–Cshow the GDP-fucose-protectable inactivation of FucTs III, IV, and VI as positive controls confirming the general property of PLP/NaBH4 sensitivity among human FucTs. Panels D and E demonstrate that both the native and K255R FucT V and native and R223K FucT VII enzymes, respectively, are inactivated by PLP/NaBH4 to a similar extent. The extent of the inactivation of the FucT VII enzymes was less than that seen for the expressed pPROTA constructs of the other FucT enzymes at the same PLP concentrations (panels A–D), suggesting that the native and R223K FucT VII enzymes have a lower affinity for PLP compared with other FucTs. Analysis of the K i for PLP for both the native and R223K FucT VII enzymes demonstrate that each enzyme had a K i of approximately 2 mm (results not shown). This compares to aK i for PLP of 105 μm previously reported for the enzyme derived from NCI-H69 cells (17Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed inactivation results demonstrate that PLP inactivation of native and R223K FucT VII enzymes occurs over a wider PLP concentration range. Fig. 4 also demonstrates that PLP/NaBH4 inactivation of all enzymes tested is protectable by GDP-fucose present at 0.3 mm final concentration. Genes encoding α1,3-FucT enzymes have been cloned from a variety of species (8Hadwiger J.A. Wilkie T.M. Strathmann M. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence of these enzymes demonstrates a substantial sequence homology, primarily within the C-terminal catalytic domain region. The multiplicity of enzymes that exists, for example in humans, probably accounts for subtle differences in enzyme function in vivo and gives rise to differing acceptor properties and transfer specificities. An increasing amount of information is becoming available to show how specific amino acid residues within the more variable regions of the catalytic domain of these proteins influence specific properties of a given enzyme form (Refs. 17Holmes E.H.

The results presented in this paper address a region of the catalytic domain that is instead rather highly conserved among enzyme forms. Although variable numbers of Lys residues are present among human FucTs, highly conserved sites exist. In particular, three Lys residues are in identical positions in FucTs III, IV, V, and VI. Two of these positions are occupied by the only Lys residues present in the FucT VII enzyme. The third site is a conservative change to an Arg residue (Arg223). The results presented in this paper focus on enzymatic properties inherent to this Lys/Arg site among human FucT enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments changing the equivalent Lys255 of FucT V to an Arg residue (K255R mutant) resulted in an enzyme with dramatically reduced specific activity compared with the native enzyme. Changing this site to a nonconservative Ala residue (K255A mutant) abolished activity. Thus, a basic group in this position is required for activity. The poor activity of the resulting K255R mutant required an alternate approach to accurately determine the kinetic effect of this type of substitution on the enzyme. Since native FucT VII has an Arg residue in this position, changing it to a Lys residue and analyzing its affect was deemed to be an ideal approach. Presumably, a more active enzyme would result, allowing kinetic comparisons of both the native and mutant enzymes. Analysis of native FucT VII and the R223K mutant confirmed that this substitution had no effect on acceptor specificity properties of the enzyme, including the enzyme's behavior with sialylated acceptors containing multiple GlcNAc residues. Further, this amino acid change had no effect on the K m for either the donor GDP-fucose or the acceptor oligosaccharide. The only effect caused by this amino acid change was to create an enzyme with inherently greater activity. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that this site does not directly function in substrate binding; however, a basic group in this site is required for activity. Enzymes containing a Lys residue in this position are inherently more active compared with those with an Arg residue, suggesting the ionization state of the side chain is significant in maintaining optimal enzyme conformation or may be involved in catalysis. This is consistent with a previous report that suggested that a basic group on human FucT enzymes (i.e.FucT III and VI) is involved in a critical hydrogen bond donor interaction with reactive acceptor hydroxyl groups during the glycosyl transfer reaction (33Hindsgaul O.

Recently, cloning of FucT enzymes from H. pylori and a comparison of aligned sequences from a wide variety of species have led to the identification of an “α1,3-FucT motif” (15Martin S.L.

Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21357-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This motif is composed of certain fully conserved amino acid residues within a portion of the catalytic domain between residues Tyr254and Lys272 of human FucT V and between residues Tyr222 and Lys240 of FucT VII. Interestingly, the Lys/Arg site described in this paper occurs within this segment of the catalytic domain. The behavior of the native and mutant enzymes described in this paper suggests that this motif may have a more complex function in FucT enzymes by directly participating in catalysis, in addition to a possible involvement in binding GDP-fucose or Mn2+ (15Martin S.L.

A more complete evaluation of the role of this α1,3-FucT motif is required before firm conclusions can be drawn relating to the functions of the differing amino acids that are present. Previous results using enzyme derived from NCI-H69 cells demonstrated that PLP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to GDP-fucose and, further, that a PLP/NaBH4-sensitive, GDP-fucose-protectable Lys residue is present (17Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The present results confirm that this is a common property of FucT enzymes. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a property of at least one of the highly conserved Lys residues present in FucTs. To determine if FucT VII was also PLP/NaBH4-sensitive and if the site corresponding to Lys255 of FucT V is the reactive site, PLP/NaBH4 inactivation studies were conducted on the native and mutant enzymes. The results confirmed that FucT VII was also inactivated by PLP/NaBH4, although with a lower efficiency than other enzyme forms. The K i for PLP inhibition with respect to GDP-fucose was determined to be 2 mm, compared with 105 μm reported previously (17Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the results from both FucT V and VII native and mutant enzymes demonstrate that there was no difference in the GDP-fucose-protectable PLP/NaBH4 inactivation regardless of whether a Lys or Arg residue occupied this amino acid position. Thus, this position does not correspond to the PLP/NaBH4-sensitive site. This is consistent with the results from a kinetic analysis of the native and mutant FucT VII enzymes, which demonstrate that the change from an Arg to Lys had no affect on the K m for GDP-fucose.

One such effect is the dithiothreitol (DTT)-induced increase in agonist affinity of certain ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs), presumably due to reduction of a disulfide bridge formed between cysteine residues conserved among all GluRs. Using biochemical techniques, this disulfide is shown to exist in the ligand-binding domain of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluRD, although GluRD homomeric receptors are not modulated by DTT. The disulfide is inaccessible to DTT, explaining the insensitivity of the intact receptor. Single mutants C260S and C315S show a 2–3-fold higher ligand affinity than wild-type, as observed for several intact GluRs, indicating that the affinity switch is completely contained within the ligand-binding domain. Also, mutants lacking the native disulfide show non-native oligomerization and dramatically reduced specific activity. These facts suggest that the disulfide bridge is required for the stability of the ligand-binding domain, explaining its conservation. A third cysteine residue in the ligand-binding domain exists as a free thiol, partially sequestered in a hydrophobic environment. These results provide a framework for interpreting a variety of GluR redox modulatory phenomena.

In some GluR subfamilies, both reducing and oxidizing (labeling) agents have been observed to modulate agonist affinity and channel properties, and it has been proposed that such agents could have therapeutic value in the treatment of various neuropathological processes (4Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For example, in the NMDA receptor subfamily, NR1 is regulated in this way when co-assembled with subunits NR2B–NR2D. In the presence of DTT, there is a reversible potentiation of channel currents, slower desensitization, and a decreased EC50 value (5Aizenman E. Lipton S.A. Loring R.H.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). This site may also be the target of nitric oxide regulation of NMDA receptors, which may have both neuroprotective and neurodestructive effects (8Lei S.Z. Pan Z.H. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.S.V.

The sensor for this DTT sensitivity has been localized by mutagenesis studies to homologous pairs of cysteine residues that are presumed to form disulfide bonds: Cys726 and Cys780(Cys744 and Cys798 in the immature sequence) of NR1 (10Sullivan J.M. Traynelis S.F. Chen H.S. Escobar W. Heinemann S.F. Lipton S.A.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments, homologs of these two cysteines are found in all GluRs, and both are located in the loop between transmembrane segments 2 and 3. This region, known as S2, forms the GluR ligand-binding domain together with the region S1, consisting of approximately 150 amino acids N-terminal to the first transmembrane domain. Together, these regions are predicted by threading algorithms to fold similarly to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (11Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E.

Connected by a linker peptide, the S1 and S2 domains of GluRD can be expressed as a soluble protein (S1S2) that reproduces the pharmacology of intact GluRD (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Sutcliffe et al. (16Sutcliffe M.J. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1575-1589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have created a molecular model of the corresponding domain of GluR6 incorporating the proposed disulfide bridge. They suggest that it stabilizes the open, unliganded form of the molecule by inhibiting a conformational change seen in the periplasmic binding proteins upon ligand binding (17Oh B.H. Pandit J. Kang C.H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F.L. Kim S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that reducing agents increase the affinity of certain GluRs for agonists. Despite the apparent conservation of the putative disulfide bond across GluR subfamilies, the effects of DTT are quite variable. The AMPA receptors are not potentiated by DTT, although it has recently been shown that mutation of Cys722 (Cys726 of NR1) to alanine in the AMPA GluR subunit GluRC does lead to higher affinity for glutamate and a decrease in channel conductivity (18Watase K. Sekiguchi M. Matsui T.A. Tagawa Y. Wada K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In NR1/NR2B-NR2D heteromeric NMDA receptors, only NR1 cysteines appear to be the target of DTT potentiation, although the NR2 subunits are required for potentiation, since NR1 homomers expressed in oocytes are not potentiated by DTT (5Aizenman E. Lipton S.A. Loring R.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 10Sullivan J.M. Traynelis S.F. Chen H.S. Escobar W. Heinemann S.F. Lipton S.A.

Pharmacol. 1994; 262: R3-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, potentiation in NR1/NR2A heteromers has two components, one of which is mediated by the NR1 disulfide and one of which is not (6Köhr G. Eckardt S. Luddens H. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Sullivan J.M. Traynelis S.F. Chen H.S. Escobar W. Heinemann S.F. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 929-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NR1/NR2A heteromers also exhibit different susceptibilities to reducing and oxidizing agents other than DTT, compared with NR1/NR2B-D channels (6Köhr G. Eckardt S. Luddens H. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of the extracellular cysteine residues in the redox modulation of GluR responses, we have addressed the following questions. Is there a disulfide bridge in GluRD ligand-binding domain homologous to that identified in NR1 and GFKAR? Is the ligand-binding domain alone sufficient to reproduce the disulfide-controlled agonist affinity shifts seen in intact GluRs? What is the basis for the insensitivity of AMPA receptors to DTT? Given this insensitivity, what explains the conservation of the disulfide bridge among GluRs? The three cysteine residues in the ligand-binding domain of GluRD were replaced individually by serines by using overlap extension PCR (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6823) Google Scholar). The plasmid pK503-4 (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) served as the template, and the following oligonucleotides were used as primers: 371, 5′- GGAAGCTTATCAAGTCGACTCATAGGCCAGAGGGTCCA-3′; 1413, 5′-GGGTTGCTAGCTATAAATATGAGGATTATTTGCAGG-3′; 1680, 5′-GGTGGTGAGCTCGTTGCTCAGGCTCAAGGC-3′; 2416, 5′- GGTGTGTCGACGGAGAGAATGGTCTCCCCCAT-3′; 2606, 5′- TACGAAGGCTACTCCGTTGATCTGGCATCGGAAATT-3′; 2608, 5′-TGCCAGATCAACGGAGTAGCCTTCGTACTTGTC-3′; 2706, 5′-CGAAAGCCTTCTGACACGATGAAAGTGGGA-3′; 2707, 5′- AAAGGTGAATCTGGGCCCAAGGACTCGGGA-3′; 2708, 5′-CATCGTGTCAGAAGGCTTTCGCTGCTCAGT-3′; 2709, 5′- CTTGGGCCCAGATTCACCTTTATCGTACCA-3′. For the C56S mutation, the PCR products generated with primer pairs 1413/2608 and 2606/371 were gel-purified and combined to serve as a template in the second PCR reaction with primers 1413 and 371. The product was digested with NheI and SalI and cloned into similarly treated pK503-4. For the C260S and C315S mutations, the first PCR was done with primer pairs 2416/2708 and 2706/1680 and primer pairs 2416/2709 and 2707/1680, respectively, and the second PCR was done with primers 2416 and 1680. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SacI and cloned into similarly treated pK503-4 vector. To generate the double mutant C260S/C315S, the first PCR reaction was performed with primers 2416/2709 and 2707/1680 using the C260S mutation–carrying plasmid as a template. The presence of the predicted mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant baculoviruses for expression of the mutated S1S2 domains were generated by using the Bac-to-Bac system of Life Technologies, Inc. as described previously (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All constructs were expressed in Trichoplusia ni High Five cells in Excell-400 medium (JRH) as soluble protein secreted into the extracellular medium. The insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a cell density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml and a multiplicity of infection of 4. After 66 h of infection at 27 °C, the extracellular medium was cleared of cells and viruses in a two-step centrifugation (4000 × g for 30 min; 185,000 × g for 1 h). CaCl2 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 3 mm. The supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml anti-FLAG M1 affinity gel column (Kodak) preequilibrated with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, 3 mm CaCl2). The column was washed with washing buffer until the protein concentration of the wash was less than 10 μg/ml. Bound protein was eluted with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA. Protein-containing fractions of the FLAG column were loaded onto an anion exchange column (Sephadex Fast Flow Q-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl. The bound protein was eluted with a 0.14–1 m NaCl gradient. The appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon concentrator with a 10-kDa cut-off (Amicon). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar). To reduce native S1S2, the protein was diluted in Tris buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 1 mm EDTA) containing 10 mm DTT. It was incubated for 60 min at room temperature. To reduce denatured S1S2, the protein was first diluted in reducing buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 10 m urea, 1 mm EDTA). The protein was then incubated with DTT at a final concentration of 10 mmfor 60 min at 37 °C. To remove excess DTT after reduction, gel filtration chromatography was performed with a Sephadex G-25F column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For denatured protein, urea buffer (100 mmNaPi, pH 7.3, 10 m urea, 1 mm EDTA) was used as the elution buffer, and for native protein, phosphate buffer (100 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, 1 mmEDTA) was used. The fractions (0.5 ml each) were titrated individually. To ensure separation of DTT from the protein, gel filtration purifications were used only if they had clearly resolved protein and DTT peaks separated by fractions without any absorption at 280 nm (and 412 nm in the presence of DTNB). The Ellman reaction (22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21368) Google Scholar, 23Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was recorded with a Shimadzu UV260 spectrophotometer that has two optical pathways. The reference cuvette contained 1 ml of urea buffer and 40 μl of 10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (10–100-fold excess of cysteines) in urea buffer for denatured protein and 600 μl of urea buffer, 40 μl of DTNB, and 400 μl of phosphate buffer for native protein. The sample cuvette contained 600 μl of urea buffer, 400 μl of protein, and 40 μl of 10 mm DTNB in urea buffer. To test the accessibility of the SH group under native conditions, untreated protein was diluted in 1 ml of phosphate buffer, and 40 μl of 10 mm DTNB or ODNB were added to the sample cuvette. The reference cuvette contained 1 ml of phosphate buffer and 40 μl of DTNB or ODNB. The absorption was measured as the absorption difference between the sample and reference cuvette at 412 nm. The concentration of SH groups (c SH) was determined by the equation,cSH=Aε412×d(Eq. 1) where A is the absorption, d is the path length of the cuvette, and ε412 = 13,700m−1 cm−1 for titration with urea buffer (for urea concentrations between 6 and 10 m) and ε412 = 14,150 m−1cm−1 for titration with phosphate buffer. The protein was lyophilized and then dissolved in reducing buffer (50 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA) or labeling buffer (50 mm NaPi, pH 6.0, 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA) depending on which cysteines were to be labeled. To label all cysteines, the protein was dissolved at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in reducing buffer and incubated at 37 °C with 5 mm DTT. After 30 min, a further 5 mm DTT was added, and the protein was incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. Then the protein was precipitated in a 10× volume of acetone/1 m HCl (98:2), centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet was washed three times in acetone, 1m HCl, H2O (98:2:10) to remove excess DTT. It was then resuspended in labeling buffer, and 2 mol of PM was added per mol of anticipated free cysteine. Consistent with these assumptions, no more than 50% of the initial PM was detected as having reacted with protein. The labeling reaction was performed for 1.5 h at room temperature. To purify S1S2 from excess PM, the protein was precipitated with acetone as above. To label only the cysteines participating in a disulfide bridge, S1S2 was dissolved in reducing buffer, and the free SH group was blocked by a 100-fold molar excess of IAM for 15 min at 37 °C. Then a 5-fold molar excess of DTT over IAM was added for 30 min at 37 °C to reduce the disulfide bridge and to block the free IAM. The protein was precipitated with acetone/HCl as above and resuspended in labeling buffer. The cysteines were labeled, and the protein was separated from excess PM as above. To label only the free cysteine, S1S2 was dissolved in labeling buffer, and the labeling with PM and the purification from excess PM were performed as above. Then the protein was resuspended in reducing buffer and reduced with 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. The reduced cysteines were blocked with a 6-fold molar excess of IAM for 10 min at 37 °C. Then the protein was precipitated with acetone/HCl. At the end of the labeling reaction, the protein was resuspended in digestion buffer (50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 5m urea, 1 mm EDTA). The labeling yield was determined by absorption of PM at 342 nm (ε342 = 40,000m−1 cm−1). The resuspended protein was incubated with Staphylococcus aureus strain V8-protease (20-fold excess by weight) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the sample was immediately separated by C18 reversed phase column HPLC (OD-2PW column, Tosohaas) with an acetonitrile gradient in water. The fractions that showed absorption at both 210 and 342 nm were analyzed with MALDI-MS (Voyager Elite Workstation, Perseptive Biosystems). Using the GCG package program PEPTIDESORT (24Fuchs R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a list of all predicted proteolytic cleavage sites in S1S2 was determined for the V8-protease. On this basis, all possible peptide fragments were computed for a partial proteolysis allowing the identification of the one whose mass was closest to the experimental value. The identification was tested by N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (25Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dialysis half-chambers with a volume of 60 μl each were separated by a dialysis membrane with a cut-off pore size of 6–8 kDa (Spectrapor). One half-chamber was filled with 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.3, and different concentrations of l-[3H]glutamate (NEN Life Science Products). For l-glutamate concentrations greater than 1.5 μm, a mixture of 1.5 μml-[3H]glutamate and different concentrations of cold l-glutamate was used. The other half-chamber contained the same solution supplemented with 0.5–1 μmS1S2. The chambers were allowed to equilibrate for 15 h at 4 °C. Then 10 μl from each half-chamber was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Packard Instruments), and the radioactivity was determined with a Beckman scintillation counter LS 6500. For eachl-glutamate concentration, duplicates were prepared. The data were analyzed by a linear fit (GraFit, Erithacus Software) as a normalized Scatchard plot,ESE0=1−Kd×(ES/S)E0(Eq. 2) where ES is the concentration of protein-ligand complex, E 0 is the total protein concentration, and S is the concentration of unbound ligand. The data were also fitted as a hyperbolic curve fit with the equation,ESE0=E0×SKd+S(Eq. 3) For saturation binding analysis, 25 nm purified protein was incubated with 1–300 nm [3H]AMPA in the presence or absence of 1 mml-glutamate in a total volume of 500 μl of ABB (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm KSCN, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by rapid filtration through polyethyleneimine-treated GF/B filters (Whatman) as described previously (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The filters were incubated in liquid scintillation fluid (Optihase II or Packard Instruments) overnight, and then the 3H radioactivity was counted. For ligand competition assays, 25–200 μl of unpurified protein, dialyzed against ABB, was incubated with 5 nm[3H]AMPA in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands (kainate and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) in a total volume of 500 μl of ABB. The ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting (GraphPad Prism 2.0 or GraFit). The Cheng-Prusoff (26Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12263) Google Scholar) equation was used to calculate the K i values. S1S2 possesses three cysteine residues. To determine whether there is a disulfide bridge in the glutamate binding region of the AMPA receptors, SH group titrations were performed. When the Ellman reaction is performed under non-reducing, denaturing conditions, one cysteine per molecule of S1S2 is detected with DTNB (Table I). If the protein is reduced with DTT under denaturing conditions prior to the Ellman reaction, three cysteines are detected. Thus, S1S2 has one free cysteine and one disulfide bridge.Table ISH group titration of S1S2 with DTNB10 murea10 mm DTTCysteines/S1S2−−0.94 ± 0.02+−0.97 ± 0.15−+1.23 ± 0.06++3.20 ± 0.22The Ellman reaction was performed under denaturing conditions.Conditions prior to Ellman reaction. Open table in a new tab The Ellman reaction was performed under denaturing conditions. Conditions prior to Ellman reaction. When the Ellman reaction is performed under non-reducing, native conditions, less than 0.1 cysteine per S1S2 could be detected with DTNB, and around 0.90 cysteine per S1S2 could be detected with the more hydrophobic thiol-specific reagent ODNB. Thus, the free cysteine appears to be partially buried in a hydrophobic environment. To determine the accessibility of the disulfide bridge to reducing agents, we exposed S1S2 to DTT under native conditions, separated the protein from DTT chromatographically, and then performed the Ellman reaction (DTNB) under denaturing conditions. Only 1.2 cysteines/molecule of S1S2 could be detected. Assuming that the disulfide bridge did not reform during the chromatography step (∼15 min), this implies that only approximately 10% of the disulfide bridges can be cleaved by DTT in the native state and suggests that the disulfide bridge is relatively inaccessible in the native protein structure. To test the assumption that the disulfide bridge did not reform during the DTT separating step, we performed experiments in which the native protein was precipitated with acetone/HCl after reduction. Then the protein was dissolved under denaturing conditions, and the free cysteines were labeled with 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid. Thedifference between non-reduced and reduced S1S2 was 0.3 cysteine/mol of S1S2 and thus in the same range as that observed with the Ellman reaction. To localize the disulfide bridge, S1S2 was labeled with PM and digested with S. aureus V8-protease. Peptide fragments were separated by reversed phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing. The results were compared with peptide fragments predicted for V8-protease digestion. S1S2 was denatured prior to reduction and labeling with PM, because it was not possible to fully reduce S1S2 in the native state. The labeling yield was approximately 83%. Different proteases were tested under different conditions, and the best chromatographic separation of peptides was obtained with partial proteolysis using the S. aureus V8-protease (data not shown). After digestion, the sample was immediately loaded onto the reversed phase column, because it was not possible to inhibit the V8-protease completely either by denaturation (incubation at 95 °C for 5 min; addition of SDS to a final concentration of 5%) or by inhibitor (monovalent anions). S1S2 was labeled in three different reactions to determine the position of the disulfide bridge (Fig. 1). Fig. 1, a and b, shows the elution profile of the free cysteine labeled with PM. There are two prominent peaks with an absorption at 342 nm with a retention time of approximately 55 min in one fraction (D). Using MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing, the nonapeptide from Gly54 to Glu62 was identified (Table II). This peptide contains Cys56, which corresponds to Cys439 in the full GluRD sequence. With MALDI-MS, a second, PM-labeled peptide (residues 45–62) could be detected, although the corresponding N-terminal sequence was not found by Edman degradation.Table IICysteine-containing peptides of the disulfide arrangement analysisFractionFragmentExperimental mass (with/without PM)Calculated mass (with/without PM)DaA253YTEQRKPC 260…LKLSE2974822.1 /5119.34810.5 /5106.8A298AGVLD…C 315…SLSNE3344056.3 /4353.84056.6 /4352.9B298AGVLD…C 315…SNELE336 /4595.64298.9 /4595.2CNDNDNDD54GYC 56VDLASE62956.4 /1253.3956.0 /1252.3D45MFEGN…C 56VDLASE62 /2367.72070.3 /2366.6The fractions that showed an absorption at 210 and 342 nm were analyzed by MALDI-MS (experimental mass) and N-terminal sequencing. The mass deviation of MALDI-MS is smaller than 1 Da. The cysteine in the isolated fragments is shown in boldface type, and the residues identified by sequencing are underlined. In fraction A, there were two masses for each fragment, because not all protein was labeled. The peptide in fraction C could not be determined (ND), because there was insufficient material. Open table in a new tab The fractions that showed an absorption at 210 and 342 nm were analyzed by MALDI-MS (experimental mass) and N-terminal sequencing. The mass deviation of MALDI-MS is smaller than 1 Da. The cysteine in the isolated fragments is shown in boldface type, and the residues identified by sequencing are underlined. In fraction A, there were two masses for each fragment, because not all protein was labeled. The peptide in fraction C could not be determined (ND), because there was insufficient material. To confirm the disulfide bridge position, a second labeling reaction was performed in which only the cysteines that form the disulfide bridge were labeled with PM (Fig. 1, c and d). Small peaks at 342 nm are detected in one fraction at 50 min (C) and in another at 55 min that corresponds to positionD in Fig. 1 b. The peak at 50 min could not be analyzed, due to insufficient material. The peaks at 55 min correspond to the free cysteine, Cys56, which was not blocked completely by IAM. There were two prominent peaks at 342 nm with retention times of 44 min (A) and 46 min (B). The peak at position B corresponds to the peptide Ala298 to Glu336 as determined by MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing (Table II). This fragment contains Cys315, which corresponds to Cys774 of the intact GluRD. The MALDI-MS profile of the fraction at positionA shows two pairs of masses. Within each pair, the mass difference equals that of PM, reflecting incomplete labeling (Table II). The fragment Ala298 to Glu334 containing Cys315 fits well to one pair of masses and was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The mass of the second fragment does not fit closely to the calculated mass of any partial V8-proteolytic peptide of S1S2. The closest match is to peptide Tyr253 to Glu297 containing Cys260. The mass deviation of 12 daltons is, however, greater than expected from the uncertainty of this technique (±1 dalton) and does not correspond to any common modification (e.g. methylation). This fragment also could not be sequenced by Edman degradation. Together, these results suggest that the fragment is chemically modified. When all cysteines are labeled with PM, the elution profile at 342 nm (Fig. 1, eand f) is approximately equal to the sum of Fig. 1,a and b, and Fig. 1, c and d. Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence of a single disulfide bridge in S1S2, formed between cysteines Cys260and Cys315. Since it was not possible to reduce S1S2 in the native state, cysteine mutants were designed to establish whether this disulfide bridge has any influence on the glutamate binding affinity as predicted by Sutcliffe et al. (16Sutcliffe M.J. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1575-1589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and as shown for GFKAR (7Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 770-780PubMed Google Scholar). The single mutants C260S and C315S both show a similar, slightly higher affinity for [3H]AMPA (Table III) than does S1S2. C315S has also a 2.4-fold higher affinity for l-[3H]glutamate compared with S1S2 (Table III). For kainate, the single mutants have a roughly 1.7-fold lower affinity than wild-type S1S2, while their affinity for the low selectivity competitive antagonist 6,7-din"

To investigate the role of IR and IRS-1 in effects of insulin, we transfected IR and IRS-1 expression plasmids into cells and reconstituted the insulin signaling pathways. 3Y1 cells stably expressing the c-myc epitope-tagged glucose transporter type 4 (3Y1-GLUT4myc) exhibit no effects of insulin, at physiological concentrations. The 3Y1-GLUT4myc-IR cells expressing GLUT4myc and IR responded to phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P3) accumulation, Akt activation, the stimulation of DNA synthesis, and membrane ruffling but not to glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake, or GLUT4myc translocation. The further expression of IRS-1 in 3Y1-GLUT4myc-IR cells led to stimulation of glycogen synthesis but not to glucose uptake or GLUT4myc translocation in response to insulin, although NaF or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did trigger GLUT4myc translocation in the cells. These results suggest that, in rat 3Y1 cells, (i) IRS-1 is essential for insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis but not for DNA synthesis, PI-3,4,5-P3 accumulation, Akt phosphorylation, or membrane ruffling, and (ii) the accumulation of PI-3,4,5-P3 and activation of Akt are insufficient for glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake or for GLUT4 translocation."

Hp/HS-interacting protein (HIP) has been identified in various adult tissues in humans. HIP supports high affinity, selective binding to Hp/HS, promotes cell adhesion, and modulates blood coagulation activities via Hp/HS-dependent mechanisms. Herein, a murine ortholog of human HIP is described that is 78.8% identical to human HIP and 99.8% identical at the cDNA level and identical at the amino acid level to a previously described murine ribosomal protein, L29. Western blot analyses and immunohistological staining with affinity-purified antibodies generated against two distinct peptide sequences of murine HIP/L29 indicate that HIP/L29 is differentially expressed in adult murine tissues and cell types. In the normal murine mammary epithelial cell line, NMuMG, HIP/L29 is enriched in the 100,000 × g particulate fraction. HIP/L29 can be solubilized from the 100,000 × g particulate fraction with 0.8 m NaCl, suggesting that it is a peripheral membrane protein.

Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicate that HS proteoglycans and their binding proteins participate in aspects of embryo implantation (5Carson D.D. Rohde L.H. Surveyor G. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, human Hp/HS-interacting protein (HIP) has been identified in uterine endometrium with expression in lumenal uterine epithelial cells, i.e. the cells to which embryos initially attach during the implantation process (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of HIP coupled with its function as a Hp/HS-binding protein makes it a candidate protein involved in Hp/HS-dependent embryo adhesion.Previous reports from our laboratory have characterized human HIP as a cell surface, Hp/HS-binding protein expressed in a number of normal human tissues and cell lines (6Rohde L.H.

HIP mRNA is 1.3 kilobases in length and encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 17,750 kDa; however, HIP migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa by SDS-PAGE, apparently due to its very high isoelectric point. HIP mRNA was found in a variety of epithelial cell types, but was absent or at markedly reduced levels in two fibroblastic cell lines examined. HIP protein expression was examined immunohistochemically in human uterine endometrial sections where it was localized to the uterine and glandular epithelium and also on the vascular endothelium. Purified human HIP as well as a recombinant HIP protein expressed in Escherichia coli were shown to bind Hp selectively and saturably and also support Hp/HS-dependent cell adhesion (8Liu S. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25856-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to reports on HIP protein, a peptide sequence within HIP has been shown to bind specific Hp/HS sequences within the Hp/HS chain (9Liu S. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9718-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, this peptide domain binds the same Hp/HS pentasaccharide that is recognized by the anticoagulant protein, antithrombin III (10Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, HIP is thought to compete with antithrombin III for this pentasaccharide motif and modulate blood coagulation activities in vivo.This present study describes the cDNA cloning, expression, and function of a murine ortholog to human HIP that is 99.8% identical to a previously published cDNA sequence for mouse ribosomal protein L29 (11Rudert F. Garnier J. Schuhbaur B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Using two antibodies generated toward distinct peptide sequences of this protein, the expression pattern of murine HIP/L29 was investigated. Additionally, recombinant murine HIP/L29 expressed in E. coli retains the ability to bind Hp selectively and saturably. Like human HIP, murine HIP/L29 is a protein that binds Hp with a high degree of selectivity and is expressed in a cell type-restricted fashion in adult mouse tissues.DISCUSSIONIn this report, a murine orthologue to human HIP, identified by screening a murine uterine cDNA library with human HIP cDNA, is described that is identical in sequence to a previously described mouse protein assigned as large subunit ribosomal protein L29 (11Rudert F. Garnier J. Schuhbaur B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The current report describes the expression pattern of this protein and its mRNA for the first time in adult tissues. The restricted pattern of expression is not what would be expected for a constitutively expressed, essential ribosomal protein. Although modest variations in cellular/tissue levels of such proteins can occur, these proteins are generally expressed at similar levels in all cell types and tissues (29Nomur M. Dean D. Yates J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 7: 92-95Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, Northern, Western, and immunohistochemical analyses all indicate marked variations in expression in different tissues and restricted patterns of expression among different cells and cell types within tissues. Although murine HIP/L29 also may play a role as an accessory ribosomal protein, we suggest an extraribosomal role for murine HIP/L29 as a Hp/HS-binding protein in higher organisms.Murine HIP/L29 has significant (>58%) sequence homology to five other sequences in the Swissprot data bank. The high degree of homology/similarity between the sequences resides in the N-terminal 50 amino acids of each protein. Twenty-two amino acids are identical in the N terminus of each sequence. Although this homology strongly suggests a domain with conserved function across species, this function has yet to be determined. Full sequence information on YL43 has yet to be obtained, but the Drosophila orthologue complete cDNA has been obtained and exhibits a truncation with respect to mouse, rat, and human. Perhaps the addition of C-terminal amino acids to mammalian orthologues has given this protein an additional function as a Hp/HS-binding protein with a different subcellular localization.The protein sequence of murine HIP/L29 does not contain a canonical signal peptide sequence or a potential membrane-spanning region. However, >90% of murine HIP/L29 is associated with the 100,000 × g particulate fraction in NMuMG cells. The lack of a transmembrane domain is consistent with experimental evidence that murine HIP/L29 is quantitatively eluted from NMuMG membrane preparations by salt. There are other examples of proteins that are present in the extracellular matrix that have neither a signal peptide nor a transmembrane motif, e.g. FGF-2. Studies done with rat L29 clearly show that it co-purifies with ribosomes (20Yuen-Ling C. Olvera J. Paz V. Wool I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and is a nucleic acid-binding protein that is distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus (22Ostvold A.C. Hullstein I. Sletten K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both human and murine HIP/L29 co-isolate with the 100,000 × g particulate fraction and are solubilized with high salt. These properties are consistent with those of a peripheral membrane protein. However, redistribution of cellular components may occur during homogenization and so subcellular fractionation may give misleading results regarding murine HIP/L29 localization. Human HIP/L29 is found on cell surfaces (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J. McMaster M.T. Fisher S. Zhou Y. Lim K. French M. Hoke D. Julian J.

Nonetheless, in tissue cross-sections, human and murine HIP/L29 immunoreactivity is found throughout the cell. Thus, it is possible that this protein occurs at multiple cellular sites with potentially different functions. Recent studies of other proteins, previously believed to be only found in cytoplasm, indicate that proteins in addition to HIP/L29 can be found in multiple subcellular locales as well as the cell surface (32Florkiewicz R.Z. Baird A. Gozalez A.M. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33Hasan A.A.K. Zisman T. Schmaier A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

If, like its human counterpart, murine HIP/L29 retains the function of binding anticoagulant species of Hp/HS (10Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it might be expected that its presence in serum would be limited to thrombotic episodes. Human HIP is not secreted at appreciable levels in human cell lines and is present in vascular elements (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is possible that HIP/L29 is released from cells when the plasma membrane is compromised, and subsequently competes with antithrombin III for anticoagulant species of Hp/HS. This would provide an innate mechanism whereby coagulation, i.e. thrombin activity, would be promoted only when needed.Immunohistochemical analysis of adult murine tissues shows that murine HIP/L29 has a restricted pattern of expression. In the uterus, murine HIP/L29 shows robust expression in the uterine epithelium. This is consistent with its expression pattern in the human and its suggested role as a Hp/HS-dependent adhesion promoting protein for embryo attachment to the uterine epithelium (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In previous studies, it was shown that human HIP and a peptide domain within human HIP supports cell attachment of human trophoblast cell lines (8Liu S. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25856-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Liu S. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9718-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HIP is normally expressed by human trophoblasts in close apposition to perlecan-enriched matrices of the fetal-maternal interface (30Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J. McMaster M.T. Fisher S. Zhou Y. Lim K. French M. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibodies to HIP markedly inhibit human cytotrophoblast invasionin vitro and HIP expression is reduced in cytotrophoblasts in preeclamptic tissue, i.e. a clinical condition characterized by poor trophoblast invasive properties (30Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J. McMaster M.T. Fisher S. Zhou Y. Lim K. French M. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, HIP may play important roles in terms of trophoblast adhesion and invasion as well as hemostasis in the placenta. Nonetheless, detection of HIP in other tissues suggests a more global function.Like human HIP, murine HIP/L29 selectively binds Hp but not other glycosaminoglycans. It appears that the affinity of murine HIP/L29 for Hp may be lower than that of human HIP, inasmuch as it elutes from Hp-agarose with slightly lower salt concentrations (0.75 m) than required to elute human HIP (0.75–1.00 m) (6Rohde L.H.

This decrease in apparent affinity may be due to the observed divergence in protein homology at the C terminus between human HIP and mouse HIP/L29. Previous work with human HIP suggested that a motif in the C terminus of alternating alanines and lysines (CRPKAKAKAKADQTK; HIP peptide 1) was responsible for human HIP's ability to bind Hp/HS and compete with antithrombin III for anticoagulant species of Hp/HS (9Liu S. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9718-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that HIP peptide-1 could form an amphipathic α-helical structure that could comprise a Hp/HS binding motif. Murine HIP/L29 does not contain a peptide sequence that is identical to HIP peptide-1. The comparable sequence within murine HIP/L29, CQPKPKVQTKAGAKAPAPAKA, contains prolines that are likely to disrupt any alpha-helical structures that might bind Hp/HS. Therefore, it is hypothesized that there may be additional domains within murine HIP/L29 that enable it to bind Hp/HS. Systematic studies of different HIP domains will be required to determine the roles that individual HIP/L29 domains play in the biological activities of this protein.Future studies will be aimed at determining the function of murine HIP/L29 in vivo. Although murine HIP/L29 is restricted to certain cells within various tissues examined, its presence in all of these tissues suggests more general functions. Some of these activities may include modulation of blood coagulation (10Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), cell adhesion (9Liu S. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9718-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), or maintenance of extracellular matrix integrity (36Marchetti D. Liu S. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15891-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, murine HIP/L29 may play different roles in different biological contexts. Heparin/heparan sulfate (Hp/HS)1 proteoglycans and their respective binding proteins play important roles in diverse biological processes including cell adhesion, cytokine/growth factor action, and modulation of blood coagulation (1Salmvirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

Stuart N. Wintle J. Clark-Lewis I. Moore H. Lam C. Auer M. Hub E. Rot A. Cell. 1997; 91: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicate that HS proteoglycans and their binding proteins participate in aspects of embryo implantation (5Carson D.D. Rohde L.H. Surveyor G. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, human Hp/HS-interacting protein (HIP) has been identified in uterine endometrium with expression in lumenal uterine epithelial cells, i.e. the cells to which embryos initially attach during the implantation process (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of HIP coupled with its function as a Hp/HS-binding protein makes it a candidate protein involved in Hp/HS-dependent embryo adhesion. Previous reports from our laboratory have characterized human HIP as a cell surface, Hp/HS-binding protein expressed in a number of normal human tissues and cell lines (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HIP mRNA is 1.3 kilobases in length and encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 17,750 kDa; however, HIP migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa by SDS-PAGE, apparently due to its very high isoelectric point. HIP mRNA was found in a variety of epithelial cell types, but was absent or at markedly reduced levels in two fibroblastic cell lines examined. HIP protein expression was examined immunohistochemically in human uterine endometrial sections where it was localized to the uterine and glandular epithelium and also on the vascular endothelium. Purified human HIP as well as a recombinant HIP protein expressed in Escherichia coli were shown to bind Hp selectively and saturably and also support Hp/HS-dependent cell adhesion (8Liu S. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25856-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to reports on HIP protein, a peptide sequence within HIP has been shown to bind specific Hp/HS sequences within the Hp/HS chain (9Liu S. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9718-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, this peptide domain binds the same Hp/HS pentasaccharide that is recognized by the anticoagulant protein, antithrombin III (10Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, HIP is thought to compete with antithrombin III for this pentasaccharide motif and modulate blood coagulation activities in vivo. This present study describes the cDNA cloning, expression, and function of a murine ortholog to human HIP that is 99.8% identical to a previously published cDNA sequence for mouse ribosomal protein L29 (11Rudert F. Garnier J. Schuhbaur B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Using two antibodies generated toward distinct peptide sequences of this protein, the expression pattern of murine HIP/L29 was investigated. Additionally, recombinant murine HIP/L29 expressed in E. coli retains the ability to bind Hp selectively and saturably. Like human HIP, murine HIP/L29 is a protein that binds Hp with a high degree of selectivity and is expressed in a cell type-restricted fashion in adult mouse tissues. DISCUSSIONIn this report, a murine orthologue to human HIP, identified by screening a murine uterine cDNA library with human HIP cDNA, is described that is identical in sequence to a previously described mouse protein assigned as large subunit ribosomal protein L29 (11Rudert F. Garnier J. Schuhbaur B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The current report describes the expression pattern of this protein and its mRNA for the first time in adult tissues. The restricted pattern of expression is not what would be expected for a constitutively expressed, essential ribosomal protein. Although modest variations in cellular/tissue levels of such proteins can occur, these proteins are generally expressed at similar levels in all cell types and tissues (29Nomur M. Dean D. Yates J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 7: 92-95Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, Northern, Western, and immunohistochemical analyses all indicate marked variations in expression in different tissues and restricted patterns of expression among different cells and cell types within tissues. Although murine HIP/L29 also may play a role as an accessory ribosomal protein, we suggest an extraribosomal role for murine HIP/L29 as a Hp/HS-binding protein in higher organisms.Murine HIP/L29 has significant (>58%) sequence homology to five other sequences in the Swissprot data bank. The high degree of homology/similarity between the sequences resides in the N-terminal 50 amino acids of each protein. Twenty-two amino acids are identical in the N terminus of each sequence. Although this homology strongly suggests a domain with conserved function across species, this function has yet to be determined. Full sequence information on YL43 has yet to be obtained, but the Drosophila orthologue complete cDNA has been obtained and exhibits a truncation with respect to mouse, rat, and human. Perhaps the addition of C-terminal amino acids to mammalian orthologues has given this protein an additional function as a Hp/HS-binding protein with a different subcellular localization.The protein sequence of murine HIP/L29 does not contain a canonical signal peptide sequence or a potential membrane-spanning region. However, >90% of murine HIP/L29 is associated with the 100,000 × g particulate fraction in NMuMG cells. The lack of a transmembrane domain is consistent with experimental evidence that murine HIP/L29 is quantitatively eluted from NMuMG membrane preparations by salt. There are other examples of proteins that are present in the extracellular matrix that have neither a signal peptide nor a transmembrane motif, e.g. FGF-2. Studies done with rat L29 clearly show that it co-purifies with ribosomes (20Yuen-Ling C. Olvera J. Paz V. Wool I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and is a nucleic acid-binding protein that is distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus (22Ostvold A.C. Hullstein I. Sletten K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both human and murine HIP/L29 co-isolate with the 100,000 × g particulate fraction and are solubilized with high salt. These properties are consistent with those of a peripheral membrane protein. However, redistribution of cellular components may occur during homogenization and so subcellular fractionation may give misleading results regarding murine HIP/L29 localization. Human HIP/L29 is found on cell surfaces (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J. McMaster M.T. Fisher S. Zhou Y. Lim K. French M. Hoke D. Julian J.

Nonetheless, in tissue cross-sections, human and murine HIP/L29 immunoreactivity is found throughout the cell. Thus, it is possible that this protein occurs at multiple cellular sites with potentially different functions. Recent studies of other proteins, previously believed to be only found in cytoplasm, indicate that proteins in addition to HIP/L29 can be found in multiple subcellular locales as well as the cell surface (32Florkiewicz R.Z. Baird A. Gozalez A.M. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33Hasan A.A.K. Zisman T. Schmaier A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

If, like its human counterpart, murine HIP/L29 retains the function of binding anticoagulant species of Hp/HS (10Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it might be expected that its presence in serum would be limited to thrombotic episodes. Human HIP is not secreted at appreciable levels in human cell lines and is present in vascular elements (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is possible that HIP/L29 is released from cells when the plasma membrane is compromised, and subsequently competes with antithrombin III for anticoagulant species of Hp/HS. This would provide an innate mechanism whereby coagulation, i.e. thrombin activity, would be promoted only when needed.Immunohistochemical analysis of adult murine tissues shows that murine HIP/L29 has a restricted pattern of expression. In the uterus, murine HIP/L29 shows robust expression in the uterine epithelium. This is consistent with its expression pattern in the human and its suggested role as a Hp/HS-dependent adhesion promoting protein for embryo attachment to the uterine epithelium (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In previous studies, it was shown that human HIP and a peptide domain within human HIP supports cell attachment of human trophoblast cell lines (8Liu S. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25856-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Liu S. Julian J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9718-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HIP is normally expressed by human trophoblasts in close apposition to perlecan-enriched matrices of the fetal-maternal interface (30Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J. McMaster M.T. Fisher S. Zhou Y. Lim K. French M. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibodies to HIP markedly inhibit human cytotrophoblast invasionin vitro and HIP expression is reduced in cytotrophoblasts in preeclamptic tissue, i.e. a clinical condition characterized by poor trophoblast invasive properties (30Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J. McMaster M.T. Fisher S. Zhou Y. Lim K. French M. Hoke D. Julian J. Carson D.D. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, HIP may play important roles in terms of trophoblast adhesion and invasion as well as hemostasis in the placenta. Nonetheless, detection of HIP in other tissues suggests a more global function.Like human HIP, murine HIP/L29 selectively binds Hp but not other glycosaminoglycans. It appears that the affinity of murine HIP/L29 for Hp may be lower than that of human HIP, inasmuch as it elutes from Hp-agarose with slightly lower salt concentrations (0.75 m) than required to elute human HIP (0.75–1.00 m) (6Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This decrease in apparent affinity may be due to the observed divergence in protein homology at the C terminus between human HIP and mouse HIP/L29. Previous work with human HIP suggested that a motif in the C terminus of alternating alanines and lysines (CRPKAKAKAKADQTK; HIP peptide 1) was responsible for human HIP's ability to bind Hp/HS and compete with antithrombin III for anticoagulant species of Hp/HS (9Liu S.

https://openalex.org/W2007632916,"Monoclonal antibody MRK-16 recognizes a discontinuous extracellular epitope on the multidrug resistance-associated ATP-binding cassette transporter, P-glycoprotein. The atomic basis for specificity of this antibody is of interest because of its potential as a modulator of P-glycoprotein activity. The crystal structure of Fab MRK-16 is reported to a resolution of 2.8 A. A structure for a portion of the epitope was derived by comparison to regions of solved structures with similar primary sequence. This has permitted a proposal for the mode of binding of the peptide epitope to the antibody, in which the peptide makes specific contacts with complementarity-determining regions H1, H2, and H3 from the heavy chain and L3 from the light chain. These interactions are consistent with epitope mapping studies and with the observation that MRK-16 is specific for human class I P-glycoprotein. This result identifies side chains in MRK-16 that would be amenable to alteration in antibody engineering experiments to derive improved multidrug resistance inhibitors for clinical use during chemotherapy. In particular, Arg-H97 contacts both Glu-746 and Asp-744 of the peptide, Arg-L96 contacts Asp-743, and Thr-H33 interacts with Thr-747. All of these epitope residues were implicated in mediating specificity by epitope mapping studies."
https://openalex.org/W2099802095,"The effects of two aminoglycoside antibiotics, neomycin and Geneticin, on the endocytic pathway were studied using a cell-free assay that reconstitutes endosome-endosome fusion. Both drugs inhibit the rate and extent of endosome fusion in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of ∼45 μM and ∼1 mm, respectively. Because the IC50 for neomycin falls within the range of affinities reported for its binding to acidic phospholipids, notably phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), these data suggest that negatively charged lipids are required for endosome fusion. A role for negatively charged lipids in membrane traffic has been postulated to involve the activity of a PIP2-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) stimulated by the GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF). Although neomycin blocks endosome fusion at a stage of the in vitroreaction that is temporally related to steps inhibited by cytosolic ARFs when they bind guanosine-5′-γ-thiophosphate (GTPγS), these inhibitors appear to act in a synergistic manner. This idea is confirmed by the fact that addition of a PIP2-independent PLD does not suppress neomycin inhibition of endosome fusion; moreover,in vitro fusion activity is not affected by the pleckstrin homology domain of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C δ1, which binds to acidic phospholipids, particularly PIP2, with high affinity. Thus, although aminoglycoside-sensitive elements of endosome fusion are required at mechanistic stages that are also blocked by GTPγS-bound ARF, these effects are unrelated to inhibition of the PIP2-dependent PLD activity stimulated by this GTP-binding protein.

PA, the product of PLD's action, in turn activates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, thereby stimulating a positive feedback cycle as the latter enzyme generates PIP2 (8Moritz A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the local production of PA and PIP2 facilitates the recruitment of coatomer subunits (collectively referred to as the COPI coat) onto Golgi membranes (4Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This idea is consistent with the documented role of ARF in COPI-mediated vesicle traffic in the secretory pathway (reviewed in Ref. 1Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 1045-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PLD activation by ARF appears to stimulate the budding of secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network as well (10Chen Y.-G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Tuscher O. Lorra C. Bouma B. Wirtz K.W.A. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 19: 271-275Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that transient changes in lipid composition promoted by ARF may also recruit clathrin and its associated complex, AP-1, to generate clathrin-coated vesicles. In fact, GTPγS-bound ARF is known to induce the association of AP-1 adaptors with trans-Golgi network membranes and immature secretory granules (12Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and these findings may reflect biochemical events preceding co-assembly of clathrin into nascent clathrin-coated buds (13Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although increasing evidence to support a role for ARF activation of PLD activity in the exocytic pathway has emerged, relatively little information is available regarding the function of these elements in the endocytic pathway. Recently, Robinson and colleagues (16Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 123: 1093-1105Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have described the recruitment of the clathrin-associated AP-2 adaptor complex onto endosomal membranes in response to GTPγS-binding by cytosolic ARFs. This group of investigators demonstrated that addition of exogenous PLD had similar effects; hence, the activation of endogenous PIP2-dependent PLD by ARF is likely to be responsible for AP-2 recruitment. Although these results point to a functional role for ARF-dependent recruitment of AP-2 to support endosomal membrane trafficking, in vitro studies from our laboratory indicate that soluble ARF activity is not required for endosome-endosome fusion despite the fact that cytosolic ARFs inhibit this activity when bound to GTPγS (18Spiro D.J. Taylor T.C. Melancon P. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13693-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, PLD has been implicated to function in endosome fusion; an inhibitor of PA production by PLD, 1-butanol, suppresses in vitro fusion activity, whereas exogenously added PLD can stimulate this reaction (19Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of ARF and PLD in the endocytic pathway, we chose to investigate the effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics. These agents are known to bind to negatively charged lipids (reviewed in Ref. 20Migneot-Leclercq M.-P. Brasseur R. Schanck A. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 44: 263-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); in particular, it has been demonstrated that neomycin specifically interacts with the acidic phospholipid PIP2(see Ref. 21Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and references therein). Neomycin inhibits PIP2-dependent PLD (3Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and interferes with AP-2 recruitment onto endosomes (17West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Neomycin also has been used in studies of an ARF-regulated PLD activity that appears to be involved in neutrophil activation (22Whatmore J. Cronin P. Cockcroft S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and an ARF-regulated PLD activity that enhances release of secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (10Chen Y.-G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar); moreover, a second aminoglycoside, Geneticin, has been shown to block secretory vesicle formation stimulated by exogenous PLD (11Tuscher O. Lorra C. Bouma B. Wirtz K.W.A. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 19: 271-275Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Aminoglycosides also have been widely studied because of the nephrotoxicity associated with their use as antibiotics and are well known to cause a vacuolarization of the apical endosomal compartment of renal proximal tubules (23Kishore B.K. Kallay Z. Lambricht P. Laurent G. Tulkens P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 867-874PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bennett W.M. Nephron. 1983; 35: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Giurgea-Marion et al. (25Giurgea-Marion L. Toubeau G. Laurent G. Heuson-Stiennon J.A. Tulkens P.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1986; 86: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that the aminoglycoside gentamicin prevents the delivery of horseradish peroxidase to the lysosome, implicating a function for acidic lipids in endocytic membrane traffic. Although many investigators have attributed the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides to arise from their inhibitory effects on lysosomal phospholipase activity (23Kishore B.K. Kallay Z. Lambricht P. Laurent G. Tulkens P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 867-874PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bennett W.M. Nephron. 1983; 35: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), an equally attractive model is that these antibiotics may interfere with elements of endocytic membrane traffic involving the activation of PLD by ARF. Here we report that both neomycin and Geneticin are effective inhibitors of cell-free endosome-endosome fusion with IC50values consistent with their known binding interactions with acidic phospholipids. Our data demonstrate that these aminoglycosides block steps of endosome fusion temporally related to steps affected by GTPγS-bound ARFs; however, the fact that these antibiotics act synergistically with GTPγS to inhibit fusion suggests that additional endosomal functions are affected. This concept is supported by the observations that a PIP2-independent PLD does not suppress the effects of neomycin on endosome fusion and that this in vitro activity is unaffected by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-δ1 (PI-PLCδ1), which is known to bind PIP2 with high affinity (26Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These results argue that there are additional mechanistic roles for acidic phospholipids in the endosomal pathway. K562 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml pencillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) fractions were prepared as described previously (18Spiro D.J. Taylor T.C. Melancon P. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13693-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, K562 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml dextrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and incubated with either 0.5 mg/ml avidin β-galactosidase or 100 nm biotin-transferrin for 60 min at 20 °C. After endocytosis was quenched on ice, the cells were washed and broken using a ball bearing homogenizer in breaking buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 85 mm sucrose, 20 μm EGTA). PNS was collected upon centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and after dialysis against breaking buffer, aliquots were stored frozen at −80 °C until use. Cytosol was prepared from K562 cells washed in PBS and broken in the same buffer, except that, after the post-nuclear supernatant centrifugation step, the PNS was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 15 min at 380,000 × g at 4 °C to remove membranous components. Supernatant cytosol was also dialyzed against breaking buffer and stored frozen at −80 °C. In vitroendosomal fusion assays were carried as described by Wessling-Resnick and Braell (28Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PNS fractions with endocytic vesicles containing avidin-β-galactosidase and biotin-transferrin were mixed on ice in a buffer containing cytosol, 1 mm MgATP, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 0.8 mm phosphocreatine, 10 μg/ml biotin-insulin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For some experiments, vesicles were first collected by microcentrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C prior to the fusion assay. Details of the amount of cytosol in the assay mixture, the exact manipulation of PNS fractions, and conditions of treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics are found in the figure legends; all manipulations of cytosol at 37 °C prior to fusion assays were carried in the presence of ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as indicated above. Reaction mixtures were held at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends, and fusion was terminated by 1:10 dilution of lysis buffer (10% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 μg/ml biotin-insulin). After microcentrifugation, clarified lysates were placed in microtiter wells coated with anti-transferrin antibodies (1:100 dilution). The complex between avidin-β-galactosidase and biotin-transferrin resulting from specific fusion events was measured as described previously (29Braell W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, after overnight incubation of the lysates at 4 °C to capture the avidin-β-galactosidase:biotin-transferrin complex, microtiter wells were washed three times with PBS, followed by four washes with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA. The wells were incubated 20 min at 37 °C in a final wash, then rinsed with PBS three times. Avidin-β-galactosidase activity was measured by incubating the wells with 250 μl of substrate solution (0.3 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactoside in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 1–3 h. Samples were diluted with five volumes of 133 mm glycine, 83 mm Na3CO3, pH 10.7, and the fluorescence of the hydrolysis product was measured using an Hitachi F-2000 spectrophotometer (365 nm excitation, 450 nm emission). The fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the extent of probe colocalization detected by complex formation (28Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Braell W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fusion measurements were adjusted for background by subtracting the amount of activity measured in samples incubated at 4 °C; because of the observed effects of neomycin and Geneticin to precipitate proteins (see “Results”), care was taken to precisely match 4 °C control samples that included the appropriate concentration of antibiotic. Fusion activity is presented as the amount of activity measured relative to control reactions carried out in the absence of drug. PLD assays were performed using methods established by Danin et al. (30Danin M. Chalifa V. Mohn H. Schmidt U.S. Liscovitch M. Fain J.M. Lipid Metabolism in Signaling Systems. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 14-24Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 1-palmitoyl-2-[6[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (C6-NBD-PC) in chloroform were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 85 mmsucrose, 150 mm KCl upon sonication for 5 min. Assay mixtures (41 μl final volume) contained 3 μl of 100 μm NBD-PC, 10 μl of PNS, 20 μl of cytosol (11.7 mg/ml), and the ATP regenerating system as described for endosome fusion assays. PLD was added from a 50 units/μl stock as noted in the figure legends. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, lipids were extracted into chloroform, lyophilized, resuspended in 50:50 chloroform:methanol, then spotted on LK6 Silica gel 60 plates (Whatman). The thin layer chromatography plates were developed in 2-propanol:ethyl acetate:chloroform:methanol:water (50:50:50:21:18, v/v). The resolved fluorescent lipids were visualized by UV light with C6-NBD-PC and and 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2–1,3 benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (C6-NDB-PA) used as standards. Avidin-β-galactosidase, biotin-transferrin, biotin-insulin, polyaspartic acid (10.4 kDa), Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD (2000 units/mg), and neomycin sulfate were from Sigma; Geneticin (G418) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. C6-NBD-PC and C6-NBD-PA were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Anti-transferrin antibodies were from Research Diagnostics. PI-PLCδ1 and PI-PLCδ1Δ(1–132), which lacks the phospholipase PH domain, were a generous gift of Dr. Mary Roberts (Department of Chemistry, Boston College, Boston, MA). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To characterize the effects of neomycin, endosome-endosome fusion activity was measured in cell-free assays supplemented with increasing amounts of drug. Briefly, vesicles containing endocytosed biotin-transferrin or avidin-β-galactosidase were mixed together on ice with cytosol, ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, and biotin-insulin; the latter is added to scavenge any extravesicular avidin-β-galactosidase that would otherwise create an artifactual fusion signal. When incubated at 37 °C, fusion of endosomal compartments results in colocalization of the probes (28Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the amount of complex formed (biotin-transferrin: avidin-β-galactosidase) is quantified using a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format and is directly proportional to the extent of fusion activity in the assay (29Braell W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by results shown in Fig. 1, neomycin inhibits cell-free endosome fusion in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50∼ 45 μm. Recent studies by Hudson and Draper (33Hudson R.T. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) revealed that neomycin specifically blocks binding of the soluble COPI complex to Golgi membranes. This effect is a result of the precipitation of coatomer with half-maximal effects observed at ∼50 μm neomycin. Thus, a plausible explanation for the dose-response curve shown in Fig. 1 is that the drug precipitates or inactivates COPI subunits that might mediate steps in the process of endosome fusion. COPI proteins have been localized to endosomal membranes (34Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 35Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and Chinese hamster ovary cell ldlF mutants have a temperature-sensitive mutation in ε-COP that causes defects in endocytic membrane traffic (36Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although evidence to support a role of COPI proteins in early endocytic vesicle fusion events is lacking, Aniento et al. (35Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that βCOP is required for thein vitro formation of endosomal carrier vesicles that support transport from early to late endocytic compartments. To examine whether inhibition by neomycin might be exerted as a result of a COPI coat requirement in the fusion assay, the effects of a second aminoglycoside, Geneticin (G418), were studied. Geneticin fails to precipitate coatomer, although this drug can block βCOP binding to Golgi membranes (33Hudson R.T. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similar to neomycin, Geneticin inhibits in vitro fusion activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). However, the IC50 for Geneticin inhibition (∼1 mm) is roughly an order of magnitude less than that observed to block coatomer-membrane interactions (33Hudson R.T. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol.

Because Geneticin does not precipitate coatomer or prevent its binding to membranes over the range of the inhibitory concentrations observed in our experiments, it is unlikely that the aminoglycosides block endosome fusion as a result of the precipitation and/or inactivation of COPI proteins. Nevertheless, a precipitate was observed to form when cytosol was treated with higher concentrations of neomycin or Geneticin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of these precipitates reveals a number of Coomassie-stainable bands (Fig. 3). These observations extend the results of Hudson and Draper (33Hudson R.T. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that many soluble factors can be precipitated by both drugs in addition to COPI subunits. As shown in Fig. 4, neomycin causes precipitation of total protein with an EC50 ∼ 250 μm(top panel), whereas Geneticin is less effective with an EC50 ≥ 2 mm (bottom panel). The relative activities of the two antibiotics to cause precipitation corresponds to the number of amino groups they contain (6 and 3, respectively), suggesting that these polyaminated drugs may nonspecifically interact with acidic proteins to promote their denaturation.Figure 3Aminoglycosides precipitate cytosolic proteins. Cytosol (9 mg/ml; 1.7 mg total protein) was incubated with 250 μm neomycin (NEO) or 2 mmGeneticin (G418) for 20 min at 37 °C, then microcentrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C to isolate precipitated product. Pellets were washed briefly with breaking buffer, then solubilized with Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Cytosol (8.9 mg/ml; 267 μg total protein) was incubated with the aminoglycosides as described for Fig. 3, and the amount of protein precipitated was determined using the Bradford method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Shown is total protein precipitated with increasing concentration of neomycin (top) or Geneticin (G418) (bottom). Data shown are the mean (± S.D.) of results from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of our concern that inhibition of fusion activity might arise solely from effects caused by protein precipitation, the ability of neomycin- and Geneticin-treated cytosol to support fusion activity was studied. Prior to fusion assays, the precipitate resulting from incubation with these drugs (approximately 1–2% of total protein) was removed by centrifugation, and the clarified cytosol was passed over a Sephadex G-25 spin column to remove antibiotic. The clarified and gel-filtered cytosol was then examined for the capacity to support fusion activity with membranes separated from PNS fractions. Removal of the drugs and the elimination of precipitated proteins restored vesicle fusion; as shown in Fig. 5, neomycin- and Geneticin-treated cytosol supported fusion activity to 65% and 90% of control levels, respectively. Addition of neomycin or Geneticin back to the pretreated cytosol inhibited endosome fusion (<25% of control levels), verifying that an aminoglycoside-sensitive factor is indeed present on endosomal membranes. Nonetheless, under the conditions defined by this assay, unspecific precipitation and/or irreversible inactivation of cytosolic protein(s) by the antibiotics does appear to have modest effects on fusion activity. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that the extent of endosome fusion activity is generally dependent on cytosol concentration (18Spiro D.J. Taylor T.C. Melancon P. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13693-13697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J.

Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although the possibility that a specific cytosolic fusion factor is targeted by these drugs cannot be rigorously excluded. Because of the pleotropic nature of the effects exerted by neomycin and Geneticin, we elected to continue to our investigation using the conditions carefully defined by these control experiments (≤250 μm neomycin and 2 mm Geneticin). These concentrations are less than or equal to the apparent EC50 for protein precipitation but are 2–5-fold higher than half-maximal concentrations for inhibition of fusion activity. Thus, depletion of cytosolic factors owing to precipitate formation are minimized whereas inhibitory effects on membrane components are maximized. To exclude the possibility that the aminoglycoside antibiotics might act on the endosomal bilayer to cause detergent-like effects, we studied the ability of polyaspartic acid to block the action of the drugs on fusion activity. Polyaspartic acid is known to bind and displace the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamycin from negatively charged liposomes and purified membrane vesicles (23Kishore B.K. Kallay Z. Lambricht P.

With both nucleotide-free and activated complex, the folding efficiency of rhodanese and MDH remained high over a large range of GroEL to substrate concentration ratios (up to 1:1). In contrast, the folding efficiency of GS began to decline at ratios lower than 8:1.

E. coli glutamine synthetase porcine mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase dithiothreitol triethanolamine. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL, a member of the Hsp 60 chaperonin family, influences the successful protein folding in vivo(for review, see Fenton and Horwich (1Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)). The GroEL oligomer contains 14 identical 57-kDa monomers arranged in a complex of two toroid-like heptameric rings to form a cylindrical structure with two central cavities (2Chen S. Roseman A.M.

Through a mechanism involving multiple rounds of binding and dissociation of co-chaperonin GroES, coupled with the binding and hydrolysis of MgATP, GroEL cycles between a number of conformational states that have different affinities for the protein substrate (4Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Corrales F.J. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4509-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The binding of GroES brings about a major conformational change in the chaperonin complex allowing for a brief encapsulation of the protein substrate inside the GroEL cavity where folding can continue (2Chen S.

A substantial amount of in vitro and in vivo evidence now indicates that protein folding is not necessarily completed within this enclosed environment. It has been found that, during chaperonin cycling, a large amount of protein is released into solution as non-native states that can rebind to the chaperonin (9Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A.

Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The continuous cycle of binding and release of the co-chaperonin and the protein substrate is controlled by the rate of ATP binding and hydrolysis. The GroEL·GroES complex is thought to have a half-life time of about 20 s at 25 °C (14Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite the significant progress in the understanding of the GroE chaperonin structure and function, the molecular processes involved with the interactions between a folding polypeptide and the chaperonin complex during multiple rounds of substrate binding and release remains obscure. With regard to successful folding, the initial interaction of folding intermediates with the GroE chaperonin complex is clearly one of the most critical steps of the chaperonin mechanism. The binding interaction between the protein folding intermediates and the substrate binding sites on GroEL is governed mainly by hydrophobic interactions (15Zahn R. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Lin S. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), although electrostatic forces may also contribute to this binding (17Perrett S. Zahn R. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These general hydrophobic interactions are most likely responsible for the low substrate specificity of the GroE complex. This property partially explains the ability of chaperonins to productively interact with different folding intermediates and influence the folding of structurally diverse proteins. Because folding proteins may undergo very rapid compaction and hydrophobic collapse prior to binding to the chaperonins, it has been postulated that chaperonins may be able to bind to folding intermediates that possess a large amount of secondary structure, i.e. a molten globule state (18Golubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 19Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U.

Indeed, hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments performed with GroEL-bound dihydrofolate reductase and analyzed by NMR or mass spectrometry have revealed that the bound structure has a significant amount of native-like characteristics (21Robinson C.V. Mayhew M. Hartl F.U. Radford S.E. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 2506-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Goldberg M.S. Zhang J. Sondek S. Matthews C.R. Fox R.O. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1080-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although earlier data suggested that the chaperonins may recognize specific secondary elements in proteins, recent crystallographic evidence indicates that GroEL preferentially binds to unstructured or extended regions in the folding protein (23Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Even so, it appears that the chaperonin interacts with a wide range of folding intermediates whose structures vary from early collapsed forms to near native forms (11Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Badcoe A.G. Smith C.J. Wood S. Halsall D.J. Holbrook J.J. Lung P. Clarke A.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, proton exchange experiments indicate that partial to complete unfolding can occur during long term substrate-chaperonin interactions (28Zahn R. Perrett S. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. Science. 1996; 271: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that chaperonins may function primarily by unfolding misfolded protein intermediates (5Corrales F.J. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4509-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol.

A. 1996; 93: 4030-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Chan H.K. Dill K.A. Proteins. 1996; 24: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) where the binding reaction between GroEL and the protein substrate would provide the free energy necessary for unfolding (29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, in cases where the folded conformer is constrained by disulfide bonds, the protein may not be measurably unfolded during its interaction with the chaperonin (26Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8100-8104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With a diverse set of chaperonin substrates, there is a high degree of variability in the chaperonin requirements for folding; for example, some proteins need GroES and ATP to fold with GroEL, while others simply require ATP (for review, see Jaenicke (32Jaenicke R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1993; 34: 209-314Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). This variability depends on the individual properties of the different substrates that can influence chaperonin mechanism either directly or indirectly. Direct influences may result from binding interactions, where the folding substrate affects either the lifetime of the GroEL·GroES complex or the initial binding of GroES onto the GroEL-polypeptide complex. Indirect influences would depend more on the properties of the folding substrates prior to their binding to or after their release from the chaperonin system. For instance, it has been shown that the GroES requirement depends, in part, on the propensity of the substrate to spontaneously fold to its native structure, without the aid of chaperonins (33Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the experimental work characterizing the chaperonin solution requirements has been done by first forming an initial complex between protein substrates and the nucleotide-free chaperonin (GroEL alone). Following the formation of the complex, folding was initiated by the addition of either ATP or ATP and GroES. This approach, however, gives virtually no information about the properties of the folding intermediates prior to their interaction with the chaperonins. Furthermore, the chaperonin species that has the highest affinity for polypeptide (GroEL alone) is not the major chaperonin capture complex in the cell. Because of the relatively high intracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP, and GroES, and the high affinity of GroEL for these components, it is more than likely that the lower affinity forms (ATP(ADP)·GroEL·GroES) are the major chaperonin complexes that interact with the folding polypeptide in vivo (for review, see Fenton and Horwich (1Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)). Previous data by Horwich and co-workers indicated that the nature of the chaperonin capture complex may influence the protein folding reaction (6Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In our current study, we have examined the folding propensity and kinetic aspects of the initial interactions between protein substrates and different chaperonin complexes. Glutamine synthetase (GS),1 rhodanese, and MDH, were chosen because each has different chaperonin requirements for efficient folding. While GS and rhodanese require at least a stoichiometric amount of the chaperonin for successful folding, MDH folds efficiently with only one-tenth of this amount of the chaperonin (29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rhodanese and MDH absolutely require GroES for folding and are commonly defined as representative chaperonin substrates, whereas GS can fold with only GroEL and ATP (37Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the folding efficiencies and capture kinetics of each protein depended differently on the nature of the initial capture complex. Our results suggest that the substrate-specific difference in the flux through the chaperonin system is, in part, determined by the initial interactions between protein folding intermediates and chaperonin. This flux is more accurately described when protein folding is examined with the physiologically relevant activated chaperonin complex. Glutamate, ATP, EDTA, DTT, NADH, and ketomalonic acid were purchased from Sigma. Urea and guanidinium HCl, both >99% pure, were from ICN Biochemical (Aurora, OH) and Fisher, respectively. Bovine liver rhodanese and pig heart mitochondrial MDH was purchased from Sigma. GS was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (34Fisher M.T. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1872-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The E. coli chaperonins, GroEL and GroES, were isolated from lysates of cells containing overexpression plasmids (gifts of Dr. George Lorimer and Dr. Edward Eisenstein) and purified as described earlier (35Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13629-13636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Eisenstein E. Reddy P. Fisher M.T. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because GroEL or GroES does not contain tryptophan, the loss of the tryptophan indole absorption, assayed by second derivative analysis of absorption spectra, was used as a criterion for purity of the preparations, in addition to analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). No contribution from tryptophan-containing contaminants was detected. GS and rhodanese were denatured in solutions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 8 m urea. Denaturation was performed for 4 h (GS) or 2 h (rhodanese) at 0 °C (11Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For rhodanese, unfolding buffer also contained 50 mm sodium thiosulfate (11Smith K.E. Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21517-21523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Denaturation of MDH was followed by the measurements of intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence (at 25 °C) as a function of denaturant concentration and incubation time. By these criteria, MDH was completely unfolded after incubation in 50 mm TEA (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT containing 4m guanidinium HCl for 0.5 h at 0 °C. Refolding of the denatured proteins was initiated by a rapid 100-fold dilution into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT (for GS and rhodanese) or 50 mm TEA (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT (for MDH) at 37 °C, followed by incubation at this temperature. For rhodanese, the refolding buffer also contained 50 mm sodium thiosulfate to stabilize rhodanese against irreversible inactivation in the presence of oxygen (38Aird B.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To assess differences in the chaperonin affinities and their potential effects on rescuing the folding protein, either nucleotide-free or activated chaperonin complexes were added to the refolding protein in question (4Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These chaperonin complexes were generated by altering the order of addition of GroEL, GroES, and ATP. When folding was first initiated in the presence of GroEL and GroES alone, with no nucleotide present, the chaperonin with the highest affinity (i.e. GroEL) was the only species capable of interacting with the folding protein. The release of the protein from the capture complex was initiated by addition of ATP to the solution after a 10-min incubation. In a different set of experiments, GroEL, GroES, and ATP were first mixed to generate the ATP·GroEL·GroES complex. Within 1 min after formation, this chaperonin species was rapidly mixed with denatured protein to initiate refolding. To measure the irreversible misfolding rates, either the nucleotide-free or activated chaperonin complexes were added to the samples at different times after the initiation of spontaneous refolding. After folding is complete, the activities for each kinetic time point (time of chaperonin addition) were determined. Unless otherwise stated, final concentrations of chaperonins in all incubations were 1 μm GroEL oligomers and 2 μm GroES oligomers. The concentrations of all the substrate proteins are presented in terms of monomer concentrations. GS activity was determined by the glutamyl transferase assay (39Woolfolk C.A. Shapiro B.M. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 116: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Rhodanese activity was assayed by monitoring thiocyanate formation after 10 min at 25 °C (40Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MDH activity was measured by diluting an aliquot from the folding mixture into 1 mm ketomalonic acid, 0.2 mm NADH, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm TEA, pH 7.5, and following the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). At the molar ratio of 2:1 (1 μm GroEL oligomer to 0.5 μmGS subunit), the refolding of GS with activated complexes showed a significant decrease in both folding rate and final yield, compared with refolding with nucleotide-free complex (Fig. 1 A). Following a 5-fold increase in the molar ratio of GroEL to GS where the concentration of the substrate protein was lowered, the reactivation rates and yields for both preparations became very similar (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of the nucleotide-free complex, the refolding yields of GS were independent of protein concentration (Fig. 2). With the activated complexes, the yields gradually increased as GS concentration was reduced. When the GS subunit concentration was lowered to 0.1 μm, the renaturation yields rose to the same levels as measured with the nucleotide-free GroE complexes (Fig. 2). A similar tendency was observed for GS yields with the nucleotide-free and the activated complexes when the substrate protein concentration remained constant at 0.5 μm and the chaperonin concentration increased to 5 μm GroEL, 10 μm GroES (data not shown). Thus, folding with the activated complex requires a high GroEL to GS molar ratio (>10) to compensate for the decreased affinity for polypeptide as well as a reduction in the number of substrate binding sites. In these experiments, we changed the order of addition of nucleotide and protein substrate to induce the formation of initially different substrate-chaperonin complexes. Because GS itself is capable of binding ATP, it was important to ensure that the presence of the nucleotide did not affect spontaneous refolding of the enzyme. No difference in the kinetics of spontaneous refolding of GS was detected between the samples containing either 5 mm ATP or no ATP after 2 h (data not shown).Figure 2Concentration dependence of GS refolding. Refolding of denatured GS was initiated by a rapid 100-fold dilution into the buffer containing either nucleotide-free (•) or activated (▪) chaperonin complexes. After 16 h at 37 °C, GS activity was measured using glutamyl transferase assay. Spontaneous refolding of the protein (▴) was determined in the absence of chaperonins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Over the same concentration range used for GS, the refolding yields of rhodanese were independent of protein concentration when either the nucleotide-free or the activated complexes were present (Fig. 3). Furthermore, even at the lowest chaperonin to rhodanese molar ratio (2:1), the refolding rates with both complexes were identical (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to what was observed with GS, the chaperonin-assisted refolding of rhodanese remained the same with either the nucleotide-free or activated complexes. Only when protein concentration was increased to 1.5 μm did the refolding yields of rhodanese with both chaperonin complexes simultaneously decline to about 70% of native activity (data not shown). Like rhodanese, the folding yields of MDH with either nucleotide-free or activated chaperonin complexes remained high and did not decline within the substrate concentration range from 0.1 to 0.5 μm MDH (Fig. 3). Refolding yields of MDH remained unchanged even when protein concentration was increased to 1.5 μm (data not shown). These latter results support an earlier observation that an optimal refolding of MDH can occur at chaperonin to substrate molar ratios as low as 1:10 (29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that GS reactivation is sensitive to the nature of the chaperonin capture complex over a substrate concentration range of 0.1 to 0.5 μm, while rhodanese and MDH are unaffected over the same range. These results imply that a portion of the folding GS monomers are unable to interact with the activated chaperonin as the concentration of GS increases. We have reasoned that a decrease in the interaction between the chaperonin complex and the folding protein could be among the most probable causes of the observed decline in GS yields. To investigate this possibility, we determined the time frame in which each folding protein substrate can productively interact (i.e. fold to native structure) with the different chaperonin complexes. Measurement of the kinetics of irreversible misfolding is a convenient experimental approach for the characterization of the initial interactions between chaperonins and protein folding intermediates (18Golubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Introduction of the chaperonin complexes at different times following the initiation of spontaneous refolding allows one to probe how rapidly the protein folding intermediates lose their ability to interact with the chaperonins. In our current study, we examined the rate with which the folding intermediates of the three protein substrates lose their ability to interact with either the nucleotide-free (GroEL alone) or an activated (ATP·GroEL·GroES) complex. These chaperonin species exhibit significantly different affinities for protein substrates. For example, according to the estimates by Clarke and co-authors, the affinities between the two chaperonin complexes and lactate dehydrogenase may differ by as much as 60 fold (4Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is important to note that ADP·GroEL·GroES complex has a significantly higher affinity for protein folding intermediates compared with ATP·GroEL·GroES complex (4Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To ensure that the activated complex remains in ATP-bound form throughout the initial interaction, the complex was prepared separately for every experimental point, 1 min prior to the initiation of refolding. Since ATP hydrolysis rate of GroEL at 37 °C is approximately 26.6 min−1 per oligomer, 2M. T. Fisher, unpublished data. only about 0.5% of the total ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP within this 1-min time period under our experimental conditions before refolding was initiated. Because rhodanese is highly susceptible to oxidation (38Aird B.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), control experiments were performed in the presence of an activated oxygen scavenger system (42Horowitz P.M. Butler M. McClure Jr., G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23596-23600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in an oxygen-free buffer under argon atmosphere. For the duration of our experiments, no difference in the misfolding kinetics was observed between these oxygen-depleted controls and those samples containing oxygen and 10 mm DTT (data not shown). For all three protein substrates, a significant portion of the activity could not be recovered by either chaperonin complex after an approximate 10 s delay in chaperonin addition (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). For GS however, the kinetics of irreversible misfolding within this time interval was significantly faster when the activated complex was used to rescue protein folding intermediates compared with the nucleotide-free complex, with the rates differing by more than 8-fold (Fig. 4 and Table I). In contrast, irreversible misfolding of rhodanese was virtually identical with both chaperonin complexes (Fig. 5 and Table I). MDH showed a slight decline (1.6-fold) in the rates of misfolding with activated complex compared with nucleotide-free complex (Fig. 6 and Table I). Throughout these experiments, a molar ratio of chaperonin to protein substrates was maintained at 10:1 (0.1 μm protein substrate) to ensure the identical capture efficiency by either nucleotide-free or activated chaperonin complexes at time zero. When the addition of chaperonins was delayed for longer than 10 s, the rates of misfolding for all substrates became significantly slower (0.02–0.05 s−1). At these slower rates, between 5 and 10% of native activity was still recoverable at the delay times of 30–60 s (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The residual recoverable activity most likely represents the small population of more stable folding intermediates capable of productive interaction with the chaperonins at intermediate delay times. Interestingly, we have observed a reproducible deviation from the double-exponential misfolding kinetic model, a rapid increase (∼10%) in recoverable GS activity with nucleotide-free complex that consistently occurs after about 1 s of delay of chaperonin addition (Fig. 4). This may be indicative of the increased interaction between putative short-lived kinetic intermediates and the nucleotide-free chaperonin complexes. As the chaperonin addition was delayed for longer time intervals, the recoverable activity continued to decline, eventually approaching the levels observed during spontaneous folding (not shown).Figure 5Kinetics of irreversible misfolding of mitochondrial rhodanese.

Only the rate constants of the first exponent (k 1 ± S.E.) are presented. The initial interactions of protein folding intermediates with the chaperonins depend on the rate of chaperonin cycling as well as the folding rate of substrate proteins. With the assumption that the kinetic properties of the protein substrates (i.e. viewing the properties of chaperonin complexes and folding intermediates as a function of time) are critical for understanding of chaperonin mechanism, we have compared folding of three structurally diverse proteins with different chaperonin complexes. One of these substrates, GS, was isolated from the bacterium E. coli and is a potential natural substrate for the GroE chaperonins (35Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13629-13636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fisher M.T. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1998; 63: 382-402PubMed Google Scholar). The two other substrates, rhodanese and MDH, both isolated from mitochondria, are the model substrates most frequently used in the study of protein folding with the GroE chaperonins. All three proteins are well established chaperonin substrates that have substantially different chaperonin requirements for the efficient folding. In addition, GS, a dodecamer, and MDH, a dimer, initially exist as subunits that interact with the chaperonin for short or long time periods, respectively (29Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,41Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 Monomeric rhodanese undergoes repeated cycles of binding to and release from chaperonins before attaining its native fold (9Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 41Fisher M.T. Yuan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29598-29601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While most other comparative studies have examined folding in a range of temperatures (33Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Landry S. Jordan R. McMacken S. Gierasch L.

Biol. 1997; 268: 512-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), all our experiments were performed exclusively at 37 °C. Not only is this the optimal growth temperature of E. coli, but the calorimetrically measured binding affinities between a folding protein and the GroEL chaperonin are at their maximum at this same temperature (16Lin S. Schwarz F.P. Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1011-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In a majority of in vitro chaperonin studies, the nucleotide-free capture complex (GroEL alone) is commonly used to initially bind the protein folding intermediates to form stable GroEL-protein substrate complexes. However, since the intracellular concentration of ATP is estimated to be in the millimolar range (47Lehninger A.L. Principles of Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1982: 373Google Scholar), the activated (GroEL·GroES·ATP (or ADP)) capture complex is more likely to participate in the binding of protein substrates under physiological conditions. In addition to its decreased affinity for protein substrates (4Staniforth R.A. Burston S.G. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this complex has a reduced number of protein binding sites compared with GroEL alone. Half of these binding sites become occupied by GroES, resulting in an asymmetric bullet-shaped complex (2Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It is clear from our experiments that the kinetics of the initial interactions of protein folding intermediates with chaperonin complexes depends on the nature of the substrate protein. The conclusion is based on differences in kinetics of irreversible misfolding observed with the same substrate in the presence of different chaperonin complexes. This experimental design provides an internal reference point to ensure that the observed differences are related to chaperonin-substrate interactions rather than to the different individual folding and assembly paths of the structurally diverse protein substrates. Interestingly, the refolding of the E. coli protein, GS, was the most sensitive to the change in chaperonin affinity. When nucleotide-free chaperonin complexes were used, the initial misfolding kinetics of GS was the slowest among the proteins studied (Table I). This indicates that the nucleotide-free chaperonin complex and GS folding intermediates interact more efficiently over a longer period of time. With the activated chaperonin complex, the irreversible misfolding rate of GS increases dramatically. It is conceivable that the disparity in GS folding yields results from the differences in formation of successful encounter complex between the substrate and the chaperonin. However, since the concentration of the chaperonins in our experiments were adjusted so the initial (time 0) overall folding efficiency was the same for both nucleotide-free and activated complexes, we tend not to favor this possibility. Instead, we suggest that a smaller population of the off-pathway GS intermediates is recognized by the activated chaperonin complexes compared with the nucleotide-free complexes. Since numerous folding intermediates may be in rapid equilibrium, the preferential binding of one particular intermediate population could result in the partitioning of other populations onto chaperonin complex due to mass action effects. Thus, in the kinetic sense, GS may not be adequately captured by the activated complex because of a slower rate of conformational transition to a form that binds to the chaperonin. Alternatively, a direct (conformational) effect of substrate binding on the affinity and cycling of chaperonin complex may be, in part, responsible for the observed differences in misfolding kinetics. The folding intermediates of both MDH and rhodanese lose their ability to interact with the nucleotide-free complex at a faster rates than GS. However, unlike GS, there is little or no change in the misfolding kinetics when the activated chaperonin complex is present suggesting that, for MDH and rhodanese, similar populations of the folding intermediates interact with equal or near equal efficiency with either the activated or nucleotide-free chaperonin complexes. The observation that GS misfolds more rapidly with the activated chaperonin than do other substrates adds a new aspect of substrate variability to the chaperonin mechanism. At present, it is not known if these findings reflect a more general tendency of preferential interaction of the activated complex with the stringent chaperonin substrates compared with nonstringent substrates. In any case, for an adequate folding and assembly of GS (a so-called nonstringent substrate) in a cellular environment at limiting chaperonin concentrations, the parallel participation of the DnaK system may be necessary (48Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 49Buchberger A. Schröder H. Hesterkamp T. Schönfeld H.J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Experiments designed to address this question are currently underway. Collectively, our data reveal that the kinetic “sampling” of different folding intermediates by chaperonins, a process that is likely to occur in the cellular environment, dictates the flux of protein substrates through the chaperonin system during folding. The observed differences in misfolding kinetics reflect the substrate-specific variations in the lifetimes of dynamic folding intermediate structures, the differences in the global properties of these intermediates, such as size, degree of transient exposure of hydrophobic and charged surfaces, or even formation of transient aggregates. Our experiments also establish a time interval when these differences could be observed, up to about 10 s from the initiation of refolding. Whether these findings could be generalized for the wider range of the chaperonin substrates remains to be determined. Even so, our comparative studies indicate that it is necessary to examine multiple substrates before conclusions about the particular aspects of the chaperonin mechanism can be drawn."
