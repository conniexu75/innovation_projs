https://openalex.org/W2047821352,"Experimental evidence is presented which demonstrates a chemically produced, mass-independent isotopic fractionation of oxygen. The effect is thought to result from self-shielding by the major isotopic species (16)O(2), but other possible mechanisms such as molecular symmetry cannot be ruled out. In a three-isotope plot, the experimentally produced fractionation line is essentially equal in slope to the observed carbonaceous chondrite mixing line. The implications for the early history of the solar system are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1971496824,"Inputs of terrestrial peat carbon to the nearshore Alaskan Beaufort Sea from erosion and fluvial transport are of the same magnitude as in situ primary production within 10 kilometers of shore. Nevertheless, carbon-13/carbon-12 ratios and carbon-14 abundances in marine organisms show that only small amounts of the terrestrial carbon are transferred beyond the microbial level. Freshwater organisms, however, are heavily dependent on peat, as shown by pronounced seasonal radiocarbon depressions in resident fish and ducks. Tundra ponds and lakes are areas where accumulated terrestrial peat carbon is apparently transferred to aquatic insect larvae and passed on to higher organisms. The lack of functionally analogous abundant marine prey organisms may explain why peat carbon is not efficiently transferred to apical food web species in the marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2057878435,"Unit cell parameters of synthetic zeolite 4A were measured at several pressures to 40 kilobars with both water and an alcohol mixture as hydrostatic pressure media. Compression in water was normal, with no observed phase transitions. Compression in alcohols was twice as great as in water, and three volume discontinuities were observed. These volume changes in alcohol were rapid with increasing pressure but sluggish in reverse. High-pressure ""phases,"" all of which are dimensionally cubic, are progressively more compressible at high pressure. These unusual high-pressure phenomena, which indicate significant interactions between zeolite 4A and the hydrostatic media, are consistent with differences in zeolite adsorption of water alcohols."
https://openalex.org/W1988533664,"Lithium is found to transform from a body-centered cubic (bcc) to a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure at 6.9 gigapascals (69 kilobars) and 296 kelvin. The relative volume of the bcc structured lithium at 6.9 gigapascals is 0.718, and the fcc structure is 0.25 percent denser. The bulk modulus and its pressure derivative for the bcc structure are 11.57 gigapascals and 3.4, and for the fcc structure are 13.1 gigapascals and 2.8. Extrapolation of the bcc-fcc phase boundary and the melting curve indicate a triple point around 15 gigapascals and 500 kelvin."

The methods and techniques for extending time-resolved measurements into the femtosecond (10(-15) second) time domain are described, and recent applications and fertile areas for investigation with femtosecond pulses are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1996128667,"Thirteen diamond stones from various unspecified mines in South Africa were analyzed for the isotopic ratio of helium-3 to helium-4. Values of the ratio ranged from less than 10–7 to (3.2 ± 0.25) × 10–4. The latter value is higher than the primordial helium-3/helium-4 ratio in meteorites and close to the ratio for solar-type helium. Such extremely high values may represent primitive helium that evolved very little (that is, showed very little increase in radiogenic helium-4) since the formation of the earth."
https://openalex.org/W2036924161,"Extreme sexual dimorphism in the Bivalvia is rare. The occurrence of dwarf males in Zachsia appears to be the first case in the Teredinidae and the first outside the Leptonacea. Female Zachsia release straight-hinge larvae that develop in the plankton and settle on living rhizomes of Phyllospadix. Larvae entering mantle pouches of females become males. Evolution of this life history pattern is tied to problems of living in a fragile, patchy habitat-that is, the rhizomes of Phyllospadix."
https://openalex.org/W1979212327,"The role of the small farm in American agriculture has been the focus of much public discussion since Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland elevated farm structure to the national political agenda during the Carter Administration. Eight hypotheses based on common assertions concerning the alleged advantages of the small farm were tested in the light of available empirical evidence. No basis was found to accept any of the eight hypotheses. There may be reasons to preserve and even encourage small farms but they are not the reasons commonly given for political initiatives and public policies favoring small farms. Although it is questionable whether any size of farm can be viewed as optimal, the strongest case is for the typical moderate-size family farm of today rather than for small farms or large industrial-type farms."
https://openalex.org/W2037659710,A well-defined seismic zone recently detected in Virginia has an orientation that is not related to the surrounding geologic structures. The orientation of the zone appears to be related to features below the Appalachian overthrust belt. A damaging earthquake that is important in evaluating seismic hazard in the southeastern United States may have occurred in the zone in 1897.
