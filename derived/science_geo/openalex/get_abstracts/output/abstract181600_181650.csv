https://openalex.org/W1982161876,"Monodisperse samples of silver nanocubes were synthesized in large quantities by reducing silver nitrate with ethylene glycol in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). These cubes were single crystals and were characterized by a slightly truncated shape bounded by [100], [110], and [111] facets. The presence of PVP and its molar ratio (in terms of repeating unit) relative to silver nitrate both played important roles in determining the geometric shape and size of the product. The silver cubes could serve as sacrificial templates to generate single-crystalline nanoboxes of gold: hollow polyhedra bounded by six [100] and eight [111] facets. Controlling the size, shape, and structure of metal nanoparticles is technologically important because of the strong correlation between these parameters and optical, electrical, and catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2126747203,"Cardiac injury in mammals and amphibians typically leads to scarring, with minimal regeneration of heart muscle. Here, we demonstrate histologically that zebrafish fully regenerate hearts within 2 months of 20% ventricular resection. Regeneration occurs through robust proliferation of cardiomyocytes localized at the leading epicardial edge of the new myocardium. The hearts of zebrafish with mutations in the Mps1 mitotic checkpoint kinase, a critical cell cycle regulator, failed to regenerate and formed scars. Thus, injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation in zebrafish can overcome scar formation, allowing cardiac muscle regeneration. These findings indicate that zebrafish will be useful for genetically dissecting the molecular mechanisms of cardiac regeneration."

The modern ascidian tadpole represents a plausible approximation to these ancestral chordates. To illuminate the origins of chordate and vertebrates, we generated a draft of the protein-coding portion of the genome of the most studied ascidian, Ciona intestinalis . The Ciona genome contains ∼16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates. Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona , suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development. The ascidian genome has also acquired a number of lineage-specific innovations, including a group of genes engaged in cellulose metabolism that are related to those in bacteria and fungi."

The average annual rate of increase was 2.0 +/- 0.7 cubic kilometers per year. Consequently, average annual discharge from the six rivers is now about 128 cubic kilometers per year greater than it was when routine measurements of discharge began. Discharge was correlated with changes in both the North Atlantic Oscillation and global mean surface air temperature. The observed large-scale change in freshwater flux has potentially important implications for ocean circulation and climate."

Here, we show that human memory B lymphocytes proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells in response to polyclonal stimuli, such as bystander T cell help and CpG DNA. Furthermore, plasma cells secreting antibodies to recall antigens are produced in vivo at levels proportional to the frequency of specific memory B cells, even several years after antigenic stimulation. Although antigen boosting leads to a transient increase in specific antibody levels, ongoing polyclonal activation of memory B cells offers a means to maintain serological memory for a human lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2049207331,"In a decade-long soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in order to investigate the consequences of these changes for the climate system. Here we show that whereas soil warming accelerates soil organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, this response is small and short-lived for a mid-latitude forest, because of the limited size of the labile soil carbon pool. We also show that warming increases the availability of mineral nitrogen to plants. Because plant growth in many mid-latitude forests is nitrogen-limited, warming has the potential to indirectly stimulate enough carbon storage in plants to at least compensate for the carbon losses from soils. Our results challenge assumptions made in some climate models that lead to projections of large long-term releases of soil carbon in response to warming of forest ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2048400783,"Ecosystem responses to increased variability in rainfall, a prediction of general circulation models, were assessed in native grassland by reducing storm frequency and increasing rainfall quantity per storm during a 4-year experiment. More extreme rainfall patterns, without concurrent changes in total rainfall quantity, increased temporal variability in soil moisture and plant species diversity. However, carbon cycling processes such as soil CO 2 flux, CO 2 uptake by the dominant grasses, and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were reduced, and ANPP was more responsive to soil moisture variability than to mean soil water content. Our results show that projected increases in rainfall variability can rapidly alter key carbon cycling processes and plant community composition, independent of changes in total precipitation."

Melanopsin ( Opn4 ), an opsin-based photopigment, is a primary candidate for photoreceptor-mediated entrainment. To investigate the functional role of melanopsin in light resetting of the oscillator, we generated melanopsin-null mice ( Opn4 −/− ). These mice entrain to a light/dark cycle and do not exhibit any overt defect in circadian activity rhythms under constant darkness. However, they display severely attenuated phase resetting in response to brief pulses of monochromatic light, highlighting the critical role of melanopsin in circadian photoentrainment in mammals."

The electron transfer chain of mitochondria is a well documented source of H2O2; however, the release of O 2⨪ from mitochondria into cytosol has not been unequivocally established. This study was aimed at validating mitochondria as sources of cytosolic O 2⨪, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the release of O 2⨪ from mitochondria into cytosol, and assessing the role of outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) in this process. Isolated rat heart mitochondria supplemented with complex I or II substrates generate an EPR signal ascribed to O 2⨪. Inhibition of the signal in a concentration-dependent manner by both manganese-superoxide dismutase and cytochromec proteins that cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane supports the extramitochondrial location of the spin adduct. Basal rates of O 2⨪ release from mitochondria were estimated at ∼0.04 nmol/min/mg protein, a value increased ∼8-fold by the complex III inhibitor, antimycin A. These estimates, obtained by quantitative spin-trapping EPR, were confirmed by fluorescence techniques, mainly hydroethidine oxidation and horseradish peroxidase-basedp-hydroxyphylacetate dimerization. Inhibitors of VDAC, 4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS), and dextran sulfate (in a voltage-dependent manner) inhibited O 2⨪ production from mitochondria by ∼55%, thus suggesting that a large portion of O 2⨪ exited mitochondria via these channels. These findings are discussed in terms of competitive decay pathways for O 2⨪ in the intermembrane space and cytosol as well as the implications of these processes for modulating cell signaling pathways in these compartments.

These findings are discussed in terms of competitive decay pathways for O 2⨪ in the intermembrane space and cytosol as well as the implications of these processes for modulating cell signaling pathways in these compartments. Mitochondria from various aerobic organisms have been recognized as effective sources of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Google Scholar, 2Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Google Scholar). H2O2produced by mitochondria has been suggested to regulate several signal transduction pathways, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) activity (3Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Google Scholar, 4Nemoto S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7311-7318Google Scholar). Alterations in mitochondrial H2O2 steady-state levels by genetic modulation of catalase expression in the mitochondrial matrix is associated with changes in cell proliferation (3Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response (6Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19241-19249Google Scholar), and apoptosis (7Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Google Scholar).A two-step model that accounts for mitochondrial H2O2 production has become widely accepted (8Boveris A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 78: 67-82Google Scholar,9Cadenas E. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Google Scholar). The first step, shown below in Reaction 1, UQ⨪+O2→UQ+O2⨪REACTION 1 entails the autoxidation of ubisemiquinone in the respiratory chain to generate O 2⨪, which is released into the mitochondrial matrix (10Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Google Scholar, 11Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Google Scholar). The second step entails the conversion of O 2⨪to H2O2 catalyzed by manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), which resides in the mitochondrial matrix. H2O2 diffuses rapidly through membranes (12Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Google Scholar), and the release of H2O2 from mitochondria to cytosol reflects the balance between H2O2production and consumption reactions, with the latter mainly involving reduction of the hydroperoxide to H2O via matrix glutathione peroxidase. Mitochondria contribute ∼20–30% to the cytosolic steady-state concentration of H2O2 (∼10−8m) (13Boveris A. Cadenas E. Mazzaro D. Clerch L. Oxygen, Gene Expression, and Cellular Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 1-25Google Scholar).Two recent findings have modified and extended this two-step mechanism for mitochondrial production of H2O2. First, part of the O 2⨪ generated during mitochondrial electron transfer is vectorially released into the intermembrane space (14Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2000; 353: 411-416Google Scholar). Evidence for this, obtained with mitoplasts (mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane), consisted of abrogation of the EPR spin adduct signal by superoxide dismutase, competitive inhibition by cytochromec, and broadening of the signal by membrane-impermeable spin-broadening agents (14Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2000; 353: 411-416Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the release of O 2⨪ into the intermembrane space considers the formation of ubisemiquinone (Reaction 1) at two sites in the ubiquinone pool, the QI site that lies near the matrix and the QOsite in the vicinity of the intermembrane space (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 16Sharp R.E. Moser C.C. Gibney B.R. Dutton P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 225-233Google Scholar). Autoxidation of ubisemiquinone at the QO site (UQ O⨪) results in release of O 2⨪ into the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Of note, O 2⨪ cannot cross membranes except in the protonated form (a small fraction of the O 2⨪ pool at physiological pH; pK a = 4.8) (17Gus'kova R.A. Ivanov I. Akhobadze V.V. Rubin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 579-583Google Scholar). Taken together, this finding suggests that H2O2 could be formed both at the intermembrane space and matrix from O 2⨪ generated toward the respective compartments.Second, the release of O 2⨪ toward the intermembrane space would be in functional relationship to the localization of a superoxide dismutase activity in this compartment. Indeed, the occurrence of a Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space of mitochondria has recently been confirmed both in rat liver (18Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Google Scholar, 19Inarrea P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 106-114Google Scholar) and yeast (20Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). These findings ended a 30-year debate following the initial report on the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space (21Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Google Scholar), which was challenged on the basis of a contamination by lysosomes (22Geller B.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8945-8952Google Scholar).The vectorial release of O 2⨪ into the intermembrane space raises the question of whether O 2⨪ generated in this manner can diffuse into the cytosol across the outer membrane and both contribute to the cytosolic steady-state levels of this species and participate in the regulation of cell signaling cascades. The intermembrane space contains several O 2⨪-scavenging pathways (cytochromec and the intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD) as well as pores for O 2⨪ diffusion across the outer membrane, in particular, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). 1The abbreviations used are: VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channels; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMPO, 5,5′–dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′ disulfonic acid stilbene; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channels; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMPO, 5,5′–dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′ disulfonic acid stilbene; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Physiologically, VDAC functions as the major channel allowing passage of low molecular weight solutes and proteins between the intermembrane space and cytoplasm (23Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 127-171Google Scholar, 24Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 207-218Google Scholar) and, more recently, its role both in the release of the pro-apoptotic cytochrome c and in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore has been described (25Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Google Scholar, 26Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar). The channel formed by VDAC has a diameter of 2–4 nm and is more selective for the passage of anions than cations (24Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 207-218Google Scholar). Erythrocyte membranes have been shown to contain an anion channel through which O 2⨪ can diffuse (24Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 207-218Google Scholar).VDAC may act similarly as a channel that allows the movement of O 2⨪ from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasmic surface of the outer membrane of mitochondria. This study was aimed at validating mitochondria as sources of cytosolic O 2⨪, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the release of O 2⨪ from mitochondria into cytosol, and assessing the role of outer membrane VDACs in this process.DISCUSSIONThe mitochondrial respiratory chain has long been recognized as an effective source of H2O2 originating from the disproportionation of O 2⨪. Diffusion of O 2⨪ from mitochondria is the consequence of two major events: (i) UQ O⨪autoxidation to generate O 2⨪ into the intermembrane compartment; and (ii) diffusion of O 2⨪ from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasm through VDAC.The notion of UQ O⨪ oxidation as the source of O 2⨪ in the intermembrane space is supported by the mechanism underlying the effect of the complex III inhibitors antimycin and myxothiazol. The former blocks electron transfer from cytochromeb H to the inner ubiquinone pool (UQI) as seen in, UQI+cytbH2+→UQI⨪+cytbH3+REACTION 5 thus resulting, through Reaction 6, cytbH3++cytbL2+→cytbH2++cytbL3+REACTION 6 in decreased cytochrome b L3+levels and, ultimately, an increase of UQO⨪ level by limiting the rate, as seen in Reaction 7, cytbL3++UQO⨪→cytbL2++UQOREACTION 7 of the electron transfer (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 44Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar). The latter, myxothiazol, binds to the QO site of the ubiquinone pool, thereby blocking electron transfer from ubiquinol (UQH2 or its monoanionic form, UQH−) to iron-sulfur clusters (45von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar), as seen in Reaction 8, UQOH−+[Fe2S2]ox→UQ0⋅¯+[Fe2S2]redREACTION 8 resulting in the inhibition of UQ UQ0⋅¯ formation (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 44Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar,46Ksenzenko M. Konstantinov A.A. Khomutov G.B. Tikhonov A.N. Ruuge E.K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 19-24Google Scholar). The effects of antimycin A and myxothiazol reported here (Fig. 1and Table I) are consistent with this electron transfer sequence (Reactions 5–8) and strengthen the QO site of the ubiquinone pool in O 2⨪ generation by mitochondria.A role for VDAC in O 2⨪ diffusion from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasm is supported by the effect of inhibitors. VDAC is the major channel in the outer membrane responsible for the passage of low molecular weight solutes and proteins between the intermembrane space and the cytoplasm. The concept that VDAC may act as a O 2⨪channel is not entirely surprising, because in erythrocyte membranes an anion channel that allows the diffusion of O 2⨪ has been previously characterized (47Lynch R.E. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4697-4699Google Scholar). In this study, two VDAC inhibitors, DIDS and dextran disulfate, decreased O 2⨪ production (in a voltage-dependent manner) in isolated heart mitochondria. Although VDAC inhibition by DIDS is nonspecific, inhibition by dextran sulfate in a voltage dependent manner is a feature that has been only observed for VDAC (42Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Google Scholar). Based on the work with VDAC inhibitors, our data suggest that the opening and closing of VDAC modulates the flux of mitochondrially generated O 2⨪ into cytosol. However, the physiological regulators of VDAC are not known.For topological and structural reasons, the diffusion of O 2⨪through VDAC may be an important pathway for removal of this species from the intermembrane space even in the presence of an intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD. First, the selectivity of VDAC for anions over cations has been attributed to positively charged amino acids in the core of the channel attracting negatively charged compounds (43Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 309-320Google Scholar). Thus, analogous to the positive charges of copper in Cu,Zn-SOD attracting O 2⨪, positive charges in VDAC may similarly attract O 2⨪. Topologically, the inner membrane where O 2⨪ is produced remains close to the VDAC. In areas where the inner membrane and outer membrane are parallel, the mean width of intermembrane space is estimated to be 22 nm (48Perkins G.A. Renken C.W. Song J.Y. Frey T.G. Young S.J. Lamont S. Martone M.E. Lindsey S. Elisman M.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 219-227Google Scholar). At points near the contact junctions, where the inner and outer membrane meet, the inner membrane lies extremely close to the cytoplasm. Mathematical modeling suggests that the mean displacement of O 2⨪, generated from the respiratory chain, is 400 nm in the matrix, taking into account the presence of Mn-SOD (49Antunes F. Salvador A. Marinho H.S. Alves R. Pinto R.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 917-943Google Scholar). If the estimated O 2⨪ mean displacement is applied to the intermembrane space, O 2⨪ generated toward the intermembrane space could diffuse across the outer membrane, especially near the contact junctions.Interestingly, neither DIDS nor dextran disulfate inhibited O 2⨪production by mitochondria completely. This suggests that either the VDAC inhibitors failed to completely close VDAC, or that O 2⨪diffused through channels in the outer membrane other than VDAC. The latter view is sustained by the occurrence of two other channels in addition to VDAC in the outer membrane, i.e. translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the peptide-sensitive channel (PSC), both of which are believed to participate in protein translocation (23Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 127-171Google Scholar). It has been suggested that NADH diffusion through the outer membrane is mediated by TOM when VDAC is inactivated (50Antos N. Stobienia O. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 119-126Google Scholar). Similarly, VDAC-deficient yeast still remains viable and can grow on nonfermentable carbon sources below 37 °C (50Antos N. Stobienia O. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 119-126Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TOM might serve as a backup metabolic channel (50Antos N. Stobienia O. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 119-126Google Scholar, 51Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Google Scholar) when VDAC loses function.Diffusion of O 2⨪ from mitochondria into cytosol is difficult to assess because conventional methods to measure O 2⨪, such as epinephrine oxidation or cytochrome c reduction, lack sensitivity and suffer from interference with mitochondrial enzymic activities. In this study, evidence obtained with spin-trapping EPR, which allows signal accumulation, supports the notion that O 2⨪can be vectorially released from mitochondria into cytosol at basal rates of ∼0.041 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein; expectedly, this rate was substantially enhanced (∼8-fold) by antimycin A. The basal rate of O 2⨪ release from mitochondria (0.041 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein) is probably an underestimation and probably represents only a portion of the total O 2⨪ that is generated toward the intermembrane space. The levels of O 2⨪ in this compartment is probably determined by several competing pathways: (i) diffusion to cytosol through VDAC and other outer membrane channels; (ii) reaction with cytochromec 3+ (reaction 3 above; k 3= 2.5 × 105m−1s−1); and (iii) dismutation to H2O2 that is either spontaneous (k = 4.5 × 105m−1s−1) or catalyzed by intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD (k = 0.62 × 109m−1s−1). Based on its fast catalytic activity, the latter may represent the prevalent scavenging pathway for O 2⨪. However, although the existence of intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD has been demonstrated in liver and yeast (18Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Google Scholar, 20Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar), its concentration and even its existence in heart mitochondria is, at present, unknown. Because of a modest rate constant, the reaction between cytochrome c and O 2⨪would represent another O 2⨪ scavenging pathway in the intermembrane space. However much of cytochrome c is believed to be ionically bound to the inner membrane, limiting its mobility (52Lenaz G. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 193-209Google Scholar) and ability to scavenge O 2⨪.The physiological and pathophysiological implications for O 2⨪released toward the intermembrane space and cytosol remain to be explored. O 2⨪ released into the cytoplasm from mitochondria may play an important role in cell signaling, because O 2⨪ has been implicated in several signaling events. In addition, cytoplasmic aconitase and other cytoplasmic enzymes susceptible to O 2⨪ may be targets of O 2⨪ released from mitochondria (53Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Google Scholar). Another important decay pathway of O 2⨪ released from mitochondria may involve its reaction (at a diffusion-controlled rate) with nitric oxide (·NO) to yield the peroxynitrite. This O 2⨪ decay pathway may be of significance in the intermembrane compartment, because nitrosation of cytochrome c and pro-apoptotic caspases that reside in the intermembrane space have been demonstrated to occur prior to apoptosis by some unidentified mechanism (54Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C. Papeta N. Ghafourifar P. Szibor M. Fang K. Gaston B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1111-1116Google Scholar). O 2⨪ generated toward the intermembrane space may play an important role in nitration of these pro-apoptotic enzymes through ONOO− formation when ·NO is present. In liver, 92% of total superoxide dismutase activity is found in the cytoplasm (55Tyler D.D. Biochem. J. 1975; 147: 493-504Google Scholar), whereas only 8% is in mitochondria. Cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD may therefore function to protect cytoplasmic proteins from mitochondrial O 2⨪ as well as from cytoplasmic O 2⨪ sources. Mitochondria from various aerobic organisms have been recognized as effective sources of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol.

H2O2produced by mitochondria has been suggested to regulate several signal transduction pathways, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) activity (3Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Google Scholar, 4Nemoto S. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7311-7318Google Scholar). Alterations in mitochondrial H2O2 steady-state levels by genetic modulation of catalase expression in the mitochondrial matrix is associated with changes in cell proliferation (3Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response (6Bai J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19241-19249Google Scholar), and apoptosis (7Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Google Scholar). A two-step model that accounts for mitochondrial H2O2 production has become widely accepted (8Boveris A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 78: 67-82Google Scholar,9Cadenas E. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Google Scholar). The first step, shown below in Reaction 1, UQ⨪+O2→UQ+O2⨪REACTION 1 entails the autoxidation of ubisemiquinone in the respiratory chain to generate O 2⨪, which is released into the mitochondrial matrix (10Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 435-444Google Scholar, 11Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Google Scholar). The second step entails the conversion of O 2⨪to H2O2 catalyzed by manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), which resides in the mitochondrial matrix. H2O2 diffuses rapidly through membranes (12Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Google Scholar), and the release of H2O2 from mitochondria to cytosol reflects the balance between H2O2production and consumption reactions, with the latter mainly involving reduction of the hydroperoxide to H2O via matrix glutathione peroxidase. Mitochondria contribute ∼20–30% to the cytosolic steady-state concentration of H2O2 (∼10−8m) (13Boveris A. Cadenas E. Mazzaro D. Clerch L. Oxygen, Gene Expression, and Cellular Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997: 1-25Google Scholar). Two recent findings have modified and extended this two-step mechanism for mitochondrial production of H2O2. First, part of the O 2⨪ generated during mitochondrial electron transfer is vectorially released into the intermembrane space (14Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2000; 353: 411-416Google Scholar). Evidence for this, obtained with mitoplasts (mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane), consisted of abrogation of the EPR spin adduct signal by superoxide dismutase, competitive inhibition by cytochromec, and broadening of the signal by membrane-impermeable spin-broadening agents (14Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2000; 353: 411-416Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the release of O 2⨪ into the intermembrane space considers the formation of ubisemiquinone (Reaction 1) at two sites in the ubiquinone pool, the QI site that lies near the matrix and the QOsite in the vicinity of the intermembrane space (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 16Sharp R.E. Moser C.C. Gibney B.R. Dutton P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 225-233Google Scholar). Autoxidation of ubisemiquinone at the QO site (UQ O⨪) results in release of O 2⨪ into the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Of note, O 2⨪ cannot cross membranes except in the protonated form (a small fraction of the O 2⨪ pool at physiological pH; pK a = 4.8) (17Gus'kova R.A. Ivanov I. Akhobadze V.V. Rubin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 579-583Google Scholar). Taken together, this finding suggests that H2O2 could be formed both at the intermembrane space and matrix from O 2⨪ generated toward the respective compartments. Second, the release of O 2⨪ toward the intermembrane space would be in functional relationship to the localization of a superoxide dismutase activity in this compartment. Indeed, the occurrence of a Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space of mitochondria has recently been confirmed both in rat liver (18Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Google Scholar, 19Inarrea P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 106-114Google Scholar) and yeast (20Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar). These findings ended a 30-year debate following the initial report on the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD in the intermembrane space (21Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Google Scholar), which was challenged on the basis of a contamination by lysosomes (22Geller B.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8945-8952Google Scholar). The vectorial release of O 2⨪ into the intermembrane space raises the question of whether O 2⨪ generated in this manner can diffuse into the cytosol across the outer membrane and both contribute to the cytosolic steady-state levels of this species and participate in the regulation of cell signaling cascades. The intermembrane space contains several O 2⨪-scavenging pathways (cytochromec and the intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD) as well as pores for O 2⨪ diffusion across the outer membrane, in particular, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). 1The abbreviations used are: VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channels; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMPO, 5,5′–dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′ disulfonic acid stilbene; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channels; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DMPO, 5,5′–dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′ disulfonic acid stilbene; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Physiologically, VDAC functions as the major channel allowing passage of low molecular weight solutes and proteins between the intermembrane space and cytoplasm (23Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 127-171Google Scholar, 24Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 207-218Google Scholar) and, more recently, its role both in the release of the pro-apoptotic cytochrome c and in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore has been described (25Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Google Scholar, 26Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Li X.X. Schumacker P.T. Colombini M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4666-4671Google Scholar). The channel formed by VDAC has a diameter of 2–4 nm and is more selective for the passage of anions than cations (24Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 207-218Google Scholar). Erythrocyte membranes have been shown to contain an anion channel through which O 2⨪ can diffuse (24Mannella C.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 207-218Google Scholar). VDAC may act similarly as a channel that allows the movement of O 2⨪ from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasmic surface of the outer membrane of mitochondria. This study was aimed at validating mitochondria as sources of cytosolic O 2⨪, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the release of O 2⨪ from mitochondria into cytosol, and assessing the role of outer membrane VDACs in this process. DISCUSSIONThe mitochondrial respiratory chain has long been recognized as an effective source of H2O2 originating from the disproportionation of O 2⨪. Diffusion of O 2⨪ from mitochondria is the consequence of two major events: (i) UQ O⨪autoxidation to generate O 2⨪ into the intermembrane compartment; and (ii) diffusion of O 2⨪ from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasm through VDAC.The notion of UQ O⨪ oxidation as the source of O 2⨪ in the intermembrane space is supported by the mechanism underlying the effect of the complex III inhibitors antimycin and myxothiazol. The former blocks electron transfer from cytochromeb H to the inner ubiquinone pool (UQI) as seen in, UQI+cytbH2+→UQI⨪+cytbH3+REACTION 5 thus resulting, through Reaction 6, cytbH3++cytbL2+→cytbH2++cytbL3+REACTION 6 in decreased cytochrome b L3+levels and, ultimately, an increase of UQO⨪ level by limiting the rate, as seen in Reaction 7, cytbL3++UQO⨪→cytbL2++UQOREACTION 7 of the electron transfer (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 44Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar). The latter, myxothiazol, binds to the QO site of the ubiquinone pool, thereby blocking electron transfer from ubiquinol (UQH2 or its monoanionic form, UQH−) to iron-sulfur clusters (45von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar), as seen in Reaction 8, UQOH−+[Fe2S2]ox→UQ0⋅¯+[Fe2S2]redREACTION 8 resulting in the inhibition of UQ UQ0⋅¯ formation (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 44Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar,46Ksenzenko M. Konstantinov A.A. Khomutov G.B. Tikhonov A.N. Ruuge E.K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 19-24Google Scholar). The effects of antimycin A and myxothiazol reported here (Fig. 1and Table I) are consistent with this electron transfer sequence (Reactions 5–8) and strengthen the QO site of the ubiquinone pool in O 2⨪ generation by mitochondria.A role for VDAC in O 2⨪ diffusion from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasm is supported by the effect of inhibitors. VDAC is the major channel in the outer membrane responsible for the passage of low molecular weight solutes and proteins between the intermembrane space and the cytoplasm. The concept that VDAC may act as a O 2⨪channel is not entirely surprising, because in erythrocyte membranes an anion channel that allows the diffusion of O 2⨪ has been previously characterized (47Lynch R.E. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4697-4699Google Scholar). In this study, two VDAC inhibitors, DIDS and dextran disulfate, decreased O 2⨪ production (in a voltage-dependent manner) in isolated heart mitochondria. Although VDAC inhibition by DIDS is nonspecific, inhibition by dextran sulfate in a voltage dependent manner is a feature that has been only observed for VDAC (42Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4896-4900Google Scholar). Based on the work with VDAC inhibitors, our data suggest that the opening and closing of VDAC modulates the flux of mitochondrially generated O 2⨪ into cytosol. However, the physiological regulators of VDAC are not known.For topological and structural reasons, the diffusion of O 2⨪through VDAC may be an important pathway for removal of this species from the intermembrane space even in the presence of an intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD. First, the selectivity of VDAC for anions over cations has been attributed to positively charged amino acids in the core of the channel attracting negatively charged compounds (43Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 309-320Google Scholar). Thus, analogous to the positive charges of copper in Cu,Zn-SOD attracting O 2⨪, positive charges in VDAC may similarly attract O 2⨪. Topologically, the inner membrane where O 2⨪ is produced remains close to the VDAC. In areas where the inner membrane and outer membrane are parallel, the mean width of intermembrane space is estimated to be 22 nm (48Perkins G.A. Renken C.W. Song J.Y. Frey T.G. Young S.J. Lamont S. Martone M.E. Lindsey S. Elisman M.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 219-227Google Scholar). At points near the contact junctions, where the inner and outer membrane meet, the inner membrane lies extremely close to the cytoplasm. Mathematical modeling suggests that the mean displacement of O 2⨪, generated from the respiratory chain, is 400 nm in the matrix, taking into account the presence of Mn-SOD (49Antunes F. Salvador A. Marinho H.S. Alves R. Pinto R.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 917-943Google Scholar). If the estimated O 2⨪ mean displacement is applied to the intermembrane space, O 2⨪ generated toward the intermembrane space could diffuse across the outer membrane, especially near the contact junctions.Interestingly, neither DIDS nor dextran disulfate inhibited O 2⨪production by mitochondria completely. This suggests that either the VDAC inhibitors failed to completely close VDAC, or that O 2⨪diffused through channels in the outer membrane other than VDAC. The latter view is sustained by the occurrence of two other channels in addition to VDAC in the outer membrane, i.e. translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the peptide-sensitive channel (PSC), both of which are believed to participate in protein translocation (23Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 127-171Google Scholar). It has been suggested that NADH diffusion through the outer membrane is mediated by TOM when VDAC is inactivated (50Antos N. Stobienia O. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 119-126Google Scholar). Similarly, VDAC-deficient yeast still remains viable and can grow on nonfermentable carbon sources below 37 °C (50Antos N. Stobienia O. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 119-126Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TOM might serve as a backup metabolic channel (50Antos N. Stobienia O. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 119-126Google Scholar, 51Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Google Scholar) when VDAC loses function.Diffusion of O 2⨪ from mitochondria into cytosol is difficult to assess because conventional methods to measure O 2⨪, such as epinephrine oxidation or cytochrome c reduction, lack sensitivity and suffer from interference with mitochondrial enzymic activities. In this study, evidence obtained with spin-trapping EPR, which allows signal accumulation, supports the notion that O 2⨪can be vectorially released from mitochondria into cytosol at basal rates of ∼0.041 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein; expectedly, this rate was substantially enhanced (∼8-fold) by antimycin A. The basal rate of O 2⨪ release from mitochondria (0.041 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein) is probably an underestimation and probably represents only a portion of the total O 2⨪ that is generated toward the intermembrane space. The levels of O 2⨪ in this compartment is probably determined by several competing pathways: (i) diffusion to cytosol through VDAC and other outer membrane channels; (ii) reaction with cytochromec 3+ (reaction 3 above; k 3= 2.5 × 105m−1s−1); and (iii) dismutation to H2O2 that is either spontaneous (k = 4.5 × 105m−1s−1) or catalyzed by intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD (k = 0.62 × 109m−1s−1). Based on its fast catalytic activity, the latter may represent the prevalent scavenging pathway for O 2⨪. However, although the existence of intermembrane space Cu,Zn-SOD has been demonstrated in liver and yeast (18Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-38393Google Scholar, 20Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Google Scholar), its concentration and even its existence in heart mitochondria is, at present, unknown. Because of a modest rate constant, the reaction between cytochrome c and O 2⨪would represent another O 2⨪ scavenging pathway in the intermembrane space. However much of cytochrome c is believed to be ionically bound to the inner membrane, limiting its mobility (52Lenaz G. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 193-209Google Scholar) and ability to scavenge O 2⨪.The physiological and pathophysiological implications for O 2⨪released toward the intermembrane space and cytosol remain to be explored. O 2⨪ released into the cytoplasm from mitochondria may play an important role in cell signaling, because O 2⨪ has been implicated in several signaling events. In addition, cytoplasmic aconitase and other cytoplasmic enzymes susceptible to O 2⨪ may be targets of O 2⨪ released from mitochondria (53Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Google Scholar). Another important decay pathway of O 2⨪ released from mitochondria may involve its reaction (at a diffusion-controlled rate) with nitric oxide (·NO) to yield the peroxynitrite. This O 2⨪ decay pathway may be of significance in the intermembrane compartment, because nitrosation of cytochrome c and pro-apoptotic caspases that reside in the intermembrane space have been demonstrated to occur prior to apoptosis by some unidentified mechanism (54Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C. Papeta N. Ghafourifar P. Szibor M. Fang K. Gaston B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1111-1116Google Scholar). O 2⨪ generated toward the intermembrane space may play an important role in nitration of these pro-apoptotic enzymes through ONOO− formation when ·NO is present. In liver, 92% of total superoxide dismutase activity is found in the cytoplasm (55Tyler D.D. Biochem. J. 1975; 147: 493-504Google Scholar), whereas only 8% is in mitochondria. Cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD may therefore function to protect cytoplasmic proteins from mitochondrial O 2⨪ as well as from cytoplasmic O 2⨪ sources. The mitochondrial respiratory chain has long been recognized as an effective source of H2O2 originating from the disproportionation of O 2⨪. Diffusion of O 2⨪ from mitochondria is the consequence of two major events: (i) UQ O⨪autoxidation to generate O 2⨪ into the intermembrane compartment; and (ii) diffusion of O 2⨪ from the intermembrane space to the cytoplasm through VDAC.

J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 44Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar). The latter, myxothiazol, binds to the QO site of the ubiquinone pool, thereby blocking electron transfer from ubiquinol (UQH2 or its monoanionic form, UQH−) to iron-sulfur clusters (45von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Google Scholar), as seen in Reaction 8, UQOH−+[Fe2S2]ox→UQ0⋅¯+[Fe2S2]redREACTION 8 resulting in the inhibition of UQ UQ0⋅¯ formation (15de Vries S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 196-224Google Scholar, 44Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar,46Ksenzenko M. Konstantinov A.A. Khomutov G.B. Tikhonov A.N. Ruuge E.K. FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 19-24Google Scholar).

Because of a modest rate constant, the reaction between cytochrome c and O 2⨪would represent another O 2⨪ scavenging pathway in the intermembrane space. However much of cytochrome c is believed to be ionically bound to the inner membrane, limiting its mobility (52Lenaz G. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 193-209Google Scholar) and ability to scavenge O 2⨪. The physiological and pathophysiological implications for O 2⨪released toward the intermembrane space and cytosol remain to be explored. O 2⨪ released into the cytoplasm from mitochondria may play an important role in cell signaling, because O 2⨪ has been implicated in several signaling events. In addition, cytoplasmic aconitase and other cytoplasmic enzymes susceptible to O 2⨪ may be targets of O 2⨪ released from mitochondria (53Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Google Scholar). Another important decay pathway of O 2⨪ released from mitochondria may involve its reaction (at a diffusion-controlled rate) with nitric oxide (·NO) to yield the peroxynitrite. This O 2⨪ decay pathway may be of significance in the intermembrane compartment, because nitrosation of cytochrome c and pro-apoptotic caspases that reside in the intermembrane space have been demonstrated to occur prior to apoptosis by some unidentified mechanism (54Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C. Papeta N. Ghafourifar P. Szibor M. Fang K. Gaston B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1111-1116Google Scholar). O 2⨪ generated toward the intermembrane space may play an important role in nitration of these pro-apoptotic enzymes through ONOO− formation when ·NO is present. In liver, 92% of total superoxide dismutase activity is found in the cytoplasm (55Tyler D.D. Biochem. J. 1975; 147: 493-504Google Scholar), whereas only 8% is in mitochondria. Cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-SOD may therefore function to protect cytoplasmic proteins from mitochondrial O 2⨪ as well as from cytoplasmic O 2⨪ sources."
https://openalex.org/W2110209988,"Melanopsin has been proposed as an important photoreceptive molecule for the mammalian circadian system. Its importance in this role was tested in melanopsin knockout mice. These mice entrained to a light/dark cycle, phase-shifted after a light pulse, and increased circadian period when light intensity increased. Induction of the immediate-early gene c- fos was observed after a nighttime light pulse in both wild-type and knockout mice. However, the magnitude of these behavioral responses in knockout mice was 40% lower than in wild-type mice. Although melanopsin is not essential for the circadian clock to receive photic input, it contributes significantly to the magnitude of photic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2117914928,"Western tonal music relies on a formal geometric structure that determines distance relationships within a harmonic or tonal space. In functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we identified an area in the rostromedial prefrontal cortex that tracks activation in tonal space. Different voxels in this area exhibited selectivity for different keys. Within the same set of consistently activated voxels, the topography of tonality selectivity rearranged itself across scanning sessions. The tonality structure was thus maintained as a dynamic topography in cortical areas known to be at a nexus of cognitive, affective, and mnemonic processing."

Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar) are a remarkable family of small plant-derived proteins that have the unique feature of a circular protein backbone. They typically contain 28–37 amino acids linked in a continuous circle of peptide bonds and thus contain no free N or C terminus. They are further characterized by six conserved cysteine residues that form a tight network of disulfide bonds in their protein core. The cyclotides are extremely resistant to proteolysis and are remarkably stable. These features have led to suggestions that this protein family makes an excellent template for drug design applications (2Craik D.J. Simonsen S. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2002; 5: 251-260Google Scholar). They also have exciting potential applications in agriculture because they are potent insecticidal agents (3Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Google Scholar). The first reports of circular proteins in plants appeared in the mid-1990s, with the identification of viola peptide I, a hemolytic agent from Viola arvensis (4Schöpke T. Hasan Agha M.I. Kraft R. Otto A. Hiller K. Sci. Pharm. 1993; 61: 145-153Google Scholar), the anti-HIV circulins fromChassalia parvifolia (5Gustafson K.R. Sowder II, R.C. Henderson L.E. Parsons I.C. Kashman Y.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar). Soon after, a series of peptides from viola plants was identified (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol.

Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar). Additional members have been discovered in the last few years (9Hallock Y.F. Sowder R.C.I. Pannell L.K. Hughes C.B. Johnson D.G.

TableI shows a sequence alignment of the currently known cyclotides and identifies a number of conserved residues. These include the six cysteine residues as well as the highlighted residues in the six backbone loops between successive Cys residues. Loops 1 and 4 are particularly highly conserved.Table ISequence alignment of peptides from the cyclotide family Open table in a new tab Although its primary sequence and circular backbone were not characterized at the time, kalata B1 had been discovered in the 1970s as a bioactive peptide in a native medicine used by women in the Congo region of Africa to accelerate labor and childbirth. Gran (15Gran L. Medd. Nor. Farm. Selsk. 1970; 12: 173-180Google Scholar) noted that the women ingested a tea made by boiling the aerial parts ofO. affinis, and subsequent studies (16Sletten K. Gran L. Medd. Nor. Farm. Selsk. 1973; 7–8: 69-82Google Scholar) suggested that an apparent 30-amino acid peptide isolated from the plant was an active uterotonic agent (17Gran L. Sandberg F. Sletten K. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2000; 70: 197-203Google Scholar). The peptide was partially characterized at the time, but it was some 25 years later before it was established that the peptide contains 29 residues in a circular backbone (7Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar). Kalata B1 was the first cyclotide to be structurally characterized (7Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar). It is a compact miniprotein that incorporates a distorted triple-stranded β-sheet and several turns. Because of the resistance of the oxidized molecule to enzymatic cleavage it was not possible to determine its disulfide connectivity chemically, but NMR data suggested a I-IV, II-V, III-VI connectivity (7Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar). This arrangement of disulfide bonds forms a cystine knot in which an embedded ring formed by the first two disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments is penetrated by the third (i.e. III-VI) disulfide bond. Such a cystine knot motif is now well known in a wide variety of proteins, ranging from growth factors to toxins, and occurs in a wide range of organisms (18Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1833-1839Google Scholar, 19Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Google Scholar). However, the cyclotides remain as the only example in which a cystine knot is embedded within a circular protein backbone, a motif that is referred to as the cyclic cystine knot (CCK)1 (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar, 20Craik D.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1809-1813Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the conserved residues superimposed onto the cyclotide structural framework is given in Fig.1. As is apparent from the sequences in Table I, most cyclotides fall into two families, referred to as the “Möbius” or “bracelet” cyclotides based on the presence or absence of a conceptual twist in the circular backbone resulting from a cis-peptide bond preceding a proline residue (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar) in loop 5 of the sequence. The presence of this cis-Pro bond was tentatively suggested in the original report on the structure of kalata B1 (7Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar) but was confirmed in subsequent reports (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar) and is assumed to be present, based on sequence homology, in other members of the Möbius family. A recent report (21Skjeldal L. Gran L. Sletten K. Volkman B.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 142-148Google Scholar) suggested an alternative possible disulfide connectivity for kalata B1 of I-VI, II-V, III-IV. This would have major topological implications because the structure would no longer be knotted, and indeed this connectivity represents a much simpler “laddered” arrangement of the disulfide bonds as indicated in Fig.2. Clearly a more detailed structural analysis is required to resolve the ambiguity of the disulfide connectivity. In the current paper we show that a combination of NOE and coupling constant data defines the disulfide connectivity and cystine knot arrangement of prototypic cyclotides from both the Möbius and bracelet families. Since the original structural reports many more cyclotides have been discovered. A major aim of the current study was thus to undertake a detailed structural analysis of the cyclotide framework to determine the structural significance of the conserved residues. Such an analysis is necessary to allow the exploitation of this framework as a template in drug design (2Craik D.J. Simonsen S. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2002; 5: 251-260Google Scholar). In summary, in this paper we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the topological features in the unique family of cyclotide proteins, namely rings (a circular backbone), twists (acis-peptide bond in the Möbius cyclotides), and knots (formed by conserved Cys residues of the family). Kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 were extracted from the aboveground parts of O. affinis and Viola odorata, respectively, with dichloromethane:methanol (1:1 v/v) overnight at room temperature. The extracts were partitioned with chloroform and water, and the water/methanol layer was concentrated on a rotary evaporator prior to lyophilization. The dried products were redissolved in H2O and purified on a preparative reverse phase C18 column (Vydac) at 8 ml/min. The molecular weights of kalata B1 (2,892.4) and cycloviolacin O1 (3,116.7) were confirmed by mass spectrometry to be identical to the expected values. Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared by dissolving kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 in either 90% H2O and 10% D2O or 100% D2O to a final concentration of 5 mm and 1.3 mm, respectively. All spectra were recorded on Bruker ARX 500 and Bruker DMX 750 spectrometers with sample temperatures in the range 280–330 K. All spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using time proportional phasing incrementation (22Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Google Scholar). For resonance assignment and structure determination a set of two-dimensional spectra including double quantum-filtered COSY (23Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Google Scholar), TOCSY (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Google Scholar) with a MLEV17 (25Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) isotropic mixing period of 80 ms, ECOSY (26Griesinger C. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar) and NOESY (27Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Google Scholar) with mixing times of 100, 150, and 200 ms were recorded. The water proton signal in the COSY spectrum was suppressed by low power irradiation during the relaxation delay. For the TOCSY and NOESY spectra water suppression was achieved using a modified WATERGATE (water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation) (28Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar) sequence. All two-dimensional spectra were collected over 4,096 data points in the f2 dimension and 512 or 600 increments in the f1 and processed using XWINNMR (Bruker). The f1 dimension was generally zero-filled to 2,048 real data points, with the f1 and f2 dimensions being multiplied by a sine-squared function shifted by 90° prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were internally referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2silapentane-5-sulfonate. During the temperature titrations the temperature was increased in steps of 10 K from 280 to 330 K, and the chemical shift movements were documented by recording of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra. Amide temperature coefficients were determined at pH 3.3 and at 5.8 for kalata B1 and at pH 2.8 and 5.3 for cycloviolacin O1. Similarly, the pH dependence was monitored for both kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 at 298 K by altering the sample pH from 1.6 to 6.5 by adding HCl and NaOH. The pKa of the titrating Glu3 residue was determined for both kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 by nonlinear curve fitting of the data points. For both peptides interproton distance restraints were derived from cross-peaks in NOESY spectra recorded with a mixing time of 200 ms. The cross-peaks were analyzed and integrated within the program XEASY (29Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Google Scholar) and assigned both manually and automatically by the NOAH function within the DYANA package (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar). After an iterative process in which preliminary structures were used to resolve ambiguities, sets of 418 and 384 interresidual distance restraints, including 188 and 178 sequential, 88 and 98 medium, and 142 and 108 long range restraints, were derived for kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1, respectively. In addition the spectral data allowed the introduction of 18 and 16 backbone dihedral angle restraints based on 3 J HNHα coupling constants derived from the splitting of the amide signals in the one-dimensional spectra and 11 and 17 χ1 dihedral angles based on3 J HαHβ coupling constants derived from ECOSY spectra together with NOE intensities derived from a 100-ms NOESY spectrum. Finally after analysis of preliminary structures and amide temperature coefficients 26 and 36 restraints for 13 and 18 hydrogen bonds were added to the structure calculations for kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1, respectively. After initial structure calculations using DYANA (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar), sets of 50 structures were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within CNS (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Google Scholar). This protocol involves a high temperature phase comprising 4,000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4,000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature is lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 500 steps of Powell minimization. The resultant structures were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell (32Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Google Scholar). The refinement in explicit water involved the following steps: 1) heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics; 2) 2,500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K before a cooling phase where the temperature was lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2,500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics; 3) minimizing the structures with 2,000 steps of Powell minimization. Identical protocols were used for both kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1. Coordinates for both peptides have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (kalata B1, 1NB1; cycloviolacin O1, 1NBJ). Samples of kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 were isolated fromO. affinis and V. odorata, respectively, and purified using our previously developed procedure (3Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Google Scholar). 750-MHz two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded, assigned, and used to generate a series of distance, angle, and hydrogen-bonding restraints. These were in turn used to determine a high resolution structure of each peptide, chosen as representative examples from the Möbius and bracelet subfamilies of cyclotides. Of particular importance was a determination of the role of conserved residues in defining the extraordinarily stable CCK template and a definitive determination of the disulfide connectivity pattern. Previously, no structures of cyclotides have been solved at physiological pH, and the recent availability of a large number of cyclotide sequences has provided for the first time an opportunity to understand the fine structural details of the framework. We show here that the deprotonation of a conserved glutamic acid residue which occurs above pH 4 is crucial for stabilizing interactions in the CCK framework. The six cysteine residues in kalata B1 were originally predicted to be most likely connected in a I-IV, II-V, III-VI pattern (7Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar). However, based on an analysis of local intercysteine NOEs a recent study queried this interpretation and suggested that an alternative connectivity, i.e. I-VI, II-V, III-IV, was similarly possible, or indeed more likely (21Skjeldal L. Gran L. Sletten K. Volkman B.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 142-148Google Scholar). Therefore we sought additional evidence for the disulfide connectivity of kalata B1 and focused specifically on an analysis of the conformations of the cysteine side chains. Note that in this paper we use the numbering scheme starting at Cys I as specified in Table I, where Cys I–VI correspond to residues 1, 5, 10, 15, 17, and 22, respectively for kalata B1. A key step in defining the disulfide connectivities in the current study was to determine the side chain dihedral angle χ1for the Cys residues by combining information from3 J HαHβ coupling constants with interproton HN-Hβ distances (33Wagner G. Prog. NMR Spectroscopy. 1990; 22: 101-139Google Scholar). The former were extracted from ECOSY spectra, whereas the latter were derived from short mixing time NOESY spectra (see figure in supplemental material). For cysteines 1, 10, 15, and 22 a pattern of one large and one small3 J HαHβ coupling constant, together with one strong and one weak HN-Hβ, NOE is observed, which is consistent with a χ1 dihedral angle of −60°. For Cys5 two small3 J HαHβ coupling constants are observed, confirming a χ1 dihedral angle of +60°, and Cys17 displays one large and one small3 J HαHβ coupling constant combined with two strong HN-Hβ NOEs, consistent with a χ1 dihedral angle of 180°. Such dihedral angle restraints were not used in either of the previous structure calculations for kalata B1, but examination of the structures shows that all six χ1 values are consistent with the knotted topology, and only three are consistent with the “laddered” structure. Of these three, two are for the II-V bond, which is common to the two alternative connectivities (Fig. 2) and not in dispute. To confirm further the connectivities we calculated a set of structures for each of the two suggested alternatives with χ1 angle restraints explicitly included for the Cys residues. The resulting energies and restraints violations, which are summarized in TableII, clearly show that the inclusion of χ1 dihedral restraints provides the key information to confirm that the knotted arrangement is favored over the laddered form.Table IIEnergy and structural statistics for the families of 20 structures representing the solution structures of cycloviolacin O1 and kalata B1Kalata B1Cycloviolacin O1Disulfide connectivity I–IV, II–V, III–VIDisulfide connectivity I–VI, II–V, III–IVEnergiesOverall−857 ± 19−466 ± 13−914 ± 15Bond7.09 ± 0.4418.0 ± 1.65.84 ± 0.48Angle46.3 ± 3.8154 ± 5.837.6 ± 2.6Improper10.7 ± 0.5037.3 ± 2.19.64 ± 0.92van der Waals−74.9 ± 3.9−25.7 ± 7.5−69.7 ± 3.6NOE12.6 ± 1.072.3 ± 8.711.1 ± 1.4cDih0.011 ± 0.03730.5 ± 5.30.16 ± 0.13Dihedral138 ± 4.5171 ± 7.5124 ± 8.5Electrostatic−997 ± 12−923 ± 12−1033 ± 9.8r.m.s. deviationar.m.s. deviation, root mean square deviation.Bond0.004 ± 0.00010.007 ± 0.00030.004 ± 0.0002Angle0.66 ± 0.0231.21 ± 0.020.568 ± 0.020Improper0.6 ± 0.011.12 ± 0.030.544 ± 0.03NOE0.024 ± 0.0010.059 ± 0.0030.0204 ± 0.002cDih0.04 ± 0.074.14 ± 0.400.254 ± 0.15Pairwise r.m.s. deviationBackbone/heavy0.22 ± 0.08/ 0.64 ± 0.150.44 ± 0.27/0.88 ± 0.330.25 ± 0.08/ 1.09 ± 0.21Experimental dataDistance restraints446418420Dihedral restraints292933NOE violations exceeding 0.20 Å06.8/structure (max 0.70 Å)0cDih violations exceeding 2.004.5/structure (max 21.5)0RamachandranMost favored81%57%81%Additionally allowed19%43%19%a r.m.s. deviation, root mean square deviation.

In the current study it was of interest to determine high resolution structures at closer to physiological pH and to monitor potential effects of pH on structure. In addition, we had noted earlier an unusually large temperature dependence of signals from Asn11 in kalata B1. Because the cyclotide framework contains an extensive network of hydrogen bonds it was of interest to determine the origin of this anomalous effect. Fig. 3 shows the chemical shift as a function of pH for the amide protons in kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1. As expected, most backbone amides vary by less than 0.1 ppm in chemical shift over the pH range 2–7, showing that the global fold is generally unaffected by pH. However, a surprisingly large effect is seen for two or three residues in each molecule. Both kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 contain only one glutamic acid residue, and monitoring the pH dependence of the γ protons or other nearby protons allows calculation of its pKa value. An apparent pKa for Glu3 of 3.5 for kalata B1 and 3.0 for cycloviolacin O1 was calculated from this analysis. The value for kalata B1 is similar to that reported recently from an analysis of 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra (21Skjeldal L. Gran L. Sletten K. Volkman B.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 142-148Google Scholar). It is clear from the pH titrations that the protonation/deprotonation of Glu3 significantly affects the chemical shifts of the backbone amide protons of residues 11 and 12 in kalata B1 and residues 11, 12, and 13 in cycloviolacin O1. For cycloviolacin O1 the amide shifts and the Hα shifts of most other residues in loop 3 are also affected, indicating a local conformational change upon protonation of Glu3. It is interesting to note that with the sole exception of the Hα of Thr11, the chemical shifts of all Hα protons move toward their random coil shifts when the pH is lowered, suggesting that loop 3 becomes less structured. Further, at pH values above the pKaof Glu3 we observe additional NOE connectivities between the Glu3 side chain protons and loop 3 amide protons in both peptides, which further supports the presence of a local conformational change. Amide temperature coefficients are useful for indicating the presence of hydrogen bonds (36Cierpicki T. Otlewski J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 249-261Google Scholar). For cycloviolacin O1 these data suggest the presence of strengthened hydrogen bonding interactions involving the Glu3 carboxyl group in the deprotonated state, consistent with the conformational change observed with pH. In particular, on deprotonation of Glu3, the amide temperature coefficient of all of the amide protons in loop 3 of cycloviolacin O1 are lowered in magnitude by an average of 1 ppb/K. Hence, it was of interest to determine high resolution structures at a pH (∼6) where Glu3 is deprotonated, as described below. Solution structures were determined for both kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 by simulated annealing using experimental distance restraints based on NOESY cross-peaks and dihedral angle restraints based on coupling constants. Particular emphasis was placed on obtaining ultrahigh resolution structures by careful refinement in a water box. Of the final 50 structures for each peptide families of the 20 lowest energy structures consistent with experimental data were chosen to represent the structures of kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1. A summary of the energetic and geometric statistics for these families is given in TableII. The structures are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, showing no distance violation greater than 0.2 Å and no dihedral angle violation greater than 2°. As indicated by the overlay of the structures in Fig. 4, A andB, it is clear that the peptides have well defined structures. Indeed the structural families not only give information on the backbone fold but also provide detailed information on the positioning of the side chains. The general fold of the cyclotides can be described as an elongated peptide circle that folds back on top of itself and is stabilized by three cross-bracing disulfide bonds, which link diagonally opposed β-strands. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the main element of secondary structure is an antiparallel β-sheet. Strand 1 (residues 14–18 in kalata B1 and 19–21 in cycloviolacin O1) and strand 2 (residues 21–25 in kalata B1 and 24–26 in cycloviolacin O1) are linked by a β-turn, hence forming a traditional β-hairpin motif. A third strand, which incorporates residues 3–5 in both kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1, is more loosely associated with the sheet and not formally recognized as a regular β-strand by PROMOTIF (37Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Google Scholar). In addition to the central β-sheet the cyclotide structures comprise a number of well ordered tight turns. In kalata B1 four β-turns, including a type I (residues 5–8), a type II (residues 12–15), a type VIa1 (residues 18–21), and a type I′ (residues 23–26) are present, whereas cycloviolacin O1 incorporates a type I β-turn (residues 5–8), a type I′ β-turn (residues 21–24), and a classical γ-turn (residues 28–30). In addition, the longer loop 3 in cycloviolacin O1, which involves residues 12–18, adopts a 310 helical conformation. These structural elements are all stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, and together with the disulfide bonds they account for the exceptional stability of the cyclotides. The high resolution structures obtained in this study provide an opportunity to determine the roles of the individual amino acids in defining and stabilizing the structures of kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 and more broadly for defining their importance for the CCK motif. We therefore undertook a detailed analysis of the geometries, hydrogen bonding interactions, and charge distributions in the two structures. The results are summarized in TableIII.Table IIIStructural roles of individual amino acids in the cyclotides based on the structures of kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 Open table in a new tab From this analysis the reasons for the conservation of certain residues are clear, with most of the highly conserved residues having prominent structural roles in the cyclotide framework. One example of this is the conservation of glycine residues. Glycine is the only amino acid for which a negative φ-angle conformation is not specifically favored and therefore is often seen in tight turns where adaptability of the backbone geometry is important. That this role is important for the cyclotides is illustrated by the fact that four of five glycines in kalata B1 and both of the two glycines in cycloviolacin O1 adopt positive φ-angles. A second example concerns Glu3, which, apart from the six cysteines, is the only residue fully conserved throughout both the Möbius and the bracelet families. From the structures it is clear that the side chain oxygens of the glutamic acid act as acceptors for multiple hydrogen bonds linking loops 1 and 3. For cycloviolacin O1 it is clear that by accepting hydrogen bonds from the backbone amides of residues 11, 12, and 13 at high pH Glu3 plays an important role in stabilizing the shor"
https://openalex.org/W2096599403,"Theory predicts the existence of barrierless protein folding. Without barriers, folding should be noncooperative and the degree of native structure should be coupled to overall protein stability. We investigated the thermal unfolding of the peripheral subunit binding domain from Escherichia coli 's 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (termed BBL) with a combination of spectroscopic techniques and calorimetry. Each technique probed a different feature of protein structure. BBL has a defined three-dimensional structure at low temperatures. However, each technique showed a distinct unfolding transition. Global analysis with a statistical mechanical model identified BBL as a downhill-folding protein. Because of BBL's biological function, we propose that downhill folders may be molecular rheostats, in which effects could be modulated by altering the distribution of an ensemble of structures."
https://openalex.org/W1999955296,"We have previously demonstrated that glycosphingolipids are internalized from the plasma membrane of human skin fibroblasts by a clathrin-independent, caveolar-related mechanism and are subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus by a process that is dependent on microtubules, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Rab7, and Rab9. Here we characterized the early steps of intracellular transport of a fluorescent glycosphingolipid analog, BODIPY-lactosylceramide (LacCer), and compared this to fluorescent transferrin (Tfn), a well established marker for the clathrin pathway. Although these two markers were initially internalized into separate vesicles by distinct mechanisms, they became co-localized in early endosomes within 5 min. These results demonstrate that glycosphingolipid-containing vesicles derived from caveolar-related endocytosis fuse with the classical endosomal system. However, in contrast to Tfn, internalization and trafficking of LacCer was independent of Rab5a, a key regulator of transport to early endosomes. By taking advantage of the monomer/excimer properties of the fluorescent lipid analog, we were also able to visualize LacCer segregation into distinct microdomains of high (red emission) and low (green emission) concentrations in the early endosomes of living cells. Interestingly, the high concentration ""red"" microdomains co-localized with fluorescent Tfn upon exit from early endosomes and passed through Rab11-positive ""recycling endosomes"" prior to being transported back to the plasma membrane. These results together with our previous studies suggest that glycosphingolipids internalized by caveolar endocytosis are rapidly delivered to early endosomes where they are fractionated into two major pools, one that is transported via late endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and the other that is returned to the plasma membrane via the recycling compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2096363434,"The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) is a central paradigm in the study of animal cooperation. According to the IPD framework, repeated play (repetition) and reciprocity combine to maintain a cooperative equilibrium. However, experimental studies with animals suggest that cooperative behavior in IPDs is unstable, and some have suggested that strong preferences for immediate benefits (that is, temporal discounting) might explain the fragility of cooperative equilibria. We studied the effects of discounting and strategic reciprocity on cooperation in captive blue jays. Our results demonstrate an interaction between discounting and reciprocity. Blue jays show high stable levels of cooperation in treatments with reduced discounting when their opponent reciprocates, but their levels of cooperation decline in all other treatment combinations. This suggests that stable cooperation requires both reduced discounting and reciprocity, and it offers an explanation of earlier failures to find cooperation in controlled payoff games."
https://openalex.org/W2163627446,"The de novo synthesis of fatty acids occurs in two distinct cellular compartments. Palmitate (16:0) is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the cytoplasm by the enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and fatty acid synthase. The synthesis of fatty acids longer than 16 carbons takes place in microsomes and utilizes malonyl-CoA as the carbon source. Each two-carbon addition requires four sequential reactions: condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a final reduction to form the elongated fatty acyl-CoA. The initial condensation reaction is the regulated and rate-controlling step in microsomal fatty acyl elongation. We previously reported the cDNA cloning and characterization of a murine long chain fatty acyl elongase (LCE) (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of two mammalian enzymes that catalyze the 3-ketoacyl-CoA and trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reduction reactions in long and very long chain fatty acid elongation, respectively.

The predominant fatty acids synthesized in mammals are long chain fatty acids 16–18 carbons in length. Long chain fatty acids are important components of phospholipids, represent the largest energy storage reservoir in the form of triglycerides, and are the preferred fatty acids used for the esterification of cholesterol. The highest rate of de novofatty acid synthesis occurs in the liver, which converts excess glucose into fatty acids for storage and transport. During times of caloric excess, glucose is converted to pyruvate, which is converted to citrate in the mitochondria and transported to the cytosol where ATP citrate lyase uses citrate to produce acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 to form malonyl-CoA. Fatty acid synthase (FAS)1 then uses malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and NADPH to elongate fatty acids in two-carbon increments in the cytosol (2Wakil S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The principal fatty acid produced by FAS in rodents is palmitic acid, which contains 16 carbons and is designated 16:0 (3Aprahamian S.A. Arslanian M.J. Wakil S.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 71B: 557-582Google Scholar). The mammalian enzymes that elongate palmitic acid (16:0) and very long chain fatty acids (>C18) have been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are shown schematically in Fig. 1 (4Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Microsomal fatty acid elongation uses malonyl-CoA as the two-carbon donor and consists of four sequential and independent reactions: 1) a condensation between a fatty acyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to form 3-ketoacyl-CoA; 2) a reduction of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA using NADPH to form 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA; 3) a dehydration of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA totrans-2,3-enoyl-CoA; and 4) a reduction oftrans-2,3-enoyl-CoA to saturated acyl-CoA (5Nugteren D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Unlike the multifunctional FAS enzyme, the enzymes that carry out microsomal fatty acid elongation are encoded by separate genes. Enzymes involved in microsomal fatty acid elongation have been characterized most extensively by genetic deletion studies inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Three proteins, designated Elo1p, Elo2p, and Elo3p, participate in the initial condensation reaction of microsomal fatty acyl elongation. Elo1p is required for the elongation of C14 to C16 fatty acids (6Toke D.A. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and Elo2p and Elo3p are required for the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids (7Oh C.-S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Six mammalian homologues of the yeast ELO genes have been described (Fig. 1). Like their yeast counterparts, these enzymes exhibit some fatty acid chain length substrate specificity. The first mammalian elongase identified was Cig30 (cold-induced glycoprotein of30 kDa), which is the functional equivalent of yeast Elo2p (8Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ssc1 and Ssc2 (sequencesimilarity to Cig30 1 and2) subsequently were identified based on homology toCig30 (9Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ssc1 is the functional equivalent of Elo3p in yeast (9Tvrdik P. Westerberg R. Silve S. Asadi A. Jakobsson A. Cannon B. Loison G. Jacobsson A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Definitive fatty acid substrate specificity has not been assigned to Ssc2, although two of its substrates are arachidonic (20:4) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5) acids (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). ELOVL4(elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like 4) was identified by linkage and haplotype analysis in families with two forms of autosomal dominant macular dystrophy and is expressed only in tissues with high contents of very long chain fatty acids; therefore, it is likely that ELOVL4 is involved in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids (10Zhang K. Kniazeva M. Han M. Li W. Yu Z. Yang Z. Li Y. Metzker M.L. Allikmets R. Zack D.J. Kakuk L.E. Lagali P.S. Wong P.W. MacDonald I.M. Sieving P.A. Figueroa D.J. Austin C.P. Gould R.J. Ayyagari R. Petrukhin K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). HELO1 was identified based on sequence homology with yeast Elo2p and has a broad range of very long chain fatty acid substrate specificity (11Leonard A.E. Bobik E.G. Dorado J. Kroeger P.E. Chuang L.T. Thurmond J.M. Parker-Barnes J.M. Das T. Huang Y.S. Mukerji P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a long chain fatty acyl elongase (LCE) that is homologous to the very long chain fatty acyl elongases; however, unlike other family members, the activity of LCE is restricted to long chain fatty acids (C12–C16) (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Proteins that participate in the post-condensation reactions of microsomal fatty acid elongation recently were characterized in yeast. Two proteins were identified that participated in the 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase reaction. The YBR159w gene encoded the protein that was responsible for the majority of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase activity in yeast microsomes (12Beaudoin F. Gable K. Sayanova O. Dunn T. Napier J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11481-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Studies using Ybr159p mutants revealed that a small amount of residual 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase activity was still present, which was subsequently ascribed to 1-acyldihydroxyacetone-phosphate reductase (13Han G. Gable K. Kohlwein S.D. Beaudoin F. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35440-35449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). No proteins have been identified that carry out the third dehydratase reaction. The final reduction of the trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA is carried out by Tsc13p in yeast (14Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.-S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In mammals, the enzymes that carry out reactions distal to the condensation reaction have not been identified. In the current studies, we identify and characterize human and mouse reductases that catalyze the second and fourth reactions in microsomal fatty acid elongation. [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA (40–60 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from AmershamBiosciences. Palmitoyl-CoA, palmitic acid (16:0), γ-linolenic acid (18:3n-6), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), fatty acid-free BSA, coenzyme A sodium salt, ATP, NADPH, malonyl-CoA, and monoclonal anti-HA (clone number HA-7) were obtained from Sigma. cDNAs encoding the putative human and mouse microsomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KAR) were identified by a BlastP search of the NCBI data bases using the S. cerevisiaeprotein Ybr159p. Human and mouse cDNAs (GenBankTMaccession numbers NM_016142 and AF064635, respectively) were identified that encode proteins that are ∼31% identical to the yeast 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase protein Ybr159p. Thetrans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase (TER) proteins were identified by a BlastP search using the S. cerevisiae protein Tsc13p, which encodes the yeast trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase. Human and mouse cDNAs (GenBankTM accession numbers AAF32373and AK010984, respectively) were identified that encode proteins that are ∼34% identical to Tsc13p. The expression plasmids for human KAR and TER were constructed as follows. cDNAs encoding the full-length protein were obtained by PCR amplification using human adipose tissue first strand cDNA (Clontech, catalogue number 7128-1) as the template and the following primers: KAR, 5′ primer, 5′-GCCACCATGGGCGGCCGCGAGAGCGCTCTCCCCGCCGCC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TTAGTTCTTCTTGGTTTTCTTCAG-3′; and TER, 5′ primer, 5′-GCCACCATGGGCGGCCGCAAGCATTACGAGGTGGAGATT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TCAGAGCAGGAAGGGGATGATGGG-3′. The 5′ primers used to amplify each cDNA contained a Kozak sequence followed by an ATG codon and aNotI restriction enzyme site. The resulting PCR products were ligated into pCMV-Script (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and digested with NotI, and three copies of the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were inserted at the 5′ end of each cDNA. The resulting plasmids were designated pCMV-HA-KAR and pCMV-HA-TER, respectively. The integrity of all PCR products and ligations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The LCE expression plasmid (pCMV-HA-LCE) was constructed as described previously (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary K-1 cells (ATCC CCL-61) were set up on glass coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of 1.0×105/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (day 0). On day 1, 0.5 μg of indicated plasmids was transfected using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium. On day 3, the cells were washed with PBS and then fixed and permeabilized by incubating in 2 ml of methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 1% BSA in PBS (buffer A). The cells were then incubated in buffer A at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal HA antibody (HA probe F-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (20 μg/ml) and a rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada) (1:200 dilution) for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with buffer B (0.1% BSA in PBS), and primary antibodies were localized by incubating the cells for 1 h at room temperature in buffer A containing 2 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After incubation with the secondary antibody, the cells were washed three times with buffer B, quickly rinsed with PBS and distilled water, and analyzed with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc., Heidelberg, Germany). HEK-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (day 0). On days 1 and 2, the cells were transfected with expression plasmids using 6 μl of FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection studies with KAR contained 0.6 μg of pCMV-HA-LCE, 0.6 μg of pCMV-HA-KAR, 0.8 μg of pVAI (15Akusjarvi G. Svensson C. Nygard O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and 0.02 μg of pCMV β-galactosidase plasmids/dish. Transfection studies with TER contained 1.0 μg of pCMV-HA-LCE, 0.2 μg of pCMV-HA-TER, 0.8 μg of pVAI (15Akusjarvi G. Svensson C. Nygard O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and 0.02 μg of pCMV β-galactosidase plasmids/dish. The total amount of plasmid DNA in each transfection was adjusted to 2 μg/dish by adding pCMV-Script. On day 3, the cells were harvested, and cytosolic and membrane proteins were prepared as described previously (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The microsomal protein was stored at −80 °C after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Transfection efficiencies were determined by measuring the β-galactosidase activity in the supernatant from the 1.3 × 105 ×g spin using a β-galactosidase assay kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the expression of HA-tagged proteins in membranes was confirmed by immunoblot analysis as described (1Moon Y.-A.

The protein concentrations were determined using the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-CoA or BSA-bound fatty acids were used as substrates for all reactions. BSA-bound fatty acids were prepared as 5 or 10 mm solutions as described (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The elongation assays contained 0.05 mg of microsomal protein in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 5 μm rotenone, 20 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 150 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (6.5 dpm/pmol), 1 mm NADPH, 20 μm BSA in a final reaction volume of 0.2 ml. For assays using BSA-bound fatty acids, the reaction mixtures contained 0.05 mg of microsomal protein in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 5 μm rotenone, 20 μm BSA-bound fatty acid, 100 μm coenzyme A, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (6.5 dpm/pmol), and 1 mm NADPH in a final volume of 0.2 ml. To initiate the elongation reaction, 0.05 mg of microsomal protein from transfected cells was added, and the incubation was continued for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 75% KOH (w/v) and 0.2 ml of ethanol, saponified at 70 °C for 1 h, and then acidified by adding 0.4 ml of 5 n HCl with 0.2 ml of ethanol. Fatty acids were collected in three independent extractions using 1 ml of hexane. The extractions were pooled, dried under nitrogen, and separated by TLC using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (30:70:1) as described (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45358-45366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The TLC plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, the resulting image was analyzed, and the lipids were quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer with BAS1000 MacBAS 2.1 software (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). Double-stranded (ds) RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) for human KAR, TER, and an irrelevant control gene, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. The oligonucleotide sequences are listed in TableI. On day 0, HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) or HepG2 (ATTC HB-8065) cells were set up at a density of 4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1× nonessential amino acid mix (Cellgro, Herndon, VA), 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, respectively. dsRNAs (0.2 μm) were transfected on days 1, 2, and 3 using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On day 4, the cells were harvested for membrane protein and total RNA as described (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

For mouse multiple tissue Northern blots, total RNA was extracted from the indicated tissues of C57BL/6J mice using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, Friendswood, TX), and poly(A+) RNA was isolated using the MessageMaker mRNA Isolation System (Invitrogen). Three μg of poly(A+) RNA from each tissue was subjected to Northern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled mouse cDNA probes for mouse KAR and TER (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A.

Mouse full-length cDNA templates for KAR and TER were PCR-amplified from mouse liver first strand cDNA using the following primers: KAR, 5′ primer, 5′-ATGGAGTGCGCTCCCCCGGCG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TTAGTTCTTCTTCCTTTTCTTCAG-3′; TER, 5′ primer, 5′-ATGAAGCACTACGAGGTGGAG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TCAGAGCAGGAAGGGAATAAT-3′ (17Shimano H.

The cyclophilin probe used as a control was described previously (1Moon Y.-A. Shah N.A. Mohapatra S. Warrington J.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

For HepG2 and HeLa cell Northern blots, cells from two 60-mm dishes were used to isolate total RNA as described above. Twenty μg of the total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis using32P-labeled human KAR and TER cDNA probes as described above. All of the Northern blot filters were exposed to a Fuji PhosphorImager and quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer with BAS1000 MacBAS software. Real time PCR conditions and oligonucleotides used to measure mRNA levels of mouse 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase and FAS were described previously (18Yang J. Goldstein J.L. Hammer R.E.

Primers were designed using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer) for the following mouse genes: LCE, 5′ primer, 5′-TGTACGCTGCCTTTATCTTTGG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGCTTCCGAAGTTCAA-3′; KAR, 5′ primer, 5′-GGCAACGAGGCCTTGGT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CCATCAGTGCCACCTGTAACAA-3′; TER, 5′ primer, 5′-TTCGTGCACCGATTCTCTCA-3′, and 3′ primer 5′-GCCCCAATAGTAGGTGCAGTTT-3′; and 36B4, 5′ primer, 5′-CACTGGTCTAGGACCCGAGAAG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-GGTGCCTCTGGAGATTTTCG-3′. 36B4 mRNA was used as an invariant control for all of the studies. All of the mice were housed in colony cages with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed Teklad mouse/rat diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets (Madison, WI). Studies using SREBP transgenic mice included five wild-type and five 12–14-week-old TgSREBP-1a, TgSREBP-2 male mice fed a high protein/high carbohydrate diet for 2 weeks prior to sacrifice as described (17Shimano H.

Hammer R.E. Moon Y.-A. Komuro R. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Shimomura I. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Four 8–10-week-old male SCAPf/f;MX1-Cre and corresponding wild-type mice received four intraperitoneal injections of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid as described (20Matsuda M. Korn B.S. Hammer R.E. Moon Y.-A. Komuro R. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Shimomura I. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The mice were fed the Teklad chow and sacrificed nonfasted 14 days after the last injection of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Total RNA was extracted from liver as described above, and equal aliquots of RNA from all of the mice were pooled for each treatment group for study by quantitative real time PCR. To identify and characterize the mammalian reductases involved in microsomal long chain fatty acid elongation, we used the sequences of yeast genes that encode a 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (YBR159w) (12Beaudoin F. Gable K. Sayanova O. Dunn T. Napier J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11481-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and a trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase (TSC13) (14Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.-S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to identify potential mammalian orthologues in the human and mouse data bases. The BlastP search of the NCBI human data base revealed two cDNAs (GenBankTM accession numbers NM_016142 and NM_000197), the predicted amino acids of which were 31% identical to the yeast 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase protein Ybr159p. Similarly, the search of the mouse data base revealed two cDNAs (GenBankTM accession numbers AF064635 and NM_008291), the predicted proteins of which were 32% identical to Ybr159p. The human and mouse cDNAs NM_000197 and NM_008291 encode the hydroxysteroid 17-β dehydrogenase 3 protein, which is only expressed in testis (21Geissler W.M. Davis D.L. Wu L. Bradshaw K.D. Patel S. Mendonca B.B. Elliston K.O. Wilson J.D. Russell D.W. Anderson S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Therefore, the proteins encoded by these cDNAs were eliminated as candidates for the microsomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase in liver. The predicted proteins encoded by the human NM_016142 and mouse AF064635cDNAs were 82% identical and of unknown function. An alignment of the predicted yeast, mouse, and human 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase amino acids is shown in Fig.2 A. An in-frame stop codon is present 12 nucleotides prior to the putative initiation methionine in the human KAR cDNA sequence, indicating that the entire coding sequence was represented in the identified cDNA. The translational reading frames of the putative human and mouse KAR cDNAs encode proteins that are 312 amino acids in length. Like in the yeast protein, a conserved dilysine ER retention motif is present at the C-terminal end of human and mouse KAR. Hydropathy analysis using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) predicts the presence of as many as four putative transmembrane domains (Fig. 2 B). To determine the tissue expression pattern of the putative KAR in mammals, human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were performed using species-specific 32P-labeled cDNA probes (Fig.2 C). A single ∼2.9-kb mRNA was identified by Northern blot analysis in all of the human tissues represented on the blot. In these, the highest level of expression appeared to be in liver, muscle, and kidney. The expression of KAR also was determined in mouse tissues. The mRNA for mouse KAR was ∼2.0 kb in size. The difference in mRNA size between the human and mouse transcripts is due to differences in the 3′-untranslated sequences. In mouse, high levels of KAR expression were also found in white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue (Fig. 2 C). The putative human and mouse TER proteins were identified by a BlastP search of the NCBI data base using the yeast TER protein Tsc13p. The identified human (GenBankTM accession number AF222742) and mouse (GenBankTM accession number AK010984) cDNAs encode proteins that are ∼34% identical to that of Tsc13p (14Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.-S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The putative human trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase cDNA has an in-frame stop codon 21 nucleotides prior to the initiation methionine. The translational reading frames of the human and mouse putative TER cDNAs predict proteins 308 amino acids in length. The overall identity of the human and mouse TER proteins is 95%. An alignment of the yeast, mouse, and human TER amino acid sequences is shown in Fig. 3 A. Unlike the KAR proteins, no consensus ER retention motif is present in the mouse or human TER sequence. Hydropathy analysis using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) predicts the presence of as many as five transmembrane domains (Fig. 3 B). No mitochondrial or peroxisomal targeting sequences were identified in these proteins. The tissue expression pattern of TER was determined using human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots as described for KAR (Fig. 3 C). A single ∼1.2-kb mRNA was identified by Northern blotting in all of the tissues tested from human and mouse (Fig. 3 C). The tissue expression of TER essentially mirrored that of KAR. To determine whether KAR or TER participated in microsomal fatty acyl elongation, expression vectors utilizing the CMV promoter were assembled that encoded the human KAR or TER proteins with HA epitope tags at their N terminus. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the human KAR or TER expression plasmids, and cytosolic and microsomal proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE to determine the subcellular localization of the proteins. As predicted from the hydropathy profiles, immunoblot analysis using an anti-HA antibody revealed that the expressed KAR and TER proteins were present only in the microsomal fraction (data not shown). To study the subcellular localization of these proteins directly, we performed"

While many cGMP-mediated processes in plants have been reported, no plant molecule with GC activity has been identified. When the Arabidopsis thalianagenome is queried with GC sequences from cyanobacteria, lower and higher eukaryotes no unassigned proteins with significant similarity are found. However, a motif search of the A. thalianagenome based on conserved and functionally assigned amino acids in the catalytic center of annotated GCs returns one candidate that also contains the adjacent glycine-rich domain typical for GCs. In this molecule, termed AtGC1, the catalytic domain is in the N-terminal part. AtGC1 contains the arginine or lysine that participates in hydrogen bonding with guanine and the cysteine that confers substrate specificity for GTP. When AtGC1 is expressed in Escherichia coli, cell extracts yield >2.5 times more cGMP than control extracts and this increase is not nitric oxide dependent. Furthermore, purified recombinant AtGC1 has Mg2+-dependent GC activity in vitro and >3 times less adenylyl cyclase activity when assayed with ATP as substrate in the absence of GTP. Catalytic activity in vitro proves that AtGC1 can function either as a monomer or homo-oligomer. AtGC1 is thus not only the first functional plant GC but also, due to its unusual domain organization, a member of a new class of GCs.

AtGC1 is thus not only the first functional plant GC but also, due to its unusual domain organization, a member of a new class of GCs. Guanylyl cyclases (GCs) 1The abbreviations used are: GC, guanylyl cyclase; NO, nitric oxide; GA, gibberellic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (EC 4.6.1.2) catalyze the formation of guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP). cGMP acts as second messenger in many prokaryotes and all eukaryotes (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman A.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414Google Scholar) including plants. In higher plants cGMP-mediated processes control phytochrome-dependent gene expression required for chloroplast development and anthocyanin biosynthesis (2Bowler C. Yamagata H. Neuhaus G. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2188-2202Google Scholar, 3Bowler C. Frohnmeyer H. Schafer E. Neuhaus G. Chua N.H. Acta Physiol. Plant. 1997; 19: 475-483Google Scholar, 4Chamovitz D. Deng X.W. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1996; 15: 455-478Google Scholar). The light down-regulated gene asparagine synthetase has been reported to be controlled by a Ca2+/cGMP-dependent pathway that activates other light responses and complementary loss- and gain-of-function experiments have identified a 17 base paircis-element within the asparagine synthetase promoter that is both necessary and sufficient for this regulation (5Neuhaus G. Bowler C. Hiratsuka K. Yamagata H. Chua N.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2554-2564Google Scholar). Thiscis-element may well be the target for a conserved phytochrome-generated repressor whose activity is regulated by calcium and cGMP (5Neuhaus G. Bowler C. Hiratsuka K. Yamagata H. Chua N.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2554-2564Google Scholar). In plants as well as in animals, nitric oxide (NO) is operating as a redox-active signaling molecule, and NO donors have been shown to induce expression of some defense-related genes, and tobacco mosaic virus-dependent increases of NO synthase activity occur in resistant plants only (6Durner J. Wendehenne D. Klessig D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10328-10333Google Scholar). NO does elevate cGMP levels in plants, and NO-induced expression of some defense-related genes was found to be mediated by the second messengers cGMP and cyclic ADP-ribose, both of which also operate in animal responses to NO (6Durner J. Wendehenne D. Klessig D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10328-10333Google Scholar). Cellular cGMP levels are also increased transiently after application of the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) in barley aleurone layers and GC inhibition prevents the GA-induced increase in cGMP and inhibits GA-induced α-amylase synthesis and secretion (7Penson S.P. Schuurink R.C. Fath A. Gubler F. Jacobsen J.V. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2325-2333Google Scholar). Both processes can be restored by exogenous application of membrane-permeant analogs of cGMP thus establishing cGMP as second messenger critical for α-amylase synthesis and/or secretion. The regulation of ion transport is also in parts dependent on cyclic nucleotides (8Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 309-328Google Scholar, 9Maathuis F.J. Sanders D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 127: 1617-1625Google Scholar). Such regulation can occur in plant voltage-gated K+ channels where binding of cGMP modulates the voltage/current relationship (8Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 309-328Google Scholar). Plants also contain cyclic nucleotide-gated low affinity cation channels where binding of cAMP and cGMP to the intracellular portion leads to direct gating (10Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Yao W. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 753-761Google Scholar). Recently, voltage-independent channels without selectivity for particular monovalent cations have been characterized inArabidopsis thaliana. Voltage-independent channels showed no selectivity among monovalent cations, and their gating was found to be voltage-independent, while micromolar concentrations of cAMP or cGMP at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane caused rapid decreases in channel open probability (9Maathuis F.J. Sanders D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 127: 1617-1625Google Scholar). It was shown that short term unidirectional Na+ influx is reduced in the presence of cyclic nucleotides and that membrane-permeable cyclic nucleotide can improve salinity tolerance presumably by reducing net Na+uptake. Cell-permeable cGMP and cAMP analogs elicit elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ in tobacco protoplasts and cause a physiological swelling response in plant protoplasts (11Volotovski I.D. Sokolovsky S.G. Molchan O.V. Knight M.R. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1023-1030Google Scholar). Opening of the stomatal pore, which results from a swelling of the two neighboring guard cells, has been observed in response to cell-permeable cGMP analogs and is suppressed by guanylyl cyclase inhibitors (12Pharmawati M. Billington T. Gehring C.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 272-276Google Scholar). Like protoplast swelling, stomatal aperture regulation is likely to be tuned by Ca2+ and cGMP cross-talk (13Pharmawati M. Maryani M.M. Nikolakopoulos T. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 385-394Google Scholar). Since significant and transient increases in intracellular cGMP levels,e.g. in response to the plant hormones GA (7Penson S.P. Schuurink R.C. Fath A. Gubler F. Jacobsen J.V. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2325-2333Google Scholar) and cytokinins (13Pharmawati M. Maryani M.M. Nikolakopoulos T. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 385-394Google Scholar) as well as vertebrate atrial natriuretic peptides and immunoreactant plant natriuretic peptides (13Pharmawati M. Maryani M.M. Nikolakopoulos T. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 385-394Google Scholar, 14Pharmawati M. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Sci. 1998; 137: 107-115Google Scholar, 15Ludidi N.N. Heazlewood J.L. Seoighe C.J. Irving H.R. Gehring C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 587-594Google Scholar), have been reported, it is reasonable to presuppose GC activity in plants. However, no plant molecule with GC activity has been identified to date, and this failure could be explained by an unusually high level of divergence in plant GCs that has put them outside the detection limit of “Blast” searches or biochemical tools such as specific antibodies against GCs from e.g. bacteria or animals. Alternatively, plant GCs may not be homologous to currently annotated GCs and thus not easily identified. In both cases, however, we hypothesized that plant GCs may contain a significant degree of similarity to the catalytic center from previously identified nucleotide cyclases and GCs in particular. Consequently, we aligned designated catalytic domains (16Wedel B.J. Garbers D.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 29-33Google Scholar, 17Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 770-777Google Scholar) from vertebrates, lower eukaryotes, and prokaryotes with a view to deduce a GC catalytic domain search motif. Such a motif would then be used to do pattern searches of the complete A. thaliana genomic sequence to identify candidate proteins for functional testing. GCs were retrieved from NCBI, and their catalytic domains were used for Blast (23Altschul S. Madden T. Schaeffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) queries of “The Arabidopsis Information Resource” database and GenBankTM. The catalytic domains were aligned using Clustal X (24Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewiak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Google Scholar), and the alignment at the catalytic center of the catalytic domain was used to derive the search motif. The derived search motif was tested for accurate and specific detection of nucleotide cyclases by querying the Protein Information Resource (www-nbrf.georgetown.edu) using the Pattern Match option on the PIR-NREF link. The search motif was used to query The Arabidopsis Information Resource database using the Patmatch link in The Arabidopsis Information Resource. Total RNA was isolated from 3-week-old seedlings using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) in combination with DNase treatment using RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand AtGC1 cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 1 μm Primer GC1fwd (5′-CAC TGT GGA TCC ATG TGG CCT CTT TGT TTT CTG-3′) incorporating a 5′ BamHI restriction site (underlined), 1 μm Primer GC1rev (5′-CTG ACTCTC GAG CTA ATA TCC GTT CTG GTT CC-3′) incorporating a 5′XhoI restriction site (underlined) using reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.). Double-stranded AtGC1 cDNA synthesis was done by PCR on first strand cDNA from above with 0.4 μm Primer GC1fwd and 0.4 μm Primer GC1rev using the expand high fidelity PCR system kit (Roche Diagnostics South Africa Pty. Ltd.) as instructed by the manufacturer, except that the deoxynucleotide triphosphate concentration was changed to 100 μm for each deoxynucleotide triphosphate. TheAtGC1 cDNA was cloned as aBamHI/XhoI fragment into pBluescript SK(+/−) (Stratagene) to construct pBS:AtGC1 and sequenced. TheAtGC1 cDNA was subcloned from the pBS:AtGC1 construct into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd.) to make the GST:AtGC1 fusion expression construct pGEX:AtGC1. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) were transformed with pGEX:AtGC1 for the expression of the recombinant protein and with pGEX-6P-2 (AmershamBiosciences UK Ltd.) for a positive control experiment. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.8. The cells were then induced for expression of GST:AtGC1 or GST by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Promega Corp.) to a final concentration of 0.6 mm and growth at 30 °C for 60 min, with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) added to a final concentration of 1 mm to inhibit resident bacterial phosphodiesterases. To determine NO dependence of AtGC1, the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to both uninduced and induced cells 10 min before harvesting of the cells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, then resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3). Total E. coliproteins were extracted by three freeze-thaw cycles in PBS, with freezing done in liquid nitrogen and thawing done at 42 °C. Purification of both recombinant GST:AtGC1 and GST was performed on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited) and eluted in glutathione elution buffer (10 mmreduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The eluted proteins were desalted and concentrated using Amicon® Ultra 10,000 MWCO 15-ml centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., MA). cGMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay using the cGMP (125I) assay system kit (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd.) as described in the supplier's manual for the acetylation protocol. Purified GST:AtGC1 recombinant fusion protein (140 μg) was used to determine AtGC1 guanylyl cyclase activity in vitro (21Thorpe S.D. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14717-14720Google Scholar). This was followed by measurements of cGMP produced from the reaction using the cGMP (125I) assay system kit. Cyclic AMP generated in vitro by GST:AtGC1 was determined using the cAMP Biotrak enzyme immunoassay (AmershamBiosciences UK Ltd.). Sequence alignment of representatives of annotated catalytic domains of GCs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes are shown in Fig.1. The residues implicated in catalysis (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D.

Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar) are indicated in red, and a 14-amino acid-long search motif spanning the catalytic center was deduced (Fig. 1). An isoleucine (Ile) and leucine (Leu) was added to positions 4 and 9, respectively, to include all three aliphatic amino acids with non-polar side chains; this is in keeping with requirements of these positions, since they are part of the hydrophobic pocket where the purine moiety binds (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar). The glutamic acid (Glu) implied in Mg2+ binding (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar) that is conserved in the present alignment (Fig. 1) was not included in the search motif, since it is not conserved in all GCs (19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar). The GC catalytic domain alignments also revealed that GCs contain a glycine-rich domain N-terminal of the catalytic center (Fig. 1), and this is the case in all currently annotated GCs (not shown). This glycine-rich domain can be expressed as (G-{X}3,4-G-X{2,3}-G) and will subsequently be referred to as glycine-rich motif and used as secondary search parameter. A pattern search of PIR with the catalytic center motif identifies 263 protein sequences of which 208 are annotated GCs and the rest are either hypothetical proteins or annotated proteins with different functions. A pattern search of the A. thaliana genome data base with no substitution allowed returns no candidates. If a replacement with any amino acid was permitted at the functionally unassigned but conserved glycine (Gly) residue in the catalytic center, seven candidates molecules are returned. Of the seven A. thaliana proteins returned only one also contains the N-terminal glycine-rich motif. This A. thaliana molecule of unassigned function was termed AtGC1. AtGC1 is 274 amino acids in length and contains the search motif in its N-terminal region between residues 32 and 46 (Fig. 2). The functionally unassigned but conserved glycine (Gly) in the catalytic center is replaced by an aspartic acid (Asp) (Fig. 1). Homology searches with AtGC1 return GCs, albeit with e-values ≥0.19, as well as more closely related (<e −20) human, mouse, mosquito, and Drosophila proteins without commonly known GC domains and of currently unknown function. AtGC1 contains the conserved arginine (Arg) or lysine (Lys) (Fig. 1) that participates in hydrogen bonding with guanine (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar) and the cysteine (Cys) that confers substrate specificity for GTP (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar, 25Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Google Scholar). Finally, one of the amino acids that has been reported to stabilize the transition state in the conversion of GTP to cGMP, namely arginine (Arg), is conservatively replaced by lysine (Lys) (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar). Such a replacement is also seen in the Fugu (Takifugu rubripes) GC (Fig. 1). AtGC1 contains a glycine-rich domain N-terminal of the catalytic center (Fig. 1) and 17 amino acids N-terminal of the motif an arginine (Arg) (Fig. 2 A) that is implied in PPibinding (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar). This arginine is flanked by hydrophobic amino acids, and this together with the distance to the catalytic center is common in annotated class III nucleotide cyclases (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar). The modeled secondary structure (26Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-205Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A) predicts a β-sheet spanning the purine-binding hydrophobic pocket, a feature that has been reported previously (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structure prediction (27Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Google Scholar) (not shown) indicates 18% identity of AtGC1 with the P-loop in nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. A domain comparison (Fig.2 B) between classical GCs and AtGC1 reveals the unusual N-terminal position of the catalytic motif as well as the reduced size of the domain. Pair-wise BLAST sequence comparison of AtGC1 against sequences from the dimerization domain, kinase-homology domain, trans-membrane domain, ligand-binding domain, and heme-binding domain that interacts with NO indicated that AtGC1 does not have significant sequence similarity with any of these domains. To test biological activity of the candidate molecule, we have obtained the cDNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR and expressed it in a prokaryotic system (Fig. 3 A). Only in protein extracts from transformed induced bacteria do we observe a fusion protein (GST:AtGC1) of the predicted molecular mass of 57 kDa. When equal amounts of cells were extracted and assayed for cGMP with a radioimmunoassay, it was observed that the cGMP levels were >2.5-fold elevated in extracts from transformed induced bacteria as compared with both extracts from non-induced cells and the control (Fig. 3 B). The findings would suggest that the A. thaliana protein is either a bona fide GC or stimulates resident E. coli GCs. Fig. 4 shows the purified recombinant AtGC1 and results from in vitro testing of the recombinant molecule. The GC activity of total extracted protein from untransformed, but IPTG-induced, E. coli is less than 10 fmol/μg of protein and higher in the presence of Mn2+than Mg2+. The purified fusion protein (Fig. 4 A) has an activity of >20 fmol/μg in the presence of Mg2+and a drastically reduced activity (>50×) in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 4 B). Both control extract from un-transformed induced E. coli obtained after glutathione-Sepharose 4B column purification and GST on its own show no activity, thus indicating that the cGMP measured in the recombinant protein preparation is solely due to the catalytic function of AtGC1. A time course of GST:AtGC1-dependant cGMP formation shows that >80% of the product was generated in less than 10 min and that no significant amount of cGMP was produced from heat-inactivated recombinant protein under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4 C). The results obtained from in vitro testing are thus consistent with monomeric or homo-oligomeric catalytic function that is independent of ATP, activating proteins or co-factors other than Mg2+. Finally, GST:AtGC1 was also tested for adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro (Fig. 4 D). The result indicates that with ATP as substrate and in the absence of GTP, AtGC1 has adenylyl cyclase activity that is >3 times lower than the GC activity and not significantly different in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Since there is compelling evidence that plants operate cGMP-dependent signaling pathways, we decided to use the resource of the complete A. thaliana genome sequence to search for GCs. The approach was based on the observation that known GC catalytic domains appear highly conserved between highly diverged organisms. We reasoned that plant GCs may contain at least some of the amino acid residues that are conserved in the catalytic center of known GCs, specifically the residues that are directly implicated in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the obligatory presence of the glycine-rich motif found adjacent to the N terminus of the catalytic center of all known GCs suggested inclusion of this feature as additional search criterium. In GCs the glycine-rich motif may play a similar role as in the P-loop of GTP-binding proteins where it gives flexiblity to the part of protein that interacts with the phosphate group in GTP, thus facilitating substrate binding (28Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Google Scholar). We anticipated that plant GCs would be significantly evolutionarily distinct and different from known GCs, since homology searches have failed to identify functional molecules in plants. Consequently, a search motif was constructed to allow conservative and semiconservative replacements of amino acid residues in the catalytic center. The glutamic acid (Glu) implied in Mg2+ binding (Fig. 1) (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar) was not included in the search motif, since it is substituted by wide range of different amino acids (Asp, Ala, Gln, Cys, Thr, Arg, and Tyr) in prokaryotic guanylyl cyclases (19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar). In addition, the glutamic acid (Glu) is also replaced by aspartic acid (Asp) in some type I and type II adenylyl cyclases (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar). This substitution pattern would thus suggest that polarity and charge of the amino acid side chain in this position is not restrictive for catalysis. The fact that no A. thaliana protein contains the unsubstituted search motif prompted a decrease of the stringency of the motif allowing for a replacement of the functionally unassigned but highly conserved glycine in the catalytic center (Fig. 1). The modified search parameters yield seven A. thaliana proteins, and only one, AtGC1, fulfils the secondary criteria of the presence of the adjacent glycine-rich motif. It is concluded that the motif search with one substitution in the catalytic center is not highly selective for GCs, since 20 proteins out of 260 proteins identified in PIR that contain the motif are implicated in functions not related to known GC activity. However, the combination of the two search parameters, the catalytic center search motif and the glycine-rich motif, identify annotated GCs only. This would suggest that the use of both parameters combined is a reliable tool for the identification of candidate GCs. AtGC1 contains the conserved residues that participate in hydrogen bonding with guanine (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar) and the cysteine (Cys) that confers substrate specificity for GTP rather than ATP (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar). This structural feature is reflected in the in vitro activity of AtGC1 which shows significantly more guanylyl than adenylyl cyclase activity. The arginine (Arg) that stabilizes the transition state in the conversion of GTP to cGMP is conservatively replaced by lysine (Lys) (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar, 19McCue L.A. McDonough K.A. Lawrence C.E. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 204-219Google Scholar), and such a substitution is also observed in Fugu (T. rubripes) (Fig. 1). AtGC1 also contains the hydrophobic pocket to which nucleotide triphoshate purine moieties can bind (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar), and the secondary structure modeling predicts that this pocket is part of a β-sheet (Fig. 2 A). A further N-terminal feature of GCs is the presence of a pyrophosphate (PPi) binding motif that consists of an arginine (Arg) flanked by aliphatic amino acids (18Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Google Scholar). AtGC1 contains such a motif 22 amino acids from the catalytic center and hence in a position that is conserved in PPi-binding sites of known GCs (Fig.2 A). The similarity between the predicted three-dimensional structure of AtGC1 and that of the P-loop structure contained in nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases (28Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Google Scholar, 29Prakash B. Renault L. Praefcke G.J. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4555-4564Google Scholar) is noteworthy, since nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases can convert GTP to both GDP and GMP (30Schwemmle M. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11299-11305Google Scholar, 31Neun R. Richter M.F. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 69-72Google Scholar). In triphosphate hydrolases, the P-loop interacts with Mg2+ for GTP binding and hydrolysis, and it may be argued that the P-loop-like structure in AtGC1 has an analogous function, and this is supported by the observed dependence of the catalytic activity of AtGC1 on Mg2+ (Fig. 4 B). AtGC1 contains a number of features that are unusual in currently annotated GCs. First, the catalytic center motif is found close to the N-terminal rather than the C-terminal or central part of the molecule where it is located in both particulate and soluble guanylyl cyclases (32Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24871-24875Google Scholar, 33Koesling D. Schultz G. Bohme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 301-306Google Scholar, 34Garbers D. Lowe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Google Scholar). C-terminal location is the norm in particulate GCs where the N terminus functions as receptor and the C-terminal GC domain generates the cytosolic signal. In addition, in AtGC1 there is no evidence of a signal sequence for direction to the membrane and the designated PPi-binding arginine (Arg) is only 12 amino acids removed from the N-terminal end of the molecule. Other features typical of particulate GCs, the ligand-binding domain, transmembrane domain, kinase homology domain, and dimerization domain are also absent. Contrary to the homodimeric particulate GCs, the soluble GCs form α/β heterodimers (33Koesling D. Schultz G. Bohme E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 301-306Google Scholar, 35Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Google Scholar). Soluble GCs are the principal effector of the gaseous messenger NO. NO dependence of soluble GCs in turn requires a heme-binding region, and this region is N-terminal of the catalytic domain. NO binds covalently via two cystine-thioether bonds that are provided by a conserved C-X-X-C-H motif in soluble GCs (36Lawson D.M. Stevenson C.E. Andrew C.R. Eady R.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5661-5671Google Scholar). In AtGC1 there is no evidence of a heme-binding motif that is required for NO binding. The absence of such a heme-binding motif is thus consistent with the lack of NO inducibility observed in AtGC1. From the sequence analysis, one would thus predict that AtGC1 is not a membrane protein, not similar in domain structure to known receptor or soluble GCs, and its lack of a heme-binding group implies activity that is insensitive to NO, while catalytic activityin vitro implies that it is active either as a monomer or homo-oligomer. The assay result obtained from transformed induced E. colidemonstrates a significant increase in cGMP (Fig. 3). Since in this assay cGMP was generated in intact bacteria and in the absence of added substrate, it can be concluded that at least the N terminus of the recombinant was present in the cytosol and thus supports the predictions based on structural features. Since AtGC1 is likely to be located in the cytosol, we tested whether the activity in vivo in E. coli cells was affected by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside, and the observed NO insensitivity is consistent with the structural features of AtGC1. NO independence in soluble GCs does not appear to be the norm; however, an unusual soluble GC fromManduca sexta (MsGC-β3) that does not require dimerization has been reported (37Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Google Scholar). In this molecule amino acids thought to participate in heme binding are substituted with non-similar amino acids (37Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Google Scholar). AtGC1 and MsGC-β3 are thus both soluble GCs that do not depend on heterodimer formation for activity. Taken together, our results imply that AtGC1 is active as a monomer, homodimer, or homo-oligomer, with no obligatory dependence on membrane associations, activation by ligands, ATP, or other co-factors with the exception of Mg2+. While homodimeric and oligomeric activity is common in particulate GCs (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman A.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414Google Scholar, 17Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Google Scholar, 34Garbers D. Lowe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Google Scholar), monomeric activity in a soluble GC has only recently been reported (38Koglin M. Vehse K. Budaeus L. Scholz H. Behrends S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30737-30743Google Scholar). Monomeric GC activity has also been demonstrated in a soluble GC (DdsGC) from Dictyostelium discoideum (39Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Google Scholar) that has in fact been identified as a homologue of an adenylyl cyclase. It is in keeping with this ancestry that DdsGC has two catalytic domains within a single molecule. The discovery of another GC from M. sexta (MsGC-I) has further complicated attempts to categorize GCs (40Simpson P.J. Nighorn A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4440-4446Google Scholar, 41Nighorn A. Simpson P.J. Morton D.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 305-314Google Scholar). MsGC-I shows highest sequence identity with receptor GCs throughout its catalytic and dimerization domains but does not contain the ligand-binding, transmembrane, or kinase-like domains typical receptor GCs (40Simpson P.J. Nighorn A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4440-4446Google Scholar). Both AtGC1 and MsGC-I contain C-terminal extensions that are not present in other known guanylyl cyclases. MsGC-I shows no similarity to domains typical of soluble GCs but appears to exist as a soluble homodimer insensitive to NO stimulation (40Simpson P.J. Nighorn A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4440-4446Google Scholar); however, despite the absence of a transmembrane domain an as yet undefined membrane association in vivo has been suggested (40Simpson P.J. Nighorn A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4440-4446Google Scholar). AtGC1 is adding to the steadily growing number of structurally diverse molecules with GC activity and it appears that many more and diverse GC-dependent physiological responses await discovery. We are currently in the process of elucidating the biological role of AtGC1 with particular emphasis on cGMP dependent promotion of stomatal opening (12Pharmawati M. Billington T. Gehring C.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 272-276Google Scholar, 13Pharmawati M. Maryani M.M. Nikolakopoulos T. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W2008150634,"The WH2 (WASP homology domain-2) is a small actin monomer-binding motif and is found in many proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, including the β-thymosins, ciboulot, WASP, and verprolin/WIP (WASP-interacting protein). In sequence database searches we identified a novel mouse protein containing a WH2 domain in its C-terminal region. This mouse gene also shows strong sequence homology to human MIM (Missing in Metastasis), a cDNA fragment that is present in non-metastatic but absent in metastatic bladder cancer cell lines. Northern blot and in situ hybridizations show that MIM is strongly expressed in the developing neurons and skeletal and cardiac muscles in mouse embryos. In adult mice, the strongest expression of MIM mRNA is in liver, outer layers of the kidney, and in the Purkinje cells of the brain. Recombinant MIM protein interacts with actin monomers and inhibits actin filament nucleation in vitro. However, the MIM/ATP-G-actin complex can participate in actin filament assembly at the barbed end. MIM binds ATP-G-actin with a higher affinity (K D = 0.06 μm) than ADP-G-actin (K D = 0.3 μm) and inhibits the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that the actin monomer-binding site resides in the C-terminal WH2 domain of MIM. Overexpression of mouse MIM in NIH 3T3 cells results in the disappearance of actin stress fibers and appearance of abnormal actin filament structures.

The structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are spatially and temporally regulated by a large number of actin-binding proteins, whose own activities and localities are precisely regulated by various signaling pathways (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 2Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Google Scholar). Sequence and structural data on actin-binding proteins has revealed that many of these proteins interact with actin through a relatively small number of protein motifs. These include the calponin homology domain, the gelsolin homology domain, the actin-depolymerizing-factor homology domain, and the WASP homology 2 (WH2)1domain (for reviews see 2–5).The WH2 domain is a small (∼35 residue) protein motif that interacts only with monomeric actin (5Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Google Scholar, 6Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B.J. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Google Scholar). WH2 domains are found in many regulators of actin dynamics, including β-thymosins and ciboulot, which bind actin monomers and regulate filament assembly. β-thymosins are actin monomer-sequestering proteins, whereas ciboulot promotes actin assembly at the barbed end of the filaments (7Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Google Scholar, 8Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Google Scholar). WH2 domains are also present in more complex proteins such as WASP/Scar, verprolin/WIP, and Srv2/CAP. These are multifunctional regulators of actin dynamics that link intracellular signaling pathways to actin dynamics (5Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Google Scholar). For example, WASP and Scar mediate signals from PIP2 and the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac to the actin cytoskeleton by inducing actin assembly through activation of the Arp2/3 complex (9Machesky L.M.

The WH2 domain is essential for the activity of WASP and Scar and is believed to facilitate the assembly of actin monomers to the newly formed filament ends (12Yarar D. D'Alessio J.A. Jeng R.L. Welch M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4045-4059Google Scholar, 13Welch M.D. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 247-288Google Scholar). Also verprolin/WIP proteins interact with actin monomers through their WH2 domains, but the biological role of their actin monomer-binding activity is still unclear (14Thanabalu T. Munn A.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6979-6989Google Scholar).We searched sequence databases for WH2 domain-containing proteins in mammals, Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to the previously characterized WH2 domain proteins (β-thymosins, ciboulot, WASP, verprolin/WIP, Scar, Srv2/CAP) we identified several previously unknown WH2 domain-containing proteins (5Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Google Scholar). One of these proteins is particularly interesting because it is highly homologous to a human cDNA fragment named MIM (Missing In Metastasis) that was recently identified in a differential screen for mRNAs specifically expressed in non-metastatic bladder cancer cells (15Lee Y.-G. Macoska J.A. Korenchuk S. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 291-294Google Scholar).We show that mouse MIM is an actin monomer-binding protein that efficiently inhibits the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers and actin filament nucleation in vitro. The strong actin-modulating activities reside in the C-terminal WH2 domain of MIM. We found that MIM is strongly expressed in the developing heart, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system. In adult mouse tissues, strong expression levels are detected in liver and in certain regions of brain and kidney. Overexpression of MIM results in the disappearance of stress fibers and formation of abnormal F-actin structures in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that MIM regulates the dynamics of the actin monomer pool in specialized mammalian cells.DISCUSSIONWe show here that mouse MIM is an actin monomer-binding protein that inhibits the nucleation of actin filaments in vitro. These activities reside in the C-terminal WH2 domain of MIM. WH2 domains are also found in many other actin monomer-interacting proteins, such as WASP, Scar, thymosin-β4, ciboulot, actobindin, and WIP/verprolin. All available data indicate that these proteins also interact with actin monomers through their WH2 domains (for recent review see Ref. 5Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least thymosin-β4, ciboulot, and actobindin have significantly higher affinity for ATP-G-actin than for ADP-G-actin (31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G. Didry D. Bubb M.R. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14786-14792Google Scholar, 36Carlier M.-F. Jean C. Rieger K.J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Google Scholar). Our data shows that mouse MIM affinity for ATP-G-actin is ∼5-fold higher than its affinity for ADP-G-actin, suggesting that WH2 domain has evolved as a motif that preferentially binds ATP-G-actin. It is important to note that mouse MIM binds ATP-G-actin with ∼20-fold higher affinity (K D = 0.06 μm, Fig. 4) than thymosin-β4, ciboulot, and actobindin (K D = 0.7–2 μm) (31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G. Didry D. Bubb M.R. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14786-14792Google Scholar). For that reason, we would expect MIM to more drastically affect actin dynamics in cells than for example thymosin-β4.Most actin monomer-binding proteins, including profilin, ADF/cofilin, twinfilin and WH2 domain proteins bind to the same site on the actin monomer, and thus compete with each other in actin monomer-binding (30Ojala P.J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Google Scholar). Our data show that mouse MIM has a higher affinity for ATP-G-actin (K D = 0.06 μm) than other actin monomer-binding proteins such as profilin (K D= 0.1–0.15 μm), ADF/cofilin (K D = 4–8 μm) and twinfilin (K D = 0.5 μm) (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 30Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3811-3821Google Scholar). This suggests that in the cells where MIM is expressed, the majority of active MIM is associated with ATP-G-actin. On the other hand, the affinity of mouse MIM for ADP-G-actin (K D = 0.3 μm), is significantly lower than the ones of ADF/cofilin (K D = 0.1–0.15 μm) and twinfilin (K D = 0.05 μm), indicating that MIM would not significantly affect the localization and dynamics of the cellular ADP-actin monomer pool (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G. Didry D. Bubb M.R. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14786-14792Google Scholar).Some WH2 domain proteins such as thymosin-β4 inhibit actin filament assembly, whereas others such as ciboulot, actobindin and WASP do not sequester actin monomers when the barbed ends of filaments are available (8Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Google Scholar, 12Yarar D. D'Alessio J.A. Jeng R.L. Welch M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4045-4059Google Scholar, 31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G.

A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Google Scholar, 40Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 114: 1801-1809Google Scholar). Mouse MIM increases the amount of actin monomers in steady-state assembly assays and inhibits actin filament nucleation in kinetic assays (Fig. 6, A and B). MIM also blocks the pointed end filament assembly, but MIM-CT/ATP-G-actin complexes can participate in barbed end filament elongation (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, our data suggests that MIM has similar effects on actin assembly as previously described for small WH2 domain proteins cibulot and actobindin (8Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Google Scholar, 31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G. Didry D. Bubb M.R. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14786-14792Google Scholar). However, because MIM is a large, multidomain protein, it is likely to have additional activities that could affect or regulate the actin-modulating activities of the C-terminal WH2 domain.Our Northern blot and in situ hybridization assays demonstrated that MIM mRNA is strongly expressed in developing neurons and myoblasts but absent in most mature neurons and muscle cells. In adult mice, MIM is present in high levels in liver, kidney, and in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (Fig. 3). Similarly, the small actin monomer-sequestering protein, thymosin-β10, is expressed in several developing neuronal cell-types, but only in Purkinje cells in adult animals (41Anadon R. Moldes I.R. Carpintero P. Evangelatos G. Livianou E. Leondiadis L. Quintela I. Carvino M.C. Gomez-Marquez J. Brain Res. 2001; 894: 255-265Google Scholar). The transient expression of MIM in developing neurons and myoblasts suggests a role in polarized growth or motility: both processes are actin-dependent and typical for differentiating neurons and myoblasts. Mature muscle cells and neurons lack MIM and have a less dynamic actin cytoskeleton and consequently do not undergo similar morphogenetic changes than their embryonic precursors. The presence of MIM in adult Purkinje cells may be related to the growth and refinement of Purkinje cell dendrites, a phenomenon that probably also takes place in adult animal brains.It is interesting to note, that the human homologue of MIM was identified as a gene that was present in non-metastatic but absent in metastatic bladder cancer cells (15Lee Y.-G. Macoska J.A. Korenchuk S. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 291-294Google Scholar). Our in situhybridization data show that MIM is strongly expressed in developing neurons and myoblasts (Fig. 3). These are highly polar cell types, suggesting that MIM may help promote and maintain cell polarity. Polarity is essential for the growth and motility of myoblasts and neurons, whereas the loss of polarity in epithelial cells may affect adhesion and precede increased motility, invasiveness, and metastatic capability. This may provide an explanation for the lack of MIM in metastatic bladder cancer cell lines (15Lee Y.-G. Macoska J.A. Korenchuk S. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 291-294Google Scholar). Alternatively, MIM may negatively regulate cytoskeletal dynamics by restricting actin polymerization only to certain regions of migrating cells and in cells that undergo polarized growth. This negative regulatory role is supported by our biochemical (Fig. 6) and cell biological studies, where overexpressing MIM disrupted stress fibers and resulted in formation of abnormal actin filament structures (Fig. 8). In the future it will be important to examine the localization of endogenous MIM protein in various cell types. Unfortunately, our attempts to generate antibodies against mouse MIM have so far been unsuccessful. We would also like to use small interfering RNA and traditional mouse knockout technology to examine the importance of MIM during development and in adult tissues.Taken together, our data show that mouse MIM binds actin monomers and regulates actin filament assembly in specific polarized mammalian cell-types. Because MIM is a relatively large, multidomain protein, it may have other activities and regulate actin dynamics in a complex fashion. Other large WH2 domain proteins (WASP, Scar, WIP/verprolin) are involved in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, and the activities of these proteins are regulated by relatively complex mechanisms (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar). Therefore, MIM may also be a link between cellular signaling pathways and actin filament assembly. In this respect, it is important to note that MIM contains also several proline-rich motifs that may interact with Src homology 3 or WW domains of certain signaling proteins. In the future it will be important to identify the interaction partners of MIM and learn how they regulate the activity and localization of MIM in specialized mammalian cells. The actin cytoskeleton is central in a number of cellular processes such as motility, morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are spatially and temporally regulated by a large number of actin-binding proteins, whose own activities and localities are precisely regulated by various signaling pathways (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 2Gimona M. Djinovic-Carugo K. Kranewitter W.J. Winder S.J.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1951-1959Google Scholar). Sequence and structural data on actin-binding proteins has revealed that many of these proteins interact with actin through a relatively small number of protein motifs. These include the calponin homology domain, the gelsolin homology domain, the actin-depolymerizing-factor homology domain, and the WASP homology 2 (WH2)1domain (for reviews see 2–5). The WH2 domain is a small (∼35 residue) protein motif that interacts only with monomeric actin (5Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Google Scholar, 6Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B.J. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Google Scholar). WH2 domains are found in many regulators of actin dynamics, including β-thymosins and ciboulot, which bind actin monomers and regulate filament assembly. β-thymosins are actin monomer-sequestering proteins, whereas ciboulot promotes actin assembly at the barbed end of the filaments (7Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Google Scholar, 8Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Google Scholar). WH2 domains are also present in more complex proteins such as WASP/Scar, verprolin/WIP, and Srv2/CAP. These are multifunctional regulators of actin dynamics that link intracellular signaling pathways to actin dynamics (5Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Google Scholar). For example, WASP and Scar mediate signals from PIP2 and the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac to the actin cytoskeleton by inducing actin assembly through activation of the Arp2/3 complex (9Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Google Scholar, 10Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Google Scholar, 11Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A.

Also verprolin/WIP proteins interact with actin monomers through their WH2 domains, but the biological role of their actin monomer-binding activity is still unclear (14Thanabalu T. Munn A.L.

Most actin monomer-binding proteins, including profilin, ADF/cofilin, twinfilin and WH2 domain proteins bind to the same site on the actin monomer, and thus compete with each other in actin monomer-binding (30Ojala P.J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Google Scholar). Our data show that mouse MIM has a higher affinity for ATP-G-actin (K D = 0.06 μm) than other actin monomer-binding proteins such as profilin (K D= 0.1–0.15 μm), ADF/cofilin (K D = 4–8 μm) and twinfilin (K D = 0.5 μm) (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 30Ojala P.J. Paavilainen V.O. Vartiainen M.K. Tuma R. Weeds A.G. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3811-3821Google Scholar). This suggests that in the cells where MIM is expressed, the majority of active MIM is associated with ATP-G-actin. On the other hand, the affinity of mouse MIM for ADP-G-actin (K D = 0.3 μm), is significantly lower than the ones of ADF/cofilin (K D = 0.1–0.15 μm) and twinfilin (K D = 0.05 μm), indicating that MIM would not significantly affect the localization and dynamics of the cellular ADP-actin monomer pool (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar, 31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G. Didry D. Bubb M.R. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14786-14792Google Scholar). Some WH2 domain proteins such as thymosin-β4 inhibit actin filament assembly, whereas others such as ciboulot, actobindin and WASP do not sequester actin monomers when the barbed ends of filaments are available (8Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Google Scholar, 12Yarar D. D'Alessio J.A. Jeng R.L. Welch M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4045-4059Google Scholar, 31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G.

Mouse MIM increases the amount of actin monomers in steady-state assembly assays and inhibits actin filament nucleation in kinetic assays (Fig. 6, A and B). MIM also blocks the pointed end filament assembly, but MIM-CT/ATP-G-actin complexes can participate in barbed end filament elongation (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, our data suggests that MIM has similar effects on actin assembly as previously described for small WH2 domain proteins cibulot and actobindin (8Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.F. Preat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Google Scholar, 31Hertzog M. Yarmola E.G. Didry D. Bubb M.R. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14786-14792Google Scholar). However, because MIM is a large, multidomain protein, it is likely to have additional activities that could affect or regulate the actin-modulating activities of the C-terminal WH2 domain. Our Northern blot and in situ hybridization assays demonstrated that MIM mRNA is strongly expressed in developing neurons and myoblasts but absent in most mature neurons and muscle cells. In adult mice, MIM is present in high levels in liver, kidney, and in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (Fig. 3). Similarly, the small actin monomer-sequestering protein, thymosin-β10, is expressed in several developing neuronal cell-types, but only in Purkinje cells in adult animals (41Anadon R. Moldes I.R. Carpintero P. Evangelatos G. Livianou E. Leondiadis L. Quintela I. Carvino M.C. Gomez-Marquez J. Brain Res. 2001; 894: 255-265Google Scholar). The transient expression of MIM in developing neurons and myoblasts suggests a role in polarized growth or motility: both processes are actin-dependent and typical for differentiating neurons and myoblasts. Mature muscle cells and neurons lack MIM and have a less dynamic actin cytoskeleton and consequently do not undergo similar morphogenetic changes than their embryonic precursors. The presence of MIM in adult Purkinje cells may be related to the growth and refinement of Purkinje cell dendrites, a phenomenon that probably also takes place in adult animal brains. It is interesting to note, that the human homologue of MIM was identified as a gene that was present in non-metastatic but absent in metastatic bladder cancer cells (15Lee Y.-G. Macoska J.A. Korenchuk S. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 291-294Google Scholar). Our in situhybridization data show that MIM is strongly expressed in developing neurons and myoblasts (Fig. 3). These are highly polar cell types, suggesting that MIM may help promote and maintain cell polarity. Polarity is essential for the growth and motility of myoblasts and neurons, whereas the loss of polarity in epithelial cells may affect adhesion and precede increased motility, invasiveness, and metastatic capability. This may provide an explanation for the lack of MIM in metastatic bladder cancer cell lines (15Lee Y.-G. Macoska J.A. Korenchuk S. Pienta K.J. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 291-294Google Scholar). Alternatively, MIM may negatively regulate cytoskeletal dynamics by restricting actin polymerization only to certain regions of migrating cells and in cells that undergo polarized growth. This negative regulatory role is supported by our biochemical (Fig. 6) and cell biological studies, where overexpressing MIM disrupted stress fibers and resulted in formation of abnormal actin filament structures (Fig. 8). In the future it will be important to examine the localization of endogenous MIM protein in various cell types. Unfortunately, our attempts to generate antibodies against mouse MIM have so far been unsuccessful. We would also like to use small interfering RNA and traditional mouse knockout technology to examine the importance of MIM during development and in adult tissues. Taken together, our data show that mouse MIM binds actin monomers and regulates actin filament assembly in specific polarized mammalian cell-types. Because MIM is a relatively large, multidomain protein, it may have other activities and regulate actin dynamics in a complex fashion. Other large WH2 domain proteins (WASP, Scar, WIP/verprolin) are involved in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, and the activities of these proteins are regulated by relatively complex mechanisms (1Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomolec. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar). Therefore, MIM may also be a link between cellular signaling pathways and actin filament assembly. In this respect, it is important to note that MIM contains also several proline-rich motifs that may interact with Src homology 3 or WW domains of certain signaling proteins. In the future it will be important to identify the interaction partners of MIM and learn how they regulate the activity and localization of MIM in specialized mammalian cells."

To understand its regulatory mechanism, we have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal truncated human SHP-1 in the inactive conformation at 2.8-Å resolution and refined the structure to a crystallographic R-factor of 24.0%. The three-dimensional structure shows that the ligand-free SHP-1 has an auto-inhibited conformation. Its N-SH2 domain blocks the catalytic domain and keeps the enzyme in the inactive conformation, which supports that the phosphatase activity of SHP-1 is primarily regulated by the N-SH2 domain. In addition, the C-SH2 domain of SHP-1 has a different orientation from and is more flexible than that of SHP-2, which enables us to propose an enzymatic activation mechanism in which the C-SH2 domains of SHPs could be involved in searching for phosphotyrosine activators.

Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key mechanism for regulating eukaryotic cellular signaling pathways. The protein tyrosine phosphorylation level is precisely regulated by two types of enzymes: protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; SH2, src homology 2; r.m.s., root mean square; CSW, PTP2 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; SH2, src homology 2; r.m.s., root mean square; CSW, PTP2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), in which PTPs act to counter-balance the process through dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated tyrosines (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar, 2Barford D. Tonks N.K. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 249-254Google Scholar). PTPs can be divided into two groups, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases and cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatases. The SH2 domain-containing PTPs, SHP-1 and SHP-2, are both cytosolic PTPs and share many structural and regulatory features. They both have two tandem SH2 domains at the N terminus followed by a single catalytic domain and an inhibitory C-terminal tail. However, irrespective of similar structural and regulatory characteristics, these two enzymes have different biological function in vivo. Different from SHP-2, which is expressed in all kinds of tissues, SHP-1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells and behaves mainly as a negative regulator of signaling pathways in lymphocytes (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar, 2Barford D. Tonks N.K. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 249-254Google Scholar). SHP-1 is dormant in the cytosol, with its phosphatase activity inhibited by both the SH2 domains and the C-terminal tail (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar, 3Tamir I. Dal Porto J.M. Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 307-315Google Scholar, 4Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 259-288Google Scholar, 5Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Google Scholar). In response to an activation signal, SHP-1 is recruited to membrane-bound inhibitory receptors via the binding of its SH2 domains to the tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif within the cytoplasmic domain of a receptor (6Famiglietti S.J. Nakamura K. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 35-40Google Scholar, 7Christensen M.D. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 2000; 51: 557-564Google Scholar, 8Wang L.L. Blasioli J. Plas D.R. Thomas M.L. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1318-1323Google Scholar). During this process, SHP-1 undergoes a structural rearrangement, exposes its active site, and binds to the downstream substrates, thereby dephosphorylating the substrates to turn off the cellular signals. SHP-1 also presents in several types of non-hematopoietic cells (9Bouchard P. Zhao Z. Banville D. Dumas F. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19585-19589Google Scholar, 10Su L. Zhao Z.

Hoglinger O. Jaramillo M.L. Banville D. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3687-3694Google Scholar). Overexpression of a catalytically inactive SHP-1 mutant in these cells strongly suppressed mitogen-activated pathways, reducing signal transduction and activation of transcription; these findings demonstrate that SHP-1 has a positive effect on mitogenic signaling in these non-hematopoietic cells (10Su L. Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Google Scholar, 11You M. Zhao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23376-23381Google Scholar). Thus, SHP-1 probably has both the negative and positive regulatory function in different types of cells. Many aspects of the molecular mechanism that underlies the activation and regulation of SHP-1 remain unclear. Here, we report the 2.8-Å crystal structure of the 61-residue C-terminal-truncated SHP-1 (residues 1–532) in the ligand-free dormant conformation. SHP-1 shares a 60% overall sequence identity with SHP-2. A comparison of the crystal structures of SHP-1 and SHP-2 reveals that the C-SH2 domain of SHPs is highly mobile, suggesting that this domain may be involved in searching for phosphopeptides to activate the enzyme in the initial stages of enzyme activation. The 61-residue C-terminal-truncated SHP-1 (residues 1–532) was cloned and expressed as described previously (13Liang X. Meng W. Niu T. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 201-203Google Scholar), except that theEscherichia coli strain of BL21 (pLysS) was used for the expression to increase the protein solubility. Purification was operated by ion exchange and affinity chromatography. The harvested protein sample was desalted by centrifugation and concentrated to 3 mg ml−1 for crystallization. Crystallization was performed by the vapor-diffusion hanging-drop method at 4 °C. The crystallization drops composed of equal-volume mixture (3 μl:3 μl) of protein solution and reservoir solution (25–30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0) were equilibrated against the reservoir solution (0.5 ml), and crystals were obtained within 2 weeks. A 2.8-Å diffraction data set was collected at 100 K on the F1 beamline at CHESS (Cornell University). The x-ray wavelength was 0.978 Å. 15% glycerol was introduced into the reservoir solution as cryoprotectant to reduce the freezing damage to crystals. Data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The space group of the SHP-1 crystals belongs to P212121, and the unit-cell parameters were determined to be a = 44.74 Å,b = 100.40 Å, and c = 149.47 Å. There was one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure of SHP-1 was solved by the molecular replacement method with AmoRe (15Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar), using the coordinates of C-terminal truncated SHP-2 (16Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Google Scholar) as the search model. Refinement was performed with CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The refinement process was monitored with the free R-factor that was calculated using randomly selected 10% of the data as the test set. After the initial rigid-body refinement, a 2F o− F c electron density map was calculated. The C-SH2 domain was found to apparently mismatch the first 2F o − F c map. Therefore, the C-SH2 domain was omitted from the model. Thereafter, five cycles of positional refinement and re-building the model for the N-SH2 and PTP domains were applied for all data in the resolution range of 10–3.0 Å, and an F o − F c map was generated. Subsequently, the C-SH2 domain was manually re-assigned based on the omitted F o − F cmap. The full model was refined with the 2-ς cutoff data in the 10–2.8-Å resolution range. The model building interspersed with CNS refinement was done with TURBO-FRODO (18Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: C66Google Scholar). In the penultimate cycle, the free R-factor was reduced to 33.4%, correspondingly, the final crystallographic R-factor was 24.0%, with all reflections used in the refinement. In the final model, the linker regions between the C-SH2 domain and the N-SH2 and catalytic domains were not observed. No water molecules were assigned to the final model. The crystal statistics, final refinement results, and geometric analyses are summarized in Table I.Table IData collection and refinement characteristics for SHP-1Data collectionBeamlineF1 in CHESSWavelength (Å)0.978Space groupP212121Unit cell constants (Å)a = 44.74, b = 100.40, c = 149.47Resolution range (Å)aNumbers in parentheses indicate outer shell values.50–2.80 (2.95–2.80)Total reflections observed63,500Unique reflections12,921Completeness (%)96.7 (89.9)I/ς(I)5.1 (2.0)R merge (%)9.9 (31.5)RefinementResolution range (Å)10.0–2.8Data cutoff (F/ς(F))2R-free (%)b10% of the diffraction were randomly selected as a test set for calculation of the R-free factor.33.4R-factor (%)24.0r.m.s. deviation for bond lengths (Å)1.43r.m.s. deviation for bond angles (°)0.007a Numbers in parentheses indicate outer shell values.b 10% of the diffraction were randomly selected as a test set for calculation of the R-free factor. Open table in a new tab The crystallized ligand-free human protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 contains residues 1–532 but lacks the 61-residue C-terminal tail. Its crystal structure has been determined by molecular replacement method and refined to a final crystallographic R-factor of 24.0% at 2.8-Å resolution. The statistics for the crystal data and refinement results are shown in Table I. Three domains were defined well from the present crystal structure. The residues 1–108 and 116–208 fold as two Src homology 2 domains, the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains, respectively. Residues 270–532 fold as the typical PTP domain, a highly twisted ten-stranded β-sheet flanked by four helices on the convex side and two helices and a β-hairpin from the concave side. The N-terminal extended region of the PTP domain comprising helices α0 and α1′ are defined well, whereas the linker regions of C-SH2 to N-SH2 and to PTP domains, residues 109–115 and 209–231, were disordered and not observed on the finial electron density map. The architecture of the three domains is compact. The two SH2 domains look like two antennas of the global PTP domain in the overall view. Fig. 1 shows a ribbon representation of the final model (Fig. 1 A), the intramolecular interaction at the interface between the N-SH2 and PTP domains (Fig. 1 B), and a portion of an electron density map of the flexible C-SH2 domain (Fig. 1 C). Fig.2 shows the sequence alignment of SHP-1 with three of its homologues, with the secondary structure elements assigned.Figure 2Sequence alignment and secondary structure element assignments for SHPs and their homologues.Identical and similar residues are cyan andgreen, respectively. Secondary structure elements for SHP-1 and SHP-2 are shown in blue and orange, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SH2 domain is responsible for recognizing the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, thereby facilitating phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions that result in signal propagation (19Shakespeare W.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 409-415Google Scholar). In general, residue at the (p + 1) position of the phosphotyrosine peptide of the binding target is considered most important for defining the binding specificity (20Huyer G. Ramachandran C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2741-2747Google Scholar). Crystal structure revealed that both SH2 domains of SHP-1 have the typical SH2 domain fold, which consists of a central four-stranded β-sheet with an α-helix on either side. The phosphopeptide-binding sites of both SH2 domains face away from the PTP domain and are fully exposed on the surface of the molecule (Fig.3 A). Nevertheless, the spatial arrangement of the two SH2 domains on PTP domain significantly differs. In contrast to the N-SH2 domain that strongly interacts with the PTP domain (see below), the C-SH2 domain is tethered around and extends to the surface of the catalytic domain and has no significant direct interactions with the PTP domain. The structure of the PTP domain of ligand-free SHP-1 is almost identical to that of the peptide-bound catalytic domain of SHP-1 (Fig.3 B). Superimposition of the α-carbons between the structure of the auto-inhibited PTP domain and the previously reported structure of the catalytic domain of SHP-1 complexed with Tyr(P)469-peptide (21Yang J. Chen Z. Niu T. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4066-4071Google Scholar) gives a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.9 Å. Nevertheless, the conformations of the β5-β6 hairpin loops (residues 356–363) in these two structures significantly differ. In the present structure, the Cα of Gly359 in the β5-β6 loop is shifted 6.7 Å, reflecting an ∼25-degree rotation of the hairpin's “plane” (Fig.3 B). It could be expected that the flexibility of this loop region was related to its important role in substrate recognition (21Yang J. Chen Z. Niu T. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4066-4071Google Scholar, 22Yang J. Liang X. Niu T. Meng W. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28199-28207Google Scholar, 23Yang J. Chen Z. Niu T. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 14-20Google Scholar). Superimposition of these structures also shows flexibility around the phosphopeptide-binding sites of some other loops, with conformational changes of 1.5–2.0 Å for the α1-β1 and β3-α2 loops (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the α0 helix appears to be highly mobile. In the Tyr(P)469-PTP complex structure (21Yang J. Chen Z. Niu T. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4066-4071Google Scholar), the α0 is located at the N terminus, far away from the PTP domain. In the present SHP-1 structure, the α0 helix bridges the C-SH2 and PTP domains and rotates ∼60 degrees to approach the surface of the PTP domain (Fig. 3 B). This mobility reflects the high flexibility of the α0-α1 loop, which may be required for exposure of the active site during enzyme activation. Our previous research also lends support to the cooperative role of helix α0 in the substrate recognition (23Yang J. Chen Z. Niu T. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 14-20Google Scholar). Previous studies have revealed that both SH2 domains of SHP-1 could bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif peptides (8Wang L.L. Blasioli J. Plas D.R. Thomas M.L. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1318-1323Google Scholar). Similar to the crystallographic data for its close relative SHP-2, however, the crystal structure of the ligand-free SHP-1 supports that the N-SH2 domain, instead of C-SH2 or both domains, acts the auto-inhibition role. The interaction between N-SH2 domain and PTP domain is extensive, whereas the C-SH2 domain does not show significant interface with either of the other two domains. Cys455, the catalytic nucleophile, is located at the base of the active-site cleft. In the auto-inhibited conformation of SHP-1, it appears that the Nβ4-Nβ5 loop of the N-SH2 domain is protruding to the catalytic PTP domain to directly block the entrance to the active site, which prevents the cysteine residue from exposing to the substrate (Figs. 1 B and 3 C). This inactive conformation is stabilized by various interactions including the salt bridge between Asp61 and Lys362, along with the π-π interaction between the Phe62 and Tyr278 side chains, and the hydrogen bonds in the residue pairs of Ser59/His422, Gly60/Gln506, and Asn58/Gln502. All of these amino acid residues involved in the interactions are conserved well between SHP-1 and SHP-2 except for Ser59; SHP-2 has a threonine residue at the corresponding site (Fig. 2). Likewise, most of these residues are also highly conserved in both CSW and PTP2 (Fig. 2), implying the similar interdomain interactions in these two enzymes. In addition, the extensive interactions around the protruding Nβ4-Nβ5 loop are present at the interface between the N-SH2 domain and the PTP domain (Fig. 3 C). The area of interacting interface between these two domains is calculated to be 1478.9 Å2, which is 20% larger than that in SHP-2. In addition, the phosphopeptide-binding sites of both SH2 domains in SHP-1, like in SHP-2, appear to expose to the solvent but not to the active site, which implies that SHP-1 repression by the N-SH2 domain is most likely to involve conformationally mediated inhibition of substrate binding (16Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulation for SHP-2 also identified that the conformational flexibility of the C-terminal half of the N-SH2 domain that interacts with the PTP domain was significantly larger in the absence of phosphopeptide ligand than that in the ligand-complexed N-SH2 domain (24Wieligmann K. De Castro L.F.P. Zacharias M. In Silico Biol. 2002; 2: 0028Google Scholar). Homology in both primary and three-dimensional structures of SHP-1 and SHP-2 suggests a similar mechanism of the interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains. Determination of the crystal structure of SHP-1 revealed that its three domains are similarly assembled to those in SHP-2 (16Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Google Scholar). High structural similarity was observed between SHP-1 and SHP-2, especially in the PTP and N-SH2 domains (Fig. 3, B and C). Superimposition of the N-SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 produced an r.m.s. deviation of only 1.3 Å for their Cα atoms. The interactions between the N-SH2 and PTP domains defined from the structure support the previously proposed regulatory mechanism that both SHP-1 and SHP-2 use the N-SH2 domain to keep the enzyme in the inactive conformation (2Barford D. Tonks N.K. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 249-254Google Scholar, 25Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Google Scholar, 26Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Google Scholar). However, the C-SH2 domain in SHP-1 structure is not only differently orientated from that in SHP-2, but its secondary structure elements are relatively more openly organized. The additional superimposition of the C-SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2, following the superimposition of their N-SH2 and PTP domains (Fig. 3 A), revealed an up to 56.3-degree rotation of their orientations and a 17.1-Å translation of their mass centroids (Fig. 3 D). Consequently, the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket (27Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Google Scholar) of the C-SH2 domain undergoes wide ranging rotation. The conformation of the N-SH2 domain in SHP-1 appears changed compared with the complex structure of the phosphotyrosine peptide-bound N-SH2 domain of SHP-2. As indicated in Fig. 3 C, both the Nα2-Nβ7 and Nβ7-Nβ8 loops of N-SH2 domain in SHP-1 project about 5 Å toward the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket and block the binding site for the phosphotyrosine peptide (27Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Google Scholar). This indicates that stronger interactions exist between the N-SH2 and PTP domains prior to the binding of phosphotyrosine peptide to the N-SH2 domain. The presence of multiple SH2 domains leads to a problem of the selectivity on phosphopeptide ligands (19Shakespeare W.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 409-415Google Scholar). Earlier studies established that N-SH2 domain in SHPs plays more critical role than C-SH2 domain in signaling; however, the C-SH2 domain is indispensable for optimal signaling (2Barford D. Tonks N.K. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 249-254Google Scholar). Although structural comparison of the C-SH2 domains of our ligand-free structure with the peptide-bound C-SH2 domain of SHP-2 provided no direct information about its function, the observed structural differences may suggest that the C-SH2 domain is responsible for searching for the enzyme activator. Together with the special assembly of these three domains, a model was proposed the activation mechanism for SHP-1 (Fig.4). In this model, the highly mobile C-SH2 domain functions as an antenna to search for phosphopeptides. Binding of phosphopeptide to the C-SH2 domain results in large conformational changes that restore the distorted conformation of the neighboring N-SH2 domain and subsequently opens up its phosphopeptide-binding pocket to harbor a second phosphopeptide molecule. These events can weaken the auto-inhibiting interaction on the interface between the N-SH2 and PTP domains and permit the subsequent synergistic opening up of the active site of the PTP domain. This mechanism is consistent with the notion that a truncated SHP-1 lacking the C-SH2 domain would be activated to a much lesser extent than full-length SHP-1 (25Pei D. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1092-1096Google Scholar, 26Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Google Scholar). It also is envisioned that a much larger change in the relative positions of the two SH2 domains will occur due to the mobility of the C-SH2 domain when they are simultaneously bound by biphosphorylated peptides, which can lead to greater movement of the N-SH2 domain. This movement should optimize the opening up of the active site of the PTP domain and can qualitatively explain why biphosphorylated peptides can activate SHPs at a 10-fold higher level than monophosphorylated peptides (28Pluskey S. Wandless T.J. Walsh C.T. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Google Scholar). Although we have already had the basic concepts of the differentiation and cooperation of these three domains based on the crystallographic and biochemical data, many questions still remain unclear for SHPs. Sequence analysis and structural comparison have revealed highly similar primary and three-dimensional structures of these two C-terminal truncated enzymes. In addition, the C-terminal truncated SHP-1 and the C-terminal truncated SHP-2 could both be activated in an identical manner to their corresponding wild-type enzymes. Nevertheless, although both have the similar phosphorylation sites, the C-terminal tails (∼66 residues) of the full-length SHPs share very low sequence homology (<15%), in contrast to the overall high homology (60%). Biochemical and immunological studies showed that the tails are associated with the lipid-binding and subcellular localization of these enzymes (29Craggs G. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23719-23725Google Scholar, 30Frank C. Keilhack H. Opitz F. Zschornig O. Bohmer F.-D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11993-12002Google Scholar). Therefore, further crystallographic and biochemical studies will be required to understand how the tails regulate the functions of these enzymes and how to cooperate with the other three domains."
https://openalex.org/W2067184505,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) show differential effects upon ERα activation function 1 (AF-1). Tamoxifen allows strong ERα AF-1 activity, whereas raloxifene allows less and ICI 182,780 (ICI) allows none. Here, we show that blockade of corepressor histone de-acetylase (HDAC) activity reverses the differential inhibitory effect of SERMs upon AF-1 activity in MCF-7 cells. This suggests that differential SERM repression of AF-1 involves HDAC-dependent corepressors. Consistent with this, ICI and raloxifene are more potent than tamoxifen in promoting ERα-dependent sequestration of progesterone receptor-associated corepressors. Moreover, ICI and raloxifene are more efficient than tamoxifen in promoting ERα binding to the corepressor N-CoR <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. An ERα mutation (537X) that increases N-CoR binding in the presence of all SERMs blocks AF-1 activity. An ERα mutation (L379R) that decreases N-CoR binding increases AF-1 activity in the presence of ICI and raloxifene and reverses the effect of the 537X mutation. The 537X and L379R mutations also alter the ligand preference of ERα action at AP-1 sites and C3 complement, an action that also involves AF-1. Together, our results suggest that differential SERM effects on corepressor binding can explain differences in SERM effects on ERα activity. We propose a model for differential effects of SERMs on N-CoR binding."
https://openalex.org/W2058845682,"Increased mammary epithelial expression of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene is associated with the acquisition of pathological proliferation. We report here that autocrine hGH production by human mammary carcinoma cells increased the expression and transcriptional activity of the homeobox domain containing protein HOXA1. Forced expression of HOXA1 in human mammary carcinoma cells resulted in increased total cell number primarily by the promotion of cell survival mediated by the transcriptional up-regulation of Bcl-2. HOXA1 also abrogated the apoptotic response of mammary carcinoma cells to doxorubicin. Forced expression of HOXA1 in mammary carcinoma cells, in a Bcl-2-dependent manner, resulted in dramatic enhancement of anchorage-independent proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Finally, forced expression of HOXA1 was sufficient to result in the oncogenic transformation of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells with aggressive in vivo tumor formation. Herein, we have therefore provided a molecular mechanism by which autocrine hGH stimulation of human mammary epithelial cells may result in oncogenic transformation."

Both the half-life and transactivation function of HIF-1α are regulated by changes in the cellular oxygen level, whereas HIF-1β remains mostly unaffected (1Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Nevertheless, revelation of crystal structures of FIH-1 and HIF-1-PH is very important in understanding oxygen-dependent regulation of HIF-1, because these two enzymes serve as oxygen sensors in the hypoxia response pathway. Here we report the crystal structure of human FIH-1, one of the two oxygen sensors. The structural core of FIH-1 consists of a β-barrel like other members of the 2OG-dependent dioxygenase family. In comparison to other family members, the structure of FIH-1 shows several distinctive features such as a unique cofactor-binding site in the wide-opened active site pocket, a dimerization domain at the C terminus, and a long and wide groove at the center of the molecule ranging from the active site of the enzyme toward the dimerization domain. The structure-based interpretation of previous biochemical analyses suggests a mechanism of hypoxia regulation by utilizing a multicomponent complex made of FIH-1, HIF-1, and VHL. The gene for FIH-1 was amplified by PCR from human colon cDNA library (Clontech) using 5′-gga att cca tat ggc ggc gac agc ggc gga gg-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-cta tgg atc ctg gca gga ggc ctt gac ccc-3′ as a reverse primer and cloned intoNdeI/BamHI restriction sites of pET-28a vector (Novagen). The N-terminal His6-tagged FIH-1 fusion protein containing the full-length of FIH-1 (residues 1–349) was overexpressed from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen). After removal of the N-terminal tag by cleavage with thrombin, FIH-1 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and concentration was determined using ε280 = 1.69 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 in 6 mguanidine. FIH-1 (apo form) was crystallized at 25 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Tetragonal crystals were obtained in drops containing 1.8 μl of protein solution (20 mg/ml) and 1.8 μl of reservoir solution (0.4m lithium sulfate, 20% PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5). The crystals belonged to the P41212 space group with unit cell dimensions of a =b = 86.89 Å and c = 143.42 Å. Crystals grown from selenomethionyl-derivatized protein was used for the MAD data collection at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamline 6B. Data collected at three wavelengths (peak, edge, and remote) were processed and scaled with the program DENZO and SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar). Seven selenium sites out of eight expected sites were located by the program SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), and heavy atom parameters were refined by the program SHARP (27de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The phases were subsequently improved by solvent-flattening using the program DM (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Data collected at the edge wavelength were used in the refinement. The model was built in the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The overall fold of FIH-1 is composed of a central β-barrel surrounded by eight α-helices with an approximate dimension of 60 × 45 × 35 Å (Fig.1 a). The structure of FIH-1 reveals two discrete domains. Domain I runs from N terminus to residue 300 and is mainly composed of the central β-barrel (sheet 1, β2–β7, β9, β12, and β14; sheet 2, β1, β8, β10, β11, and β13) and six α-helices (α1–α6) surrounding them. Domain II (residues 301–349) comprising two consecutive α-helices (α7 and α8) stretches away from domain I. Domain II, which is completely missing in all known structures of the dioxygenase family, forms strong interactions with the same region of the 2-fold symmetry related molecule (Fig. 1 b). It is further stabilized by interactions with helix α6. Dimeric association of FIH-1 revealed by the crystal structure was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering experiments (data not shown). Dimeric interface, which is predominantly composed of hydrophobic interactions, buries 1,516 Å2 that corresponds to 8.7% of the total surface of the FIH-1 monomer. Despite low sequence homology, the overall structure of FIH-1 is similar to those of other 2OG-dependent oxygenases as proposed based on the conservation of the signature motif residues (13Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

In a search for homologous structures by using the Dali server, seven members of the 2OG-dependent oxygenases including clavaminic acid synthase (CAS), isopenicillin synthase, and anthocyanidin synthase were identified with similar z-values ranging from 9.0 to 7.0. Structural similarities are mainly found in the central β-barrel region. When we aligned the structure of FIH-1 with that of CAS, 103 Cα atoms were superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 2.50 Å (Fig. 2). Although there are good alignments in the region of the central β-barrel region, the arrangements of α-helices are quite different and cannot be aligned to each other well. Other differences in the structure of FIH-1 include the long insertions in N- and C-terminal regions (Fig.2). Substantial differences are also found in several loops and α-helices in the middle of the protein. Previous investigations have demonstrated a strict requirement of FIH-1 for ferrous ion and 2OG (13Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J.

At the center of the β-barrel structure of FIH-1, there is a big cavity that is lined with the residues implicated in coordinating a ferrous ion (His-199, Asp-201, and His-279), termed the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad (Fig. 3,a and b; Fig.4 a). In one side of the facial triad, there is an opening that is spacious enough to accommodate the cofactor, 2OG. Side chains of the facial triad residues are aligned as if they were coordinating a ferrous ion, despite that the FIH-1 structure is in apo state (Fig. 3 a). Positions of the triad residues in FIH-1 match well with those of CAS (Fig. 3 a). Consistent with the crystal structure, mutation of either His-199 or Asp-201 to Ala impaired the FIH-1 activity (14Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The facial triad residues are highly exposed to the solvent due to the wide opening of the pocket entrance (∼15 Å wide, Fig 4 a). In CAS the entrance of pocket is blocked by three extended loops (residues 111–117, 131–135, and 202–205 in CAS), allowing only small molecule substrates to enter the active site. The wide-opened pocket entrance of FIH-1 indicates that the substrate may have a helical conformation rather than an extended strand (see below).Figure 4The putative binding sites for HIF-1 α and VHL. a, the electrostatic potential surface of FIH-1 is presented with the docked peptide representing the region near the hydroxylation site of HIF-1α CAD. Positive and negative potentials are colored blue andred, respectively. In the figure, an ideal α-helical polyalanine model (13 residues) was manually docked on the prominent groove near the active site of FIH-1. The facial triad residues (His-199, Asp-201, and His-279) in the active site also are shown in the figure. b, the putative HIF-1α CAD- and VHL-binding sites are represented on a ribbon diagram of FIH-1 with the same orientation as a. Two parts of the N-terminal 126 residues were colored differently (residues 12–88, pink; residues 89–126, orange). The rest of the molecule is colored gray. The α-helical polyalanine model docked in the putative substrate-binding groove and the facial triad residues are shown as in a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whereas conformations of the facial triad residues are highly conserved between FIH-1 and other 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, the putative binding site for 2OG in FIH-1 is substantially different from that in other 2OG-dependent dioxygenases. In CAS, 5-carboxylate of 2OG is bound to the charged side chain of Arg-293 that is highly conserved in 2OG-dependent dioxygenases (2Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 37Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar). Arg-281 and Arg-297 also are positioned near the 5-carboxylate, contributing to the binding of 2OG. However, in FIH-1, those arginines are replaced with hydrophobic or non-ionic residues such as Thr-290, Ile-281, and Asn-294 (Fig. 2). Instead, side chain of Lys-214 protruding from different secondary structural element (strand β10 of sheet 1) appears to be involved in the binding of 2OG. Although the Cα position of Lys-214 is different from that of Arg-293 of CAS, the charged moiety of Lys-214 is located at the similar position as that of CAS (Fig. 3 a). Lys-214 is completely conserved in the subfamily members of FIH-1 from various species (14Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), supporting its possible role in the FIH-1 activity by coordinating 2OG. The most prominent feature in the FIH-1 structure is a distinctive groove that extends from the active site toward the interconnecting loop between domains I and II (loop D1–D2) (Fig. 4, a and b). The groove, being ∼15 Å wide and ∼40 Å long, is lined mainly by residues from helix α7, loop D1–D2, and strands β7 and β14. In CAS, the region corresponding to the FIH-1 groove is occupied by several loop structures (residues 111–117, residues 148–153, residues 202–205, and residues 317–324 in CAS). The groove surface consists of many hydrophobic residues and is wide enough to accommodate a single α-helix (Fig. 4, a and b). Recently, NMR structures for the complex of the CH1 domain of P300 with the HIF-1α CAD were reported (38Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 39Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In the complex structures, residues preceding the hydroxylation site, Asn-803 has an α-helical conformation. Thus, we propose that the long groove found in the FIH-1 structure serves as the binding site for HIF-1α CAD. Previous analyses (12Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar) suggested that the HIF-binding site is located at the C-terminal region of FIH-1, consistent with the location of the putative helix-binding groove revealed from the structure. The VHL-binding site is located N-terminal (until residue 126) to the HIF-binding site (12Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). In the FIH-1 structure, the N-terminal 126 residues are divided into two structural segments that overlap the core of the protein from opposite sides (Fig. 4 b). The first segment comprising the N-terminal 89 residues lies at the opposite side of the active site, whereas the second segment (residues 90–126) is positioned at the entrance of active site. The second segment is close to the putative binding site for HIF-1α CAD (Fig. 4 b), indicating that there may be a steric hindrance if VHL were to bind to the second segment. Thus, VHL is likely to bind FIH-1 by utilizing the first segment, and FIH-1 may act as a bridge in the interaction between VHL and HIF1α CAD (Fig. 5). Consistent with this structural implication, VHL interacts with HIF-1α CAD in the presence but not in the absence of FIH-1 (12Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The FIH-1 structure suggests a mechanism for the physiological regulation of the HIF-1 activity by revealing three-dimensional locations of regions in FIH-1 that are implicated in the interactions with HIF-1α CAD and VHL. The distinctive binding sites for HIF-1α CAD and VHL on the surface of FIH-1 support the possibility of the ternary complex and indicate that the cooperative binding of the three proteins may be required in the hydroxylation of HIF-1α CAD by FIH-1 (Fig. 5). Previous analyses reported that FIH-1 was active under hypoxic conditions despite its expected role as an oxygen sensor, whereas the activity of HIF-1-PH was suppressed in hypoxia (2Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 12Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 14Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). This implies that the FIH-1 active site itself may not act as a direct oxygen sensor. Instead, the oxygen dependence of the hydroxylation by FIH-1 may be due to its substrate recognition mechanism that requires a complex formation with VHL and HIF-1α. In normoxia, VHL binds to the HIF-1α ODD domain through the hydroxyproline and then recruits FIH-1 around HIF-1α CAD for the hydroxylation of Asn-803, whereas in hypoxia, FIH-1 cannot bind the substrate due to the absence of the HIF-1α-bound VHL. The dimerization of FIH-1 may lead to the formation of a large complex that includes two molecules of HIF-1α and VHL as well as various histone deacetylases (Fig. 5). The multimerization-dependent regulation of FIH-1 activity may have an advantage for the HIF-1α regulation by providing sequential checks for the cellular oxygen level by using different mechanisms. Appropriate hypoxia responses are important in overcoming oxygen and nutrient deficiency during hypoxic states in ischemic diseases such as stroke and cardiovascular diseases. The crystal structure of FIH-1 reveals critical information about the active site of the enzyme such as the wide-opened entrance for the catalytic site and a distinctive 2OG-binding site. These characteristic features would be an aid in designing specific drugs that can inhibit the enzyme activity and promote the hypoxia-inducible responses in ischemic diseases. The prominent groove near the active site, which is likely the HIF-1α CAD-binding site, may also be exploited for the design of inhibitors. We thank Drs. S.-S. Cha, K.-H. Kim, and H.-S.

The three-dimensional structure of a synthetic version of the two-disulfide intermediate of kalata B1 in which Ala residues replace the reduced Cys residues provides a structural insight into why the two-disulfide intermediate is a kinetic trap on the folding pathway. The cyclotide family comprises macrocyclic peptides that are ∼30 residues in length and incorporate a knotted topology of disulfide bonds formed between six conserved cysteine residues (1Craik D.J.

Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar). The major structural features of the motif are a cyclic backbone, a distorted triple stranded β-sheet and a cystine knot arrangement of the three disulfide bonds. The cystine knot comprises an embedded ring formed by disulfide bonds I–IV and II–V that is threaded by the III–VI disulfide bond. This knotted topology was originally determined for kalata B1 using NMR data (11Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Google Scholar) but the corresponding disulfide connectivity of other members of the cyclotide family has since been confirmed by synthetic methods involving directed disulfide bond formation (7Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Chiu K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8913-8918Google Scholar, 15Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Yu Q. Development of Novel Antimicrobial Agents: Emerging Strategies. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2001: 215-240Google Scholar). Despite this, a recent study based primarily on analysis of local NOE patterns (16Skjeldal L. Gran L. Sletten K. Volkman B.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 142-148Google Scholar) suggested that an alternative, non-knotted disulfide bonding pattern may be possible for kalata B1. The present study provides additional evidence in favor of the originally proposed knotted topology. The first cyclotides discovered fell into two distinct subfamilies based on sequence similarities within, but not between, the subfamilies. These were termed the Möbius and bracelet subfamilies based on topological considerations (1Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Google Scholar), and comprised peptides isolated from the Rubiaceae and Violaceae plant families. A third subfamily has now been proposed based on a determination of the three-dimensional structure of MCoTI-II (13Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Google Scholar). This macrocyclic trypsin inhibitor was discovered in the seeds of a plant from the Cucurbitaceae, or squash, family (10Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Chiche L. Nguyen T.M. Andrieu J.P. Heitz A. Trinh Hong T. Pham T.T. Le Nguyen D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5722-5730Google Scholar), and its structure contains the CCK motif (13Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Google Scholar, 14Heitz A. Hernandez J.F. Gagnon J. Hong T.T. Pham T.T. Nguyen T.M. Le-Nguyen D. Chiche L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7973-7983Google Scholar) seen in the previously reported cyclotides despite having no sequence homology except for the six cysteine residues. Acyclic forms of squash trypsin inhibitors have been known for many years and include EETI-II (17Favel A. Mattras H. Coletti-Previero M.A. Zwilling R. Robinson E.A. Castro B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 33: 202-208Google Scholar) and CMTI-I (18Wieczorek M. Otlewski J. Cook J. Parks K. Leluk J. Wilimowska-Pelc A. Polanowski A. Wilusz T. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 646-652Google Scholar). The structures (19Heitz A. Chiche L. Le Nguyen D. Castro B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2392-2398Google Scholar, 20Bode W. Greyling H.J. Huber R. Otlewski J. Wilusz T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 285-292Google Scholar) of these molecules are very similar to that determined for MCoTI-II, apart from the cyclic backbone. Interestingly, no acyclic forms of the cyclotides from the Rubiaceae and Violaceae plant families have been found. A sequence comparison of kalata B1, MCoTI-II, and EETI-II is given in Fig. 1 and illustrates the common cystine knot motif in the three molecules. Fig. 1 also defines and highlights the diversity of the backbone loops, defined as the regions between successive Cys residues in these peptides. Owing to their cyclic nature kalata B1 and MCoTI-II have six loops while the acyclic homologue EETI-II has five loops. In the current study it was of interest to compare the oxidative folding of kalata B1 with those of linear cystine knot peptides such as EETI-II because they have some interesting topological similarities and differences. The cyclotides have recently been shown to be translated gene products (9Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Google Scholar) that are processed from linear precursor proteins; however, the mechanism of cyclization, and the folding pathways required to achieve the correct three-dimensional shape and disulfide bond connectivity are yet to be elucidated. Examination of the gene sequence suggests that loop 6 is where cyclization occurs and this is consistent with expectations based on a sequence comparison of cyclotides with acyclic cystine knot proteins such as EETI-II (Fig. 1). Effectively, loop 6 may be regarded as the linker region that is clasped together to form the cyclic peptide backbone. The cyclic nature and knotted topology of the cyclotides gives them remarkable stability and there is much interest in determining how the unique knotted fold is formed. We have previously shown that prior cyclization of kalata B1 appears to facilitate oxidative folding into the native conformation (6Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Google Scholar). An acyclic form of kalata B1 required a hydrophobic solution environment to produce significant amounts of the correctly folded form, whereas the cyclic form folded efficiently into the native isomer in aqueous solution. We have also explored the importance of the cyclic backbone in the folding of cyclotides by synthesizing all of the topologically distinct acyclic permutants (21Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19068-19075Google Scholar). This is equivalent to opening the backbone of kalata B1 in each of the six loops between successive Cys residues. We found that four of six permutants folded into native-like conformations, but two did not; these were precisely the two that involved breaking the embedded ring of the cystine knot. That study showed that a native-like fold can be produced without the cyclic backbone, but highlighted the importance of the cystine knot in forming the native conformation. In the current study we have examined the oxidative refolding and reductive unfolding of kalata B1 and characterized a major folding intermediate. The properties of this intermediate, when compared with a topologically similar intermediate characterized for EETI-II (22Le-Nguyen D. Heitz A. Chiche L. El Hajji M. Castro B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 165-174Google Scholar), reveal fundamental differences in the folding pathways of cystine knot proteins with cyclic backbones relative to those with conventional, acyclic, backbones. Part of the study required the synthesis of a mutant in which a single disulfide bond is removed and we show that this adopts a native-like fold, consistent with expectations from the identified folding intermediate. Kalata B1 was extracted from the above ground parts of Oldenlandia affinis with dichloromethane/methanol (1:1; v/v) overnight at room temperature. The extract was partitioned with chloroform and water and the water/methanol layer concentrated on a rotary evaporator prior to lyophilization. The dried product was re-dissolved in H2O and purified using preparative RP-HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac) at 8 ml/min. Masses were analyzed using an ES-TOF Micromass LCT mass spectrometer. Kalata B1 (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, containing varying concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP (0.5–300 mm). To monitor the unfolding, aliquots were removed at various time intervals and quenched with 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed using RP-HPLC and LCMS. A large-scale reduction was performed for the subsequent oxidative refolding experiments. Kalata B1 was reduced with an excess of DTT (1m) in ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) at room temperature for 2 h. The reduced material was purified on semi-preparative RP-HPLC at 3 ml/min. Large scale refolding reactions were performed in 50% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 and 1 mm reduced glutathione. To isolate the folding intermediate the refolding reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min and then immediately purified on a semi-preparative reverse phase column. Following purification the fractions were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Small scale reactions were performed under various solution conditions and analyzed by RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry. [Ala1,15]Kalata B1 was synthesized using a native chemical ligation strategy. This methodology requires the synthesis of a linear precursor peptide containing an N-terminal Cys residue. This forms a thioester with a functionalized C terminus and subsequently undergoes an S,N acyl migration to form a native peptide bond in the resultant circular protein. Of the four possible Cys residues in the di-Ala mutant peptide, Cys5was chosen as the N-terminal residue. The linear precursor was synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis with BOC/HBTU chemistry and cleaved from the resin with HF. The cyclization reaction was performed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) with an excess of TCEP over a period of ∼30 min. The cyclic reduced precursor was then oxidized in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 50% v/v isopropyl alcohol and 1 mm reduced glutathione at room temperature overnight. The peptide was purified as described above.

D2O (99.9% and 99.99%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA. Spectra were recorded at 290 and 298 K on a Bruker ARX-500 or Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer equipped with a shielded gradient unit. two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the t 1 dimension (23Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Google Scholar). The two-dimensional experiments consisted of a TOCSY (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn.

Solvent suppression was achieved using a modified WATERGATE sequence (29Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired over 6024 Hz with 4096 complex data points in F2 and 512 increments in the F1 dimension.3JNH-Hα coupling constants were measured from a one-dimensional spectrum or from the DQF-COSY spectrum. Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station using XWINNMR (Bruker) software. The t 1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 real data points, and 90° phase-shifted sine bell window functions were applied prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were referenced internal sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulponate. Preliminary structures of [Ala1,15]kalata B1 were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within the program DYANA (30Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar). Final structures were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within CNS version 1.0 (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Google Scholar). The starting structures were generated using random (φ, ψ) dihedral angles and energy-minimized to produce structures with the correct local geometry. A set of 50 structures was generated by a torsion angle simulated-annealing protocol (32Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Google Scholar, 33Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 124: 154-164Google Scholar). This protocol involves a high-temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature is lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 500 steps of Powell minimization. Structures consistent with restraints were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell, as described by Linge and Nilges (34Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Google Scholar). The refinement in explicit water involves the following steps. First, heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Second, 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K before a cooling phase where the temperature is lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. Structures were analyzed using PROMOTIF (35Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (36Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). The cyclotides provide a unique opportunity to examine the folding of the cystine knot motif in the presence of a constrained backbone. In the current study we chose the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 to probe oxidative refolding and reductive unfolding. We have previously shown that reduced cyclic kalata B1 can be very efficiently refolded into the native conformation (6Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Google Scholar) under appropriate conditions. Refolding was performed in 50% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 and 1 mm reduced glutathione at room temperature overnight, and essentially only one product was obtained (6Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Google Scholar). In the current study the oxidative folding reaction was monitored by removing aliquots at selected time points and analyzing them with RP-HPLC. Fig. 2 a shows the RP-HPLC traces for a time-course carried out over 10 h for kalata B1. In contrast to what is typically observed for the refolding of most peptides native oxidized kalata B1 elutes significantly later than the reduced peptide. This is most likely because of the patch of hydrophobic residues that becomes surface exposed upon correct folding (6Daly N.L. Love S. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10606-10614Google Scholar), which provides a characteristic marker of the native folded compound. In addition to the late eluting native peak, there are several peaks that elute with retention times close to that of the reduced cyclic peptide. LCMS confirmed that these peaks correspond to partially oxidized forms but peak overlap prevented their definitive characterization. Between the two extremes of the reduced and native forms there is an additional sharp, well-resolved peak that is detectable minutes after starting the refolding reaction (intermediate IIa in Fig. 2 a). Its relatively late retention time suggests a conformation not dissimilar from the native form. To determine if the presence of this well resolved folding intermediate was dependent on the refolding conditions several oxidation reactions were performed under various solution conditions (results not shown). Oxidation of reduced, cyclic kalata B1 in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate alone produces a small amount of the well-resolved intermediate and native peptide within 15 min. The percentage of the native product is markedly increased in the presence of reduced glutathione. Inclusion of guanidine hydrochloride in the buffer prevented folding into the native conformation and there was also no evidence for the folding intermediate. These results suggest that reduced glutathione aids refolding by allowing disulfide shuffling, while denaturing agents prevent native-like interactions that are required for folding to occur. Folding intermediates for model disulfide-rich peptides such as BPTI and lysozyme have been extensively studied (37Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Google Scholar,38van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Mateo P.L. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4794-4803Google Scholar). It has been shown that quenching oxidative folding reactions with acid does not result in significant intramolecular disulfide rearrangement even after delays of several hours (38van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Mateo P.L. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4794-4803Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, we used an acid quench method in our studies to prevent disulfide rearrangement. Large scale oxidative refolding reactions were used to purify the folding intermediate of kalata B1. Reactions were left for ∼15 min, quenched with acid and then immediately purified using semi-preparative RP-HPLC. The early eluting intermediates were not purified to homogeneity and the main focus was on the well resolved intermediate. This intermediate was purified, and an accurate molecular mass (2894 ± 0.1 Da) was determined using electrospray mass spectrometry. The molecular mass was consistent with a peptide with two disulfide bonds intact and one bond reduced. The reductive unfolding of kalata B1 was examined using both DTT and TCEP as reducing agents in the presence and absence of isopropyl alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol did not appear to influence the reactions. The reactions performed at various concentrations of DTT (5–100 mm) at pH 8.5 essentially show only reduced and fully oxidized species with no significant accumulation of any partially reduced species (Fig.2 b). However, lowering the pH to 4.5 and using TCEP (5–300 mm) as the reductant revealed the presence of minor components along the unfolding pathway (Fig. 2 c). LCMS analysis allowed determination of the mass of the two most abundant intermediates shown in Fig. 2 c, which correspond to a one-disulfide (Ia) and a two-disulfide (IIb) species. A very minor peak was consistently observed in the reductive unfolding at the retention time observed for intermediate IIa. Isolation of this peak from RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry confirmed that the mass was consistent with intermediate IIa. To further characterize the intermediate IIa the peak was isolated from RP-HPLC and examined using NMR spectroscopy. A TOCSY spectrum was recorded immediately after dissolution in 10% 2H2O/90% H2O and revealed a very well dispersed spectrum consistent with a single solution conformation. A NOESY spectrum recorded later had lower signal intensity than that expected based on the signal intensity of the TOCSY spectrum. This appears to be a result of the sample aggregating over time and was confirmed by re-recording additional one-dimensional spectra. A one-dimensional spectrum recorded immediately after dissolution of the sample and one recorded 24 h later highlights the changes that occur (Fig.3 a). Despite the instability of the sample there was still sufficient information gained from the TOCSY/NOESY spectra to assign the peaks in IIa (Fig. 3 b). A comparison of the αH chemical shifts of the intermediate with the native peptide is shown in Fig.4 a and reveals that IIa has a native-like structure. The only significant differences occur near residue Cys 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cyclic cystine knot; DTT, dithiothreitol; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; LCMS, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; TOCSY, two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy; ECOSY, exclusive correlation spectroscopy; WATERGATE, water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation; RMSD, root mean square deviation, suggesting that the disulfide bond involving this residue is perturbed (absent) in the intermediate. An analysis of the βH chemical shift differences between the native kalata B1 and IIa further confirmed the identity of the reduced cysteine residues. The separation of the β-proton chemical shifts (Δδβ) for four of the six cysteine residues is very similar in the native peptide and in IIa (Fig. 4 b). However, Cys 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cyclic cystine knot; DTT, dithiothreitol; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; LCMS, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; TOCSY, two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy; ECOSY, exclusive correlation spectroscopy; WATERGATE, water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation; RMSD, root mean square deviation and Cys15 are both affected significantly.

Furthermore, the direction of the change,i.e. toward a decreased chemical shift separation suggests a less structured local conformation. Thus, it appears that IIa contains a native-like structure with the two native disulfide bonds Cys5–Cys17 and Cys10–Cys22 intact, but with Cys 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cyclic cystine knot; DTT, dithiothreitol; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performan"
https://openalex.org/W2029453778,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor, which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPARα mediates the carcinogenic effects of peroxisome proliferators in rodents. In humans, PPARα plays a fundamental role in regulating energy homeostasis via control of lipid metabolism. To study the possible role of chaperone proteins in the regulation of PPARα activity, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) was made against PPARα and designated as 3B6/PPAR. The specificity of mAb 3B6/PPAR in recognizing PPARα was tested in immunoprecipitations using in vitrotranslated PPAR subtypes. The mAb 3B6/PPAR recognized PPARα, failed to bind to PPARβ or PPARγ, and is efficient in both immunoprecipitating and visualizing the receptor on protein blots. The immunoprecipitation of PPARα in mouse liver cytosol using mAb 3B6/PPAR has resulted in the detection of two co-immunoprecipitated proteins, which are heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and the hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP2). The concomitant depletion of PPARα in hsp90-depleted mouse liver cytosol was also detected. Complex formation between XAP2 and PPARα/FLAG was also demonstrated in an in vitro translation binding assay. hsp90 interacts with PPARα in a mammalian two-hybrid assay and binds to the E/F domain. Transient expression of XAP2 co-expressed with PPARα resulted in down-regulation of a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven reporter gene activity. Taken together, these results indicate that PPARα is in a complex with hsp90 and XAP2, and XAP2 appears to function as a repressor. This is the first demonstration that PPARα is stably associated with other proteins in tissue extracts and the first nuclear receptor shown to functionally interact with XAP2."

Motulsky A.G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 274: 1049-1057Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated that smoking, excessive drinking of alcohol, obesity, type II diabetes, and an unhealthy diet contribute to mild hyperhomocysteinemia (1Robinson K. Carmel R. Jacobson D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 371-383Google Scholar, 2Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygård O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Google Scholar). In addition, elevated plasma Hcy has recently been linked to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment in the elderly (4Clarke R. Smith A.D. Jobst K.A. Refsum H. Sutton L. Ueland P.M. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 1449-1455Google Scholar, 5Selhub J. Bagely L.C. Miller J. Rosenberg I.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: S614-S620Google Scholar). Hcy is a non-protein amino acid derived from the catabolism ofS-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), an immediate product of trans-methylation reactions that utilizeS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (6Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobson D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar). Hcy has three possible fates: 1) methylation to methionine withN-5-methyltetrahydrofolate or betaine as the methyl donor, 2) conversion to cysteine via the trans-sulfuration pathway, and 3) release into extracellular fluids (e.g. plasma and urine). AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases catalyze many critical reactions including methylation of RNA, DNA, proteins, and small molecules such as guanidinoacetate and glycine (6Clarke S. Banfield K. Carmel R. Jacobson D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 63-78Google Scholar). The potential of methyltransferases to regulate plasma Hcy is not well defined. Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is a liver-specific enzyme that generates AdoHcy during the conversion of one membrane lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, into another membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC) (7Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Google Scholar). PEMT accounts for the formation of ∼30% PC made in liver (8DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Google Scholar, 9Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Google Scholar). With this large capacity for PC synthesis and the generation of three AdoHcy molecules for each PC molecule synthesized, we hypothesized that the PEMT reaction might contribute significantly to Hcy in plasma. We have utilized thePemt −/− mouse, hepatocytes derived from these mice, and overexpression of PEMT in McArdle RH7777 (rat hepatoma) cells to test this hypothesis. The results show that PEMT expression enhances plasma Hcy levels and the secretion of Hcy from hepatocytes. For the high fat/high cholesterol diet, a semi-purified diet lacking a fat source was purchased from Teklad (catalog number 84712, Madison, WI) and supplemented with 19% (w/w) olive oil, 1% (w/w) linseed oil (a source of essential fatty acids), and 1% (w/w) cholesterol. Rodent chow was from LabDiet (PICO Laboratory Rodent Diet 20). Hanks' balanced salt solution, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless noted otherwise. The Pemt −/− mouse colony had a mixed genetic background of 129/J and C57BL/6 mice and was maintained by homozygous breeding in a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle. At the age of 12–14 weeks, Pemt −/− andPemt +/+ mice were fed ad libitum either chow or the high fat/high cholesterol diet for 3 weeks (10Cheema S.K. Cikaluk D. Agellon L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 157-165Google Scholar). MalePemt −/− and Pemt +/+ mice (12–20-weeks old) that were fed chow were used. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion (11Davis R.A. Engelhorn S.C. Pangburn S.H. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 266: 497-509Google Scholar) and plated on 60-mm collagen-coated dishes at a density of 2.0 × 106cells/dish in DMEM containing 17% fetal bovine serum and 0.01 mg/ml insulin. After 7.5 h, the primary cultures were rinsed twice in serum-free DMEM over a 1-h period and then incubated in serum-free DMEM for 12 h ± 200 μm guanidinoacetate. Medium and cells were collected and frozen at −70 °C until analysis. The cells were re-suspended and sonicated in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride). Protein analysis was performed with the Coomassie Blue Plus protocol from Bio-Rad. McArdle RH-7777 rat hepatoma cells stably expressing human PEMT cDNA or vector alone (pCI, Promega) were maintained in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml gentamycin, and 100 μm ethanolamine. The ethanolamine was added to ensure that there was sufficient substrate for phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis so that this lipid would not be limiting for phospholipid methylation. Following a 24-h incubation period, the medium was removed, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and frozen until analysis. Livers were removed from mice and flash-frozen. The protein content of the liver samples was determined by the Biuret method (13Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Google Scholar). Thawed liver samples were homogenized in 50 mmphosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.9). The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the following enzyme activities were measured in the supernatant: cystathionine β-synthase (14Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D.

The final product of betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase, methionine, was measured by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Total Hcy content in plasma and media was measured by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection of ammonium 7-fluoro 2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate thiol adducts (12Vester B. Rasmussen K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 549-554Google Scholar). The amounts of methionine, total cysteine, serine, and glycine in media were measured in samples that had been deproteinized by treatment with 10% sulfosalicylic acid. The protein was removed by centrifugation, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.2. The amino acids were analyzed on a Beckman 121 MB amino acid analyzer using Bensond-X 0.25 Cation Xchange Resin according to Beckman 121MB-TB-O17 application notes and quantitated using a Hewlett Packard Computing Integrator Model 3395A following post-column derivatization with ninhydrin. PEMT activity was measured as described previously (19Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Google Scholar). Female and male Pemt +/+ andPemt −/− mice were fed chow or a high fat/cholesterol diet for 3 weeks. Fig. 1shows that the plasma content of Hcy in Pemt −/−mice was ∼50% less than in Pemt +/+ mice. Neither gender nor diet influenced the levels of plasma Hcy. To determine whether alterations of activities of other key hepatic enzymes of homocysteine production and removal might have caused the decreased plasma Hcy levels in Pemt −/− mice, we assayed five enzymes listed in TableI. The activities were not statistically different between Pemt −/− andPemt +/+ mice. Hence, the 50% lower level of plasma Hcy in the Pemt −/− mice is probably because of the absence of PEMT activity in the liver.Table ISpecific activities of enzymes involved in methionine and homocysteine metabolismEnzymePemt −/−Pemt +/+nmol/min/mg proteinCystathionine β-synthaseMales11.1 ± 2.411.7 ± 2.4Females13.5 ± 2.713.4 ± 1.2AdoMet synthaseMales1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.3Females0.92 ± 0.10.78 ± 0.2Methionine synthaseMales0.063 ± 0.0040.054 ± 0.015Females0.026 ± 0.0050.029 ± 0.002Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductaseMales0.027 ± 0.0060.031 ± 0.004Females0.037 ± 0.0080.033 ± 0.008Betaine:Hcy methyltransferaseMales3.7 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.3Females3.8 ± 0.33.6 ± 0.6The results are mean values ± S.D. for 3–5 animals that were fed a chow diet.

We measured the secretion of Hcy from primary hepatocytes isolated from Pemt +/+ andPemt −/− mice. Fig. 2shows that hepatocytes from Pemt −/− mice secrete ∼50% less Hcy than hepatocytes from Pemt +/+ mice. It was conceivable that the depletion of intracellular AdoMet decreased Hcy secretion from Pemt −/− hepatocytes. To test this possibility, we performed a parallel experiment in which hepatocytes were incubated with guanidinoacetate. Methylation of guanidinoacetate to form creatine is an important contributor to the exported Hcy pool (20Stead L.M. Au K.P. Jacobs R.L. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E1095-E1100Google Scholar). Therefore, if AdoMet was sufficient in the hepatocytes from Pemt −/− mice, we should observe enhanced Hcy secretion. Fig. 2 indicates that guanidinoacetate-stimulated Hcy secretion from bothPemt +/+ and Pemt −/− hepatocytes to a similar degree. Thus, apparently a lack of AdoMet seems unlikely. These results concur with previous measurements of the levels of AdoMet (∼130 pmol/mg liver) and AdoHcy (∼40 pmol/mg liver) that were similar in the livers of Pemt +/+ andPemt −/− mice (21Walkey C.J. Importance of Phospholipid Methylation.Ph.D. Thesis. University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada1997Google Scholar). We also established at the end of the incubation period that methionine, cysteine, serine, and glycine had not been depleted from the medium and therefore were not limiting Hcy secretion. Thus, AdoMet was not limiting for Hcy formation, and the decreased secretion of Hcy from Pemt −/−hepatocytes was attributed to the lack of PEMT. Plasma homocysteine is also increased in rats that were provided with dietary guanidinoacetate as is the production of homocysteine by hepatocytes incubated with guanidinoacetate (20Stead L.M. Au K.P. Jacobs R.L. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E1095-E1100Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that altered flux through another major methyltransferase can also affect homocysteine metabolism. McArdle RH-7777 hepatoma cells have negligible PEMT activity (19Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Google Scholar). We reasoned that if Hcy secretion were dependent upon PEMT activity, stable expression of PEMT in these cells would stimulate Hcy secretion. Fig. 3 confirms the low PEMT activity in parental McArdle cells and indicates that the secretion of Hcy from cells that expressed human PEMT was enhanced. We also demonstrated that methionine, cysteine, serine, and glycine had not been depleted from the medium at the end of the incubation period. If ∼50% plasma Hcy was derived from the PEMT reaction as suggested by our results, PEMT must generate significant amounts of AdoHcy in the liver. A 20-g mouse secretes ∼30 μmol (23 mg) PC into bile each day (22Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Google Scholar), and the PEMT pathway is an important source for PC in the bile (23Agellon L.B. Walkey C.J. Vance D.E. Kuipers F. Verkade H.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 725-729Google Scholar). Approximately, one-third of the PC in murine liver is derived from the PEMT pathway (8DeLong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Google Scholar, 9Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Google Scholar). Therefore, ∼10 μmol biliary PC should be produced via PEMT in 24 h. Each phosphatidylethanolamine molecule methylated to PC produces three molecules of AdoHcy. Hence, to satisfy the export of PC into bile, the murine liver produces ∼30 μmol AdoHcy in 24 h from the PEMT reaction. This estimate does not take into account the presumed sizeable requirement of PC biosynthesis for hepatocyte membranes or for export with lipoproteins. From Fig. 2, we estimated the amount of Hcy secreted from 1 g of liver over a 24-h period. Murine hepatocytes secreted 15 nmol Hcy/mg protein over a 12-h period. Assuming that a 1-g liver yields 175 mg of protein (24Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5909Google Scholar), a 1-g liver would produce 5.25 μmol Hcy/day. Although these calculations are approximations, it is clear that hepatic PEMT generates significantly more AdoHcy (>30 μmol) than Hcy (∼5 μmol) secreted from the liver each day. In addition to defining a role for PEMT in the regulation of plasma Hcy, the work also argues for a primary role of the liver in producing Hcy. All of the nucleated cells have the capacity to generate AdoHcy and probably Hcy; hence, it is difficult to determine the quantitative source of plasma Hcy. Because PEMT is quantitatively abundant only in the liver (7Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that alterations in plasma Hcy in mice are largely mediated by the liver. Moreover, the hepatic methylation of guanidinoacetate to creatine to replace urinary creatinine loss (estimated at 3–15 μmol/day in mice (25Loo G. Goodman P.J. Hill K.A. Smith J.T. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 2403-2408Google Scholar, 26Murray C.E. Warnes D.M. Ballard F.J. Tomas F.M. Clin. Sci. 1981; 61: 737-741Google Scholar)) is also considered a source of plasma Hcy. Much of what is known concerning AdoMet consumption in trans-methylation reactions is derived from the elegant studies of Muddet al. (27Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 721-735Google Scholar, 28Mudd S.H. Ebert M.H. Scriver C.R. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 707-720Google Scholar) on the balance of methyl groups in humans. These experiments estimated that creatine synthesis in the liver consumes ∼75% of available AdoMet. Of the remaining 25% AdoMet, ∼15% was estimated to be used for PC synthesis from phosphatidylethanolamine and the remaining ∼10% was estimated to be used for other trans-methylations and polyamine synthesis. In those studies, the measurement of AdoMet consumption via PEMT involved the oxidation of choline to sarcosine and the recovery of this compound in urine. When sarcosine was administered to a patient deficient in sarcosine dehydrogenase, only 60–80% was recovered in urine. Therefore, the recovery of sarcosine in the urine in these calculations underestimated its formation and, thus, the contribution of the PEMT reaction. Moreover, because many destinations require PEMT-derived PC (e.g. cellular membranes, bile secretion, lipoprotein secretion, sphingomyelin synthesis), the measurement of the oxidation of choline to sarcosine significantly underestimates the consumption of AdoMet in the PEMT reaction. Our results suggest that PC synthesis from phosphatidylethanolamine consumes substantially more AdoMet than was previously thought. Mudd et al. (27Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 721-735Google Scholar, 28Mudd S.H. Ebert M.H. Scriver C.R. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 707-720Google Scholar) note that their estimates must be revised as more data become available. It appears that such revision is now appropriate. The results demonstrate that the PEMT reaction in liver is a major source of plasma Hcy, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several studies (29Tawakol A. Omland T. Gerhard M. Wu J.T. Creager M.A. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1119-1121Google Scholar, 30Chao C.-L. Kuo T.-L. Lee Y.-T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 485-490Google Scholar) have demonstrated that hyperhomocysteinemia is detrimental to normal vascular endothelial function. Furthermore, elevated Hcy levels stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell growth and migration as well as the recruitment of monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions (31Dalton M.L. Gadson P.F. Wrenn R.W. Rosenquest T.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 703-711Google Scholar, 32Majors A. Ehrhart L.A. Pezacka E.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2074-2081Google Scholar, 33Poddar R. Sivasubramanian N.

Although Hcy enhances the development of atherosclerotic lesions, it has not been demonstrated that Hcy is a cause of atherosclerosis. Studies in patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia but without any other cardiovascular disease risk factors were shown to be at no greater risk for the disease compared with healthy individuals (35Verhoef P. Kok F.J. Klujtmans L.A. Blom H.J. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Kryssen D.A. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 132: 105-113Google Scholar). Also, neither cystathionine β-synthase nor methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase-deficient mice developed atherosclerosis until old age, even though the mice had severe homocysteinuria (36Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Google Scholar). Regardless of whether or not mild hyperhomocysteinemia causes or merely correlates with the development of cardiovascular disease, it is a strong predictor of mortality in individuals (37Chen Z. Karaplis A.C. Ackerman S.L. Pogribny I.P. Melnyk S. Lussier-Cacan S. Chen M.F. Pai A. John S.W.M. Smith R.S. Bottiglieri T. Bagely P. Selhub J. Rudnicki M.A. James S.J. Rozen R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 433-443Google Scholar). It is now shown that the PEMT reaction in the liver is a major source of plasma Hcy. A previous study (38Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Google Scholar) with hepatocytes derived fromPemt −/− mice demonstrates that PEMT is also important in regulation of the secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, high levels of which leads to cardiovascular disease. Therefore, continued research on the role of PEMT in the generation of plasma Hcy will lead to a better understanding of the possible relationship between mild hyperhomocysteinemia and other cardiovascular risk factors.

Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar, 2Janecek S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 67-97Google Scholar, 3Pujadas G. Palau J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 38-54Google Scholar). Their widespread occurrence in various organisms and the consumption of their substrates for food reserves and energy sources have led to intense interest in their biomedical properties and to major biotechnological applications in industry (4Eichler J. Biotechnol. Adv. 2001; 19: 261-278Google Scholar, 5Van der Maarel M.J. van der Veen B. Uitdehaag J.C. Leemhuis H. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 94: 137-155Google Scholar, 6Bertoldo C. Antranikian G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 151-160Google Scholar). Their value in specific industrial processes depends critically on their pH and optimal temperature, which vary depending on the organism of origin. Nearly all α-amylases belong to class-13 of glycosylhydrolases by virtue of their characteristic sequence motifs. However, in general, their overall sequence similarity is low, which, for some members, falls below the 10% level (1Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar, 2Janecek S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 67-97Google Scholar, 3Pujadas G. Palau J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 38-54Google Scholar, 7Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Google Scholar). A number of crystal structures of class-13 members have been solved, comprising α-amylases from organisms inhabiting environments that span a large temperature range, from psychrophilic to hyperthermophilic (3Pujadas G. Palau J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 38-54Google Scholar). These α-amylases share a common three-domain fold with the catalytic activity located on the C-terminal face of a central (βα)8-barrel, domain A. The sequences of the other two domains, B and C, are void of any conserved motifs and are not involved directly in substrate catalysis. Besides the recently solved three-dimensional structure of the glycosyltrehalose trehalosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricusKm1 that exhibits α-amylase activity (8Feese M.D. Kato Y. Tamada T. Kato M. Komeda T. Miura Y. Hirose M. Hondo K. Kobayashi K. Kuroki R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 451-464Google Scholar), no other structures of archael class-13 α-amylases are known to date. The α-amylase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus woesei(PWA), 1The abbreviations used are: PWA, P. woesei α-amylase; PIXE, proton-induced x-ray emission; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ac, acarbose; BLA, B. licheniformis α-amylase 1The abbreviations used are: PWA, P. woesei α-amylase; PIXE, proton-induced x-ray emission; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ac, acarbose; BLA, B. licheniformis α-amylase which is identical to that from Pyrococcus furiosus (9Vieille C. Zeikus J.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Google Scholar), was cloned and classified as a class-13 glycosylhydrolase (10Jorgensen S. Vorgias C.E. Antranikian G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16335-16342Google Scholar). Throughout this study, both the α-amylases of P. woesei and P. furiosuswill be referred to as PWA. Biochemical characterization of recombinant PWA revealed a high thermal stability and maximum catalytic activity at ∼100 °C (10Jorgensen S. Vorgias C.E. Antranikian G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16335-16342Google Scholar, 11Dong G. Vieille C. Savchenko A. Zeikus J.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3569-3576Google Scholar, 12Linden A. Niehaus F. Antranikian G. J. Chromatogr. 2000; 737: 253-259Google Scholar). In a recent study using coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, it was shown that PWA binds calcium and zinc stoichiometrically and with high affinity (13Savchenko A. Vieille C. Kang S. Zeikus J.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6193-6201Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to many other α-amylases, PWA activity does not require the addition of metal ions. Due to its superior properties, exceeding those of α-amylases currently employed in commercial preparations (5Van der Maarel M.J. van der Veen B. Uitdehaag J.C. Leemhuis H. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 94: 137-155Google Scholar, 14Niehaus F. Bertoldo C. Kähler M. Antranikian G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 711-729Google Scholar), PWA has become a prime candidate for maximizing the efficiency of applications in the starch industry. To reveal the molecular basis of its properties, we solved the x-ray structure of PWA in the presence of three different active site ligands. The structure reveals a novel (Ca,Zn)-binding site in close proximity to the active site cleft, which is not found in α-amylases of any bacteria, plants, and most other Archaea. The presence of this site indicates adaptive evolution of PWA to the specific living conditions of P. woesei. The three complex structures also show how competitive binding of organic compounds and zinc provides a direct molecular explanation as to why a molar excess of zinc or some chemically related metals inhibits PWA activity. The wild-type gene encoding PWA was amplified by PCR using primers deduced from the open reading frame of the P. furiosus wild-type α-amylase gene (10Jorgensen S. Vorgias C.E. Antranikian G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16335-16342Google Scholar). An NcoI recognition site (underlined) was fused to the 5′-end of the sense primer (5′-CAT GCC ATG GAC ATA AAG AAA TTA ACA CCC CTC-3′), as was an XhoI recognition site (underlined) to the antisense primer (5′-GGC CTC GAGTCA CCC AAC ACC ACA ATA ACT CCA-3′). Additionally, the natural GTG start codon was replaced with the Escherichia coli start codon ATG (boldface). The PCR product was digested twice withNcoI/XhoI and cloned into theNcoI/XhoI cloning site of the pET-15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate the plasmid pPWA. pPWA was cloned and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (15Studier F. Moffat B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) as described previously (12Linden A. Niehaus F. Antranikian G. J. Chromatogr. 2000; 737: 253-259Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence is identical to the α-amylase gene from P. furiosus (10Jorgensen S. Vorgias C.E. Antranikian G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16335-16342Google Scholar) and to the P. woesei amylase sequence released to the NCBI Protein Database by Lu et al. 2C. Lu, J. Weizheng, and Y. Yunyan, unpublished data. The recombinant α-amylase gene product was purified from catalytically active inclusion bodies (12Linden A. Niehaus F. Antranikian G. J. Chromatogr. 2000; 737: 253-259Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 0.12m Britton and Robinson buffer (pH 12) and purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). The protein was eluted in 0.02 m triethanolamine containing 30% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol (pH 7.2). Fractions containing amylolytic activity at 99 °C were pooled and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 prep-grade column. The amylase was eluted in 0.02 m triethanolamine (pH 7.2) and concentrated to a final concentration of 5.5 mg/ml in an Amicon ultrafiltration device (Millipore Corp., Eschborn, Germany). The concentration of the enzyme preparation was determined by estimating the extinction coefficient according to the method of Gill and von Hippel (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). The metal content of isolated PWA was determined by detection of the proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) at the Leipzig 2 MeV proton microprobe (17Butz T. Flagmeyer R.H. Heitmann J. Jamieson D.N. Legge G.J.F. Lehmann D. Reibetanz U. Reinert T. Saint A. Spemann D. Szymanski R. Troger W. Vogt J. Zhu J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods B. 2000; 161: 323-327Google Scholar). Using this technique, all elements besides those lighter than sodium can be detected in a single scan at a minimum weight limit of ∼1–10 ppm. The measurements were calibrated using the nine sulfur atoms of the PWA sequence (five cysteines and four methionines) as an internal standard. Protein samples were dialyzed extensively against Chelex 100-treated buffer composed of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 12) to remove chloride and sulfur compounds that disturb the protein sulfur signal. The samples (∼2 μl, 1 mg/ml) were dropped onto sample holders covered with a 0.9 μm polyethylene terephthalate foil. A sample area of ∼1 mm2 was scanned with the proton microbeam, and the characteristic x-rays were detected using a germanium detector. A total charge of ∼0.17 coulomb was applied within 20 min, ensuring that no elemental loss (sulfur or metals) due to thermal stress occurred, which would otherwise have changed the x-ray signal intensity. The number of metals per molecule was calculated from their calibrated signals with reference to the calibrated sulfur signal. The overall accuracy was estimated by taking into account the statistical errors of the x-ray yield and the uncertainty in the correction for x-ray absorption within the sample. Purified recombinant PWA was crystallized at a concentration of 5.5 mg/ml by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. PWA·Zn was grown from 1 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5) containing 0.01 mZn2(SO4)·7H2O and 25% (v/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 at 19 °C. The PWA·Ac/Zn complex was grown from 1 μl of acarbose solution (11 mg/ml), 1 μl of protein solution, and 1 μl of 0.1 msodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) containing 0.05 mZn(OAc)2 and 35% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol at 25 °C. The PWA·Tris complex was crystallized from 1 μl of acarbose solution (11 mg/ml), 1 μl of protein solution, and 1 μl of 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) containing 0.05 mMgCl2 and 40% (v/v) ethanol. A heavy atom derivative suitable for crystallographic phase determination was obtained by soaking PWA·Zn in a solution containing 29% (v/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 and 1.0 mm CH3HgCl for 1.5 h at 19 °C prior to x-ray data collection. Each x-ray data collection was performed with one single crystal using 27% (v/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 as a cryoprotectant for PWA·Zn. For PWA·Tris, 40% (v/v) ethanol and 31.5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400 were used as a cryoprotectant. For PWA·Ac/Zn, no transfer into a cryoprotectant was carried out. All crystals were mounted onto nylon cryo-loops (Hampton Research, Riverside, CA) and shock-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray data sets for the PWA·Zn, PWA·Ac/Zn, and PWA·Tris complexes were recorded up to 2.2-, 2.0-, and 1.5-Å resolution, respectively. An anomalous diffraction data set to 2.5-Å resolution was collected from a PWA mercury derivative isoform at a wavelength above the L-III adsorption edge of mercury. Further data statistics are presented in Table I. The data were processed, merged, and scaled using the HKL program suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

From three major binding sites, initial phases were calculated and refined using SHARP (20De la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Google Scholar) up to 2.5-Å resolution. Phases were improved by solvent flattening with SHARP. An initial map calculated in CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) was used to build the model of the molecule using the interactive graphics program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The model was traced with the help of Bacillus licheniformisα-amylase (BLA) as a template. The final model was built in a consecutive cycle of crystallographic refinement using CNS and manual rebuilding. A total number of 25,967 reflections in the resolution range of 20–2.22 Å were included in the refinement, with 3.8% (995 reflections) set aside for cross-validation (23Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Google Scholar). The initialR-value was 44.2%, and the free R-factor was 42.1%. After several cycles of positional and restrained individualB-factor refinement, solvent building was performed using the solvent 0 mode of ArpWArp (24Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Google Scholar) and CNS with waters placed in local maxima of difference electron density maps above 3 ς. The structures of the two PWA·inhibitor complexes (PWA·Tris and PWA·Ac/Zn) were solved by molecular replacement using the structure of PWA·Zn as a search model. Rotation and translation functions were calculated with AMoRe (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) using x-ray data from 10 to 2.5 Å, resulting in a single solution with correlation coefficients of 68.6 and 80.1% andR-factors of 39.4 and 33.5% for PWA·Tris and PWA·Ac/Zn, respectively. A test set of 1686 reflections (4.7%, PWA·Tris) and 1196 reflections (1.7%, PWA·Ac/Zn) for the calculation ofR free was excluded during refinement in CNS. Initial phases of the PWA·Tris model were applied to automated model building using ArpWArp for model completion. The models were verified and corrected, and acarbose and Tris molecules were built manually using the graphics software program O. Solvent building and subsequent refinement were performed as described above. Metal atoms were identified from high peaks in the difference Fourier maps and in part from additional high peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier maps. Metals were refined as calcium when no higher peak level appeared in the anomalous electron density map and the coordination geometry agreed with that of known protein·calcium complexes. They were refined as magnesium sites when an excess of magnesium was present during crystallization and a negative F o −F c difference Fourier electron density peak appeared when the metal position was refined as calcium. Metals were refined as zinc when the crystal growth conditions contained zinc ions and if the metals sites showed a high anomalous peak emerging from data set collection at 12.4 keV (λ = 0.91 Å), which is above the k-adsorption edge of zinc of 9.59 keV (λ = 1.28 Å). We have solved the structure of PWA in three different forms using experimental phases from a mercury derivative. The structures are in the presence of three different inhibitors: 1) zinc (PWA·Zn); 2) the specific substrate analog acarbose and zinc (PWA·Ac/Zn); and 3) Tris, which was used as a buffer for crystallization trials in the absence of zinc (PWA·Tris). They have been refined to 2.2-, 2.0-, and 1.6-Å resolution, respectively. PWA displays the canonical glycosylhydrolase class-13 fold that is composed of three domains, A–C (Fig.1). Comparison of the overall structure of PWA with that of other known α-amylases using the program DALI (26Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) revealed the highest structural similarity to the homologous enzymes from the hyperthermophile B. licheniformis (BLA; 29% sequence identity; root mean square deviation of 2.5 Å based on comparison of the Cα backbone trace) and from barley (28% sequence identity; root mean square deviation of 1.8 Å) (Fig.2).Figure 2Structure-based alignment of PWA sequences. The secondary structure assignments for PWA are shown as colored cylinders (310-helices and α-helices) and arrows (β-strands) above the aligned sequences.

The Protein Data Bank code for BLA is 1BLI (27Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). The positions of amino acid residues coordinating the zinc ion in domain B (site 1; cf. Table II) are highlighted in red; those coordinating calcium (site 2;cf. Table II) in domain B are colored yellow; and the cysteines forming disulfide bonds are colored green. The seven invariant amino acid residues are marked in black. The alignment was carried out with DALI using the main chain positions of each coordinate set.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As in other α-amylases, the central domain A, covering residues 1–109 and 170–340, is folded as a (βα)8-barrel and contains the active site at its C-terminal face. Domain B (residues 111–169) inserts between β-strand 3 and α-helix 3a of domain A, thus forming part of the active site cleft. Its secondary structure is limited to two short β-strands, forming a small antiparallel β-sheet and a short 310-helix (Figs. 1 and 2). At their interface, domains A and B comprise a novel (Ca,Zn) metal center, which is described further below (see Fig. 4). A disulfide bridge is formed by two consecutive cysteine residues (Cys153 and Cys154) in close vicinity to the zinc-binding site of this two-metal center. Covering a range of 58 residues only, domain B of PWA is one of the smallest α-amylase B domains, whereas other members of the family span >100 residues (2Janecek S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 67-97Google Scholar, 3Pujadas G. Palau J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 38-54Google Scholar). Among those with a known structure, domain B of BLA is most similar (root mean square deviation of 2.3 Å based on the Cα backbone) (27Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar) to the corresponding domain of PWA. In contrast, domain B of BLA contains 43 additional residues that form a second β-sheet (27Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain C (residues 341–435) is arranged in an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet containing a Greek key motif. The function of this domain still remains unclear. We initially identified the nature of the bound metal ions by PIXE. For these experiments, PWA was expressed heterologously in E. coli and purified in the absence of exogenous metals except for sodium. The PIXE data revealed the presence of 1.1 ± 0.4 molar eq of zinc and 4 ± 2 molar eq of calcium bound to PWA. In the PWA crystal structures, the type of the metal sites was characterized by the analysis of anomalous x-ray data and positive peaks inF o − F c difference Fourier electron density maps (Table I). Based on these data, the PWA structures show excessive metal binding; all three structures have five metal-binding sites in common (TableII). The two crystal forms grown in the presence of zinc (PWA·Zn and PWA·Ac/Zn) reveal two additional metal sites, bringing the total in these structures to seven. The presence of an anomalous signal under the experimental conditions of x-ray data collection was used to indicate the presence of zinc (Tables I and II). In the PWA·Tris structure, solved from crystals grown in the absence of zinc, but in the presence of magnesium, only one site showed a significant anomalous signal and therefore was refined as a zinc site (Table II). The remaining four sites, without an anomalous signal, but retaining strong positive difference electron density, when refined as an ordered solvent (>10 ς), were interpreted to be calcium or magnesium sites. Thus, the stoichiometry of calcium (or magnesium) and zinc sites observed in the PWA·Tris structure is in good agreement with the PIXE data. In contrast, in the PWA·Zn and PWA·Ac/Zn structures, all sites except one showed a significant anomalous signal and were therefore refined as zinc sites. The remaining site was interpreted as a calcium site. These metal sites will be referred to as activating sites (Table II, sites 1 and 2), an inhibiting site (site 7), and other sites (sites 3–6).Table IIMetal-binding sites in PWA of different crystal formsPWA·ZnPWA·Ac/ZnPWA·TrisSite 1MetalCaCaCaB-factor (Å2)27.124.512.4ς (diff/ano)12.7/–15.5/–25.9/–Protein ligands: Asn110, Asp155, Gly157α, Asp164, Gly2022-aMain chain oxygen involved in metal coordination.Site 2MetalZnZnZnB-factor (Å2)26.827.912.7ς (diff/ano)13.0/9.224.4/14.141.0/59.0Protein ligands: His147, His152, Cys166Site 3MetalZnZnMgB-factor (Å2)27.934.918.0ς (diff/ano)10.2/11.216.8/–11.8/–Protein ligands: Asp347, Asp349, Glu350Site 4MetalZnZnNo metalB-factor (Å2)24.840.2ς (diff/ano)14.1/9.312.2/9.7Protein ligands: Lys33,2-bSide chain residue coordinating zinc observed only in PWA·Zn.

We quantified the inhibitory effects of a number of established α-amylase active site ligands, including the transition state analog acarbose and the buffer Tris (TableIII). To link the observed tight binding of calcium and zinc to a potential role in activity regulation, we also assessed the regulatory properties of a number of metal ions (TableIII). Except for copper (full inhibition in the presence of 3 mm Cu2+), zinc had the strongest inhibitory effect. In the presence of ≥3 mm zinc, residual PWA activity was <10%. In contrast to many other characterized α-amylases, including commercially available BLA (10Jorgensen S. Vorgias C.E. Antranikian G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16335-16342Google Scholar, 13Savchenko A. Vieille C. Kang S. Zeikus J.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6193-6201Google Scholar), PWA was not activated significantly by an excess of calcium (Table III). Based on the measured inhibition data, we selected three ligands (acarbose, Tris, and zinc) for crystallographic characterization of the PWA active site (Fig. 3).Table IIIEffect of metal ions and chemical reagents on PWA activityAdditivesRelative activity1 mm3 mm5 mm%Mg2+10610699Ni2+605186Ca2+1059483Fe3+958263Co2+926655Fe2+855538Mn2+584433Zn2+2570Cu2+500EDTA959186Tris918783Acarbose745420The relative activity refers to the enzyme activity determined without any additive (100 %).

Acarbose is a pseudotetrasaccharide inhibitor consisting of a valienamine unit at the nonreducing end linked to 4-amino- 4,6-dideoxy-α-d-glucose, which is fused to maltose. In the PWA·Ac/Zn structure, resulting from co-crystallization of PWA in the presence of acarbose and zinc, one acarbose molecule is bound to the active site at the C-terminal face of the (βα)8-barrel of domain A. It interacts with a number of highly conserved residues that reside in loops connecting β-strands 4, 5, and 7 of the (βα)8-barrel with the subsequent helices (Figs. 2 and 3, A and B) (2Janecek S.

https://openalex.org/W2120790589,"Murine stress-inducible protein 1 (mSTI1) is a co-chaperone that is homologous with the human Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop). Guided by Hop structural data and sequence alignment analyses, we have used site-directed mutagenesis, co-precipitation assays, circular dichroism spectroscopy, steady-state fluorescence, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to both qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the contacts necessary for the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR1) of mSTI1 to bind to heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) and to discriminate between Hsc70 and Hsp90. We have shown that substitutions in the first TPR motif of Lys8 or Asn12did not affect binding of mSTI1 to Hsc70, whereas double substitution of these residues abrogated binding. A substitution in the second TPR motif of Asn43 lowered but did not abrogate binding. Similarly, a deletion in the second TPR motif coupled with a substitution of Lys8 or Asn12 reduced but did not abrogate binding. These results suggest that mSTI1-Hsc70 interaction requires a network of interactions not only between charged residues in the TPR1 domain of mSTI1 and the EEVD motif of Hsc70 but also outside the TPR domain. We propose that the electrostatic interactions in the first TPR motif made by Lys8 or Asn12 define part of the minimum interactions required for successful mSTI1-Hsc70 interaction. Using a truncated derivative of mSTI1 incapable of binding to Hsp90, we substituted residues on TPR1 potentially involved in hydrophobic contacts with Hsc70. The modified protein had reduced binding to Hsc70 but now showed significant binding capacity for Hsp90. In contrast, topologically equivalent substitutions on a truncated derivative of mSTI1 incapable of binding to Hsc70 did not confer Hsc70 specificity on TPR2A. Our results suggest that binding of Hsc70 to TPR1 is more specific than binding of Hsp90 to TPR2A with serious implications for the mechanisms of mSTI1 interactions with Hsc70 and Hsp90 in vivo.

A typical TPR motif consists of two anti-parallel α helices with small consensus hydrophobic residues occurring at position of closest contact between the helices whereas large consensus residues are usually found at interfaces between adjacent helices in a tandem array (17Lamb J.R.

In multiple-motif TPR proteins, tandem TPR motifs fold into a right-handed superhelical structure forming a binding groove to accommodate partner proteins (19Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that conserved basic residues that project into the grooves of the TPR domains of proteins that interact with Hsc70 and Hsp90 are important for binding to these molecular chaperones (20Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.-S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the N-terminal TPR domain (TPR1) of Hop in complex with the C-terminal heptapeptide of Hsp70 and the first central TPR domain (TPR2A) in complex with the C-terminal pentapeptide of Hsp90 have been determined (6Scheufler C.

The structures predict that binding involves a network of electrostatic interactions between charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal and first central TPR domains of Hop and the C-terminal EEVD motifs of Hsp70 and Hsp90 peptides, respectively. Recently, it has been shown that, whereas Asp0 and Val−1 act as general anchor residues, the highly conserved glutamates of the EEVD motif, which appear to be critical in Hsp90 binding by TPR2A, do not contribute appreciably to the interaction of Hsp70 with TPR1 (21Brinker A. Scheufler C. von Der Mulbe F. Fleckenstein B. Herrmann C. Jung G. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19265-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The electrostatic interactions between the TPR domains and the C-terminal aspartate (Asp0) form a two-carboxylate clamp that appears to be necessary for binding of Hop to Hsp70 and Hsp90. Residues in the TPR1 domain predicted to be involved in forming this clamp include Lys8, Asn12, Asn43, Lys73, and Arg77, whereas the topologically equivalent residues in the TPR2A domain are Lys229, Asn233, Asn264, Lys301, and Arg305. These amino acid residues are highly conserved in TPR-containing proteins that bind to the C-terminal EEVD motifs of Hsc70 and Hsp90. Discrimination between the C termini of the two molecular chaperones appears to depend largely on hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions between residues in the TPR domains of Hop and residues upstream of the EEVD motif (6Scheufler C.

For example, Ala46, Ala49, and Lys50, all in helix A of the second TPR motif (helix 2A) in TPR1 of Hop, make hydrophobic contacts with the isoleucine (Ile−4) of the IEEVD sequence in Hsp70, whereas Tyr236 and Glu271 in helix A of the first TPR motif (helix 1A) and helix A of the second TPR motif (helix 2A) of TPR2A, respectively, make important hydrophobic contacts with the methionine (Met−4) of the MEEVD sequence in Hsp90. Pro−6, which is further upstream of the EEVD motif in Hsp70, exists in a hydrophobic cavity formed by Glu83 and Phe84 of helix A of the third TPR motif (helix 3A) in TPR1. Val−1 in the EEVD motif of Hsp70 makes hydrophobic contacts with Asn12 and Leu15 in helix 1A and with Asn43 in helix 2A of TPR1. In the TPR2A complex, Val−1 in the EEVD motif of Hsp90 is in hydrophobic contacts with Asn233, Asn264, and Ala267. The relevance of the individual amino acids in the C-terminal peptides of Hsp70 (PTIEEVD) and Hsp90 (MEEVD) to the Hsp70-Hop-Hsp90 complex, and in particular the Hsp90-Hop complex, has been characterized (21Brinker A. Scheufler C. von Der Mulbe F. Fleckenstein B. Herrmann C. Jung G. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19265-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the relative significance of the individual amino acids in the TPR1 domain groove to general binding and specificity of the Hsp70-Hop complex has yet to be experimentally characterized. Using site-directed mutagenesis, co-precipitation assays, circular dichroism spectroscopy, steady-state fluorescence, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we provide both qualitative and quantitative evidence to show that mSTI1-Hsc70 interaction requires a network of interactions not only between charged residues in the TPR1 domain of mSTI1 and the EEVD motif of Hsc70, but also outside the TPR domain. We also propose that the electrostatic interactions in the first TPR motif made by Lys8 or Asn12 define part of the minimum interactions required for successful mSTI1-Hsc70 interaction. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hydrophobic contacts in the second TPR motif of TPR1 domains are important in determining specificity of mSTI1 interaction with Hsc70, and by doing amino acid substitutions, we have engineered the ability to bind Hsp90 on the Hsc70-specific TPR1 domain of mSTI1. In contrast, engineering Hsc70-binding capacity on the Hsp90-binding TPR2A was not possible by simple swapping of topologically equivalent residues. General molecular biology procedures such as restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, ligation, preparation of competent bacterial cells, and bacterial cell transformation were done according to standard protocols (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.46-7.50Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and Western blotting according to Towbin et al. (25Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). The enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect specific proteins during Western analysis. All mutations were generated from the plasmids pGEX3X2000 and pQE30–2000, which contain the cDNAs encoding the full-length proteins GST-543 and His-543, respectively. Generation of the deletion plasmids pGEX3X700 (encoding GST fusion of the C-terminal truncated protein, GST-N217), pGEX3X1400 (encoding GST fusion of the N-terminal truncated protein, GST-C334), and pGEX3X2000 (Δ37–47) (encoding GST fusion of the protein in which residues 37–47 have been deleted, GST-543 (Δ37–47)) has been previously reported (3Lassle M.

Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All mutations were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis using a double-stranded whole plasmid linear amplification procedure (QuikChange mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Silent mutations were engineered to create restriction sites for screening purposes except where the desired codon change(s) automatically generated restriction sites. The following alanine (Ala) mutant proteins were generated: GST-543 (K8A), GST-543 (N12A), GST-543 (K8A,N12A), His-543 (K8A,N12A), GST-543 (N43A), GST-543 (Δ37–47, K8A), GST-543 (Δ37–47, N12A), and GST-543 (K301A). GST-543 (Y27A) was generated as previously described (26van der Spuy J. Kana B.D. Dirr H.W. Blatch G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the deletion mutant, a highly conserved block of amino acids in helix 2A (residues 37–47) was deleted. Other mutants generated are: GST-N217 (L15Y), GST-N217 (A49F,K50E), GST-N217 (L15Y,A49F,K50E), GST-C334 (Y236L), GST-C334 (F270A,E271K), and GST-C334 (Y236L,F270A,E271K). All mutations were confirmed both by restriction enzyme analysis and by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Exponentially growing Escherichia coli XLI Blue cells carrying pGEX3X-derived plasmid constructs were induced for 5–6 h at 37 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and lysed by mild sonication in 0.01 culture volume of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 1 mm final concentration of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The sonicate was incubated, with gentle agitation, for 30 min at room temperature after addition of Triton X-100 to 1% final concentration. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of clarified extracts were added to 50% (w/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (2-ml bed volume per 100 ml of extract) previously equilibrated with PBS. Binding was allowed to occur for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After the beads were washed extensively with ice-cold PBS, the bound GST fusion proteins were eluted by adding appropriate volume of the elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Eluted GST fusion proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Both wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed easily and found to be soluble. Heterologous production of His6-tagged mSTI1 proteins in exponentially growing E. coli cells was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The E. coli cells were treated and lysed as described above. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column. Washing of the column was done using a buffer containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm PMSF. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–300 mm imidazole. The ligand was removed from the protein by gel filtration in a Sephadex G-25 column. Buffer exchange was achieved by loading the purified protein onto a hydroxyapatite column previously equilibrated with 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, and eluting with a linear gradient of 20–300 mmK2HPO4. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE (12%) and size exclusion-high performance liquid chromatography using a LKB model 2150. In separate 1-ml reactions, GST-mSTI1 fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads to a final concentration of 0.3 μm. Binding was allowed to occur for 1 h at 4 °C, after which unbound fusion protein was removed by washing three times in ice-cold PBS. Hsc70 binding assays were conducted by incubating the coupled agarose beads with 250 μg of NIH 3T3 crude extracts in a 1-ml reaction volume using ice-cold PBS. In Hsp90 binding assays, purified Hsp90 rather than extract proteins was added to a final concentration of 0.025 μm. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were collected and washed extensively in ice-cold PBS to remove nonspecifically bound extract proteins. The bound proteins were solubilized in 70 μl of SDS sample buffer and 30 μl analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE. After transferring onto nitrocellulose membrane, co-precipitation of Hsc70 or Hsp90 with the GST-mSTI1 fusion proteins was revealed by immunodetection and chemiluminescent autoradiography using the monoclonal primary antibodies H5147 and H9010 specific for Hsc70 and Hsp90, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was performed using a Biacore X apparatus. All experiments were performed at 25 °C in PBS containing 0.005% P20 surfactant (buffer A). Monoclonal goat anti-GST antibody was covalently attached to carboxymethlylated dextran on a sensor chip CM5 via amine coupling according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Approximately 700 response units of GST-mSTI1 fusion protein were bound to the immobilized antibody. Recombinant GST was immobilized on a separate reference flow cell. The chip was equilibrated with buffer A before passing solutions containing increasing concentrations of purified Hsc70 or Hsp90 over the bound proteins at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. For competition experiments, mixture of full-length Hsc70 and Hsp90 (8 and 5 μm final concentrations, respectively) was pre-incubated at 25 °C before passing it over the immobilized mSTI1 proteins. Background binding to GST was subtracted from each signal to account for nonspecific binding to GST. Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software version 2.2.4. Fluorescence emission spectra and other fluorescence measurements were made at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The intrinsic fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm) of the lone tryptophan in mSTI1 was measured for 2 μm protein between 300 and 400 nm in a PerkinElmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (27Wallace L.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5320-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism measurements were made using 8 μm amounts of each protein sample in a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. Ellipticity values were collected (average of 10 runs) in both the near-UV (350–250 nm) and far-UV (250–200 nm) regions. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) solution, at 37 °C and 10% CO2 until they reached 80–100% confluence. The cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by three washes with PBS. The harvested cells were resuspended in appropriate volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min to allow lysis to occur. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant used immediately. Fig.1 A shows the various GST-mSTI1 protein derivatives used in this study. For both steady-state and circular dichroism spectroscopies, we used the His6-tagged proteins. We constructed a sequence alignment of Hsc70-interacting TPR domains of STI1 homologues. The alignment revealed that the charged residues in the TPR domains predicted to form the so-called two-carboxylate clamp with the EEVD motif of Hsc70 are strictly conserved among homologous STI1 proteins (Fig. 1 B,first alignment). In another alignment, we compared the same basic residues in Hsc70-binding TPR domains of non-homologous Hsc70-interacting proteins of colon cancer antigen 7 (NY-CO-7; Ref. 28Liu F.-H. Wu S.-J.

Conservation was found to be less strict in these proteins, especially at positions equivalent to Lys73 and Arg77 in Hop (Fig. 1 B,second alignment). As expected, the residues that are predicted to determine specificity of binding to Hsc70 in Hop do not show strict conservation when comparing functionally equivalent Hsc70-interacting TPR domains (Fig. 1 B, first andsecond alignments). When comparing TPR1, TPR2A, and TPR2B domains of mSTI1, Ala49 and Lys50 in TPR1 are predicted to be topologically equivalent to Phe270and Glu271 in TPR2A, and Thr405 and Lys406 in TPR2B, respectively (Fig. 1 B,third alignment). Ala49 and Lys50 in Hop are predicted to be important in determining Hsc70 binding specificity, whereas Phe270 and Glu271 are predicted to be critical for the specific binding of Hsp90 (6Scheufler C.

Interestingly, TPR2B has similar specificity determinants at these positions to those of TPR1 (Ala49/Lys50 versusThr405/Lys406), suggesting that it may have, yet to be detected, Hsc70-interaction capacity (Fig. 1 B,third alignment). Fig.2 (A and B) shows the ribbon representations of the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal TPR domains of Hop in complex with the C-terminal peptides of Hsp70 and Hsp90, respectively. Amino acid residues involved in general binding (Fig. 2 A, i and ii) and specificity of binding (Fig. 2 B, i andii) of the TPR domains to the peptides are represented insticks. Homology modeling, using co-ordinates generated from Hop, revealed that the structures of the N- and C-terminal TPR domains of mSTI1 are similar to that of Hop. This is not unexpected because the two homologues share 97% amino acid identity.Figure 2Hop TPR domains in complexes with C-terminal Hsc70 and Hsp90 peptides. Ribbon representations of the crystal structures of the N-terminal TPR (TPR1; Protein Data Bank code 1ELW) and central TPR (TPR2A; Protein Data Bank code 1ELR) domains of Hop in complexes with the C-terminal heptapeptide of Hsp70 and pentapeptide of Hsp90, respectively. TPR domains are shown as ribbons, peptides as rods, and amino acid residues assticks. The TPR residues are labeled by the single-letter code and anumber that relates to its position in the primary amino acid sequence.

Hsp90 binds to the central TPR domain (TPR2A) of Hop by a similar mechanism (ii).B, specificity of binding is determined by hydrophobic contacts with Ile−4 in Hsp70 (i) and Met−5 in Hsp90 (ii).

We generated single mutations: GST-543 (K8A), GST-543 (N12A), GST-543 (N43A), GST-543 (K301A), and a double mutation, GST-543 (K8A,N12A), of the full-length GST fusion protein (GST-543); and single mutations GST-543 (Δ37–47, K8A) and GST-543 (Δ37–47, N12A) of the deletion mutant GST-543 (Δ37–47) (see “Experimental Procedures”). GST-543 (K73A), GST-543 (R77A), GST-543 (K229A), and GST-543 (N233A) could not be produced successfully, possibly because of deleterious structural effects of the amino acid substitutions on the protein. The various GST fusion proteins were tested for their ability to bind to either Hsc70 from NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell extracts or purified Hsp90. Our results showed that single mutation of Lys8 or Asn12 in helix 1A of TPR1 had no significant effect on the specific binding of mSTI1 to Hsc70, as these mutant proteins bound Hsc70 at levels comparable with that of the unmodified protein (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1, 3, and 5). However, double mutation of Lys8 and Asn12, GST-543 (K8A,N12A), abrogated binding to Hsc70 below detectable levels (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). In contrast to Hsc70-mSTI1 interaction, single substitution of Lys301 in TPR2A, GST-543 (K301A), was found to abrogate binding of mSTI1 to Hsp90 (results not shown). Notably, mutation of Asn43 in helix 2A of TPR1 led to a significant decrease in the affinity of mSTI1 for Hsc70 but not abrogation (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). As a negative control (Fig. 3 A,lane 6), we used a mutant GST derivative of mSTI1, GST-543 (Y27A), which has been shown not to bind Hsc70 (26van der Spuy J. Kana B.D. Dirr H.W. Blatch G.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In all the binding assays, GST alone did not bind to Hsc70 (Fig. 3). To provide evidence that binding of Hsc70 to the GST-mSTI1 derivatives was specific and not the recognition of misfolded proteins by Hsc70, we tested the sensitivities of the interactions to increasing ionic strength. The interaction of GST-543 appeared to be specific as binding of the unmodified protein was found to decrease with increasing ionic concentrations (result not shown). The binding of GST-543 (K8A), GST-543 (N12A), and GST-543 (N43A) followed the same pattern at increasing ionic concentrations (results not shown).

In contrast, their expression follows the localization of uterine VEGF expression with increasing angiogenesis during the postimplantation period (days 5–8). This disparate pattern of uterine HIFs, ARNTs, and VEGF expression on days 1–4 of pregnancy suggests HIFs have multiple roles in addition to the regulation of angiogenesis during the peri-implantation period.

We have previously shown that VEGF isoforms and VEGF receptors are expressed in the uterus during early pregnancy in a spatiotemporal manner (1Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting that VEGF plays an important role in uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis required for implantation and decidualization. Because the uterus is a primary target for estrogen and progesterone (P4), which profoundly influence uterine function prior to and during implantation, it is thought that steroid hormones modulate the uterine angiogenic status via the VEGF system. Indeed, our recent studies have shown that estrogen and P4have different effects in vivo; estrogen promotes uterine vascular permeability but profoundly inhibits angiogenesis, whereas P4 stimulates angiogenesis with little effect on vascular permeability. These effects of estrogen and P4 are mediated by differential spatiotemporal expression of proangiogenic factors in the uterus (12Ma W. Tan J. Matsumoto H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). VEGF effects are complemented and coordinated by another class of angiogenic factors, the angiopoietins that act via the tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 (13Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F.

Furthermore, our results provide evidence that although ovarian steroid hormones influence uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis during the preimplantation period, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandins direct these events during implantation and decidualization by differentially regulating VEGF and angiopoietin signaling. However, the mechanisms by which steroid hormones and prostaglandins differentially regulate uterine angiogenesis during early pregnancy remain unresolved.

HIF-2α is also known as endothelial PAS domain protein-1, HIF-1α-like factor, HIF-related factor, or MOP2 (memberof the PAS superfamily 2) (15Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). HIF-β subunits are identical to the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocators (ARNTs). The ARNT family consists of ARNT1, ARNT2, and ARNT3. ARNT3 is also known as BMAL1 (brain andmuscle ARNT-like protein-1) (15Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). HIF-α subunits can heterodimerize with the ARNT family members without specificity for their dimerization partners (15Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is expressed in most human and rodent tissues (25Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Guenet J.L. Gassmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Wiener C.M. Booth G. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Levels of the HIF-1α protein are primarily regulated by protein stabilization under hypoxic conditions, whereas its rapid degradation occurs under normoxic conditions via an ubiquitination mechanism (15Semenza G.L.

Normally, the expression of HIF-1α is ubiquitous, whereas that of HIF-2α and HIF-3α shows a more restricted expression pattern. There is evidence that HIF-2α mRNA expression is much higher under normoxic conditions and that its expression correlates with that of VEGF (34Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of ARNT1, ARNT2, and ARNT3 in general resemble those of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α (15Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in ARNT1, HIF-1α, or HIF-2α die at midgestational stage because of vascular defects primarily involving the embryonic and extraembryonic vasculature (15Semenza G.L. J. Appl.

In contrast, mice deficient in ARNT2 or ARNT3 do not exhibit any vascular abnormalities (39Hosoya T. Oda Y. Takahashi S. Morita M. Kawauchi S. Ema M. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

These results suggest that VEGF expression is primarily regulated by HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and ARNT1 but not ARNT2 or ARNT3 during embryonic development. However, there is very limited information regarding the relationship between HIFs, ARNTs, and VEGF in the adult normal uterus during early pregnancy, although the role of HIFs in regulating VEGF and thus angiogenesis in tumor tissues has clearly been documented (41Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Spielmann P. Zimmermann D.R. Gassmann M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the temporal and cell-specific expression of HIFs and ARNTs in parallel with the expression of VEGF in the uterus during the peri-implantation period and under steroid hormonal regulation. We observed that expression of HIFs and ARNTs does not spatiotemporally correlate with the expression of VEGF in the uterus during the preimplantation period (days 1–4 of pregnancy). In contrast, the expression of these transcription factors follows the localization of VEGF expression in the uterus with increasing angiogenesis during the postimplantation period (days 5–8). The disparate pattern of HIFs, ARNTs, and VEGF expression on days 1–4 of pregnancy suggests that they have different roles in addition to the regulation of angiogenesis in the uterus during the peri-implantation period. We also observed that although HIF-1α is primarily regulated by P4 in the mouse uterus, estrogen transiently regulates HIF-2α. Adult CD-1 mice were purchased from the Charles Rivers Laboratory (Raleigh, NC). Females were mated with fertile males of the same strain to induce pregnancy (day 1 = vaginal plug). Estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-deficient mice (129/J/C57BL/6J) and progesterone receptor (PR)-deficient mice (129SvEv/C57BL/6) were generated as previously described (43Lubahn D.B. Moyer J.S. Golding T.S.

PCR analysis of the genomic DNA determined the genotypes. All of the mice were housed in our Animal Care Facilities according to the National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. To examine the effects of estrogen and/or P4 on uterine gene expression, ovariectomized mice were injected with sesame oil (0.1 ml/mouse), estradiol-17β (E2) (100 ng/mouse), P4 (2 mg/mouse), or E2 plus P4. At termination of the treatments, uteri were processed for subsequent analysis. The steroids were dissolved in sesame oil and injected subcutaneously. The cDNA clones for Vegf andribosomal protein L7 (rpL7) have previously been described (1Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K.

Peter Carmeliet (Flanders Inter-University Institute, Leuveen, Belgium) kindly provided a cDNA clone for the mouse HIF-1α. A 192-bp HIF-1α was subcloned into a pGEM3ZF(+) vector at the EcoRI site. Mouse-specific HIF-3α and ARNT1 cDNAs were gifts from Chris Bradfield (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Partial cDNAs for mouse HIF-2α, ARNT2, andARNT3 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR cloning with specific primers. For Northern hybridization, antisense32P-labeled cRNA probes were generated using T7polymerase. For in situ hybridization, sense and antisense35S-labeled cRNA probes were generated using Sp6and T7 polymerases, respectively. Probes had specific activities of about 2 × 109 dpm/μg. For Northern hybridization, poly(A)+ RNA (2.0 μg) was denatured and separated by formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and UV cross-linked. Northern blots were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as previously described by us (1Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K.

Quantification of hybridized bands was analyzed by densitometric scanning. In situ hybridization was performed as previously described by us (1Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M.

In brief, frozen sections (10 μm) were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were prehybridized and hybridized at 45 °C for 4 h in 50% formamide hybridization buffer containing the35S-labeled antisense or sense cRNA probes. RNase A-resistant hybrids were detected by autoradiography. The sections were post-stained with eosin and hematoxylin. Frozen sections (10 μm thick) were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and stored at −80 °C until used. The sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature followed by washing in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 5 min twice. Immunolocalization of HIF-1α was performed as previously described with some modifications (46Camenisch G. Tini M. Chilov D. Kvietikova I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Spielmann P. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M.

A peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgY antibody (1:100; Pierce) was added onto the sections, and the sections were incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Immunolocalization for ARNT1 was performed as previously described (48Paria B.C. Zhao X. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Yoshinaga K. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, the sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ARNT1 antibody (1:250; Affinity BioReagents, Neshanic Station, NJ) overnight at 4 °C. Immunostaining was performed using a Histostain-SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After immunostaining, the sections were counterstained with 0.5% Fast Green. The red color indicated the site of positive staining. AN3CA uterine carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro), whereas L929 cells were cultured in Joklik's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. In addition, amphotericin B (250 ng/ml) was added to the medium for culturing L929 cells. AN3CA cells (7.5 × 105) and L929 cells (3.5 × 105) were co-transfected with the following vectors (all at 0.6 μg/ml):CMV hPR-A and/or CMV hPR-B orpcDNA3 (control; Invitrogen), and different combinations of the luciferase constructs, pHXN1a-Luc(HIF-1α, exon 1.2 upstream region, 1.5 kb) (41Wenger R.H.

The CMV hPR-A andCMV hPR-B expression vectors were kindly provided by Dean Edwards (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO), whereaspH1030-Luc and PRE-Luc constructs were generously provided by Roland Wenger (Carl-Ludwig Institute of Physiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig) and Nancy Weigel (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), respectively. All transfection was normalized to a total of 2.0 μg/ml withpcDNA3. The transfection mixture was replaced with complete medium containing the vehicle (1% ethanol) or P4 (1 μm). After 48 h, the cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were determined using a luminometer (Mono Light 2010) and normalized to the relative light units from Renillaluciferase using a dual luciferase kit (Promega). The objective of these experiments was to examine whether Vegf expression is co-localized with that of HIFs and ARNTs during the pre- and post-implantation periods. As previously shown by us (1Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), Vegf mRNA expression was restricted to the luminal epithelium on day 1 of pregnancy when the uterus is under the influence of preovulatory estrogen, whereas on day 4 of pregnancy, this expression became primarily localized in the stroma under the influence of rising P4 levels fortified with a small amount of estrogen (Fig.1 A). However, the mechanism by which steroid hormones influence Vegf expression is not fully understood. Because HIFs are known to regulate Vegfexpression associated with angiogenesis, we examined the expression ofHIFs and their partners ARNTs in the uterus to determine whether HIFs play any role in uterine Vegfexpression. We observed that the expression of HIFs(HIF-1α, -2α, and -3α) was very low to undetectable in the uterus on day 1 of pregnancy. However,HIF-1α was distinctly expressed in the luminal epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy as opposed to the expression of Vegfin the stroma. Interestingly, distinct but patchy expression ofHIF-2α was noted in the stroma, whereas the expression ofHIF-3α was undetectable (Fig. 1 A). Because HIFs must heterodimerize with ARNTs for transcriptional activation of Vegf (17Hofer T. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 443: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we next examined the expression ofARNTs in the uterus on similar days of pregnancy. To our surprise, we observed that all three ARNTs (ARNT1, ARNT2, and ARNT3) were expressed at very low to undetectable levels on these days of pregnancy, except ARNT1, which was expressed at a low to modest level both in the luminal epithelium and stroma on day 4 of pregnancy (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the stromal expression of HIF-2α that correlates with ARNT1on day 4 of pregnancy suggests that HIF-2α regulates Vegftranscription after heterodimerization with ARNT1. We next asked whether the localization of these proteins follows the same pattern as their respective mRNAs. Surprisingly, immunoreactive HIF-1α and ARNT1 were primarily localized to the uterine epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy, suggesting that HIF-1α effects are probably restricted to the epithelium at this time (Fig. 1 C). The unavailability of suitable antibodies to other HIFs and ARNTs has precluded us from determining the localization of these proteins in the uterus. Nonetheless, the mRNA localization of HIF-2α in the stroma in the presence of little or no expression of ARNT2and ARNT3 and a very low level of ARNT1expression with restricted localization of its protein in the epithelium raises questions regarding a role for HIF-2α in stromalVegf expression on day 4 of pregnancy. It is possible that a yet unidentified ARNT isoform is expressed in the stroma at this time. Nonetheless, the localization of both the mRNA and protein for HIF-1α and ARNT1 in the epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy suggests that HIF-1α has a different role in the uterus, becauseVegf is expressed in the stroma but not in the epithelium at this time. There are increases in Vegf expression and angiogenesis in the uterus at the site of the blastocyst as implantation progresses. Therefore, we compared the expression of Vegf with those ofHIFs and ARNTs during the postimplantation period, particularly on days 5 and 8 of pregnancy. These 2 days were chosen because day 5 represents a very early stage of implantation that correlates with initiation of the decidualization process, whereas day 8 represents a late phase of the implantation process when decidual growth is maximal.

https://openalex.org/W2049576572,"Records of now-extinct short-lived nuclides in meteorites provide information about the formation and evolution of the solar system. We have found excess 10B that we attribute to the decay of short-lived 10Be (half-life 1.5 million years) in hibonite grains from the Murchison meteorite. The grains show no evidence of decay of two other short-lived nuclides-26Al (half-life 700,000 years) and 41Ca (half-life 100,000 years)-that may be present in early solar system solids. One plausible source of the observed 10Be is energetic particle irradiation of material in the solar nebula. An effective irradiation dose of approximately 2 x 10(18) protons per square centimeter with a kinetic energy of >/=10 megaelectronvolts per atomic mass unit can explain our measurements. The presence of 10Be, coupled with the absence of 41Ca and 26Al, may rule out energetic particle irradiation as the primary source of 41Ca and 26Al present in some early solar system solids and strengthens the case of a stellar source for 41Ca and 26Al."
https://openalex.org/W2049732271,"We examined the effects of protein folding on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-cytosol transport (dislocation) by exploiting the well-characterized dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain. DHFR retains the capacity to bind folate analogues in the lumen of microsomes and in the ER of intact cells, upon which it acquires a conformation resistant to proteinase K digestion. Here we show that a Class I major histocompatibility complex heavy chain fused to DHFR is still recognized by the human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoproteins US2 and US11, resulting in dislocation of the fusion protein from the ERin vitro and in vivo. A folded state of the DHFR domain does not impair dislocation of Class I MHC heavy chainsin vitro or in living cells. In fact, a slight acceleration of the dislocation of DHFR heavy chain fusion was observed in vitro in the presence of a folate analogue. These results suggest that one or more of the channels used for dislocation can accommodate polypeptides that contain a tightly folded domain of considerable size. Our data raise the possibility that the Sec61 channel can be modified to accommodate a folded DHFR domain for dislocation, but not for translocation into the ER, or that a channel altogether distinct from Sec61 is used for dislocation.

N-Linked oligosaccharides are added cotranslationally, and the formation of disulfide bonds may be initiated on the nascent polypeptide. Folding of nascent chains is assisted by an elaborate system of chaperones that includes calnexin, calreticulin, and oxidoreductases such as PDI and ERp57. To exit the ER along the secretory pathway, proteins must pass an ER quality control system. A failure to pass this checkpoint may trigger protein degradation, which mostly takes place in the cytoplasm (2Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Terminally misfolded proteins or unassembled protein complexes, which are dislocated from the ER to the cytosol, are degraded by the proteasome (3Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the cytoplasm, glycoproteins may lose their N-linked glycan in a reaction catalyzed byN-glycanase, presumably prior to proteasomal degradation. The human cytomegalovirus-encoded US2 and US11 glycoproteins mediate the destruction of class I MHC heavy chains (HC) by catalyzing the transfer of Class I HC from the ER to the cytosol, followed by proteasomal degradation, all in a matter of a few minutes. US2 and US11 usurp the normal cellular degradation machinery to selectively eliminate class I MHC as a means of immune evasion (4Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). p97, an AAA ATPase, may mediate the extraction of ubiquitinated HC from the ER in the case of US11-mediated degradation (5Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). However, because ubiquitination takes place in the cytosol and the cytosolic tail of HC is not directly ubiquitinated, ubiquitination cannot be the active force behind HC dislocation but must be located downstream from some as yet unidentified initiating events (6Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In a previous study we demonstrated that an EGFP-HC fusion protein composed of EGFP fused to the N terminus of the Class I MHC luminal domain is still subject to accelerated degradation when coexpressed with US2 and US11 and yields similar deglycosylated breakdown intermediates as seen for endogenous Class I HC. Surprisingly, EGFP fluorescence was retained throughout the process, suggesting either that dislocation occurred without a requirement for unfolding of the GFP domain or that unfolding and refolding of GFP had to occur rapidly (7Fiebiger E. Story C. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1041-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we tested the effects of folding on ER dislocation by using the well-characterized dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain. DHFR is a cytosolic enzyme that acquires a tightly folded conformation when bound to folate analogues like methotrexate (MTX) or the hydrophobic membrane-permeable derivative, trimetrexate (TMX) (8Sasso S.P. Gilli R.M. Sari J.C. Rimet O.S. Briand C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DHFR, when occupied by these ligands, acquires resistance to proteinase K digestion, yielding a distinctive 21-kDa protease-resistant fragment. In this capacity, DHFR can serve as a module that can block translocation across a membrane when only unfolded polypeptides are translocation competent. In this manner, fusion proteins using the DHFR moiety have been used extensively to study transport of proteins into mitochondria, a process strongly inhibited by MTX-stabilized DHFR (9Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Other studies using DHFR fusion proteins demonstrated that chaperone-mediated import into lysosomes, import into chloroplasts, and transport across the bacterial plasma membrane by the Sec machinery require the unfolded conformation for the polypeptide substrate to be translocated, because these processes are all compromised by a folded DHFR domain (10Salvador N. Aguado C. Horst M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27447-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Endo T. Kawakami M. Goto A. America T. Weisbeek P. Nakai M. Eur. J.

This situation, however, does not apply to all cases of transport examined, because fully folded proteins can be transported into mammalian peroxisomes and into Trypanosoma brucei glycosomes (13Walton P.A. Hill P.E. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Hausler T. Stierhof Y.D. Wirtz E. Clayton C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Secretory and most membrane proteins are inserted cotranslationally into the ER and acquire their tertiary structure inside the ER lumen. The translocation channel itself is believed capable of accommodating polypeptide segments in an α-helical configuration. However, completion of folding is thought to take place in the ER lumen (15Mingarro I.I. Nilsson I.I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. BMC Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the translocation of a hybrid between the presecretory protein, preprocecropin A, and DHFR (ppcecDHFR) into mammalian microsomes is signal peptide-dependent and will proceed post-translationally. Although membrane insertion and signal peptide removal of the preprocecropin moiety did not require unfolding of the DHFR domain, completion of translocation required unfolded DHFR, because translocation was blocked by inclusion of MTX. When MTX is present, and hence the DHFR portion of the ppcecDHFR is compactly folded, ppcecDHFR is susceptible to proteinase K digestion when translated in the presence of microsomes. It was concluded that folded MTX-occupied DHFR is unable to fit into the Sec61 aqueous pore to allow import into the ER (16Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we show that a DHFR-HC fusion protein is recognized by US2 and US11 for ER dislocation in vitro and in vivo. DHFR retains the capacity to bind folate analogues in the lumen of microsomes and in the ER of intact cells. Folding of the DHFR domain does not impair dislocation of Class I MHC heavy chains in vitro or in living cells. These results suggest that the channel(s) used for dislocation can accommodate polypeptides that contain a tightly folded domain of considerable size. Our data raise the possibility that the Sec61 channel can be modified to accommodate a folded DHFR domain for dislocation, but not for translocation into the ER, or that a channel distinct from Sec61 is used for dislocation. U373-MG astrocytoma cells (control), and US2 transfectants (US2+) were maintained as described previously (17Tortorella D. Story C.M. Huppa J.B. Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DHFR-HC (U373DHFR-HC) cells and US2-DHFR-HC (US2DHFR-HC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD). The αHC serum was generated by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially expressed luminal fragment of HLA-A2 and HLA-B27 heavy chain. The DHFR-HC molecule was cloned with the murine class I molecule H2-Kb signal sequence at its N terminus and the class I heavy chain HLA-A2 allele (amino acids 25–365) at the C terminus. The H2-Kb signal sequence directs the chimeric molecule to the ER. The chimeric constructs were inserted to pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The DHFR-HC was transfected into control and US2+ cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Frederick, MD) and the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer. pcDNA3.1-DHFR-HC was linearized with SspI forin vitro transcription. Transcription and translation were performed as described previously (18Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In vitro degradation assays were carried out by translating the indicated mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRLs) in the presence of microsomes as described (18Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Microsomes were spun down (20,000 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in 10 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose) containing 1 mg/ml RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with or without 0.1 mm TMX and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. 15 μl of Flexi RRL in the presence or absence of TMX containing 50 μm of the proteasome inhibitor ZLLL (MG132) were added, and aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points. A microsomal pellet was obtained by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min). Reducing sample buffer was added to the pellet, then it was analyzed using SDS-PAGE. DHFR-HC mRNA was translated in the presence of control microsomes. Microsomes were resuspended in 10 μl of homogenization buffer and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with or without TMX. To measure the extent to which carryover of TMX with the pellet fraction occurred, unlabeled microsomes were treated in a similar fashion. Microsomes were spun down and washed once with 1 ml of cold homogenization buffer. Microsome pellets were resuspended, combined, and lysed together in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 with or without proteinase K, as indicated. Cells were detached by trypsin treatment, followed by starvation in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. Cells were metabolically labeled with 500 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine (1200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) at 37 °C for the times indicated. Pulse-chase experiments, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (19Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Folate analogues were added during the starvation, pulse, and chase periods. TMX (kind gift from Medimmune, Gaithersburg, MD) was used at 0.1 mm, and MTX (Aldrich, WI) was used at 10 μm. EndoH (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) digestions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular fractionation of metabolically labeled US2DHFR-HC cells was performed as described previously (17Tortorella D. Story C.M. Huppa J.B. Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One million US2DHFR-HC cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min at 37 °C with or without TMX. To measure the extent to which TMX binding to DHFR occurred post-lysis rather than in the ER, the same number of unlabeled U373 cells was exposed to TMX in the same manner. These cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and the unlabeled cells were resuspended and combined with pulse-labeled cells. The mixed unlabeled and pulse-labeled cells were spun down and lysed together in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 0.5% lysis buffer. DHFR-HC was immunoprecipitated, and resistance to proteinase K was assessed, as indicated. Carryover of TMX from the unlabeled cells should then be able to stabilize35S-labeled DHFR-HC not exposed to TMX in the course of metabolic labeling. To achieve maximal binding of TMX to the DHFR moiety, 0.1 mm TMX was added directly to lysates where indicated. DHFR-HC was immunoprecipitated and one-half of the sample was kept on ice, while the other half of each sample was treated with proteinase K as described below. TMX binding to DHFR-HC was calculated as the ratio between the 21-kDa digestion product and the intact DHFR-HC. The maximal binding control, in which TMX was added to lysates, was used to normalize for percentage of binding. Microsomes were lysed in 30 μl of homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Digestion was performed on ice for 30 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mmfinal concentration) was added to inactivate proteinase K. Reducing sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled and immediately loaded onto the gel. Digestion of αHC immunoprecipitates was done in a similar fashion. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with NET buffer (Nonidet P-40 0.5%, NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 5 mm, Tris (pH 7.4) 50 mm), 30 μl of homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 was added, and proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml at room temperature for 45 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) was added, and an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated reducing sample buffer was added. Samples were boiled and immediately loaded onto the gel. We generated a polypeptide composed of the H-2Kb signal sequence, followed by DHFR fused in-frame to the N terminus of HLA-A2 heavy chain. We first verified that DHFR, a cytosolic enzyme, can fold properly in the lumen of the ER, where both redox potential and calcium concentrations differ significantly from those in the cytosol. The H-2Kb-DHFR-HC construct was translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes derived from U373 cells (Fig. 1). Following isolation of the microsomal fraction by centrifugation, we added trimetrexate (TMX), a membrane-permeable folate analogue, to the microsomes. Microsomes were then extensively washed to eliminate traces of unbound drug, lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and subjected to proteinase K digestion. The generation of a 21-kDa DHFR fragment resistant to proteinase K digestion is indicative of binding of the folate analogue and stabilization of the tightly folded conformation of DHFR. Inclusion of TMX renders the DHFR portion of the DHFR-HC fusion resistant to proteinase K digestion, as judged by the appearance of a 21-kDa polypeptide only when microsomes were preincubated with TMX (Fig. 1,lanes 2 and 3). To exclude the possibility of binding of TMX to DHFR after lysis, rather than in intact microsomes, we incubated a separate preparation of microsomes with TMX, washed the pellet, and lysed these microsomes together with DHFR-HC-containing microsomes that had not been exposed to TMX. Digestion of the DHFR-HC fusion by proteinase K was complete in this case (Fig. 1, lane 4), excluding the possibility of carryover of the drug. Hence, DHFR-HC inserted in the ER folds properly and acquires a tight conformation when bound to a folate analogue. We next examined the ability of DHFR-HC to undergo US2/US11-mediated degradation. In previous work we established anin vitro system that recapitulates US2/US11-mediated degradation. The hallmark of this in vitro reaction is the disappearance of glycosylated HLA-A2 HC from the pellet fraction in a US2- or US11-dependent manner. Over time, we observe the appearance of a soluble deglycosylated intermediate released from the microsomal fraction, when incubation is carried out in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor ZLLL (18Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We applied the same in vitro system to DHFR-HC. DHFR-HC mRNA was translated in the presence of microsomes derived from control or US2- or US11-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A). In all three types of microsomes some of the glycosylated DHFR-HC was detected in the supernatants, probably due to inefficient separation of the pellet and supernatant fractions by the conditions of centrifugation used. Therefore, as an indicator of dislocation we considered both the loss of glycosylated DHFR-HC from the pellet fraction and the appearance of the deglycosylated intermediate over time in the supernatant fraction. We did not observe the appearance of a deglycosylated intermediate in the supernatants of U373-derived microsomes (Fig. 2 A,Supernatants, lanes 1 and 2). However, when DHFR-HC was translated into microsomes derived from US2+ and US11+ cells, a polypeptide with higher mobility appeared at the 60-min chase point. This polypeptide corresponds to deglycosylated DHFR-HC and is indicative of a US2/US11-dependent dislocation reaction (Fig. 2 A, Supernatants, lanes 5,6, 9, and 10). As for HLA-A2 HC (18Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), US2+ microsomes support better the dislocation of DHFR-HC than US11+ microsomes, as measured by disappearance from the microsome fraction (Fig. 2 B) and accumulation of the deglycosylated intermediate in the supernatants (Fig. 2 A,Supernatants, lanes 6 and 8 versus lanes 10 and 12). We then measured whether formation of a tightly folded domain inside the ER lumen would impede dislocation. Microsomes were incubated at 30 °C with TMX 30 min prior to the chase to ensure efficient binding of the drug to the DHFR-HC protein. We did not detect inhibition of dislocation of DHFR-HC from microsomes treated with TMX. In fact, we consistently observed a slight but reproducible increase in the amount of deglycosylated intermediate released from US2+ microsomes but not for US11+ microsomes (Fig. 2 A, Supernatants,lane 8 versus 6). We examined a more detailed time course for dislocation of DHFR-HC from US2+ microsomes. At all chase points, the deglycosylated intermediate was more abundant for microsomes treated with TMX when compared with controls (Fig.2 C, lanes 6 versus 2 and 7 versus 3). We conclude that the compactly folded DHFR moiety does not impede dislocation of the DHFR-HC fusion. Unassembled class I MHC heavy chains are recognized by the quality control machinery and are subject to dislocation followed by proteasome-dependent degradation (20Raposo G. van Santen H.M. Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It was therefore necessary to verify that DHFR-HC does not dislocate spontaneously in control cells. U373 cells were transfected with DHFR-HC, and the stability of the fusion protein was monitored by pulse-chase analysis. We also assessed intracellular transport of the fusion protein by performing EndoH digestion. DHFR-HC was stable in control cells even after 3 h of chase (Fig. 3,lanes 1, 3, and 5). While endogenous class I MHC acquired EndoH resistance at 90 min. of chase, the DHFR-HC fusion remains EndoH sensitive even after 3 h of chase (Fig. 3,lanes 2, 4, and 6). Inclusion of TMX affected neither stability nor EndoH sensitivity of the protein (Fig.3, lanes 7–12). We conclude that the DHFR-HC is relatively stable and fails to leave the ER and that the stability of DHFR-HC is not affected by DHFR ligands. To demonstrate binding of TMX to the DHFR domain of DHFR-HC fusion inside the ER lumen, US2DHFR-HC cells were pulsed for 15 min. in the presence or in the absence of TMX followed by immunoprecipitation and treatment with proteinase K. Under these conditions, radiolabeled DHFR-HC corresponds to ER-disposed protein. To control for binding of TMX to the DHFR moiety post-lysis and to assess the efficiency of TMX binding, we performed the experiment as outlined in Fig.4 A. Pulse-labeled cells not exposed to TMX were washed and mixed with the same number of unlabeled cells incubated with TMX. If binding of TMX to the DHFR-HC fusion would occur post-lysis by carryover of the drug, one should expect to see stabilization of labeled fusion protein obtained from cells not exposed to TMX (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2). As a negative control, 35S-labeled US2DHFR-HC cells were mixed with unlabeled cells not exposed to TMX (Fig. 4 A,lanes 3 and 4). Upon proteinase K digestion of anti-heavy chain immunoprecipitates exposed post-lysis to TMX, a 21-kDa band appeared, indicating some carryover of TMX (Fig. 4 B,lane 2). In addition, we included a control for maximal binding of TMX to the DHFR moiety (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7 and 8). US2DHFR-HC cells were pulse-labeled in the presence of TMX, washed, and lysed. We then added TMX directly to the lysates to obtain maximal exposure of the DHFR domain to TMX. Under these conditions DHFR was stabilized significantly better (Fig. 4 B, lane 8). We quantified the binding of each condition by calculating the ratio of the 21-kDa digestion product over the intact DHFR-HC. The ratio for maximal binding, in which TMX was added to lysates, was defined as 100% binding. Binding of TMX to DHFR-HC was 86.5% of the maximal binding observed in a detergent lysate and at least 3-fold higher than binding post-lysis (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that binding of TMX to the DHFR domain of DHFR-HC fusion occurs pre-lysis inside the ER lumen. We performed pulse-chase experiments to monitor the dislocation of DHFR-HC coexpressed with US2. We saw that pulse-labeled DHFR-HC expressed in US2DHFR-HC disappeared completely within 1 h of chase (not shown). In the presence of proteasome inhibitor, glycosylated DHFR-HC was converted to the deglycosylated intermediate (Fig.5 B). To test whether TMX affects the dislocation rate in live cells, US2DHFR-HCcells were pulse-labeled for 5 min and chased for the indicated times in the absence (Fig. 5 A) or presence (Fig. 5 B) of proteasome inhibitors. In the absence of proteasome inhibitors, DHFR-HC was mostly degraded after 20 min of chase (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–3). In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor ZL3VS, we observed the conversion of DHFR-HC to the deglycosylated intermediate (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10–12). As a control, we treated cells with MTX, for which its hydrophilicity should exclude it from the ER, to account for possible effects downstream of dislocation, which might include the inability of folded DHFR to be targeted for proteasomal degradation as efficiently as DHFR not exposed to MTX (22Johnston J.A. Johnson E.S. Waller P.R. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We did not observe any effect of TMX or MTX on the dislocation rate of DHFR-HC, regardless of the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–9 and Fig. 5 B, lanes 13–18). If extremely rapid unfolding occurred at 37 °C, then perhaps a chase at room temperature might slow down the process. Even at room temperature, DHFR-HC was dislocated at a rate similar to that seen for the endogenous HC. We did not detect any effect on dislocation upon inclusion of TMX (not shown). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that complete unfolding is not required for dislocation. In keeping with our earlier observations, inclusion of TMX did not change the subcellular localization of the DHFR-HC fusion. The deglycosylated fusion product fractionated with the cytosolic compartment, irrespective of the folded state of the DHFR moiety (Fig.5 C, lane 8 versus 6). We conclude that the DHFR-HC fusion behaves like the endogenous Class I heavy chains as far as US2-mediated dislocation is concerned. Importantly, the folded state of the DHFR domain does not interfere with ER dislocation. To exclude the possibility that rapid unfolding in the ER precedes dislocation despite the binding of TMX, we examined the resistance of the DHFR-HC fusion protein to proteinase K when chased in the presence or absence of TMX. US2DHFR-HC cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min in the presence of TMX, washed twice with PBS, and chased for 60 min to ensure complete conversion of glycosylated DHFR-HC to the deglycosylated intermediate, a reaction that occurs in the cytoplasm. Following TMX removal, cells were chased in the presence (Fig.6 A, lanes 11 and12) or absence (lanes 9 and 10) of TMX. DHFR-HC was immunoprecipitated and digested with proteinase K. To achieve maximal binding of TMX to the DHFR moiety, TMX was included throughout the pulse and chase as well as added into the lysis buffer (Fig. 6 A, lanes 13 and 14). This level of binding was defined as 100% binding. Resistance of DHFR-HC to proteinase K when TMX was present during the pulse and chase was 72% of maximal binding (Fig. 6 B), 62% when TMX was present only during the pulse period, and removed by washing prior to the 60-min chase. We also measured the binding of TMX to DHFR-HC during the pulse. US2DHFR-HC cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min in the presence of TMX. Cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and proteinase K digestion (Fig.6 A, lanes 3 and 4). Addition of TMX during the pulse stabilized DHFR-HC to 75% of level seen when TMX was added to the lysate (Fig. 6 A, lanes 5 and6, and Fig. 6 B). Neither ER-resident DHFR-HC nor the deglycosylated intermediate were stabilized when TMX was omitted (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1 and 2, and7 and 8). The similar levels of stabilization of DHFR-HC conferred by TMX in all three conditions indicates that binding of TMX to the DHFR domain of DHFR-HC fusion during the pulse accounts for most of the binding observed at the end of the chase period when TMX is removed by washing. Therefore, TMX binds to DHFR in the ER and interacts stably with DHFR-HC in the course of dislocation. The US2-mediated dislocation of Class I MHC heavy chains from the ER involves a viral product that interacts with the correctly folded protein, as inferred from the crystal structure of the US2-HC·β2m complex (23Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This interaction diverts the HC and US2 itself with remarkably rapid kinetics (half-life of 3–5 min) back to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. When the proteasome is blocked, the HC accumulates in the cytosol as a deglycosylated intermediate (24Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

https://openalex.org/W2069077882,"The bactericidal activity of mouse Paneth cell αdefensins, or cryptdins, is dependent on processing of cryptdin precursors (pro-Crps) by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (Wilson, C. L., Ouellette, A. J., Satchell, D. P., Ayabe, T., Lopez-Boado, Y. S., Stratman, J. L., Hultgren, S. J., Matrisian, L. M., and Parks, W. C. (1999) Science 286, 113–117). To investigate the mechanisms of pro-Crp processing by this enzyme, recombinant pro-Crp4, a His-tagged chimeric pro-Crp (pro-CC), and site-directed mutant precursors of each were digested with MMP-7, and the cleavage products were analyzed by NH2-terminal peptide sequencing. Proteolysis of pro-Crp4 with MMP-7 activated in vitrobactericidal activity to the level of the mature Crp4 peptide by cleaving pro-Crp4 at Ser43↓Ile44 and Ala53↓Leu54 in the proregion and near the Crp4 peptide NH2 terminus between Ser58↓Leu59. Because the Crp4 NH2terminus occurs at Gly61, not Leu59, MMP-7 is necessary but insufficient to complete the processing of Crp4. Crp activating proteolysis at S58↓L59 was unaffected by I44S/I44D or L54S/L54D loss-of-function mutations in pro-Crp4, and a (L59S)-pro-CC mutant was cleaved normally at Ser43↓Val44and Ser53↓Leu54 sites but not at the peptide NH2 terminus. C57BL/6 mice contain an abundant (L59S)-Crp4 mutant peptide with Leu54 at its NH2 terminus resulting from Ala53↓Leu54 cleavage and loss-of-function at the Ser58↓Ser59 cleavage site. Thus, α-defensins resulting from mutations at MMP-7 cleavage sites exist in mouse populations. A pro-CC substrate containing both L54S and L59S mutations resisted cleavage at Ser43↓Val44 completely, showing that cleavage at one or both downstream sites must precede proteolysis at Ser43↓Val44. These findings show that MMP-7 activation of pro-Crps can occur without proteolysis of the proregion, and prosegment fragmentation depends, at least in part, on the release of the Crp peptide from the precursor. The bactericidal activity of mouse Paneth cell αdefensins, or cryptdins, is dependent on processing of cryptdin precursors (pro-Crps) by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (Wilson, C. L., Ouellette, A. J., Satchell, D. P., Ayabe, T., Lopez-Boado, Y. S., Stratman, J. L., Hultgren, S. J., Matrisian, L. M., and Parks, W. C. (1999) Science 286, 113–117). To investigate the mechanisms of pro-Crp processing by this enzyme, recombinant pro-Crp4, a His-tagged chimeric pro-Crp (pro-CC), and site-directed mutant precursors of each were digested with MMP-7, and the cleavage products were analyzed by NH2-terminal peptide sequencing. Proteolysis of pro-Crp4 with MMP-7 activated in vitrobactericidal activity to the level of the mature Crp4 peptide by cleaving pro-Crp4 at Ser43↓Ile44 and Ala53↓Leu54 in the proregion and near the Crp4 peptide NH2 terminus between Ser58↓Leu59. Because the Crp4 NH2terminus occurs at Gly61, not Leu59, MMP-7 is necessary but insufficient to complete the processing of Crp4. Crp activating proteolysis at S58↓L59 was unaffected by I44S/I44D or L54S/L54D loss-of-function mutations in pro-Crp4, and a (L59S)-pro-CC mutant was cleaved normally at Ser43↓Val44and Ser53↓Leu54 sites but not at the peptide NH2 terminus. C57BL/6 mice contain an abundant (L59S)-Crp4 mutant peptide with Leu54 at its NH2 terminus resulting from Ala53↓Leu54 cleavage and loss-of-function at the Ser58↓Ser59 cleavage site. Thus, α-defensins resulting from mutations at MMP-7 cleavage sites exist in mouse populations. A pro-CC substrate containing both L54S and L59S mutations resisted cleavage at Ser43↓Val44 completely, showing that cleavage at one or both downstream sites must precede proteolysis at Ser43↓Val44. These findings show that MMP-7 activation of pro-Crps can occur without proteolysis of the proregion, and prosegment fragmentation depends, at least in part, on the release of the Crp peptide from the precursor. matrix metalloproteinase-7 cryptdin procryptdin matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography acid urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid colony forming units chimeric pro-Crp The release of endogenous antimicrobial peptides by mammalian epithelial cells contributes to innate mucosal immunity (1Huttner K.M.

In the small intestine of most mammals, Paneth cells that reside at the base of the crypts synthesize and secrete microbicidal α-defensins, termed cryptdins in mice, as components of apical secretory granules (3Porter E.M.

Cryptdin peptides constitute ∼70% of the bactericidal peptide activity released by mouse Paneth cells, and cryptdin concentration at the point of secretion is at least 1000 times greater than the minimal bactericidal concentration of the peptides (9Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Google Scholar). The production of functional α-defensins involves proteolytic processing of inactive precursor forms by mechanisms that differ between mice and humans (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar,11Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Google Scholar). α-Defensins are processed from inactive proforms by specific proteolytic cleavage steps. Both neutrophil and Paneth cell α-defensins derive from ∼10-kDa prepropeptides that contain canonical signal sequences, acidic proregions, and a ∼3.5-kDa mature α-defensin peptide in the COOH-terminal portion of the precursor. Most pro-α-defensins are fully processed in mature phagocytic leukocytes (12Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Google Scholar, 13Ganz T. Liu L. Valore E.V. Oren A. Blood. 1993; 82: 641-650Google Scholar), and processing of myeloid α-defensin precursors occurs within 4–24 h after synthesis by apparently sequential events that produce major intermediates of 75 and 56 amino acids (12Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Google Scholar, 13Ganz T. Liu L. Valore E.V. Oren A. Blood. 1993; 82: 641-650Google Scholar, 14Michaelson D. Rayner J. Couto M. Ganz T. J.

Deletions in the prosegment adjacent to the proregion-defensin junction impaired post-translational processing of human neutrophil pro-α-defensins when expressed heterologously in mouse 32DCL3 cells (13Ganz T. Liu L. Valore E.V. Oren A. Blood. 1993; 82: 641-650Google Scholar). The anionic propeptide segments also appear to neutralize the cationic COOH-terminal defensin peptides, as suggested by the inhibition of in vitro α-defensin bactericidal activity when intact proregions are added in trans (5Ayabe T.

Human Paneth cells store HD-5 α-defensin in precursor form that is converted rapidly by trypsin to the mature HD-5 peptide after secretion (10Cunliffe R.N. Rose F.R. Keyte J. Abberley L. Chan W.C. Mahida Y.R. Gut. 2001; 48: 176-185Google Scholar, 11Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 272-276Google Scholar), but mouse Paneth cell pro-Crps are processed and activated by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (matrilysin, MMP-7,1 EC 3.4.24.23) by intracellular processing events that precede secretion (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar). In mouse small intestine, MMP-7 is expressed only by Paneth cells (17Wilson C.L. Heppner K.J. Rudolph L.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 851-869Google Scholar), where the enzyme activates all α-defensins from 8.4-kDa proforms (18Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar). Previously, both procryptdin-1 (pro-Crp1) and a COOH-terminal His6 tagged pro-Crp chimera (pro-CC) containing sequence from pro-Crp1, pro-Crp4, and pro-Crp15 were shown to be activated to 3.5 kDa α-defensins in vitro by MMP-7-catalyzed cleavage at conserved sites in the proregion and at the junction of the propeptide and the NH2 terminus of the mature cryptdin peptide (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar, 18Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar). In those studies, MMP-7 was found to cleave between Ser43↓Val44 in the prosegment and at Ser58↓Leu59, where Leu59 is the NH2-terminal residue for all known mouse cryptdins except Crp4 and Crp5 (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar). Additional preliminary evidence showed that MMP-7 cleaved pro-Crp4 at Ala53↓Leu54 (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar), a site that corresponds to processing intermediates isolated from mouse small intestine (19Putsep K. Axelsson L.G. Boman A. Midtvedt T. Normark S. Boman H.G. Andersson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40478-40482Google Scholar). Thus, mouse pro-Crps contain conserved sites within the precursor proregion that MMP-7 recognizes and cleaves, but their role in pro-Crp activation is uncharacterized. In this study, cryptdin biosynthesis was investigated by analyzing the processing of recombinant pro-Crps by MMP-7 in vitro. We focused on Crp4, because it is the most bactericidal mouse α-defensin, and comparisons of pro-Crp4 cleavage with cleavage of the pro-Crp chimera pro-CC allowed the generality of MMP-7 site usage to be assessed. The products of in vitro pro-Crp cleavage by MMP-7 and the effects of eliminating the proregion processing sites by site-directed mutagenesis have been determined. The results show that cryptdin activation by cleavage of the peptide bond at the peptide NH2 terminus is independent of proteolysis within the prosegment; however, cleavage upstream at Ser43↓Val44 is dependent on cleavage downstream at the Ser58↓Leu59 or Ala/Ser53↓Leu54 sites. Also, C57BL/6 mice accumulate Crp4-related processing intermediates that result from loss-of-function mutations at MMP-7 processing sites. All procedures on mice were performed with approval and in compliance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), and Washington University School of Medicine. Six-week-old adult male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc. (North Wilmington, MA). MMP-7 null mice were 6–8-week-old males backcrossed for 10 generations onto the C57BL/6 background. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility under 12 h cycles of light and dark and had free access to standard rat chow and water. Recombinant pro-Crp4 and pro-Crp4 variants with mutated MMP-7 recognition sites were prepared using the pET-28a expression system to produce NH2-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins (Novagen, Madison, WI). By PCR amplification, a Met-coding trideoxynucleotide was incorporated 5′ of codon 20 in the Crp4 precursor cDNA and cloned in-frame with the amino-terminal His6 in the EcoRI/SalI sites of pET-28a. For cloning pro-Crp4, forward primer pETPCr4-F (5′-GCGCGAATTCATGGATCCTATCCAAAACACA) was paired with reverse primer SLpMALCrp4R (5′-ATATATGTCGACTGTTCAGCGGCGGGGGCAGCAGTACAA), corresponding to nucleotides 104–119 and 301–327 in prepro-Crp4 cDNA (20Ouellette A.J. Darmoul D. Tran D. Huttner K.M. Yuan J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6643-6651Google Scholar). Reactions were performed using the GeneAmp PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by incubating the reaction mixture at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by successive cycles at 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The underlined codon in the pETPCr4-F primer denotes a Met codon that was introduced immediately upstream of the pro-Crp4 NH2-terminal Asp residue to incorporate a CNBr cleavage site. Following PCR amplification, samples (25 μl) of individual reactions were gel purified using 2% agarose gels, and extracted using QIAEX II (Qiagen Inc., Valencia CA). In most cases, amplification products were cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO, sequenced, digested with EcoRI andSalI, and gel-purified EcoRI/SalI inserts were ligated into EcoRI and SalI-digested pET-28a plasmid DNA, and transformed into bothEscherichia coli XL-2 Blue and BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Recombinant proteins were expressed for 6 h at 37 °C inE. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells growing exponentially in Terrific Broth medium by induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside under kanamycin selection. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Cells were lysed in 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), and clarified by centrifugation in a Sorvall SA-600 rotor at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Fusion proteins were purified immediately after lysate clarification. Recombinant precursor fusion proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) resin affinity chromatography and recovered from fusions after CNBr cleavage. His-tagged fusion proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA resin with 2 column volumes of buffer consisting of 6 m guanidine HCl, 1m imidazole, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.0). Fusion proteins, containing an NH2-terminal His6 tag, a 26-amino acid spacer, and pro-Crp4, were dialyzed against 5% acetic acid and lyophilized. Lyophilized proteins dissolved in 80% formic acid were adjusted to 10 mg/ml CNBr in 80% formic acid and incubated under N2 overnight at room temperature. Cleavage was terminated by addition of 10 volumes of H2O, proteins were lyophilized, dissolved in 5% acetic acid, and purified by C-18 RP-HPLC by eluting peptides over 120 min with an 20–40% acetonitrile gradient. The identities of recombinant pro-Crp4 molecules were verified by MALDI-TOF MS at the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility and by acid-urea PAGE (21Selsted M.E. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into recombinant pro-Crp4 molecules by PCR. In reaction 1, the mutant forward primer, e.g. pc4I44Dfor, containing the mutant codon flanked by three natural codons was paired with SLpMALCrp4R, the normal reverse primer at the 3′-end of the desired sequence. In reaction 2, the mutant reverse primer, e.g.pc4I44Drev, the exact complement of the mutant forward primer, was paired with the normal forward primer pETPCr4-F at the 5′-end of the desired sequence, and sequences were amplified from the pET-28a pro-Crp4 construct as described above: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by successive cycles at 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Products from reactions 1 and 2 were purified electrophoretically, and 0.5-μl samples of gel-purified DNA were combined as templates in PCR reaction 3, using normal external primers, SLpMALCrp4R and pETPCr4-F, as amplimers. The full-length, mutated pro-Crp4 product of reaction 3 was cloned sequentially into the vectors pCR2.1-TOPO and pET-28a as noted above, and all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing prior to expression. The following forward and reverse internal primers were used to introduce mutations into pro-Crp4. To eliminate the Ser43↓Ile44 MMP-7 cleavage site, the following mutant constructs were prepared: (I44D)-pro-Crp4 using forward primer pc4I44Dfor (5′-CAGGCTGTGTCTGACTCCTTTGGAGGC) and reverse primer pc4I44Drev (5′-GCCTCCAAAGGAGTCAGACACAGCCTG); (I44S)-pro-Crp4 using forward primer pc4I44Sfor (5′-CAGGCTGTGTCTTCCTCCTTTGGAGGC) and reverse primer pc4I44Srev (GCCTCCAAAGGAGGAAGACACAGCCTG); (V42D-S43E-I44D-S45E-F46D)-pro-Crp4 ((DEDED)-pro-Crp4) using forward primer petPC4DEDEDfor (5′-GAGGACCAGGCTGACGAAGACGAAGACGGAGGCCAAGAA) and reverse primer petPC4D EDEDrev (5′-TTCTTGGCCTCCGTCTTCGTCTTCGTCAGCCTGGTC CTC). To eliminate the MMP-7 cleavage site at Ala53-Val54, the following mutant pro-Crp4 constructs were prepared: (L54D)-pro-Crp4, using forward primer pc4L54Dfor (5′-GAAGGGTCTGCTGA CCATGAAAAATCT) and reverse primer pc4L54Drev (5′-AGATTTTTCATGGTCAGCAGACCCTTC); (L54S)-pro-Crp4, using forward primer pc4L54Sfor (5′-GAAGGGTCTGCTTCCCATGAAAAATCT) and reverse primer pc4L54Srev (AGATTTTTCATGGGAAGCAGACCCTTC). To ablate both the Ser43-Ile44 and Ala53-Leu54 MMP-7 cleavage sites, (DEDED)-pro-Crp4 was used as template for mutagenesis of the Ala53-Leu54 site using the (L54D)-pro-Crp4 primers pc4L54Dfor and pc4L54Drev described above to produce (DEDED/L54D)-pro-Crp4. The pro-CC construct for production in the baculovirus expression system has been described (18Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar). Briefly, prepro-Crp15 cDNA was amplified using a forward primer derived from sequence encoding the signal peptide and a reverse primer that changed a Met residue in the COOH terminus of the mature peptide to a Thr (characteristic of Crp1). In addition, the COOH-terminal Arg residue of the precursor was converted to Pro-Arg-Arg-His-His-His-His-His-His; Pro-Arg-Arg is the Crp4 COOH-terminal sequence. The amplified sequence was cloned into the transfer vector pVL1393 and transfected into Sf9 insect cells along with BaculoGold DNA (BD Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA) to produce recombinant baculovirus. Following a 4–5-day infection of HighFive insect cells (Stratagene) with recombinant baculovirus, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Pellets were thawed and lysed in 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mmsodium phosphate (pH 8), and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). Lysates were passed several times through an 18-gauge needle and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated batchwise at room temperature with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 1–3 h with mixing. Bound His-tagged precursor was eluted with 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 4.5), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 4.5), and 1% Triton X-100 in 0.5–1.0-ml fractions. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Protein concentration and purity were assessed by reducing Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and GelCode Blue (Pierce) staining. If further purification was required, proteins were concentrated to 0.6 ml using Centricon YM-3 centrifugal filter devices and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR/10/30 column connected to anÄKTAFPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As with pro-Crp4, mutations were introduced into recombinant pro-CC by PCR. To generate the L59S mutation, the forward primer used originally to construct pro-CC, CRPBam-F (5′-GCGGATCCTCCTGCTCACCAATCCTCCA-3′) was paired with the mutant reverse primer CRP-L59S (5′-ACCAGATCTCTCGACGATTCCTCT-3′), where the underlined sequence corresponds to BamHI and BglII restriction sites, respectively. Conditions for amplification from the pro-CC template were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. The 220-bp product was cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen); theBamHI-BglII fragment from this plasmid construct was used to replace the BamHI-BglII fragment in the pro-CC cDNA in pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega). The full-length (L59S)-pro-CC cDNA, flanked by BamHI andEcoRI sites, was then transferred to the pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector using these two restriction enzymes. To add the L54S mutation, pGEM7-(L59S)-pro-CC was used as a template for forward primer CRPBam-F and mutant reverse primer CRPL54/59SBglII-R containing aBglII restriction site (underlined) (5′-AGATCTCTCGACGATTCCTCTTGACTAGAAGAGCC-3′). Amplification parameters were similar to those used for (L59S)-pro-CC except that the annealing temperature was increased to 65 °C and the number of cycles was reduced to 25. The 220-bp product was subcloned into pVL1393 as described above for pro-CCL59S. To eliminate only the Ser43↓Val44 and Ser53↓Leu54 MMP-7 cleavage sites in pro-CC, a two-step process was used. First, the forward primer CRPBam-F was paired with the mutant reverse primer CRPL54SBglII-R (5′-AGATCTCTCAACGATTCCTCTTGACTAGAAG AGCC-3′), where theBglII restriction is underlined. The PCR product was subcloned and transferred to pGEM7-pro-CC as described above. In the second step, this new construct, pGEM7-(L54S)-pro-CC, was used as a template for the mutant forward primer CRPV44SbbsI-F (5′-GAAGACGACCAGGCTGTGTCTTCCTCTTTTGGAGAC-3′), where theBbsI restriction site is underlined, and a normal downstream primer containing a PstI restriction site (underlined), CRPPstI-R (5′-CTGCAGGTCCCATTTATGTGT-3′). The 130-bp product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO; theBbsI-PstI fragment from this construct was used to replace the BbsI-PstI fragment in pGEM7-(L54S)-pro-CC. Full-length cDNA from the resulting plasmid, pGEM7-(V44SL54S)-pro-CC, was subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pVL1393. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing prior to expression. A naturally existing α-defensin that has a L59S mutation was purified from C57BL/6 mice, and the corresponding precursor to that Crp4(B6a) variant was isolated from MMP-7 null mouse small intestine by extraction with 30% acetic acid as described (5Ayabe T.

Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar). Protein samples were applied to analytical C-18 RP-HPLC columns (Vydac 218TP54) in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted at ∼35 min using a 10–45% acetonitrile gradient developed over 55 min. Protein fractions containing apparent pro-Crp4 were analyzed by acid urea-(AU)-PAGE as described (18Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar, 21Selsted M.E. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York1993Google Scholar), and their identities were deduced from a combination of NH2-terminal peptide sequencing, MALDI-TOF-MS, and comparisons with the corresponding cDNA sequence in RIKEN (accession number AK008107). Purification of the Crp4 mutant and corresponding pro-Crp was completed subsequently by C-18 reverse phase-HPLC using a 120-min, 20–40% acetonitrile gradient, from which cryptdin precursors eluted between 23 and 30% acetonitrile. Peptide concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Peptide samples were lyophilized, dissolved in 20 μl of 5% acetic acid containing 3.0 m urea, and electrophoresed on 12.5% AU-PAGE for 1 h at 100 V and for 3.5 h at 250 V (21Selsted M.E. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie R-250 after fixation in formalin-containing acetic acid/methanol. Crp4 and pro-Crp4 were identified by co-migration with authentic mouse Crps and pro-Crps in AU-PAGE (>0.6 × R F of methyl green dye) as described (22Selsted M.E. Becker 3rd, H.W. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 270-274Google Scholar) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and NH2- terminal sequencing. For reduction and alkylation, recombinant peptides dissolved at 500 μg/ml in 6m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) were reduced with dithiothreitol at 50 °C for 3–4 h using 5 mol of dithiothreitol per mol of polypeptide cysteine. After cooling, a 3-fold mass excess of iodoacetic acid to dithiothreitol was added to the reduced peptide solution, incubated for 10 min, and residual iodoacetic acid was reacted with excess dithiothreitol. The native and alkylated peptides were purified on C-18 RP-HPLC, and the molecular masses were determined by MALDI-TOF MS, followed by NH2-terminal sequencing in the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Recombinant pro-Crp4 and pro-CC molecules were digested with MMP-7, analyzed by AU-PAGE and SDS-PAGE, and samples of the proteolytic digests were analyzed by NH2-terminal sequencing. Samples (1 μg) of pro-Crp4 and all variants, as well as pro-CC and corresponding variants, were incubated with activated recombinant human MMP-7 (0.3–1.0 μg) catalytic domain (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, or Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 for 18–24 h at 37 °C. Samples of pro-Crp4 digests were analyzed by AU-PAGE, and ∼200 ng quantities of complete digests were subjected to 5 or more cycles of NH2-terminal peptide sequencing at the UCI Biomedical Protein and Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Pro-CC digests were analyzed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide), and bands were visualized using GelCodeTM Blue staining reagent (Pierce). For NH2-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation, 3 μg of precursor incubated with MMP-7 were separated by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred to and visualized on mini-ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Also, samples of the Crp1 prosegment corresponding to residues 19–58 in prepro-Crp1 (23Huttner K.M. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Genomics. 1994; 19: 448-453Google Scholar, 24Ouellette A.J. Hsieh M.M.

The Crp1 proregion consisting of the primary structure, DPIQNTDEETKTEEQPGEDDQAVSVSFGDPEGTSLQEES, was synthesized by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., (Hopkinton, MA). The composition and properties of the synthetic prosegment has been reported previously (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar). The activation of pro-Crp4 was assayed by conducting bactericidal peptide assays with pro-Crp4 following digestion with MMP-7 under conditions of quantitative cleavage at Leu59(above). Samples consisting of exponentially growing bacterial cells (∼1 × 106 colony forming units (CFU)/ml) were incubated with 0–20 μg/ml Crp4 or pro-Crp4 with or without MMP-7-mediated proteolysis (above). After 60 min at 37 °C, 20 μl of each incubation mixture was diluted 1:1000 with 10 mmPIPES (pH 7.4), and 50 μl of the diluted samples were plated on trypticase soy agar using a Spiral Biotech Autoplate 4000 (Spiral Biotech Inc., Bethesda, MD). Surviving bacteria were quantitated as colony forming units on plates after incubation at 37 °C for 12 h. Pro-Crp4 is cleaved by MMP-7 at sites corresponding to those identified previously in natural pro-Crps (5Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Google Scholar). Recombinant pro-Crp4 molecules expressed in E. coli were purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC (Fig.1). Because the pro-Crp4 protein lacks methionine, CNBr provided a means for quantitative chemical cleavage of affinity purified fusion proteins from which the pro-Crp4 component could be separated from the His-tagged fusion partner by sequential RP-HPLC fractionation. The mass of the pro-Crp4 molecule was verified by MALDI-TOF-MS to be 8231 atomic mass units, and its homogeneity was judged by analytical RP-HPLC, AU-PAGE, and NH2-terminal sequencing. The sequence DPIQNT … , the consensus for mouse pro-α-defensins, was the only NH2terminus detected. Also, cleavage of recombinant pro-Crp4 with MMP-7in vitro produced a single evident product that migrated only slightly slower than Crp4 in AU-PAGE gels and was comparable with Crp4 in bactericidal activity (Fig. 1). Previously, Paneth cell α-defensin precursor substrates isolated from MMP-7 null mouse small intestine were cleaved in vitro with MMP-7, identifying cleavage sites at Ser43↓Val44 and Ser58↓Leu59"

The crystallographic structure of the cdb3 dimer has revealed that residues 175–185 assume a β-hairpin loop similar to a putative ankyrin-binding motif at the cytoplasmic surface of the Na+/K+-ATPase. To test whether this hairpin loop constitutes an ankyrin-binding site on cdb3, we have deleted amino acids 175–185 and substituted the 11-residue loop with a Gly-Gly dipeptide that bridges the deletion without introducing strain into the structure. Although the deletion mutant undergoes the same native conformational changes exhibited by wild type cdb3 and binds other peripheral proteins normally, the mutant exhibits no affinity for ankyrin. This suggests that the exposed β-hairpin turn indeed constitutes a major ankyrin-binding site on cdb3. Other biochemical studies suggest that ankyrin also docks at the NH2 terminus of band 3. Thus, antibodies to the NH2 terminus of cdb3 block ankyrin binding to the cdb3, and ankyrin binding to cdb3 prevents p72syk phosphorylation of cdb3 at its NH2 terminus (predominantly at Tyr-8). However, a truncation mutant of cdb3 lacking the NH2-terminal 50 residues displays the same binding affinity as wild type cdb3.

Ankyrin is folded into three independent domains that include an 89-kDa NH2-terminal membrane-binding domain, followed by a 62-kDa spectrin-binding domain and a COOH-terminal regulatory domain. The membrane-binding domain of ankyrin consists of 24 tandem repeats of a 33-amino acid motif known as the ankyrin repeat that is involved in protein recognition (11Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V.

Because ankyrin interacts with a highly diverse group of membrane proteins, much effort has been devoted to identifying the structural features that mediate these interactions (15Devarajan P.

The major linkage between the membrane bilayer and spectrin-based cortical skeleton in erythrocytes is mediated by ankyrin binding to band 3. Because previous studies (19Thevinin B.J.-M.

Thus, modification of Cys-201 and/or Cys-317 of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was found to compromise ankyrin binding (19Thevinin B.J.-M. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against residues 190–203 (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 174–186 (21Davis L. Lux S.E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were also shown to block the ankyrin interaction. Ankyrin association was further found to protect residues 175–186 of cdb3 from proteolysis (21Davis L. Lux S.E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chimera analysis also implicated participation of residues 155–195 (22Ding Y. Kobayashi S. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22494-22498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar studies have suggested a contribution from the NH2terminus of cdb3 in the ankyrin interaction (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for NH2-terminal involvement has come from the observation that kidney cdb3, which lacks residues 1–65, exhibits no affinity for ankyrin (23Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, ankyrin association inhibits phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (predominantly Tyr-8) at the NH2 terminus of band 3 (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would appear from these considerations that ankyrin may associate with two disparate regions of cdb3, a region near residues 175–190 and sequences near the NH2 terminus. With the recent publication of the crystal structure of cdb3 (25Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has become possible to ask more precise questions regarding the docking site of ankyrin on cdb3. In this study, we have noted that a stem-loop structure, which is conformationally similar to a proposed ankyrin-binding site on the Na+/K+-ATPase (26Zhang Z. Devarajan P. Dorfman A.L. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 1998: 18681-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is located within the general region defined by the earlier mapping studies of Willardson et al. (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Davis et al. (21Davis L. Lux S.E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have, therefore, decided to evaluate whether this stem-loop structure might constitute a critical conformational motif involved in ankyrin-band 3 association. Because of previous evidence for NH2-terminal involvement, we have also explored the nature of the participation of the region in ankyrin binding in greater detail. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized and used for site-directed mutagenesis. For deletion of amino acids 175–185 and substitution of 2 glycines in their place, 5′-ggccctggggggtgtgaagggtggacagcctctgctcccccaac3-′ (2 glycine residues are underlined). A His6 tag was introduced at the COOH terminus of cdb3 in a pT7–7 plasmid (27Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and used as the template. For deletion of amino acids 1–50, PCR was performed using two primers: forward, 5′-ggaattccatatgcacccgggtacccacgaggtc3-′ (start codon and amino acids 51 are underlined); reverse, 5′-agaaagctttcagtggtggtggtggtggtggaagagctggcctgtctgctg3-′ (stop codon and 6 histidine residues are underlined). The resulting mutant cDNAs were sequenced to verify mutations. Plasmids were then transferred into BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells for expression of the mutated cdb3 proteins. Both wild type and mutant cdb3s with a COOH-terminal His tag were expressed in the pT7–7 bacterial expression system using isopropylthiogalactoside induction for 3 h at 37 °C. The His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Intact ankyrin was purified and radiolabeled using 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent as described by Bennett (28Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The 46.5-kDa fragment of ankyrin (residues 403–827) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3)/pLysS (the expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. Vann Bennett) and purified as described by Davis and Bennett (29Davis L. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-tagged 46.5 kDa ankyrin construct was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Michaely at the University of Texas Southwestern, and the GST-tagged protein 4.1 construct was a generous gift of Dr. Narla Mohandas. GST-tagged proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences). The pH dependence of the Stokes radius of cdb3, which increases by more than 11 Å between pH levels 6.5 and 9.5, was evaluated as previously reported (30Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 269: 13070-13076Google Scholar, 31Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except the fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column used consisted of prepacked Superdex 200HR 10/30 (AmershamBiosciences). The pH dependence of intrinsic fluorescence emission of cdb3, which more than doubles between pH levels 6.5 and 9.5, was measured at 340 nm in solutions of 50 mm sodium borate, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 70 mm NaCl adjusted to desired pH levels using an Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and slit widths set at 6 nm. Purified His-tagged wild type or mutant cdb3 was mixed with increasing concentrations of ankyrin at 4 °C overnight in 7.5 mm phosphate buffer containing 10% sucrose, 90 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at pH 7. Pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads were incubated with the mixture for 30 min at 4 °C and washed six times with the same buffer. The bound complexes of cdb3-ankyrin were eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The quantity of bound ankyrin was then evaluated by either a quantitative dot-blot assay using an anti-ankyrin antibody, or by measuring the radioactive counts in the eluate whenever125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled ankyrin was employed, or by measuring GST activity for GST-ankyrin fusion constructs. The GST substrate (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5/1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene/1 mm reduced glutathione) was added to the eluants and the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded to determine the amount of bound GST-ankyrin (32Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that equivalent amounts of His-tagged wild type and mutant cdb3 were bound to the Ni2+ beads, eluants were assayed for bound cdb3 using an anti-cdb3 antibody. Binding of GST-30 kDa 4.1 (a GST fusion construct of the cdb3-binding domain of protein 4.1) to cdb3 was determined by the same method, except the pH of the incubation buffer was adjusted to pH 7.4. Peptides corresponding to residues 175–185 of human cdb3 were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA). An additional cysteine was added to the NH2 and COOH termini of the peptide for subsequent formation of a disulfide bridge between the ends of the peptide in an effort to mimic the hairpin loop seen in the crystal structure. Increasing concentrations of peptide were then mixed with ankyrin prior to addition of cdb3, and the binding assay was performed as described above. As noted in the Introduction, a proposed ankyrin-binding site on the cytoplasmic pole of the Na+/K+-ATPase (26Zhang Z. Devarajan P. Dorfman A.L. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 1998: 18681-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar) appears structurally similar to a β-hairpin loop revealed in the crystal structure of cdb3 (Fig.1). To evaluate whether this hairpin loop comprising residues 175–185 of cdb3 might serve as an ankyrin-binding site, the residues forming the hairpin loop were deleted and a diglycine bridge was substituted in their place. Thus, based on the 4.9 Å distance separating amino acids 175 and 185 in the crystal structure, two glycines were calculated to optimally span the gap without introducing strain into the mutated protein molecule. This deletion mutant was then expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity for further characterization. To confirm that the conformation of the above deletion mutant was not globally perturbed, the reversible pH-dependent conformational change characteristic of native cdb3 was examined (30Low P.S. Westfall M.A. Allen D.P. Appell K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 269: 13070-13076Google Scholar,31Appell K.C. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11104-11111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as the pH is raised from 6.5 to 9.5, the Stokes radius of native cdb3 enlarges by more than 11 Å and the intrinsic fluorescence, which is highly quenched at lower pH, more than doubles. As seen in Fig. 2 A, titration of the deletion mutant from pH 6.5 to 9.5 yields the expected fluorescence increase of 2-fold. Further, comparison of the Stokes radius increase of the mutant and wild type cdb3 as a function of increasing pH reveals the same dimensional changes in both proteins (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrate that the deletion mutant retains the same structural properties as wild type cdb3. To further establish that truncation of the β-hairpin loop causes only a localized change in cdb3 structure, the interaction of cdb3 with protein 4.1, a second major peripheral protein ligand of cdb3 was examined. For this purpose, recombinant GST-30 kDa 4.1 was expressed and purified in E. coli. By means of a His tag pull-down assay, where purified His-tagged cdb3 was allowed to associate with GST-30 kDa 4.1 and the complex was pelleted with the help of Ni2+ beads, the affinity of mutated cdb3 for 4.1 was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the amount of bound protein 4.1 associated with mutant cdb3, as measured from the GST activity in the pellet, was the same as the quantity of protein 4.1 associating with wild type cdb3, confirming that deletion of the β-hairpin loop induces no global change in cdb3 conformation. Further, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a glycolytic enzyme that binds to cdb3 and becomes inhibited upon binding, was also examined for any change in interaction with the mutant cdb3. As demonstrated in the customary glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibition assay (33Tsai L.H. Murthy S.N.P. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 157: 1438-1442Google Scholar), both wild type and mutant cdb3 were able to inhibit the enzyme >90% with the same inhibition constant (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that any impact of loop deletion on ankyrin binding must be attributed to a direct modification of the attachment site of ankyrin and not to a general perturbation of cdb3 structure. Binding of ankyrin to wild type and mutant cdb3 was also evaluated by a His tag pull-down assay similar to that used for analysis of protein 4.1 binding. Thus, His-tagged cdb3 was incubated with a fusion construct of GST linked to the D3/D4 domains of the membrane-binding domain of ankyrin (a construct of ankyrin comprising ankyrin repeats 13–24 that has been frequently used to study ankyrin-band 3 interactions (29Davis L. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34van Dort H.M. Moriyama R. Low P.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; : 276Google Scholar)) and any complexes formed were pelleted by collection of the His-tagged cdb3 on Ni2+ beads. The content of pelleted GST-46.5 kDa ankyrin was then quantitated by measuring GST activity in the pellet. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the binding curve for the association of the GST-ankyrin fusion construct with His-tagged cdb3 shows saturation with an apparent dissociation constant of ∼400 nm. Binding was found to be specific because addition of excess unlabeled ankyrin competitively blocked the interaction and because heat denaturation of the 46.5-kDa ankyrin eliminated all association (data not shown). Importantly, binding of the 175–185 deletion mutant to ankyrin was not distinguishable from background, suggesting that the deleted loop is critical for ankyrin association. Further, when the same analysis was performed by a dot-blot assay using His-tagged cdb3 and unmodified 46.5 kDa ankyrin, a qualitatively similar result was obtained (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that the β-hairpin loop on cdb3 plays a critical role in the ankyrin interaction. Although previous studies have demonstrated that 46.5 kDa ankyrin can bind cdb3 with high affinity (29Davis L. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and even drive band 3 into tetramers, much like intact ankyrin (34van Dort H.M. Moriyama R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14819-14826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the question still remained whether the full-length 220 kDa ankyrin, with its twelve additional 33 amino acid repeats, might be less dependent on the β-hairpin loop for binding than 46.5 kDa ankyrin, which lacks the first half of its membrane-binding domain. To address this issue, we purified intact ankyrin from the red cell membrane and radiolabelled it with125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent. Following incubation with His-tagged cdb3, the resulting ankyrin-cdb3 complexes were pulled-down using Ni2+ beads, and bound ankyrin was quantitated by measuring cpm. As seen in Fig.4, intact ankyrin was also inhibited in its association with the cdb3 deletion mutant, suggesting that even the intact protein, with all 24 ankyrin repeats, relies heavily on the β-hairpin loop for interaction. To further support the hypothesis that residues 175–185 participate directly and prominently in ankyrin binding, the 11 amino acid peptide corresponding to residues 175–185 was synthesized, only in this case a cysteine residue was added to each end of the peptide to allow for disulfide-mediated cyclization of the peptide. Cyclization was considered important as a means of trying to mimic the 3-dimensional structure of the β-hairpin loop in situ. The resulting looped peptide was then tested for its ability to inhibit binding of 46.5 kDa ankyrin to cdb3. As seen in Fig.5, the synthetic peptide was indeed able to completely inhibit ankyrin binding at concentrations around 500 μg/ml. Curiously, rupture of the disulfide bond using a reducing agent did not attenuate the ability of the peptide to inhibit cdb3 binding (data not shown), suggesting that the cyclized peptide was not highly constrained in its conformational flexibility. A second ankyrin-binding site proposed in the literature is thought to reside at the NH2 terminus of cdb3 (25Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lux S.E. Palek J. Handinm R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. Lippincott, Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). Evidence for this contention originally arose from three key observations: i) kidney cdb3, which lacks residues 1–65, shows no affinity for ankyrin (23Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); ii) phosphorylation of cdb3 on tyrosine 8 is inhibited upon addition of ankyrin (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and iii) antibodies to the extreme NH2 terminus of cdb3 block ankyrin binding (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, with the advent of the crystal structure of cdb3 (25Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the interpretation of at least one of these observations no longer seems so straightforward because deletion of residues 1–65 of cdb3 removes the central strand of a large β-pleated sheet, which must certainly perturb the global conformation of cdb3. Therefore, to better evaluate the proposed involvement of the NH2 terminus of cdb3 in ankyrin binding, a new deletion mutant was required that would induce no distortion in cdb3 conformation. For this purpose, the crystal structure of cdb3 was again consulted and interpreted to indicate that the NH2-terminal 50 residues of cdb3 are unstructured and can be eliminated without perturbing any other regions of the polypeptide (25Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, residues 1–50 of cdb3 were deleted, and the resulting truncated cdb3 was evaluated for ankyrin affinity. In contrast to our expectations from previous studies (20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), cdb3 lacking residues 1–50 exhibited the same binding affinity for 46.5 kDa ankyrin as wild type cdb3 (Fig. 3), suggesting that the NH2 terminus may not be essential for ankyrin association. Nevertheless, because the previous studies were conducted with intact ankyrin rather than truncated 46.5 kDa ankyrin, and because the earlier data still seemed compelling, it was decided to re-evaluate the affinity of the 1–50 deletion mutant of cdb3, but this time for the full-length ankyrin (i.e. the 220-kDa ankyrin might still require the NH2 terminus of cdb3). However, as seen in Fig.4, similar results were again obtained. Finally, to assure ourselves that the previously published studies were not flawed, we repeated the experiments using 46.5 kDa ankyrin instead of intact ankyrin and found that all three lines of evidence for NH2-terminal involvement could be replicated (i.e. kidney band 3 does not bind 46.5 kDa ankyrin, 46.5 kDa ankyrin inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation at the NH2 terminus of cdb3, and antibodies to the NH2 terminus of cdb3 block 46.5 kDa ankyrin binding (data not shown)). These results argue strongly that although residues 1–50 of cdb3 may not physically participate in ankyrin binding, they must reside sufficiently proximal to the ankyrin-binding site on cdb3 that antibody binding to the NH2 terminus prevents ankyrin association, and ankyrin association at the β-hairpin loop sterically obstructs phosphorylation of cdb3 on Tyr-8. Examination of the crystal structure of cdb3 demonstrates that this steric overlap is entirely reasonable. We have presented evidence that the β-hairpin loop comprising residues 175–185 of cdb3 constitutes a major ankyrin-binding site on the erythrocyte membrane. Although previous studies (19Thevinin B.J.-M. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892PubMed Google Scholar, 20Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22494-22498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have suggested the involvement of a mid-region of cdb3 in ankyrin binding, a more precise characterization of this binding site could not be pursued until the three-dimensional structure of cdb3 became available. Thus, random deletion mutagenesis of the implicated sequences without the aid of crystallographic coordinates would have risked inducing global changes in protein conformation that might have led to nonspecific inhibition of ankyrin association. With access to the crystal structure, however, it was possible to identify and delete the crucial loop region on cdb3 without introducing distortion or strain into the rest of the protein. Abrogation of ankyrin binding by this deletion mutant, with no accompanying perturbation of either the pH-dependent conformational change or binding affinity for protein 4.1, could then be interpreted to indicate the critical involvement of the β-hairpin loop in ankyrin binding. This conclusion was further confirmed by the ability of the deleted peptide to directly compete for ankyrin association with cdb3. Deletion mutagenesis of the NH2 terminus of cdb3 further demonstrated that the first 50 residues of the polypeptide are not directly involved in ankyrin binding. However, the observations that blocking of this sequence by peptide-specific Fabs totally prevents ankyrin binding, and ankyrin binding to the β-hairpin loop inhibits phosphorylation of Tyr-8 argues strongly that the NH2 terminus and the ankyrin-binding site lie near each other. Curiously, prediction of this steric interference would not have been obvious from the crystal structure because the first 55 residues of cdb3 are too flexible to be resolved and because the β-hairpin loop lies ∼50 Å from residue 55 (i.e. the site where the flexible NH2-terminal sequence leaves the body of cdb3). Nevertheless, a close physical proximity must be real because ankyrin also competes with other peripheral proteins that bind at the NH2 terminus of band 3 (38Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 2S. H. Chang and P. S. Low, unpublished results. . Because the NH2 terminus of cdb3 is not only required for stable interaction with protein 4.1 (38Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also for association with various glycolytic enzymes (33Tsai L.H. Murthy S.N.P. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 157: 1438-1442Google Scholar, 39Murthy P.S.N. Liu T. Kaul R.K. Kohler H. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1991; 1061: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is also conceivable that binding of ankyrin to cdb3 might be involved in regulation of other protein interactions at the NH2terminus. The absence of a requirement for residues 1–50 in ankyrin binding raises the question of why kidney cdb3, which lacks residues 1–65, fails to bind ankyrin. Analysis of the crystal structure, however, demonstrates that residues 57–65 constitute a central strand in an eight-stranded β sheet that extends through the middle of cdb3. Although deletion of residues 1–50 can be argued to have little or no impact on protein conformation, removal of residues 1–65 should force rearrangement of the packing of the entire domain. Thus, based on crystallographic considerations, kidney cdb3 should have a somewhat different conformation from erythrocyte cdb3. Consistent with this speculation, it has been reported that kanadaptin interacts with kidney, but not erythrocyte band 3 (42Chen J. Vijayakumar S. Li X. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1038-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas the glycolytic enzymes, ankyrin, and protein 4.1 associate with erythrocyte but not kidney band 3 (24Wang C.C. Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17892-17897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the binding properties of intact ankyrin to band 3 are reasonably well replicated by the binding properties of 46.5 kDa ankyrin to cdb3. Not only do both polypeptides require association at the β-hairpin loop, but neither preparation appears to involve docking with the NH2 terminus, even though both are inhibited by Fabs directed at this sequence, and both prevent phosphorylation of Tyr-8. Previous studies (35Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have suggested that ankyrin contains one cdb3-binding site on its second set of 6 ankyrin repeats (subdomain 2) and another binding site somewhere within repeats 13–24 (subdomains 3 and 4, i.e. the 46.5-kDa ankyrin. Based on the above similarities in binding properties, it is tempting to speculate that most of the interfacial contacts may occur between subdomains 3 and 4 and cdb3 and that docking with subdomain 2 may involve a more limited surface area. Comparison of the proposed Na+/K+-ATPase and cdb3-binding sites for ankyrin might suggest that a β-hairpin loop constitutes a common ankyrin-binding motif on the cytoplasmic domains of multiple membrane-spanning proteins. Even though the loop on cdb3 shares no sequence homology with the loop on the Na+/K+-ATPase, cdb3 still inhibits the binding of ankyrin to the Na+/K+-ATPase (43Morrow J.S. Cianci C. Ardito T. Mann A. Kashgarian M.T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We interpret this to suggest that a conformational fit rather than sequence complementarity at the binding interface contributes primarily to complex formation. Indeed, our inability to compromise ankyrin-binding affinity by mutating both charged residues in the β-hairpin loop (data not shown) is consistent with the more dominant role played by conformational fit in stabilizing this interaction. As other ankyrin-binding structures become available, it will be interesting to examine whether similar exposed loops constitute the sites of association.

HIF-1 binds to a hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) located within the VEGF promoter (11Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell.

The activity of HIF-1 is regulated mainly by the expression and activity of the HIF-1α subunit. Although HIF-1β protein is rather stable and readily detected in the nucleus of most normoxic cells, HIF-1α protein is often hardly detectable because of rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (16Salceda S.

Hypoxia increases the level of HIF-1α protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation (19Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar).

HIF-1α is subsequently translocated to the nucleus, where it can dimerize with HIF-1β to form the HIF-1 complex (20Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L.

The stabilization and transcriptional activation of the HIF-1α protein involve changes in its phosphorylation state. Activation of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and/or its downstream target the protein-serine/threonine kinase Akt, can result in the phosphorylation and stabilization of HIF-1α under hypoxic and normoxic conditions (8Blancher C. Moore J.W. Robertson N. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7349-7355PubMed Google Scholar, 24Minet E. Michel G. Mottet D. Raes M. Michiels C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of PI3K activity has been shown to reduce the transactivation function of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells (25Hirota K. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21166-21172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). So far, there is no evidence that PI3K and Akt can phosphorylate HIF-1α directly. Other pathways that regulate HIF-1α phosphorylation involve members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (26Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

This may occur through direct phosphorylation because these kinases have been shown to phosphorylate HIF-1α in vitro(28Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

The stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (SAPKs/JNKs) do not phosphorylate HIF-1α in vitro, but may indirectly regulate HIF-1-mediated transcription of VEGF under hypoxia through phosphorylating the transcription factor c-Jun (18Kallio P.J.

The stabilization and transcriptional activation of HIF-1α may also involve alterations in its redox state. Evidence is provide that changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a role in HIF-1α protein induction and HIF-1 transactivation (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

The levels of ROS may also directly or indirectly influence the redox status of cysteine residues in the transactivation domains of HIF-1α, which can affect interactions with transcriptional coactivators (21Ema M.

In a previous study on the role of oxidative stress in the regulation of VEGF, we showed that sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) induces HIF-1α protein and VEGF mRNA and protein levels in the human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3 and H134 (34Duyndam M.C. Hulscher T.M. Fontijn D. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48066-48076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Arsenite induces oxidative stress by binding to thiol groups of cellular proteins and by increasing the production of ROS. Because the effects of sodium arsenite on HIF-1α protein and VEGF expression are independent of increased ROS production, we hypothesized that they may be mediated through binding of arsenite to thiol (SH) groups of the HIF-1α protein itself or of components of signal transduction pathways involved in HIF-1 or VEGF regulation (34Duyndam M.C. Hulscher T.M. Fontijn D. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48066-48076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our findings with sodium arsenite may be of clinical relevance. Several cytotoxic agents in cancer treatment are susceptible of interacting with thiol groups of cellular proteins. Moreover, arsenic trioxide (As2O3), another trivalent arsenic compound, has potential as an anticancer agent (35Murgo A.J. Oncologist. 2001; 6, (Suppl. 2): 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At low dosages (1–10 μm), arsenic trioxide has a significant cytotoxic effect on human ovarian cancer cell lines and is suggested to be a useful agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer (36Uslu R. Sanli U.A. Sezgin C. Karabulut B. Terzioglu E. Omay S.B. Goker E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4957-4964PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we now compared the potency of arsenic trioxide with that of sodium arsenite to induce HIF-1α protein and VEGF mRNA and protein levels in the OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cell line. We also investigated the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway and of MAPK family members in sodium arsenite-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation and VEGF expression. Furthermore, we examined whether up-regulation of VEGF mRNA expression by sodium arsenite was mediated by HIF-1. Sodium arsenite, arsenic trioxide, wortmannin, glutathione (GSH), N-acetylcysteine (NAc), and buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from Sigma. PD98059, SB203580 and SB202190 were purchased from Calbiochem. OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells and Jnk1 +/− Jnk2 −/−,Jnk1 −/− Jnk2 −/−,HIF-1α +/+, andHIF-1α −/− mouse fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sanbio, Uden, The Netherlands), 50 units/ml penicillin (ICN Biochemicals, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (ICN Biochemicals). Cells were routinely cultured in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hypoxic conditions were performed by incubation of cells in a tightly sealed chamber maintained at 1% oxygen, 94% N2, and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Immortalized Jnk1 + − Jnk2 −/− andJnk1 −/− Jnk2 −/− cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. E. F. Wagner (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria). These cell lines have been established independently from individual primary mouse embryo fibroblasts that were each isolated from a single mouse embryo following the 3T3 protocol (37Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar, 38Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech.

Semenza (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Both cell lines were established by transfection of primary mouse embryo fibroblast cultures with an expression vector encoding simian virus 40 T-antigen as described elsewhere (39Feldser D. Agani F. Iyer N.V. Pak B. Ferreira G. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3915-3918PubMed Google Scholar). For treatment of cells with sodium arsenite or arsenic trioxide, cells were seeded in culture dishes in medium and grown overnight. Thereafter, sodium arsenite or arsenic trioxide was added to the conditioned medium, and cells were incubated further for the time periods as indicated in each experiment. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin, PD98059, SB203580, SB202190, GSH, and NAc was performed for 1 h before the addition of sodium arsenite; pretreatment with BSO was performed for 16 h. Rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against phospho-Akt-1 (Ser473), phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), p44/p42 MAPK, SAPK/JNK, p38 MAPK, and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antiserum were purchased from New England Biolabs. Mouse monoclonal antisera to HIF-1α were purchased from Novus Biologicals/AbCam (Cambridge, U. K.) and BD Transduction Laboratories (Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands). The sheep polyclonal antiserum directed against Akt-1 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against c-Jun (H-79) and Raf-1 (C12) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The mouse monoclonal antiserum against β-actin (C4) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The polyclonal human antiserum against topoisomerase I was purchased from TopoGEN (Columbus, OH). The mouse monoclonal antiserum against human p53 (DO-7) and the horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse serum were purchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). The horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-sheep serum was purchased from Calbiochem. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by scraping with a rubber policeman in 250 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) for Western blotting or in 450 μl of E1A buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for ELISA. Both lysis buffers were supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. After a 15-min incubation period on ice, the extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at −70 °C. Isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions from OVCAR-3 cells in the subcellular fractionation experiment was performed as described previously (40De Rooij K.E. Dorsman J.C. Smoor M.A. Den Dunnen J.T. Van Ommen G.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Plus Protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein cell extracts were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.025% Tween 20) and 5% milk and incubated overnight with antiserum directed against phospho-Akt-1(1:3,000), phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (1:1,000), phospho-SAPK/JNK (1:1,000), phospho-p38 (1:1,000), phospho-c-Jun (1:1,000), HIF-1α (1:500), β-actin (1:2,000), Raf-1 (1:500), topoisomerase I (1:5,000) or p53 (1:1,000). After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antiserum in TBST and 5% milk. The membranes were washed again with TBST, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. To detect both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Akt-1, c-Jun, and the MAPK family members, membranes were stripped for 15 min in strip buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2% SDS, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) at 42 °C and washed with TBST. Subsequently, the blots were blocked again and incubated for 2 h with Akt-1, p44/p42 MAPK, SAPK/JNK, or p38-specific antiserum (1:1,000 dilution) or with a c-Jun-specific antiserum (1:500 dilution) in TBST and 5% milk. The incubations with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-sheep antisera and the detection of the proteins were performed as described above. Equal numbers of cells were plated on 9.6-mm culture dishes and grown overnight. The conditioned medium of all dishes was collected, pooled, and 450 μl was sampled (time-point (T) = 0 medium sample). Cells of one dish were washed and lysed in 450 μl of lysis buffer as described above (T = 0 lysate sample). The conditioned medium was divided into 5 volumes. Sodium arsenite was added to 1 volume at a concentration of 100 μm, and arsenic trioxide was added to 3 volumes at concentrations of 100, 50, and 10 μm. Subsequently, conditioned medium with or without sodium arsenite or arsenic trioxide was again added to culture dishes with cells. Thus, atT = 0 the amount of VEGF protein in the medium was the same in each culture dish. Cells were incubated further for the time periods indicated in each experiment. Thereafter, 450 μl of conditioned medium was sampled, and cells were lysed. VEGF concentrations in nondiluted media samples and lysates were determined in duplicate by ELISA using the reagents and the protocol supplied with the Quantikine Human VEGF Immunoassay kit (R&D Systems). Differences in VEGF concentrations in medium and lysates of nontreatedversus sodium arsenite- or arsenic trioxide-treated cells were evaluated using Student's t test for two groups.p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. Generation of human γ-actin and VEGF165 antisense probes has been described elsewhere (34Duyndam M.C. Hulscher T.M. Fontijn D. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48066-48076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen) containing a fragment of murine VEGF164 or γ-actin cDNA were used as templates for the synthesis of murine VEGF164 and γ-actin antisense probes. The templates were generated as follows. Total RNA fromJnk1 +/− Jnk2 −/− mouse fibroblasts was reversed transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Murine VEGF164cDNA (nucleotides 454–648) was amplified with the forward primer 5′-ATAACAAGCTT AGCACAGCAGATGTGAATGC-3′ and the reversed primer 5′-GCAACCTCGA GCTTGTCACATCTGCAAGTAC-3′. Murine γ-actin cDNA (nucleotides 630–780) was amplified with the forward primer 5′-ATAACAAGCT TGCTATGTTGCCCTGGATTTTGAG-3′ and the reversed primer 5′-GCAACCTCGAG GGA AGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGT-3′. Amplification of VEGF164and γ-actin cDNA fragments was performed for 36 cycles at 94 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C. In addition to VEGF164 or γ-actin sequences (underlined), the forward and reverse primers contain restriction sites (bold) for HindIII andXhoI, respectively. The 216-nucleotide VEGF164and 172-nucleotide γ-actin amplified fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, dissolved in water, and digested withHindIII and XhoI. The digestion mixtures were subjected to gel electrophoresis, and the VEGF164 and γ-actin cDNA fragments were isolated from the agarose gel by use of the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The isolated VEGF164 and γ-actin cDNA fragments were cloned into the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3, and the sequence of the VEGF164 and γ-actin cDNA fragments was verified by sequencing. pcDNA3VEGF164 and pcDNA3γ-actin were linearized with HindIII, and 228-nucleotide VEGF164 and 185-nucleotide γ-actin antisense probes were generated with SP6 polymerase. The RNase protection assay was carried out as described (34Duyndam M.C. Hulscher T.M. Fontijn D. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48066-48076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hybridization of total RNA to a 136-nucleotide human γ-actin antisense probe gives rise to a protected fragment of 130 nucleotide, whereas hybridization to the 185-nucleotide murine γ-actin antisense probe is expected to result in the protection of a fragment of 151 nucleotides. It should be noted that hybridization of total RNA to the 301-nucleotide human VEGF165 antisense probe and the 228-nucleotide murine VEGF164 can give rise to fragments of different sizes because of protection by VEGF mRNAs of different isoforms (1Robinson C.J.

Protection by human VEGF165mRNA and murine VEGF164 mRNA is most efficient, giving rise to protected fragments of 252 and 195 nucleotides, respectively. Therefore, effects on VEGF mRNA levels were monitored by assessing the mRNA levels of human VEGF165 and murine VEGF164. The pGL3 promoter vector was purchased from Promega. This vector contains the SV40 basal promoter upstream of luciferase coding sequences and the SV40 late polyadenylation signal. 5xHREpGL3 contains five copies of a HIF-1 consensus sequence of the human VEGF promoter and was cloned from the reporter plasmid 5HRE/hCMVmp (43Shibata T. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). 5HRE/hCMVmp was digested with KpnI andBglII, and the KpnI-BglII fragment was ligated into the KpnI-BglII-digested pGL3-promoter vector. 5xjun2pGL3 contains five copies of thejun2 element of the human c-jun promoter (44van Dam H.

Usually one CCAAT element is present in promoters at positions between −60 and −100, but an emerging class of promoters harbor multiple NF-Y sites. In the triple CCAAT-containing cyclin B2 cell-cycle promoter, all CCAAT boxes, independently from their NF-Y affinities, are important for function. We investigated the relationships between NF-Y and p300. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis found that NF-Y and p300 are bound to the cyclin B2 promoter in vivo and that their binding is regulated during the cell cycle, positively correlating with promoter function. Cotransfection experiments determined that the coactivator acts on all CCAAT boxes and requires a precise spacing between the three elements. We established the order of in vitrobinding of the three NF-Y complexes and find decreasing affinities from the most distal Y1 to the proximal Y3 site. Binding of two or three NF-Y trimers with or without p300 is not cooperative, but association with the Y1 and Y2 sites is extremely stable. p300 favors the binding of NF-Y to the weak Y3 proximal site, provided that a correct distance between the three CCAAT is respected. Our data indicate that the precise spacing of multiple CCAAT boxes is crucial for coactivator function.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The importance of this element has been outlined in innumerable functional assays, and indeed, mutations affecting it have a profound negative effect on the function of neighboring cis-acting elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)1 and transfections with highly diagnostic dominant negative vectors for NF-YA implicated NF-Y as the CCAAT activator in >500 mammalian promoters (2Mantovani R.

NF-Y is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC, all necessary for DNA binding (3Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). NF-YA and NF-YC possess large Q-rich domains that are required for transcriptional activation. NF-YB and NF-YC are tightly bound through histone-fold motifs, whose formation is required for NF-YA association and sequence-specific DNA binding. Circular permutation assays have clearly shown that NF-Y bends DNA and organizes the three-dimensional architecture of promoters; it is understood that NF-Y promotes the binding of neighboring trans-activators and makes connections with TFIID, contacting several of the TAFIIs (4Frontini M.

In general, coactivators are thought to serve as a bridge for transcription factors and holoenzyme interactions, having been recruited to promoters through activation domains. Many coactivators, such as CBP/p300, PCAF, GCN5, possess an enzymatic activity, histone acetyltransferase, that adds an acetyl group to lysines of the N-terminal ends of the core histones (7Sterner D.E. Berger S.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity is apparently essential for activation function in many, but not in all systems tested (8Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol.

In addition to histones, coactivators also target transcription factors, influencing different aspects of their functions, such as DNA binding affinity, nuclear localization, or retention (for review, see Ref. 11Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The role of p300/CBP in control of cell growth and differentiation has been studied in many systems (12Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). p300/CBP exerts a profound effect on cell cycle control, as exemplified by the finding that E1A mutants that cannot bind to p300 exhibit defective cellular transformation (13Wang H.-G.H. Moran E. Yacuik P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7917-7924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p300/CBP·PCAF protein complex might regulate target genes that are involved in controlling the G1/S transition, such as p21WAF1 (14Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The overexpression of E1A, whose binding to p300/CBP antagonizes PCAF association, drives cells into S phase (15Missero C.

Among the many genes activated by NF-Y, an emerging class is represented by those regulated differently during the cell cycle, particularly in the G2/M phase. Key regulators such as CDC25A/B/C, cyclin B1/B2, Cdc2, and topoisomerase IIα contain multiple CCAAT boxes in their promoters, invariably shown to be crucial for the proper regulation of these genes (Ref. 2Mantovani R.

It associates with the Cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and thereby regulates phosphorylation of target proteins (27Gautier J. Minshull J. Lohka M. Glotzer M. Hunt T. Maller J.L. Cell. 1990; 60: 487-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Complex formation between cyclin B and Cdc2 is essential for G2/M transition. In mammalian cells cyclin B exists in two isoforms, cyclin B1 and cyclin B2 (28Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We have previously analyzed expression from the cyclin B2 promoter and found NF-Y to be the major activator (21Bolognese F. Wasner M. Lange-zu Dohna C. Gurtner A. Ronchi A. Muller H. Manni I. Mossner J. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Engeland K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cell cycle-dependent transcription is mediated by a CDE-CHR repressor element (29Lange-zu Dohna C. Brandeis M. Berr F. Mossner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Three NF-Y binding CCAAT boxes in the proximal promoter spaced 33-bp apart are responsible for more than two-thirds of the total activity of the cyclin B2 promoter. A large difference in affinity to NF-Y was detected among these three CCAAT elements, with the proximal Y3 binding NF-Y with very low affinity, yet they all equally contributed to the full transcriptional activity of the promoter (21Bolognese F. Wasner M. Lange-zu Dohna C. Gurtner A. Ronchi A. Muller H. Manni I. Mossner J. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Engeland K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that NF-Y binding is cooperative, either directly, through interactions with intermediate factors such as coactivators, or else that another factor, for which there is no evidence at the moment, might bind and activate Y3. To solve this matter, we present data that dissect the interplay between NF-Y and p300.DISCUSSIONIn this study we investigated the relationship between NF-Y and p300 on the cyclin B2 promoter that is active in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. We found that p300 activates in a manner that requires a precise spacing between the three CCAAT boxes. Indeed, NF-Y and the coactivator are bound to the promoter in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent way. In vitro the order of binding of three NF-Y protein complexes is Y1 > Y2 ≫ Y3, with decreasing affinities from the most distal to the proximal site. The binding of two or three NF-Y molecules with or without p300 is not cooperative. However, p300 favors the association of NF-Y to the proximal site, and the distance between the three CCAAT boxes is crucial for this activity. We conclude that the precise alignment of multiple CCAAT boxes is crucial for coactivator function.NF-Y Binding to Multiple CCAAT BoxesA recent analysis of 1031 human promoters indicated that the CCAAT box is present in 65% of them (1Suzuki Y. Tsunoda T. Sese J. Taira H. Mizushima-Sugano J. Hata H. Ota T. Isogai T. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Suyama A. Sakaki Y. Morishita S. Okubo K. Sugano S. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have catalogued >500 CCAAT promoters regulated by NF-Y and found that the majority contain only one CCAAT box, either in the forward or reverse orientation. In general, NF-Y cooperates with neighboring factors to regulate gene expression. In inducible systems, such as those of the heat shock, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, NF-Y teams up with heat shock factor, ATF6, and sterol regulatory element binding protein. In the major histocompatibility complex class II genes setting, NF-Y cooperates with the regulatory factor X box trimer (Ref. 3Mantovani R. Gene. 1999; 239: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar and references therein; Refs. 18Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P.

Biol. 1999; 286: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the cooperative effect has been studied and, baring the NF-Y-C/EBP connections on the albumin promoter, in all other cases NF-Y mediates a profound increase in DNA-binding affinity of the neighboring factor.Alterations in the spacing between the CCAAT boxes and nearby sites provoke a decrease and sometimes abolition of the activation potential. In cell cycle-regulated promoters, NF-Y is essential for the timing of activation (35Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 36van Ginkel P.R. Hsiao K.M. Schjerven H. Farnham P.J. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of G1/S promoters, NF-Y cooperates with E2Fs; in G2/M promoters NF-Y binding CCAAT boxes are found near the CDE-CHR element (29Lange-zu Dohna C. Brandeis M. Berr F. Mossner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Biochemically, it is unclear at what level the cooperation is exerted. Many cell cycle promoters are peculiar in that they contain at least two and sometimes more NF-Y binding sites, in particular in promoters of key G2/M cell cycle regulators Cdc2, topoisomerase IIα, CDC25C, and cyclin B1/B2 (Table I). The distance between these elements is (i) highly conserved among species and (ii) relatively constant; in the case of CDC25C, three CCAAT boxes are spaced 32 bp apart, in cyclin B2 the distances are 33 bp, in Cdc2 two CCAAT elements are spaced by 32 bp. Promoters for which both human and mouse sequences are available show that the sequences of NF-Y binding sites as well as their distance is strictly conserved. Especially in CDC25C and cyclin B2 mouse and human promoters nucleotides in between CCAAT boxes are not conserved, contrasting the sequence identity of and distance between NF-Y binding elements (32Haugwitz U. Wasner M. Wiedmann M. Spiesbach K. Rother K. Mossner J. Engeland K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 4M. Wasner and K. Engeland, unpublished information. In all the promoters mentioned above, the affinities of NF-Y for the individual CCAAT sites differ; in CDC25C one of the CCAAT boxes is not even a perfect pentanucleotide. In cyclin B2 it is apparent that between Y1 and Y3 there is a 50-fold difference in binding affinity, yet the integrity of Y3 is as important as the high affinity Y1 binding in terms of function. The cyclin B2 systems is also conspicuous for another reason; that is, the NF-Y sites are apparently sufficient on their own to activate this promoter essentially without the need of additional factors. This is unlike the other systems tested so far, in which NF-Y is unable to activate alone. In a previous study on the γ-globin promoter, we found that NF-Y binding to double CCAAT boxes spaced by 27 nucleotides was not cooperative unless an extra 5 nucleotides were added. In such a case, a complex formed by two NF-Y trimers bound to the two sites was much more stable in off-rate experiments thanks to the presence of the NF-YA and NF-YC glutamine-rich domains (30Liberati C. di Silvio A. Ottolenghi S. Mantovani R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The distance of 32 nucleotides predicts that the two CCAAT boxes are on the same side of the DNA double helix, which has an average periodicity of 10.5 and is somewhat dependent upon the sequence. Thus, we expected that the binding of NF-Y to the triple CCAAT elements of cyclin B2 could be itself cooperative in our in vitro EMSAs. This is not the case (Fig. 4). It is possible that the lack of cooperativity is due to the extra nucleotide present between the cyclin B2 CCAAT boxes or to the intervening sequences. Nevertheless, it is clear that the stability of the Y1-Y2·NF-Y complexes is extremely high, with a half-life of >24 h in vitro. Thus, one is tempted to conclude that unlike the situation when NF-Y finds another transcription factor nearby, cooperativity at the DNA binding level is not required when two or more NF-Y sites are aligned on the promoter, even in the presence of CCAAT boxes that do not conform to an optimal binding consensus. Yet, the perfect alignment of the three sites is clearly required for optimal promoter function (Fig. 2). Optimal transcription then results from additional contacts.Table IList of cell cycle promoters with multiple CCAAT boxes spaced by 31/33 nucleotidesSequences from cyclin B2 were from Bolognese et al.

Commun. 2000; 267: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Bending and phasing assays revealed that NF-Y distorts and rotates DNA in a way that is reminiscent of histones bound to DNA in the nucleosomal structure (30Liberati C. di Silvio A.

The stunningly slow off-rates observed in this study are a premiere for sequence-specific transcription factors and can only be compared with the highly stable nucleosomal structures. Indeed, two of the NF-Y subunits, NF-YB and NF-YC, have histone-like features, as predicted from amino acid alignments, o-phenanthroline footprinting, and structure-function analyses and, most importantly, as detailed by recent crystallographic studies (41Romier C. Cocchiarella F. Mantovani R. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1336-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A spacing of 32/33 nucleotides, thereby an alignment on the same side of the double helix, is in keeping with three CCAAT boxes forming a heminucleosomal structure, as indicated by Fig. 7. The minimal platform recognized by coactivators is likely to be NF-Y binding to Y1 and Y2, with additional contacts made on Y3 once p300 has been recruited onto the promoter.Activity of p300 on Cell Cycle Promotersp300/CBP proteins are coactivators involved in the activation of a large number, if not all, the polymerase II-transcribed genes. In particular, p300 and CBP are targets of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein; their role in cell cycle control has been shown by the finding that E1A mutants that cannot bind to p300 exhibit defective cellular transformation (13Wang H.-G.H. Moran E. Yacuik P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7917-7924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of E1A, which antagonizes PCAF binding to p300/CBP, drives cells into S phase (14Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). E1A is also known to affect the binding of pocket proteins to the E2F transcription factors that are associated with genes modulated in the cell cycle. Recent experiments on an E2F-regulated promoter show that p300 is important for the cell cycle-regulated expression of dihydrofolate reductase (42Fry C.J. Pearson A. Malinowski E. Bartley S.M. Greenblatt J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15883-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The p300/CBP·PCAF protein complex is believed to regulate target genes that are involved in controlling the G1/S transition, such as p21WAF1 (15Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Activity of p300/CBP has been studied in a number of systems, with particular focus on their acetyltransferase enzymatic activity. We find that the positive role of p300 on NF-Y function is exerted through an increase in DNA affinity, mostly observed on the weak Y3 binding site. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such demonstration for p300 binding on multiple sites for the same factor. Essentially three types of action are supposed to be exerted by p300/CBP; (i) the protein serves as a platform, a bridge, through which the direct interactions with multiple DNA binding activators are supported; recruitment of p300/CBP stabilizes the otherwise weak binding of these factors or even makes them possible. In keeping with this, interactions of p300/CBP with many transcription factors have been mapped in one and sometimes multiple subdomains of the coactivators. Evidence for this mechanism is still largely circumstantial, and the biochemical dissection of this mechanism on DNA was obtained only on the β-interferon promoter (43Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). (ii) Once on a promoter, p300/CBP proteins modify the chromatin structures nearby the sites by virtue of their histone acetylation activity, rendering nucleosomes more “accessible” to the general transcription apparatus. (iii) The same histone acetyltransferase activity would be used to increase the affinity of the DNA binding factor for the targeted sequence. This latter property is less well understood. In many cases, in fact, the opposite happens; acetylation of high mobility group(I) inhibits formation of the enhanceosome on the β-interferon promoter (43Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the case of p53, whose function is positively affected by p300, acetylation apparently affects recruitment of p300/CBP (44Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in keeping with these latter results, we find that p300 acetylates NF-YB and that this modification increases NF-Y-p300 interactions.3 In many promoters, the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP is apparently dispensable (8Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Harton J.A. Zika E. Ting J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7029-7036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); p300/CBP and PCAF cooperate with members of the MyoD family of muscle transcription factors in modulating the expression of downstream myogenic factors, including myogenin and MEF2, leading to terminal withdrawal from the cell cycle of myotubes (45Puri P.L.

Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y.J. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The p300 histone acetyltransferase domain is dispensable for MyoD-dependent transcription, suggesting that the “bridging” mechanism is predominant in this case.One important result that stems from the ChIP analysis is that the cyclin B2 promoter is devoid of NF-Y and p300 in cells arrested in G0, and the two activators become bound only in S-phase, when the gene starts to be activated. This was not obvious, considering the presence of NF-Y on the cyclin B1 promoter during mitosis, recently described in HeLa cells (47Sciortino S. Gurtner A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, other promoters are indeed bound by NF-Y in G0 cells, suggesting regulation of promoter selectivity in this phase. These data rule out alternative scenarios that could have been envisaged; (i) p300 would be absent from the promoter in G1 and early S, when the promoter is silent, and be recruited in late S through interactions with a pre-bound NF-Y, constitutively associated through the cycle; (ii) it would be co-resident with the Y1-Y2 NF-Y throughout the cell cycle and only become active in late S, to promote Y3 binding. Open questions remain as to the regulation of NF-Y promoter association through the cell cycle. It is possible that additional signals, most likely post-transl"

It is also known that ethanol modulates the expression and activity of several intracellular signaling molecules and transcription factors in monocytes and Kupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages. Expression of CD14, the endotoxin receptor, is up-regulated following chronic exposure to endotoxin and ethanol. Ethanol-induced oxidative stress is important in the regulation of transcription factor activation and cytokine production by Kupffer cells. Thus, it was hypothesized that acute ethanol increases CD14 expression through a mechanism dependent upon oxidant production. This hypothesis was tested by overexpression of superoxide dismutase via recombinant adenovirus. Mice were infected with adenovirus (3 × 109plaque-forming units, intravenously) containing either Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Ad.SOD1) or β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ), which caused significant expression of Cu,Zn-SOD in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Three days post-infection, mice were given saline or ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically). A significant increase in CD14 mRNA was observed 3 h after ethanol, and this increase was almost completely blocked in mice overexpressing Cu,Zn-SOD. Additionally, overexpression of SOD also blunted ethanol-induced activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 and production of cytokines. However, only inhibition of AP-1 with dominant-negative TAK1 but not NFκB by dominant-negative IκBα significantly blunted ethanol-induced increases in CD14, suggesting that AP-1 is important for CD14 transcriptional regulation.

Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552Google Scholar, 3Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Google Scholar). Specifically, the Tlr-4 protein activates the IRAK, which in turn activates the NFκB signaling cascade including NIK, IKK, IκB, and NFκB (4Abreu M.T. Vora P. Faure E. Thomas L.S. Arnold E.T. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1609-1616Google Scholar, 5Faure E. Equils O. Sieling P.A. Thomas L. Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Polentarutti N. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11058-11063Google Scholar, 6Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of Kupffer cell by LPS leads to an increase in oxidant (i.e. superoxide and nitric oxide) through NADPH oxidase and nitric-oxide synthase, respectively. Interestingly, oxidant production is required for full activation of LPS-induced NFκB (7Li N. Karin M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1137-1143Google Scholar), suggesting that oxidants are involved in the signaling mechanisms. It was recently demonstrated that overexpression of antioxidant superoxide dismutase in Kupffer cells blunts LPS-induced NFκB activation and TNFα production in Kupffer cells in vitro (8Wheeler M.D. Yamashina S. Froh M. Rusyn I. Thurman R.G. J Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 622-630Google Scholar). It has been reported that ethanol also alters the subunit composition of inflammatory transcription factor NFκB by inducing the formation of p50 homodimerization of NFκB (9Mandrekar P. Catalano D. Szabo G. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 988-994Google Scholar). Independent studies have shown that both IRAK and transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 are redox-sensitive (10Tewes F. Bol G.F. Brigelius-Flohe R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3015-3021Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that oxidant production affects key signaling molecules and transcription factors and that these alterations are involved in sensitization to LPS caused by acute ethanol. Enomoto et al. (11Enomoto N. Ikejima K. Bradford B.U. Rivera C.A. Kono H. Brenner D.A. Thurman R.G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 443-451Google Scholar) have described the phenomena whereby ethanol alters the response of Kupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages, to a subsequent insult by LPS in vivo. It was also shown that pretreatment of animals with nonabsorbable antibiotics completely prevents tolerance and sensitization caused by ethanol, suggesting the mechanism involves gut-derived LPS and activation of Kupffer cells (12Enomoto N. Ikejima K. Yamashina S. Hirose M. Shimizu H. Kitamura T. Takei Y. Sato A.N. Thurman R.G. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 51S-54SGoogle Scholar). It was also reported that an increase in CD14 expression correlated with sensitization. Thus, it is hypothesized that Kupffer cells are activated initially by LPS to produce oxidants via NADPH oxidase, which activates redox-sensitive transcription factors leading to an increase in cytokine production and CD14 expression. This hypothesis was tested by overexpressing antioxidant Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver using recombinant adenovirus. It is also important to note that adenovirus transduces both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in vivo (8Wheeler M.D. Yamashina S. Froh M. Rusyn I. Thurman R.G. J Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 622-630Google Scholar). Here, it is reported that ethanol increases both NFκB and AP-1 activity as well as cytokine production, all of which are blunted by SOD overexpression. Ethanol-induced increases in CD14 mRNA are blunted significantly by SOD overexpression, consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol-induced sensitization is mediated in part by an increase in CD14, which is dependent upon oxidant production. Finally, it is demonstrated that inhibition of AP-1 with dominant-negative TAK1, an up-stream kinase for c-jun, blunts ethanol-induced up-regulation of CD14. These data clearly support the hypothesis that ethanol exposure results in the up-regulation of CD14 through oxidant-dependent activation of AP-1. Male C57Bl/6 mice (18–22 g, The Jackson Laboratory) were used for these experiments except for studies evaluating the role of NADPH oxidase and TNFα in CD14 mRNA regulation. For those studies, mice deficient in p47phox, a required regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase, and mice deficient in TNFα were used. The p47phox knockout mice were originally obtained from Dr. Steve Holland (13Jackson S.H. Gallin J.I. Holland S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 751-758Google Scholar). The TNFα knockout mice were purchased as breeding pairs (The Jackson Laboratory), and colonies have been maintained within IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee)-approved facilities and guidelines. C57Bl/6 were infected with adenovirus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units/animal, intravenously) 3 days prior to receiving either saline or ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically). Recombinant adenovirus containing the transgene for either Cu,Zn-SOD (Ad.SOD1) or β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) was prepared as described elsewhere (14Rigby P.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1983; 64: 255-266Google Scholar, 15Rosenfeld M.A. Siegfried W. Yoshimura K. Yoneyama K. Fukayama M. Stier L.E. Paakko P.K. Gilardi P. Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Science. 1991; 252: 431-434Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid shuttle vector pAd5.CMV.lacZ was constructed by standard cloning protocols as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The adenoviral shuttle plasmid was transfected into the permissive HEK-293 host cell line to generate recombinant Ad.lacZ adenovirus. Recombinant adenovirus containing the transgene for human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Ad.SOD1) was the kind gift of Dr. John Engelhardt (University of Iowa). Preparation of adenovirus containing the transgene for hemagglutinin-tagged IκBα super-repressor (Ad.IκB) has been described previously (17Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Google Scholar). The IκBα super-repressor is a dominant-negative protein that contains Ser32 → Ala and Ser36 → Ala mutations, which inhibit phosphorylation and prevent NFκB dissociation and translocation into the nucleus. Recombinant adenoviruses containing dominant-negative TAK, an inhibitor of LPS-induced AP-1 activation (18Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. Richard Rippe (University of North Carolina). The virus isolates were plaque-purified and propagated in HEK-293 cells, isolated, concentrated, and titered by plaque assay. Purified recombinant adenovirus (1 × 109 plaque-forming units) was suspended in normal saline and injected into animals via the tail vein. Kupffer cells and hepatocytes were isolated from naive Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) or rats infected with Ad.lacZ (1 × 109 pfu) 3 days earlier. Briefly, livers were isolated following pentobarbital anesthesia (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and perfused via the portal vein for 10 min with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer containing 115 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.016% collagenase (pH 7.4) followed by 10 min of perfusion with calcium-free buffer containing 0.5 mm EGTA. Liver cells were dispersed by gentle shaking in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, 4 °C), and the nonparenchymal cell fraction was separated from parenchymal cells by centrifugation through Percoll gradients based on a method developed by Smedsrod and Pertoft (19Smedsrod B. Pertoft H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 213-230Google Scholar). Either whole liver or isolated hepatocytes and Kupffer cells were homogenized, and samples (30 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis using 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted with either anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti- Cu,Zn-SOD antibody (Oxis, Portland, OR), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The anti-SOD antibody is cross-reactive with both endogenous rat Cu,Zn-SOD and the human recombinant SOD. Protein was visualized by radiography using ECL Western detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (6 μm) were mounted on glass slides. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then stained with mouse anti-CD14 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. The immunostaining was visualized using the DAKO immunostaining kit. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Primary antibody dilutions were 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20. For studies in whole liver, nuclear extracts were isolated as described by Dignam et al.(20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) with minor modifications (21Rusyn I. Tsukamoto H. Thurman R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1217-1222Google Scholar). Binding conditions for NFκB and AP-1 were characterized and EMSA was performed as described elsewhere (22Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Google Scholar, 23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (20 μg) from liver tissue were preincubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 μg bovine serum albumin (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 μl of a 32P-labeled DNA probe (10,000 cpm/μl) containing 1 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide in a total volume of 20 μl. Mixtures were incubated FOR 20 min on ice and resolved on 5% polyacrylamide (29:1 cross-linking) and 0.4× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat LS Kodak film. The intensity of NFκB and NFκB binding was quantitated by scanning autoradiograms with GelScan XL (Amersham Biosciences) and is expressed as arbitrary densitometric units. Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue using RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). RNase protection assays for cytokine expression were performed using the RiboQuant multiprobe assay system (Pharmingen). Briefly, [32P] RNA probes were transcribed with T7 polymerase using the multiprobe template set mCK-3 (Pharmingen). For CD14, a cDNA fragment amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR from mouse macrophage cDNA library was subcloned into pCR-Topo (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) by standard cloning procedures. Prior to translation of the RNA probe, the pCR plasmid containing the CD14 insert was linearized byHindIII restriction digest. The RNA probe was generated with T7 polymerase using the transcription assay described above. RNA (20 μg) was hybridized with 4 × 105 cpm of probe overnight at 56 °C. Samples were then digested with RNase followed by proteinase K treatment, phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Samples were resolved on a 5% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (19:1) urea gel. After drying, the gel was visualized by autoradiography. To evaluate gene transfer of SOD in these studies, whole liver extracts were evaluated by Western blot using antibodies against the human isoform of Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig.1 A). In the livers of animals 3 days after Ad.lacZ infection, low levels of human Cu,Zn-SOD were detected, which was most likely caused by cross-reactivity with the mouse isoform. In Ad.SOD1-infected mice, however, significant Cu,Zn-SOD expression was observed. It was demonstrated that recombinant adenovirus could transduce both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in vivo (8Wheeler M.D. Yamashina S. Froh M. Rusyn I. Thurman R.G. J Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 622-630Google Scholar). Thus, experiments were performed to determine whether SOD was overexpressed in each cell type following Ad.SOD1 infection in mice. Mice were infected with either Ad.lacZ or Ad.SOD1 as described above, and Kupffer cells and hepatocytes were isolated 3 days after infection as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lysates from each cell type were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for either Cu,Zn-SOD or β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 B). β-Galactosidase was detected in hepatocytes from Ad.lacZ-infected animals but not in hepatocytes from Ad.SOD1-infected mice. Similarly, β-galactosidase expression was observed in Kupffer cells from Ad.lacZ-infected animals but not in those from Ad.SOD1-infected mice. As expected, Cu,Zn-SOD expression in hepatocytes was significantly increased in mice infected with Ad.SOD1 compared with mice infected with Ad.lacZ. Kupffer cells from Ad.lacZ-infected mice expressed very little Cu,Zn-SOD. However, Cu,Zn-SOD expression was significantly increased in Kupffer cells from mice infected with Ad.SOD1, confirming that Ad.SOD1 transduces both hepatocytes and Kupffer cell in vivo, resulting in overexpression of SOD in each cell type. It is known that ethanol enhances the response of mice to LPS administration. The hypothesis that acute oxidative stress plays a role in the mechanisms of sensitization was tested here. First, C57Bl/6 mice were given either saline or ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically) followed by LPS (2.5 mg/kg, intravenously) 24 h later. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after LPS administration (Fig.2 A). As expected, serum ALT levels were elevated in saline-pretreated animals at 8 h after LPS at 110 ± 12 units/ml. However, in ethanol-pretreated mice, the increase in serum ALT levels 8 h after LPS was significantly potentiated by nearly 80% (186 ± 12 units/ml, p< 0.05, Repeated measures ANOVA) mice. These data support the hypothesis that ethanol induces sensitization to LPS, which is consistent with numerous reports. Next, animals were infected with recombinant adenovirus (1 × 109 pfu/animal, intravenously) containing either Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Ad.SOD1) or β-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ). Three days after infection, when transgene expression is optimal, animals were given either saline or ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically), followed 24 h later by LPS (2.5 g/kg, intravenously) or vehicle alone. The increase in serum ALT levels caused by LPS alone was slightly blunted in Ad.SOD1-infected mice but was not significantly different after 8 h compared with levels in Ad.lacZ-infected animals (Fig. 2 B). As expected, ethanol pretreatment of Ad.lacZ-infected animals given LPS resulted in a significant increase in serum ALT release over Ad.lacZ-infected animals pretreated with saline. Importantly, under these conditions, ethanol alone in both Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD1-infected animals did not cause a significant increase in ALT release. However, in animals infected with Ad.SOD1, ethanol pretreatment had no effect on LPS-induced increase in serum ALT levels. These data strongly support the hypothesis that oxidative stress participates in the mechanisms of sensitization to LPS induced by ethanol in mouse liver. To understand how oxidants participate in the mechanisms of ethanol-induced sensitization to LPS, the hypothesis that oxidants are involved in activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 following acute ethanol was tested. First, control mice were given ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically), liver nuclear extracts were isolated 0, 1, 3, and 6 h later, and the DNA binding activity of both NFκB and AP-1 was evaluated by EMSA (Fig. 3). Peak NFκΒ DNA binding activity was observed ∼3 h after ethanol exposure (Fig. 3 A). Using nuclear extracts isolated 3 h after ethanol exposure, competition and supershift assays were performed to validate the specificity of NFκB DNA binding. The addition of unlabeled probe completely blocked DNA binding in extracts from ethanol-treated mice. Moreover, the addition of antibodies against mouse p50 and p65 subunits of NFκB caused retardation in NFκB gel shift mobility, confirming the formation of active NFκB induced by ethanol exposure. Similar studies were performed to evaluate the activation of AP-1 following acute ethanol. The DNA binding activity of AP-1 also peaked at ∼3 h after ethanol (Fig. 3 B). The specificity of AP-1 DNA binding was also determined by competition and supershift assays using antibodies against both c-Fos and c-Jun. To test the hypothesis that overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD would blunt acute ethanol-induced NFκB and AP-1 activation, mice were infected with recombinant Ad.lacZ (1 × 109pfu/animal) or Ad.SOD1 as described above. Three days after infection, mice were given 5 g/kg ethanol, and nuclear extracts were isolated from liver 3 h later. Ethanol caused a significant increase in NFκB activity in Ad.lacZ-infected mice. Importantly, ethanol-induced NFκB activation was markedly blunted in mice infected with Ad.SOD1 (Fig. 3 C). In animals infected with Ad.lacZ, ethanol induced a significant increase in AP-1 activity, which was not observed in animals infected with Ad.SOD1 (Fig.3 D). These data strongly support the hypothesis that oxidant generation caused by exposure to acute ethanol is important for activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor AP-1. Moreover, these data suggest that activation of NFκB and AP-1 may be important in the sensitization to LPS caused by acute ethanol exposure. NFκB and AP-1 are known transcription factors that regulate the expression of several inflammatory cytokines. Thus, mRNA levels of cytokines were measured in livers of Ad.lacZ- and Ad.SOD1-infected mice following administration of either saline or ethanol (Fig.4). Consistent with transcription factor activation, mRNA levels for TNFα were significantly elevated in Ad.lacZ-infected animals following ethanol injection. In Ad.SOD1-infected mice, the ethanol-induced increase in TNFα mRNA was blunted by >70%. Similarly, ethanol caused an increase in interleukin-6 mRNA levels, which was nearly completely blocked in Ad.SOD1-infected mice. These changes in mRNA, quantified by phosphorimaging, clearly demonstrate that oxidants are involved in the acute ethanol-induced increase in cytokine production. To verify these findings, serum cytokine levels were measured in mice following ethanol exposure. In animals infected with Ad.lacZ, a peak increase in serum TNFα levels was observed 6 h after ethanol administration. Ethanol caused a significant increase in TNFα from basal levels of 28.1 ± 4.3 pg/ml to 46.7 ± 7.4 pg/ml (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc analysis). This increase in serum TNFα was blunted to 29.4 ± 6.3 pg/ml in mice infected with Ad.SOD1. These data correlate with the ethanol-induced changes in TNFα mRNA levels in mice infected with Ad.lacZ and Ad.SOD. Surprisingly, interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 was not detected in serum following ethanol exposure in either Ad.lacZ- or Ad.SOD1-infected mice. Perhaps this is related to changes in localized expression of these cytokines, which may not alter serum levels. Recently it was demonstrated that chronic ethanol-fed animals exhibited high levels of CD14 expression on Kupffer cells (12Enomoto N. Ikejima K. Yamashina S. Hirose M. Shimizu H. Kitamura T. Takei Y. Sato A.N. Thurman R.G. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 51S-54SGoogle Scholar, 25Kono H. Wheeler M.D. Rusyn I. Lin M. Seabra V. Rivera C.A. Bradford B.U. Forman D.T. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G652-G661Google Scholar). The hypothesis is that ethanol exposure causes an up-regulation of CD14, which “primes” Kupffer cells to LPS causing an elevated inflammatory response. Moreover, promoter elements for the CD14 gene have been shown to contain several AP-1 consensus binding sites (26Matsuura K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21787-21794Google Scholar, 27Liu S. Shapiro R.A. Nie S. Zhu D. Vodovotz Y. Billiar T.R. Gene. 2000; 250: 137-147Google Scholar). Thus, the hypothesis that acute ethanol increased the expression of CD14 in whole liver was tested. Animals were given ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically) and sacrificed after 0, 1, 3, 12, and 21 h. CD14 mRNA, measured by RNase protection assay, was elevated significantly at 3 h after ethanol administration (Fig.5 A), supporting the hypothesis that ethanol increases CD14 expression in vivo. To test the hypothesis that oxidants were involved in ethanol-induced up-regulation of CD14, mice were infected with Ad.SOD1 (1 × 109 pfu/animal) or Ad.lacZ 3 days prior to ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically) or saline treatment, and CD14 mRNA was measured 3 h later. Compared with saline, ethanol caused a significant increase in CD14 mRNA in Ad.lacZ-infected animals. However, the increase in CD14 induced by ethanol was dramatically blunted in animals infected with Ad.SOD1 (Fig. 5 B). These data strongly support the hypothesis that oxidants are involved in acute ethanol-induced increases in CD14 levels. The strong correlation between the inhibition of redox-sensitive transcription factors and CD14 up-regulation suggests that CD14 expression may be regulated by NFκB and/or AP-1. Because it has been reported that CD14 can be expressed on hepatocytes in addition to Kupffer cells, it was important to determine the location of CD14 expression following acute ethanol exposure. To test the hypothesis that ethanol caused an up-regulation of CD14 primarily on Kupffer cells, liver sections from mice infected with either Ad.lacZ or Ad.SOD1 and given either saline or ethanol were stained immunohistochemically for CD14 (Fig.6). Compared with results in saline-treated mice, a significant increase in CD14 detection was observed 24 h after ethanol administration. CD14 expression was increased predominantly in sinusoidal cells (i.e. Kupffer cells). Ethanol-induced CD14 expression was not significantly increased over basal levels of expression in mice infected with Ad.SOD1. This is an important finding confirming that an increase in CD14 mRNA translates into increased protein expression and that ethanol-induced expression is most likely limited to Kupffer cells within the liver. Because AP-1 regulatory sites are present in the promoter region of CD14 (27Liu S. Shapiro R.A. Nie S. Zhu D. Vodovotz Y. Billiar T.R. Gene. 2000; 250: 137-147Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that AP-1 regulates CD14 expression following acute ethanol administration. To test this hypothesis, animals were infected with an adenovirus (1 × 109 pfu/animal, intravenously) containing the transgene for either β-galactosidase, dominant-negative IκBα, an inhibitor of NFκB, or dominant-negative TAK1 (Ad.ΔTAK), an up-stream activation kinase for AP-1 (18Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915Google Scholar). Three days after infection, animals were given 5 g/kg ethanol as above and sacrificed 3 h later, and CD14 mRNA levels were measured by RNase protection assay (Fig.7). As expected, in Ad.lacZ-infected animals, ethanol caused a significant increase in CD14 mRNA compared with animals given saline. Overexpression of dominant-negative IκBα, a specific inhibitor of NFκB, had no effect on ethanol-induced up-regulation of CD14, despite a clear inhibition of NFκB activation in vivo (data not shown). However, the increase in CD14 mRNA levels following ethanol was dramatically blunted in animals infected with Ad.ΔTAK, strongly supporting the hypothesis that AP-1 activation is involved in the up-regulation of CD14 under these conditions. Also, overexpression of dominant-negative TAK significantly blunted ethanol-induced activation of AP-1 DNA binding compared with controls (data not shown). Because oxidants are involved in acute ethanol-induced CD14 expression in vivo, and CD14 is primarily expressed on Kupffer cells, it is hypothesized that NADPH oxidase, the primary source of oxidants in Kupffer cells, is important in the mechanism. Thus, ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically) or saline was given to either wild-type or NADPH oxidase-deficient mice (p47phox−/−), and CD14 expression was measured 3 h later. As expected, in wild-type mice, administration of ethanol, as compared with saline, caused a significant increase in CD14 mRNA (Fig. 8 A). However, ethanol-induced CD14 expression was blunted by >75% in NADPH oxidase-deficient mice. These data strongly suggest that NADPH oxidase is central to oxidant production following acute ethanol and that it is involved in the up-regulation of CD14, most likely through NFκB and AP-1 transcription factors. Because acute ethanol causes TNFα production and also oxidative stress, we hypothesized that TNFα mediates AP-1 activation and up-regulation of CD14. To test this hypothesis, mice deficient in TNFα (TNF−/−) and wild-type control mice were given either saline or ethanol (5 g/kg, intragastrically). Three hours later, the mice were sacrificed, and the level of CD14 mRNA was measured by RNase protection assay (Fig. 8 B). In the wild-type controls, ethanol induced a significant increase in CD14 expression compared with wild-type mice receiving only saline. Similarly, ethanol caused a significant increase in CD14 mRNA in TNFα−/− mice. Importantly, the increase in CD14 mRNA due to ethanol was not different between wild-type and TNFα−/− mice, suggesting that TNFα signaling is not required for the increase in CD14 expression under these conditions. A recently described polymorphism in the human CD14 promoter region, resulting in higher levels of CD14, is associated with an increase in severity of alcoholic liver disease (28Jarvelainen H.A. Orpana A. Perola M. Savolainen V.T. Karhunen P.J. Lindros K.O. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1148-1153Google Scholar). These human studies, along with several animal studies, strongly support the involvement of CD14 in alcoholic liver disease and suggest that CD14 is a risk factor for ethanol-induced pathology (29Yin M. Bradford B.U. Wheeler M.D. Uesugi T. Froh M. Goyert S.M. Thurman R.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4737-4742Google Scholar). CD14, which is expressed largely on Kupffer cells in the liver, is activated by circulating endotoxin that enters the liver via the portal vein. CD14 is a membrane-associated receptor but has no transmembrane-spanning region. Thus, it associates with the toll-like receptor-4, which initiates intracellular signaling. Although clearly defined signaling pathways have not been identified, activation of CD14 results in the production of superoxide free radicals and toxic cytokines, including TNFα, as well as a number of other inflammatory responses. Mice deficient in CD14 are almost completely resistant to LPS-induced liver injury at physiological levels (i.e. less than 10–50 pg/ml). Moreover, CD14-deficient mice do not exhibit any pathological changes due to chronic ethanol exposure compared with wild-type mice. Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of CD14 and endotoxin in ethanol-induced liver injury. Activation of CD14 on Kupffer cells leads to the production of superoxide and TNFα, which are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. We and others have shown that CD14 levels are elevated in liver following chronic exposure to ethanol (1Yamashina S. Wheeler M.D. Rusyn I. Ikejima K. Sato N. Thurman R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 686-690Google Scholar, 24Kishore R. Hill J.R. McMullen M.R. Frenkel J. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G6-G15Google Scholar, 25Kono H. Wheeler M.D. Rusyn I. Lin M. Seabra V. Rivera C.A. Bradford B.U. Forman D.T. Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G652-G661Google Scholar). This increase correlates with ethanol-induced liver injury. Thus, steady increases in CD14 expression because of ethanol exposure, resulting in increased cytokine production, could exacerbate ethanol-induced injury. These studies were done to understand the mechanisms involved in CD14 up-regulation due to ethanol. It is shown here that acute ethanol administration leads to a rapid increase in CD14 expression in vivo. These data are consistent with the observation that acute ethanol causes hypersensitivity to LPS, a mechanism known as “priming” or “sensitization.” It is hypothesized that ethanol activates signaling mechanisms that result in the up-regulation of CD14 on Kupffer cells, which sensitizes animals to subsequent challenge with LPS. Because it is known that ethanol activates redox-sensitive transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 and induces a rapid increase in CD14 expression, it is hypothesized that oxidants activate either NFκB or AP-1 and increase the synthesis of CD14. Moreover, it was hypothesized that overexpression of SOD would blunt the increase in CD14 due to acute ethanol. In these experiments it was clearly demonstrated that SOD blunted the priming effect of ethanol in vivo (Fig. 2 B). However, it is difficult to understand whether SOD directly blunts the effects of ethanol on priming or whether SOD blunts LPS signaling itself. Therefore, studies were done to evaluate the role of oxidants in the priming effect of ethanol alone. Consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol primes the liver, acute ethanol activates NFκB and AP-1 (Fig. 3). Acute ethanol also causes a transient increase in cytokine production similar to the increase in CD14 expression (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, it was also hypothesized that activation of transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 played a role in the up-regulation of CD14. To determine whether AP-1 was directly responsible for the up-regulation of CD14, studies were done to inhibit AP-1 using dominant-negative TAK expression via adenovirus. Inhibition of AP-1, either indirectly by overexpression of SOD or directly by dominant-negative TAK, blunted the increase in CD14 expression due to acute ethanol in addition to blunting AP-1 activation. TAK has been demonstrated to be an “up-stream” kinase of AP-1, leading to its activation (18Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that AP-1 is a critical transcription factor involved in the up-regulation of CD14. This finding is consistent with other reports demonstrating that the CD14 promoter contains several AP-1-responsive elements (26Matsuura K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21787-21794Google Scholar). Overexpression of superoxide dismutase blunted ethanol-induced activation of NFκB and AP-1 and up-regulation of CD14, suggesting that these redox-sensitive transcription factors are involved in the regulation of CD14. However, it is likely that AP-1 and not NFκB is actually involved because NFκB regulatory elements within the CD14 promoter have not been identified. Moreover, inhibition of NFκB using the dominant-negative IκBα super-repressor, although blocking ethanol-induced NFκB activation, had no effect on the up-regulation of CD14 following acute ethanol (Fig. 7). On the other hand, inhibition of AP-1 activation using dominant-negative TAK completely and significantly blunted the increase in CD14 expression (Fig. 7). It is hypothesized that TNFα release by Kupffer cells in response to acute ethanol activates the AP-1 pathway, leading to an increase in CD14 expression. However, we demonstrate here that the up-regulation of CD14 was not affected in mice deficient in TNFα (Fig. 8). These data suggest that TNFα signaling is not necessary for ethanol to up-regulate CD14. This is an important point because it was shown that TNFα is required for long-term ethanol induced liver injury. Interestingly, deletion of NADPH oxidase in p47phox mutant mice did inhibit CD14 up-regulation due to ethanol, supporting the hypothesis that NAPDH oxidase is an early source of oxidants due to ethanol. This experiment was performed to identify the potential source of oxidant production that contributed to AP-1 activation and CD14 expression. The p47phox subunit is most likely a critical regulatory factor of NADPH oxidase, based on a number studies. Therefore, these data suggest that NADPH oxidase is important for oxidant production following acute ethanol. However, with the expanding information about NADPH oxidase genes, it is becoming clear that p47phox expression is not limited to macrophages, unlike the catalytic subunit gp91phox of NADPH oxidase, which is predominantly expressed on macrophages. The role of gp91phox in ethanol-induced oxidative stress in liver is an important unresolved question. In conclusion, ethanol induces oxidant production through NADPH oxidase in Kupffer cells leading to the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors, which simultaneously up-regulates cytokine expression and CD14 expression. It has recently been shown that CD14 is necessary for ethanol-induced liver injury in mice and that increased levels of CD14 correlate with severity of alcoholic liver disease in humans. Thus, it is very likely that acute doses of ethanol cause an increase in CD14 and that progressive increases in CD14 underlie the mechanisms of pathology. As ethanol exposure increases in CD14 expression, a hyper-responsiveness may lead to a significant and sustained increase in oxidant and cytokine production, which disposes the liver to greater injury. Although CD14 is required for ethanol-induced liver injury, it is not clear whether basal levels of CD14 are sufficient to mediate the pathological effects of ethanol and endotoxin or whether the increase in CD14 expression is required. This is an intriguing question because it represents a potential target for therapy, to inhibit the up-regulation of CD14 in vivo."

We found that human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to a vesicating dose (300 μm) of sulfur mustard (SM) exhibit a dose-dependent increase in the levels of Fas receptor and Fas ligand. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the upstream caspases-8 and -9 are both activated in a time-dependent fashion, and caspase-8 is cleaved prior to caspase-9. These results are consistent with the activation of both death receptor (caspase-8) and mitochondrial (caspase-9) pathways by SM. Pretreatment of keratinocytes with a peptide inhibitor of caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-CHO) suppressed SM-induced downstream markers of apoptosis. To further analyze the importance of the death receptor pathway in SM toxicity, we utilized Fas- or tumor necrosis factor receptor-neutralizing antibodies or constructs expressing a dominant-negative FADD (FADD-DN) to inhibit the recruitment of FADD to the death receptor complex and block the Fas/tumor necrosis factor receptor pathway following SM exposure. Keratinocytes pretreated with Fas-blocking antibody or stably expressing FADD-DN and exhibiting reduced levels of FADD signaling demonstrated markedly decreased caspase-3 activity when treated with SM. In addition, the processing of procaspases-3, -7, and -8 into their active forms was observed in SM-treated control keratinocytes, but not in FADD-DN cells. Blocking the death receptor complex by expression of FADD-DN additionally inhibited SM-induced internucleosomal DNA cleavage and caspase-6-mediated nuclear lamin cleavage. Significantly, we further found that altering the death receptor pathway by expressing FADD-DN in human skin grafted onto nude mice reduces vesication and tissue injury in response to SM. These results indicate that the death receptor pathway plays a pivotal role in SM-induced apoptosis and is therefore a target for therapeutic intervention to reduce SM injury.

In an effort to help develop medical countermeasures for potential exposure of military personnel and civilians, we have been attempting to define the molecular series of events leading to SM toxicity in cell culture, in transgenic animal models, and in grafted human epidermis. Whereas human dermal fibroblasts may contribute to the vesication response by releasing degradative cytosolic components extracellularly after a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent SM-induced necrosis (7Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Liu W.F. Velena A. Anderson D. Benton B. Wang Z.Q. Smith W. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1566-1573Google Scholar), keratinocytes display markers of an apoptotic death, as well as those of terminal differentiation (8Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Spoonde A. Smith W. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 64-71Google Scholar). SM-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes appears to be controlled by both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways (9Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Smith W.J. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2000; 20: S43-S49Google Scholar). The targets of these apoptotic pathways are a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases or caspases (10Alnemri E. Livingston D. Nicholson D. Salvesen G. Thornberry N. Wong W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Google Scholar). Caspase-3 appears to be a converging point for different apoptotic pathways (11Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A.

In the present study, we demonstrate that SM induces both Fas and its ligand (FasL) in primary human epidermal keratinocytes. We also observed the activation of markers of apoptosis that are consistent with a Fas-FasL-receptor interaction, including cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP. Utilizing a combination of techniques including the stable expression of a dominant-negative inhibitor of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), we demonstrate a role for the Fas/TNF receptor family in mediating the response of human keratinocytes to SM. Stable expression of FADD-DN blocks SM-induced markers of keratinocyte apoptosis, such as caspase-3 activity and proteolytic processing of procaspases-3, -7, and -8, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, and caspase-6-mediated nuclear lamin cleavage. We have shown earlier that NHEK as well as an immortalized line, Nco, could be used to establish a histologically and immunocytochemically normal epidermis when grafted onto nude mice (8Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Spoonde A. Smith W. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 64-71Google Scholar, 9Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Smith W.J. Ray R.

The present study demonstrates that markers of apoptosis are induced in basal cells of SM-exposed grafts, particularly in regions where microvesicles are formed. We have now also utilized the graft system to genetically engineer human keratinocytes prior to grafting to ectopically express a dominant-negative FADD and generate a human epidermis containing FADD-DN keratinocytes. These human grafts were exposed to SM, and showed a reduced vesication response compared with control keratinocyte. Topical SM exposure of Fas-deficient mice in the current study also indicates the viability of this strategy to suppress vesication by using inhibitors of the death receptor pathway. An understanding of the mechanisms for SM vesication will hopefully lead to therapeutic strategies for prevention or treatment of SM toxicity. Importantly, our experiments indicate that the Fas/FADD pathway is required for caspase-3 processing, because inhibitors of this pathway block SM-induced apoptosis. Because the FADD pathway can be manipulated at the level of a cell surface (Fas), receptor, Fas/FADD as well as the caspases represent attractive targets for the modulation of the effects of SM. Inhibition of the Fas/FADD pathway by specific pharmacological inhibitors such as neutralizing antibodies to Fas or peptide inhibitors of caspases may therefore be of therapeutic value in the treatment of or prophylaxis against SM injury in humans. Primary human keratinocytes were derived from neonatal foreskins and grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium (SFM) supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen). Primary keratinocytes were immortalized by transduction with the HPV16 E6/E7 genes (16Sherman L. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3269-3279Google Scholar) to generate the Nco cell line as described previously (17Stöppler H. Stöppler M.C. Johnson E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Smulson M.E. Iyer S. Rosenthal D.S. Schlegel R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1207-1214Google Scholar). The FADD-DN plasmid construct in pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen), a generous gift from Dr. V. Dixit, expresses a truncated FADD protein, which lacks the N-terminal domain that is responsible for recruiting and activating caspase-8 at the death receptor complex (Fig. 5 A). Nco cells were transfected with empty vector or with FADD-DN using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and stable clones were selected in G418 and maintained in SFM. Cells were grown to 60–80% confluency, and then exposed to SM diluted in SFM to final concentrations of 100, 200, or 300 μm, with or without pretreatment with Fas- (clone ZB-4; Upstate Biotech, Waltham, MA) or TNFR1- (clone H398; Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria (18Choi K.B. Wong F. Harlan J.M. Chaudhary P.M. Hood L. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20185-20188Google Scholar)) neutralizing antibodies. Media was not changed for the duration of the experiments. At different time points after SM exposure, cells were harvested for further analyses. SM (bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide; >98% purity) was obtained from the United States Army Edgewood Research, Development and Engineering Center. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, incubated for 10 min on ice, and freeze-thawed 3 times. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein concentration of the cytosolic extract was determined with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. For the fluorometric caspase-3 activity assay, 25 μg of cytosolic extract was initially diluted to a volume of 50 μl with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, to which 50 μl of caspase assay buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol) was added. The aliquots were then mixed with equal amounts (100 μl) of 40 μm fluorescent tetrapeptide substrate specific for caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-AMC; BACHEM) in caspase assay buffer and transferred to 96-well plates. Free aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), generated as a result of cleavage of the aspartate-AMC bond, was monitored continuously over 10 min with a Cytofluor 4000 fluorometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The emission from each well was plotted against time, and linear regression analysis of the initial velocity (slope) for each curve yielded the activity. SDS-PAGE and transfer of separated proteins to nitrocellulose membranes were performed according to standard procedures. Proteins were measured (DCA protein assay; Bio-Rad) and normalized prior to gel loading, and all filters were stained with Ponceau S, to reduce the possibility of loading artifacts. They were then incubated with antibodies to the p17 subunit of caspase-3 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-7 (1:1000; BD Pharmingen), caspase-8 (1:1000; BD Pharmingen), caspase-9 (1:1000; Trevigen), or caspase-10 (1:1000; Trevigen), lamin A (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) 45 (1:500; BD Pharmingen), or PARP (1:1000; BD Pharmingen). Immune complexes were detected by subsequent incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (1:3000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunoblots were sequentially stripped of antibodies by incubation for 30 min at 50 °C with a solution containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), blocked again, and reprobed with additional antibodies to accurately compare different proteins from the same filter. Typically, a filter could be reprobed three times before there was detectable loss of protein from the membrane, which was monitored by Ponceau S staining after stripping. Cells were harvested and lysed in 0.5 ml of 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, and total genomic DNA was extracted and purified using a Wizard Miniprep DNA Purification Resin (Promega). After RNase A treatment (20 μg/ml) of the DNA samples for 30 min, apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel at 4 V/cm. DNA ladders were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and images were captured with the Kodak EDAS 120 (Kodak) gel documentation system. Cells were plated in culture plates and exposed to various concentrations of SM. 16 h after induction of apoptosis, the cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and subsequently resuspended in and incubated in the dark with 100 μl of annexin V incubation reagent that includes fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) and propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature. Flow cytometric analyses were conducted on a BD Biosciences FACStar Plus cytometer using a 100-milliwatt air-cooled argon laser at 488 nm. A 1-cm diameter piece of skin was removed from the dorsal surface of athymic mice, and a pellet of cells containing 8 × 106 fibroblasts + 5 × 106 keratinocytes (NHEK or Nco) was pipetted on top of the muscular layer within a silicon dome to protect the cells during epithelization (Fig.10 A). The dome was removed after a week and the graft was allowed to develop for 6–8 weeks. SM exposure was performed by placing a small amount of SM liquid into an absorbent filter at the bottom of a vapor cup, which was then inverted onto the dorsal surface of the animal, to expose the graft site to the SM vapor. Frozen and fixed sections were derived from punch biopsies taken from the graft site, and analyzed for the expression of FADD-DN using the AU1 antibody, which recognizes the specific AU1 epitope tag on the FADD-DN protein. Histological analysis of the SM-exposed human skin grafts transplanted onto nude mice was also performed utilizing an end point of micro- or macroblisters or SM-induced microvesication.Figure 10Detection of AU1-tagged FADD-DN and human K14 in human keratinocytes grafted to nude mice. A, schematic diagram of grafting protocol wherein a 1-cm diameter piece of skin is removed from the dorsal surface of athymic mice, and a pellet of cells containing 8 × 106fibroblasts + 5 × 106 keratinocytes (NHEK or Nco) are pipetted on top of the muscular layer within a silicon dome to protect the cells during development. The dome is removed after 1 week.B, Nco human keratinocytes were stably transfected with a FADD-DN construct, containing a FADD-DN insert in pCDNA 3.1 linked to a sequence encoding the AU1 epitope. Six weeks after grafting, skin was harvested, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. 5 μm sections were deparaffinized, and stained with antisera specific for AU1 (middle), or human keratin 14 (right). No staining was observed in host mouse skin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Paraffin-embedded sections derived from SM-exposed human skin grafts were subjected to analysis for markers of in vivo apoptosis, including indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies to the active form of caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Sections were deparaffinized, incubated overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature with antibodies to active caspase-3 (1:250 dilution) in PBS containing 12% bovine serum albumin. After a PBS wash, slides were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution in PBS/bovine serum albumin), washed, and incubated for 30 min with streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red (1:800 dilution in PBS/bovine serum albumin). Cells were finally mounted with PBS containing 80% glycerol and observed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. DNA breaks characteristic of the late stage of apoptosis were detectedin situ using a Klenow fragment-based assay system (DermaTACS; Trevigen). For fixation, slides were equilibrated to room temperature and redried for 2 h on a slide warmer at 45 °C, rehydrated in 100, 95, then 70% ethanol, washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7% buffered formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and washed in PBS. Slides were then incubated with 50 μl of Cytonin for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice in deionized water, and immersed in quenching solution containing 90% methanol and 3% H2O2 for 5 min at room temperature. After a PBS wash, slides were incubated in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase labeling buffer for 5 min at room temperature, and visualized under a bright field microscope. We determined the sequence of events involved in SM-induced apoptosis by performing dose-response and time course experiments. Fas, a cell-surface receptor found in most cell types including keratinocytes, mediates some forms of apoptosis. Upon activation by its specific ligand (FasL), or by agonist antibody, Fas forms a homotrimeric complex, which in turn recruits the FADD to the membrane-bound complex. In turn, one or more of the upstream caspases (caspase-8 or -10) localize to the Fas-FADD complex, and become autocatalytically activated. We first determined whether SM induces expression of the Fas receptor or its ligand because enhanced expression of Fas or FasL has been shown to occur in cells exposed to DNA damaging agents, leading to activation of upstream caspase-8 and downstream apoptotic events such as caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage (19Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Google Scholar, 20Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of extracts derived from keratinocytes exposed to different doses of SM revealed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of both Fas receptor and FasL in response to SM (Fig. 1 A). By immunoblot analysis using antibodies that recognize both the full-length (116 kDa) and 89-kDa cleavage products of PARP, we also demonstrated that SM-induced apoptosis is accompanied by complete cleavage of PARP into 89- and 24- kDa fragments that contain the active site and the DNA-binding domain of the enzyme, similar to the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PARP induced by exposure to anti-Fas (Fig. 1 C). The central signaling proteins for many of the pathways that coordinate apoptosis are the caspases, cysteine proteases named for their preference for aspartate at their substrate cleavage site (10Alnemri E. Livingston D. Nicholson D. Salvesen G. Thornberry N. Wong W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Google Scholar), which cleave key proteins involved in the structure and integrity of the cell. We previously focused on caspase-3 activation in the SM apoptotic response (8Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Spoonde A. Smith W. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 64-71Google Scholar, 9Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Smith W.J. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Appl. Toxicol. 2000; 20: S43-S49Google Scholar), because caspase-3 has been shown to be a converging point for different apoptotic pathways (11Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar). In a number of apoptotic systems, caspase-3 cleaves key proteins involved in the structure and integrity of the cell. To further understand the apoptotic response of keratinocytes following SM exposure, we assayed for the activation of other key caspases, in particular the upstream caspases-8, -9, and -10, and the executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7. When the blot in Fig. 1 A was stripped of antibodies and reprobed with anti-caspase-8, SM-induced proteolytic processing of caspase-8 was noted in cells exposed to vesicating doses of SM (200 and 300 μm; Fig. 1 B). The sequence of caspase activation provides insight into the mechanism of apoptosis because caspase-8 is first activated following engagement of death receptors, whereas caspase-9 is activated via a mitochondrial pathway. We therefore investigated the molecular ordering of caspase activation in response to SM. NHEK were exposed to 300 μmSM for various times, and cell extracts were derived and subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing antibodies specific to caspases-3, -7, -8, -9, or -10. Upstream caspases-8 and -9 were both activated in a time-dependent fashion, with caspase-8 cleaved prior to caspase-9 (1 versus 4 h) (Fig.2). Because activation of caspase-8 correlates with a Fas-mediated pathway of apoptosis and activation of caspase-9 is consistent with a mitochondrial pathway, these results are in agreement with the activation of both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways by SM. In contrast, no cleavage of caspase-10 was observed (Fig. 6 C).Figure 6Stable expression of FADD-DN in Nco keratinocytes inhibits SM-induced activation and proteolytic processing of procaspases-3 and -8 to their active forms. A, Nco and FADD-DN keratinocytes were incubated for 16 h with the indicated concentrations of SM in SFM (left panel) or to agonist antibodies to Fas (right panel), after which whole cell extracts were prepared and assayed for caspase-3 activity with the specific substrate DEVD-AMC. Cell extracts from the experiment inA were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for caspases-3 (B), -8, and -10 (C). The positions of the caspases and their proteolytic cleavage products are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The executioner caspases-3 and -7 were both proteolytically activated after SM exposure, with caspase-3 activation detectable 3 h after SM exposure, and caspase-7 cleavage noted 4 h after exposure. To detect caspase-6 activity, we utilized antisera specific for lamin A, which is cleaved in vivo by active caspase-6 at the peptide sequence VEID. Caspase-6 activity is essential for lamin A cleavage, which is necessary for chromatin condensation during apoptotic execution (21Ruchaud S.N.K. Villa P. Kottke T. Dingwall C.S.K. Earnshaw W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1967-1977Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the time course of caspase-6-mediated lamin A cleavage in NHEK following SM exposure. Surprisingly, this substrate was one of the first to be cleaved (within 1 h), relative to cleavage of PARP (6 h), or the apoptotic DFF/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (16 h; Fig. 3). PARP has been shown to be a substrate of caspase-3 and -7, whereas DFF 45 is primarily cleaved by caspase-3. Taken together, these data suggest that caspase-6 may be the first of the executioner caspases to be activated following exposure of NHEK to SM, followed by caspase-3 and -7. We previously found that the suprabasal-specific keratins, K1 and K10, are induced upon exposure of NHEK to 100 μm SM, using monoclonal antibodies (8Rosenthal D.S. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Iyer S. Spoonde A. Smith W. Ray R. Smulson M.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 64-71Google Scholar). In the current study, we utilized a polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of K1, and found that exposure of cells to higher concentrations of SM resulted in proteolytic cleavage of keratin K1 (Fig. 4 A). The size of the K1 cleavage product maps near a perfect consensus sequence for a site of cleavage by caspase-6 (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, point mutations near this region of K1 give rise to a genetic blistering disorder, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, very similar to SM-induced vesication (22McLean W.H. Eady R.A. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J. McMillan J.R. Leigh I.M. Navsaria H.A. Higgins C. Harper J.I. Paige D.G. Morley S.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 24-30Google Scholar). K1 may therefore be a substrate for caspase-6 and a target during SM-induced keratinocyte apoptosis. Up-regulation of the Fas ligand or receptor (23Takahashi H. Kobayashi H. Hashimoto Y. Matsuo S. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 810-815Google Scholar) causes recruitment of FADD (24Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Google Scholar), to the death-inducing signaling complex (27Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Google Scholar), and induces the activation of caspase-8 (26Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Google Scholar), followed by the activation of the executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7. SM induces a dose-dependent increase in the levels of both Fas receptor as well as FasL (Fig. 1), and caspase-8 is activated within 2 h after exposure of NHEK to SM (Fig. 2). To further analyze the importance of the death receptor pathway for SM toxicity, we utilized a dominant negative inhibitor of FADD (FADD-DN), which expresses a truncated FADD protein containing an AU1 epitope tag and lacking the N-terminal domain necessary for recruitment and activation of caspase-8 at the death receptor complex (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the recruitment of FADD to the death receptor complex is inhibited in cells expressing FADD-DN. Nco cells were transfected with empty vector or with FADD-DN; stable clones were selected in G418 and maintained in SFM. Immunoblot analysis of extracts derived from different FADD-DN clones with antibodies to FADD confirmed the presence of both FADD and FADD-DN in positive clones, whereas parental Nco cells expressed only full-length FADD protein (Fig. 5 B, left panel). Expression of the AU1 tag in one clone (DN3), which was chosen for high levels of FADD-DN and used in subsequent experiments, was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-AU1 (Fig. 5 B,right panel).

https://openalex.org/W2166683510,"Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria possess tripartite transporters that catalyze drug extrusion across the inner and outer membranes, thereby conferring resistance. These transporters consist of inner (IMP) and outer (OMP) membrane proteins, which are coupled by a periplasmic membrane fusion (MFP) protein. However, it is not know whether the MFP translocates the drug between the membranes, by acting as a channel, or whether it brings the IMP and OMP together, facilitating drug transfer. The MFP EmrA has an elongated periplasmic domain, which binds transported drugs, and is anchored to the inner membrane by a single α-helix, which contains a leucine zipper dimerization domain. Consistent with CD and hydrodynamic analyses, the periplasmic domain is predicted to be composed of a β-sheet subdomain and an α-helical coiled-coil. We propose that EmrA forms a trimer in which the coiled-coils radiate across the periplasm, where they could sequester the OMP TolC. The “free” leucine zipper in the EmrA trimer might stabilize the interaction with the IMP EmrB, which also possesses leucine zipper motifs in the putative N- and C-terminal helices.

Gram-negative bacteria possess tripartite transport systems for translocating drugs across both the inner membrane (IM)1 and the outer membrane (OM). This system consists of inner and outer membrane proteins, which translocate drugs across their respective membranes but are coupled by a periplasmic protein (1Borges-Walmsley M.I. Walmsley A.R. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The periplasmic domain of this protein is apparently anchored to the IM via either a lipid moiety or an α-helix. There has been much speculation as to the functional role of this periplasmic protein, the delineation of which is crucial to understanding the mechanism of this type of transport system. One proposal is that it forms a channel between the membranes; but another suggests that it pulls the membranes together, allowing ligand transfer between the IMP and OMP (2Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because of the latter hypothesis this periplasmic protein was originally termed a membrane fusion protein (MFP), but more recently the term dynamic adaptor has been adopted (3Andersen, C., Hughes, C., and Koronakis, V. EMBO Rep., 1, 313–318.Google Scholar). The structures of two of the components of such a tripartite complex, the OMP TolC (4Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) and the IMP AcrB (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), have recently been determined by x-ray crystallography (4Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Both TolC and AcrB crystallize as trimers. The three TolC molecules are structured into a 140-Å cylindrical channel with a 35-Å internal diameter. The OM end of the structure is open, providing solvent access, but the periplasmic end tapers to a virtual close. The structure can be divided into two major domains: an OM β-barrel and a periplasmic α-helical barrel. The β-barrel domain, which provides an essentially open channel through the OM, is composed of 12 β-strands, 4 donated by each TolC molecule, arranged into a right-twisted barrel. The α-helical domain is a 12-helix barrel, constructed from long (67 residues) and short (23 and 34 residues) helices, with pairs of the shorter helices stacked to produce pseudo-continuous helices. The α-helices are further arranged into coiled-coils, and the mixed α/β structure connecting the shorter helices forms a belt around the helical barrel. The α-helical barrel is about 100 Å long, which is close to the lower estimates of the depth of the periplasmic space at 130 Å, but some estimates put the depth of the periplasm at 250 Å and beyond the span of TolC (6Dubochet J. McDowall A.W. Menge B. Schmid E.N. Lickfeld K.G. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 381-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Graham L.L. Beveridge T.J. Naninga N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AcrB trimer, which has a jellyfish-like appearance, comprises a periplasmic headpiece with dimensions of 50 × >100 Å and a transmembrane domain with dimensions of 70 × >80 Å (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The headpiece, which is formed by protrusions between helices 1 and 2 and helices 7 and 8 of the transmembrane domain, is divided into two stacked parts, with the upper and lower parts 30 and 40 Å thick, respectively. Viewed from the side, the upper part has a trapezoidal appearance, 70 Å wide at the bottom and 40 Å at the top; whereas viewed from above, the upper part is open like a funnel, with an internal diameter of 30 Å. This funnel is connected by a pore, located between the headpieces of the three protomers, to a large central cavity at the interface of the headpiece and the transmembrane domains of the protomers. The three transmembrane domains, each of which is composed of 12 helices, are arranged into a ring with a 30-Å hole between them, which might be filled with phospholipids. It has been proposed that the upper headpiece interacts with TolC (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), with six vertical hairpins from the AcrAB trimer contacting the six α-helix-turn-α-helix structures of the TolC trimer, to form a continuous path across the periplasmic space. If this is the case, it suggests a mechanism in which drugs transported through the transmembrane domains of AcrB are delivered to the central cavity created at the transmembrane domain headpiece interface, where they can be shuttled through the headpiece pore and funnel to TolC. Interestingly, MFPs are predicted to have a structure that resembles TolC; the N- and C termini of MFPs are proposed to fold into a flattened β-barrel, with the intervening residues arranged into two long helices, each of about 60 or more residues, which fold back on one another to form a coiled-coil (2Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Considering those MFPs that utilize an N-terminal α-helix to anchor them to the IM, this would position the β-barrel at the IM with the α-helices radiating out across the periplasm. Furthermore, the ability of MFPs to form stable trimers (8Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar,9Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) invites the suggestion that their role is to form a connecting channel between the IM translocase and TolC. The putative β-barrel of the MFP could act as the receiver domain for drugs released from the IM translocase, whereas the α-helices could transiently interact with TolC. A possible mechanism for this interaction is that the six α-helices of the MFP trimer form a cylinder that inserts into the closed end of TolC to open it. Considering however that both TolC and MFPs are highly elongated molecules (4Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 9Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) capable of overlapping in the periplasmic space, a more likely mechanism is for the MFP to utilize its α-helices to “grab” the outer surface of TolC. There is a deep cleft within the headpiece of AcrB in which the MFP AcrA may lie, thereby positioning it to straddle both the periplasmic domains of AcrB and TolC (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), and biochemical cross-linking studies have revealed that the MFP-TolC interaction is substrate-induced and transient (8Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the β-domain contains a motif that resembles the lipoyl domain of enzymes involved in the transfer of a covalently attached lipoyl or biotinyl moiety between proteins (2Johnson J.M. Church G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 695-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In such enzymes, this lipoyl domain is usually a flattened β-barrel. The formation of a similar domain would require the N- and C-terminal domains of the MFP to interact, which might provide a mechanism for bringing the two membranes together. However, the dimensions of AcrB and TolC are sufficient to indicate that they can contact one another across the periplasm, arguing against a role for the MFP in bringing the IM and OM together. This type of transport system is clearly of considerable scientific and medical interest, because our knowledge of them is rudimentary, and their study is likely to have medical benefits, because they confer drug resistance and only effect transport in bacteria. For this study, our aim was to characterize EmrA, the MFP of a multidrug transporter from Escherichia coli (10Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8938-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), as a structural and functional paradigm for the elucidation of the properties of a number of IMP-MFP-OMP transport systems and to address the central question of the role of the MFP in drug translocation. The EmrAB transporter is composed of EmrB, a putative 14-helix multidrug H+antiporter belonging to the major facilitator (MF) superfamily (11Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the MFP EmrA. EmrA is predicted to have a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a large periplasmic domain. The EmrAB proteins are thought to provide a continuous pathway across the bacterial membranes by operating in conjunction with TolC (1Borges-Walmsley M.I. Walmsley A.R. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Underscoring the medical importance of this system, homologues of EmrA and B have been found in human pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae (12Colmer J.A. Fralick J.A. Hamood A.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar),Neisseria gonorrhoeae (13Lee E.H. Shafer W.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Strenotrophomonas maltophilia (14Alonso A. Martinez J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and Campylobacter jejuni (15Lin J. Michel L.O. Zhang Q. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2124-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Also the genome sequences of Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Bordatella pertussis, Rickettsia prowazeki, and Yersinia pestis indicate that they possess related systems. The pGEM-Teasy (Promega) plasmids bearing the emrA inserts were propagated in NovaBlue E. coli cells (Novagen). The pET21 (Novagen) plasmid constructs bearing emrA inserts were propagated inE. coli strain C41, a derivative of BL21 (16Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), and that bearing the hmrA insert was propagated in BL21* (Invitrogen). A ΔacrA strain of E. coli, termed N43 (17Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed with E. coli emrAB, ΔNTemrAemrB (i.e. the construct expressed EmrA-(49–390)), and H. influenzae hmrAB pUC constructs and used for MIC measurements. Chromosomal DNA from E. coli strain DH5α was used as target DNA for amplification of emrA by PCR using the forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGATCCAGCGCAAATGCGGAGACTCA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGGCCAGCGTTAGCTTTTACGAT-3′, respectively. We incorporated BamHI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined) into these primers to allow fragment ligation into pET21a to produce construct pET-EmrA-(1–390). Four truncated fragments of EmrA were generated by PCR, emrA-(15–390),emrA-(29–390), and emrA-(49–390), with the forward primers 5′-GGATCCAAGAGCGGCAAACGTAAG-3′, 5′-GGATCCC TCTTTATAATTATTGCCGT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCGAAGAAACCGATGACGCATACG-3′, respectively, in combination with the reverse primer used to cloneemrA-(1–390), whereas emrA-(1–56) was generated with the forward primer used to clone emrA-(1–390) and the reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGCGTATGCGTCATCGGTTTCTTC-3′. In each caseBamHI-XhoI restriction fragments were prepared and ligated into pET21a to produce constructs pET-EmrA-(15–390), pET-EmrA-(29–390), pET-EmrA-(49–390), and pET-EmrA-(1–56). Each pET construct was sequenced to ensure its integrity and that it was in-frame with the T7 and His6 tags. The pET constructs were used to transform E. coli strain C41, providing expression of the His6-tagged proteins. A single colony of C41/pET-EmrA was used to inoculate 5 ml of tryptone-yeast extract/50 μg ml−1 carbenicillin (CB), grown to saturation at 37 °C, and used to inoculate 0.5 liters of tryptone-yeast extract/50 μg ml−1 CB. Growth was continued at 37 °C until reaching anA600 of 0.4–0.5, at which point 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/50 μg ml−1 CB was added, and the growth continued overnight at a reduced temperature of 23 °C. For most preparations 3 liters of cells (e.g. 6 × 0.5 liters) were cultivated. Cells were harvested at 8670 × g and washed with TNG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The cell pellet from each 0.5-liter culture was resuspended in 20 ml of TNG buffer, giving 100 ml for a 3-liter culture, to which was added 0.5 ml 10 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 0.1 ml 10 mg ml−1 DNase, and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet (complete, EDTA-freeTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were disrupted by passage through a cell disrupter (model Z-plus 1.1 kilowatts, Constant Systems) operated at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and cell debris were cleared from the supernatant at 39,000 × g (20 min, 4 °C), which was then spun at 194,000 × g (1.5 h, 4 °C), separating the soluble protein from the cell membrane pellet. EmrA-(49–390) was isolated from the supernatant, EmrA-(1–56), EmrA-(15–390), and EmrA-(1–390) from the membranes, and EmrA-(29–390) from both the membrane and soluble fractions. For purification of EmrA-(49–390), 6 ml of suspended Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was added to one-quarter of the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. A 1.5-cm-diameter Econo-columnTM (BioRad) was packed with the Ni2+-NTA-agarose to a final column volume of about 3 ml and washed successively with 10, 2.5, and 0.5 volumes of TNG buffer containing 10, 25, and 50 mm imidazole, respectively, before elution of the protein under gravity with 400 mmimidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mmKCl (TK). Generally, 5 ml of protein at 15–20 mg ml−1 was eluted from the column, and then a further 5 ml of protein at 5 mg ml−1 was eluted, thus giving a yield of about 400 mg of protein from a 3-liter culture. The protein was dialyzed against TK to remove the imidazole. EmrA-(29–390) was obtained from the soluble fraction in an identical manner. For EmrA-(1–390), EmrA-(1–56), EmrA-(15–390), and EmrA-(29–390) (membrane fraction) purifications, each membrane pellet was solubilized by the addition of 1 volume of 1.5% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in TKG buffer (TK plus 10% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 1 h, after which time 9 volumes of TKG was added to reduce the dodecyl-β-d-maltoside concentration to 0.15%, and solubilized proteins were separated from the membrane debris at 194,000 × g. To 100 ml of supernatant, 4 ml of suspended Ni2+-NTA-agarose/1 protease inhibitor tablet was added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. A 1-cm-diameter Econo-column was packed with the Ni2+-NTA-agarose to a final volume of about 2 ml and washed successively with 10, 2.5, and 2 volumes of TKGN (TKG plus 0.2%n-nonyl-β-d-maltoside) containing 10, 25, and 50 mm imidazole, respectively. 400 mmimidazole/TKGN was used to elute the protein under gravity, with the protein usually occurring in the second and third 1-ml aliquot at a concentration of 0.5–1 mg ml−1. The protein was dialyzed against TKGN to remove the imidazole. Each pET-EmrA construct was tested for expression in the cytoplasm, inner membrane, and periplasm by purification. Proteins were released from the periplasm by cold osmotic shock of the cells (18Hunt A.G. Hong J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and the protein extract was treated according to the procedure adopted for the purification of soluble EmrA proteins but maintaining the proteins in glycerol-containing buffers. Proteins were quickly frozen and stored at −80 °C. H. influenzaeRd, KW20, genomic DNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and used to PCR clone the periplasmic domain of HmrA, the H. influenzaehomologue of EmrA, with the primers 5′-CACCATGTTTGAAGAAACAGAAGATGCTTATGTGG-3′ and 5′-ATGGCTGTTTTGCTGAATGATAGATTC-3′. The resulting product was cloned into the pET101/d-TOPO (Invitrogen) expression vector giving the pHmrA-6H plasmid, which was used to transform E. coli TOP10 cells, for overexpression of HmrA-(48–390). Automated DNA sequencing of the plasmid confirmed the sequence and translation frame as correct. pHmrA-6H was used to transform E. coliBL21* (Invitrogen), which was used for all subsequent protein production. BL21*/pHmrA-6H cells were grown at 37 °C in a 10-ml LB starter culture containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin from a single colony picked from a fresh agar plate. When the cells were just visible, 1 ml of starter culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB containing 100 μg/ml CB, which was grown to an A600 of 0.4 at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C and then chilled on ice for 1 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mmHEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, and disrupted with a Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation and frozen in five 25-ml aliquots at −80 °C. HmrA-(48–390) was purified according to the same protocol adopted for EmrA-(49–390). The emrA and emrB genes were amplified by PCR using the forward and reverse primers 5′-GAATTCGAGCGCAAATGCGGAGACTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGCTTAGTGCGCACCTCCGCC-3′, respectively, to introduceEcoRI and HindIII sites (underlined) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified DNA, which was purified and ligated into pGEMT-Easy (Promega). The emrAB genes were rescued from pGEM-Teasy by restriction digest with EcoRI and HindIII, ligated intoEcoRI/HindIII-digested pUC to create pUC-EmrAB, and transformed into E. coli strain N43. Similarly, the pUC-EmrA-(49–390)B construct was made using the forward primer 5′-GAATTCGAAGAAACCGATGACGCATACG-3′, so that the expressed EmrA lacked the first 48 amino acids. The constructs were checked by automated DNA sequencing. The hmrA and hmrB genes were amplified by PCR using the forward and reverse primers 5′-GAATTCTGACGCAAATTGCAACT-3′ and 5′-GAAGCTTAATGCTGAGTACC AAA-3′, respectively. The PCR product was purified and ligated into pGEM-Teasy (Promega). The hmrAB genes were rescued from pGEM-Teasy by restriction digest with EcoRI, ligated intoEcoRI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pUC to create pUC-HmrAB, and transformed into E. coli (NovoBlue, Invitrogen). Automated DNA sequencing was used to identify a plasmid in which the hmrAB genes were correctly orientated, which was then used to transform strain N43. MICs were measured according to the microdilution broth method established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (19National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically.10. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Villanova, PA1990Google Scholar). Briefly, a single colony was picked from an LB/ampicillin plate, used to inoculate 20 ml LB/ampicillin medium, and grown to an A600 of 0.1. Cells were transferred to a microtiter plate and mixed with serial dilutions of the drug to be tested. Bacterial growth was monitored after an 18-h incubation at 37 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay using a kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% or 12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (NuPAGE gels and MES or MOPS buffer; Novex) and stained with Coomassie Gelcode BlueTM (Pierce). Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were mixed with the loading buffer at room temperature to avoid any potential problems due to protein aggregation, which can occur when samples are boiled. Native PAGE (7.5% (BioRad) polyacrylamide gels and Tris-glycine buffer (pH 7.5) run for 16 h at 50 v) was also used to separate proteins. EmrA proteins were subjected to gel chromatography on a Superdex 200 column run on an AKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences) automated chromatography system. EmrA-(1–390) (1.3 mg ml−1 in TKGN) and EmrA-(49–390) (3.0 mg ml−1 in TKG) were applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with PNGL buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml min−1. It was necessary to utilize PNGL as the equilibration buffer because the separation of the monomers and dimers of EmrA was inefficient when TKGN was used as the equilibration buffer, which however is better for storage of EmrA. Although the retention time for the EmrA-(49–390) monomer appeared to be less than for the EmrA-(1–390) dimer and monomer, possibly because the proteins adopt different conformations, the column resolution would be relatively poor in this range (e.g. between 45 and 90 kDa), and consequently there would be difficulties in comparing the elution profiles from different runs. Accordingly, we did not try to estimate the molecular masses of the proteins from the retention times. Moreover, the proteins are likely to elute as protein-detergent micelles with a greater molecular mass than the protein. EmrA-(1–390) monomers and dimers were separated by gel chromatography on a Superdex 200 column, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and either immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibodies (Sigma) or N-terminal sequenced (Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham, UK). The predicted amino acid sequence of the EmrA-(2–390)-(His)6 fusion protein (i.e. termed EmrA-(1–390)) was MASMTGGQQMGRDP-EmrA-(2–390)-LEHHHHHH, with residues 2–12 constituting an immunogenic T7 tag. N-terminal sequencing of the EmrA-(1–390) gave the first 11 and 10 residues of the T7 tag for the monomer and dimer, respectively. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J600 spectrometer at 20 °C using protein samples dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaF. The percentage of secondary structure was predicted from the CD spectra using the program SELCON (20Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made in a Jasco FP750 fluorimeter at 20 °C. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 292.5 nm, and the emission wavelength was scanned between 300 and 400 nm. For titrations of EmrA-(49–390), KI was added from a 5 m stock solution to 2 ml of 1.25 μm protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm NaCl. For KI titrations in the presence of drugs, the drug concentration was set to the maximum possible (e.g. 39 μm FCCP, 48 μm CCCP, 19 μm DNP, 20 μm nalidixic acid, and 53 μm chloramphenicol) that would not reduce the protein fluorescence by more than 50% because of its inner filter effect. In the case of nalidixic acid, the pH of the protein solutions was tested to ensure that the small volume of acid added had not perturbed the pH. The protein fluorescence and KI concentration were corrected for the dilution effect. HmrA-(48–390) was routinely used at a concentration of 6 μm because this gave a fluorescence equivalent to 1.25 μm EmrA-(49–390), but using the proteins at equivalent concentrations did not affect the titration curves. The FCCP titration curve for EmrA was fitted to an equation with hyperbolic and linear functions by nonlinear regression using the program SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific): y = A − [(B × [FCCP]/Kd + [FCCP]) + (C × [FCCP])], where A is the value ofF0/F in the absence of FCCP,B is the total decrease in the value ofF0/F for concentrations of FCCP that tend toward saturating the hyperbolic component attributed to specific binding, Kd is the dissociation constant for the specific EmrA-(49–390)-FCCP complex, and C is the slope of the linear component attributed to nonspecific binding. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium measurements were made with an Optima XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Sedimentation was performed at 45,000 rpm in double sector cells at 20 °C, and the data were analyzed using DCDT+ software, version 1.12 (21Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We measured the value of s for different protein concentrations in the range of 0.5–1 mg/ml in 40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 400 mm KCl and extrapolated the data to zero protein concentration. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 15,000, 18,000 and 20,000 rpm at 20 °C, and the data were analyzed using the manufacturer's software (Microcal Origin, version 4.1). The partial specific volume, ṽ, was calculated as 0.736 ml/g from the amino acid sequence of EmrA-(49–390) using SEDNTERP software (22Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar); this value was used in all calculations. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on a Dynapro 801 (Protein Solutions Inc.) instrument at 20 °C. Samples were injected at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. Data analysis was performed using the manufacturer's software. Residues 23–46 of EmrA were predicted, using the program TMHMM (23Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar), to form an α-helix that anchors the protein in the periplasm of E. coli. However, this prediction for EmrA, or for any other MFP, has not been tested experimentally. To map the domains of EmrA, a number ofemrA constructs were made in pET to overexpress the whole and truncated portions of EmrA (Fig. 1) with a His tag to aid in purification (Fig.2A). To determine the location of each protein, we attempted their purification from the periplasm milieu, obtained by osmotic shock of the cells, from the cytoplasmic milieu, obtained as the soluble fraction after cell disruption, and from inner membranes, prepared by detergent solubilization of membranes from disrupted cells. The EmrA-(1–390), EmrA-(15–390), and EmrA-(1–59) proteins were purified from cytoplasmic membranes, whereas EmrA-(49–390) was purified as a soluble protein from the cytoplasm. In contrast, EmrA-(29–390) was obtained from both membranes (about two-thirds of the total protein) and the cytoplasm (about one-third of the total protein). None of the proteins"

We propose that truncated spalt can exert a dominant negative effect and is able to interfere with the correct function of full-length protein, by causing its displacement from the nucleus. This could affect the transcriptional repressor activity of spalt and DNA binding. Spalt protein truncations could also affect the function of other spalt family members in various tissues.

This work focuses on the functional analysis of two chick homologs of the spalt family, csal1 andcsal3. 1The second chick homolog, which we previously named csal2, will now be called csal3 because it is most closely related to human Hsall3 (3Kohlhase J.

Spalt proteins are important in a number of developmental processes, cell fate decisions, and organogenesis. Spalt(sal) was first isolated in Drosophila and encodes a protein characterized by multiple double zinc finger motifs of the C2H2 type, commonly found in transcription factors (8Kühnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Weber A. Wagner-Bernholz J.F. Gehring W.J. Jäckle H. Schuh R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 168-179Google Scholar). Expression of sal is found in various tissues in Drosophila embryos and larvae (8Kühnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Weber A. Wagner-Bernholz J.F. Gehring W.J. Jäckle H. Schuh R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 168-179Google Scholar). Early in development sal acts as a region-specific homeotic gene and is required for the specification of head and tail regions (9Jürgens G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 189-196Google Scholar). At later stages sal regulates pattern formation and cell fate decisions in the wing disc, the trachea, and in sensory organs of the peripheral nervous system (10Sturtevant M.A. Biehs B. Marin E.

Anat. 2001; 199: 25-33Google Scholar). In addition it was shown recently that sal is regulated by the homeobox geneultrabithorax (ubx), which can directly repress multiple cis-elements in the sal promoter (15Galant R. Walsh C.M. Carroll S.B. Development. 2002; 129: 3115-3126Google Scholar). Vertebrate sal homologs have been identified in mouse,Xenopus, and Medaka (1Ott T. Kaestner K.H. Monaghan A.P. Schütz G. Mech.

In human, three homologs ofsal have been isolated (3Kohlhase J. Hausmann S. Stojmenovic G. Dixkens C. Bink K. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Altmann M. Engel W.

Mutations in one of these genes, termed Hsall1 or SALL1, which result in a premature truncation and loss of the C2H2 zinc finger motifs, cause Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS), 2The abbreviations used are: TBS, Townes-Brocks syndrome; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAL4DBD, GAL4 DNA binding domain; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HH, Hamburger and Hamilton; HSV, herpes simplex virus; TK, thymidine kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate 2The abbreviations used are: TBS, Townes-Brocks syndrome; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAL4DBD, GAL4 DNA binding domain; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HH, Hamburger and Hamilton; HSV, herpes simplex virus; TK, thymidine kinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate an autosomal dominant disorder. TBS is characterized by anorectal, ear, and hand malformations, in particular preaxial polydactyly (2Kohlhase J. Wischermann A. Reichenbach H. Froster U. Engel W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 81-83Google Scholar, 20Engels S. Kohlhase J. McGaughran J. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 458-460Google Scholar). These observations show that vertebrate sal homologs play important roles in the development of a number of organ systems. In addition, mice deficient in msall1, a homolog ofHsall1, die perinatally from severe kidney failure caused by incomplete ureteric bud outgrowth. However, neither heterozygous nor homozygous mice mimic the TBS phenotype, and it was suggested thatmsall1 deficiency may be compensated for bymsall2 and/or msall3 in mice. Alternatively, the mutant Townes-Brocks protein may exert a dominant negative effect and eliminate the function of all spalt proteins in humans (21Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S. Lacey D.L. Katsuki M. Asashima M. Yokota T. Development. 2001; 128: 3105-3115Google Scholar). The structure of spalt proteins suggested that they may act as transcriptional regulators. This was supported by the finding that a highly related Drosophila protein spalt-related (salr), can bind to DNA in vitro (22Barrio R. Shea M.J. Carulli J. Lipkow K. Gaul U. Frommer G. Schuh R. Jäckle H. Kafatos F.C. Dev. Genes Evol. 1996; 206: 315-325Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that fusion proteins of mouse sall1 and human SALL1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain suppress transcription of a GAL4 reporter plasmid. This repression required the amino-terminal single zinc finger, which, in case of msall1, can bind to histone deacetylase (23Netzer C. Rieger L. Brero A. Zhang C.D. Hinzke M. Kohlhase J. Bohlander S.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3017-3024Google Scholar, 24Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Google Scholar). We have used in vitro biochemical approaches to elucidate further the molecular function of spalt proteins. We demonstrate here that chick spalt proteins, csal1 and csal3, repress transcription from a reporter plasmid. The proteins physically interact with each other in cultured cells, and the conserved glutamine-rich region located within the amino-terminal third of spalt proteins is necessary for this interaction. We also demonstrate that “TBS-like” truncated chick proteins can still interact with wild-type protein and with each other. We show that truncated csal1 protein is localized to the cytoplasm of cells, whereas the full-length protein is exclusively nuclear. In addition, in the presence of truncated spalt proteins, nuclear localization of csal1 is abrogated. Together these findings provide new evidence for the molecular mechanism underlying TBS. Digoxigenin-UTP-csal1 and FITC-UTP-csal3 antisense RNA probes were generated, and in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (4Farrell E.R. Münsterberg A.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 447-458Google Scholar, 6Farrell E.R. Tosh G. Church E. Münsterberg A.E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 227-230Google Scholar). Probes were detected separately, and anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Roche) at 350 μg/ml. Embryos were then washed extensively, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, heat treated at 65 °C, and anti-FITC antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche) was detected with Magenta Phos (Sigma) at 175 μg/ml. To generate an in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain the open reading frames of csal1 was subcloned into p1012GAL4 using HindIII andXbaI, and csal3 was subcloned usingEcoRI and XhoI. The cloning vector, p1012GAL4 and the reporter plasmids, pG5TKCAT and pG0TKCAT, were a gift from Dr. Neil Perkins, University of Dundee (25Anderson L.A. Perkins N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29550-29554Google Scholar). To construct HA- and FLAG-tagged spalt proteins we performed PCR mutagenesis and replaced the internal stop codon with anXhoI site for cloning into pCMV1-HA or pCMV1-FLAG (26Wicks S.J. Lui S. Abdel-Wahab N. Mason R.M. Chantry A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8103-8111Google Scholar). Truncations and deletions were generated using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce internal XhoI sites by PCR into the tagged spalts. PCR products were digested withDpnI (Roche) and transformed into competent DH5αEscherichia coli using standard protocols. Plasmids were digested with XhoI and the vector religated to generate tagged truncations. HEK293 cells were transfected with 12.5 μg of the reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of the GAL4 fusion construct by calcium phosphate and CAT assays carried out as described (27Chen C.K. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar, 28Yang S.H. Bumpass D.C. Perkins N.D. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5036-5046Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extract of transfected cells was prepared in lysis buffer (0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8) by repeated freeze-thaw cycles, protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA for 20 min at 37 °C. Reaction products were separated on a silica TLC plate with 90% chloroform and 10% methanol; after drying the plates conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to [acetyl-14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. HEK293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of each plasmid (27Chen C.K. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). After 48 h protein was extracted with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal) in the presence of complete proteinase inhibitor (Roche) by incubating on ice for 20 min and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 447Google Scholar). Protein extracts were precleared with 15 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 20 min at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of either anti-HA.11 (Babco) or anti FLAG M2 (Sigma) and shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. After this, 30 μl of protein A-agarose was added and shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose pellet was washed four times in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and boiled in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer before SDS-PAGE separation and Western blotting. Western blots were performed with the same antibodies and detected with either a secondary anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson) or protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 5 μg of each plasmid by calcium phosphate (27Chen C.K. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). After 48 h cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and proteins were detected with primary antibodies, anti-HA.11 (Babco) or anti-FLAG polyclonal (Sigma), and anti mouse-FITC and anti rabbit-TRITC secondary antibodies (Jackson). Immunostaining was analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan2 and a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. We have shown previously that csal1 and csal3 are expressed during limb development (4Farrell E.R. Münsterberg A.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 447-458Google Scholar, 6Farrell E.R. Tosh G. Church E. Münsterberg A.E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 227-230Google Scholar). In the present study we have used double in situ hybridization to determine the extent to which csal1 and csal3 transcripts might be coexpressed. Both chick spalt genes were detected in developing wing and leg buds from Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) (30Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 195: 231-272Google Scholar) stages 23–25 (Fig. 1, A–D). At HH23, csal1 and csal3 transcripts were both expressed in the distal most region of limb buds with a slightly broader expression of csal1 (Fig. 1 A). Subsequently, csal3 expression became more highly restricted, and both transcripts overlapped in posterior limb bud mesenchyme (Fig. 1, B and C). At HH25,csal3 expression began to decrease, and faint purple staining was identified in a patch of mesenchyme cells (Fig.1 D, white line tracing). Transcripts of both genes were also detected in other areas of the embryo, in particular the developing neural tube and the tail bud (Fig. 1 C). This raises the possibility that csal1 and csal3 could interact functionally during development. It was demonstrated recently that fusion proteins of both human and mouse sall1 with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) can repress transcription from a GAL4 responsive reporter plasmid (23Netzer C. Rieger L. Brero A. Zhang C.D. Hinzke M. Kohlhase J. Bohlander S.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3017-3024Google Scholar,24Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Google Scholar). To assess whether chick spalt proteins can also function as transcriptional repressors, we performed similar experiments and fused the GAL4DBD to the amino-terminal end of chick csal1 and csal3. These plasmid constructs were cotransfected into HEK293 cells along with a reporter construct, G5TKCAT, which contains five GAL4 binding sites in front of the HSVTK promoter driving CAT gene expression (25Anderson L.A. Perkins N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29550-29554Google Scholar). CAT activity was quantitated and compared with the CAT activity obtained with the plasmid vector containing only the GAL4DBD, which was set to be 100%. This showed that, similar to human and mouse sall1, csal1-GAL4DBD and csal3-GAL4DBD fusion proteins can repress transcription, 4-fold and 6.5-fold, respectively (Fig.2, left two columns). To test whether transcriptional repression depends on DNA binding we cotransfected GAL4 spalt fusion proteins with a reporter plasmid lacking GAL4 binding sites (G0TKCAT; Fig. 2, right two columns). In this situation we observed an ∼2-fold reduction in transcription activity. We next wanted to investigate whether csal1 and csal3 can interact to form higher order structures. We generated HA- and FLAG-tagged versions of both chick spalt proteins (Fig. 3). HEK293 cells were cotransfected with these constructs, and immunoprecipitations were performed using protein extracts followed by Western blot analysis. As a control, protein extracts from cells transfected with either csal1-HA or csal3-FLAG were immunoprecipitated with both anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. In neither case did we observe nonspecific cross-reactivity, and protein was detected on a Western blot only after immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and6). We found that immunoprecipitation of csal1-FLAG with an anti-FLAG antibody resulted in coprecipitation of csal1-HA-tagged protein, demonstrating a physical interaction between multiple csal1 proteins (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of csal3-FLAG with an anti-FLAG antibody resulted in coprecipitation of csal3-HA-tagged protein, suggesting that csal3 forms homo-oligomers (Fig. 4 C, lane 6). Becausecsal1 and csal3 are coexpressed in limb development we next examined whether they could interact with each other. Using protein extracts of cells transfected with csal1-HA and csal3-FLAG expression constructs we could detect csal1-HA protein after immunoprecipitation of csal3-FLAG, demonstrating that csal1 and csal3 can interact in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4 D, lane 6).Figure 4Chick spalt proteins interact in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing tagged forms of csal1 and csal3 as indicated by (+) above eachlane in each panel.

Initially we produced HA-tagged versions of csal1 containing amino acids 1–806 and 1–290. Both of these truncations retain the amino-terminal single zinc finger and the glutamine-rich region but lack some or all of the C2H2 double zinc finger motifs. Mutations in Hsall1 which cause TBS result in the loss of all C2H2 double zinc finger motifs (2Kohlhase J. Wischermann A. Reichenbach H. Froster U. Engel W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 81-83Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–806-HA with an anti-HA antibody resulted in coprecipitation of full-length csal1-FLAG (Fig.5 A, lane 6), and immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–290-HA with an anti-HA antibody resulted in coprecipitation of full-length csal1-FLAG, demonstrating that the first 290 amino acids are sufficient to mediate interactions with full-length csal1 (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of csal3-HA with an anti-HA antibody resulted in coprecipitation of the truncated csal3-1–282-FLAG protein, indicating that amino acids 1–282 of csal3 are sufficient to interact with full-length csal3 (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). Next we investigated whether csal1-1–290 and csal3-1–282 can interact with each other. We found that immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–290-HA resulted in coprecipitation of csal1-1–290-FLAG and csal3-1–282, respectively (Fig. 5 C, lanes 5 and 6). Together these experiments demonstrate that TBS-like amino-terminal truncations of csal1 and csal3 are sufficient to mediate interactions with full-length proteins and with each other. We generated further deletions of both csal1 and csal3 to identify the domain within the amino terminus which mediates physical interactions between chick spalt proteins. HA-tagged csal1 truncations were generated, encompassing amino acids 1–65, 1–218, 1–240, and FLAG-tagged csal3 truncations were generated encompassing amino acids 1–85, 1–230, and 1–252. As depicted in the schematic representation csal1-1–65 and csal3-1–85 contain only the amino-terminal single zinc finger motif, csal1-1–218 and csal3-1–230 contain in addition the intervening region up to the glutamine-rich domain, and csal1-1–240 and csal3-1–252 terminate immediately after the glutamine-rich domain. We also generated a FLAG-tagged csal3 construct with an internal deletion of the glutamine-rich domain, termed csal3-ΔQ-FLAG (Fig.3 B). Immunoprecipitations followed by Western blot analysis demonstrated that only csal1-1–240 and csal3-1–252 proteins were able to interact with csal1 and csal3 proteins. Immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–240-HA resulted in coprecipitation of csal1-1–290-FLAG (Fig.6 A, lane 6). In contrast, immunoprecipitation of either csal1-1–218-HA or csal1-1–65-HA did not result in coprecipitation of csal1-1–290-FLAG (Fig. 6 A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–240-HA resulted in coprecipitation of csal3-1–282-FLAG (Fig. 6 B,lane 6). As expected, immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–218-HA and csal1-1–65-HA did not result in coprecipitation of csal3-1–282-FLAG (Fig. 6 B, lanes 7 and8). In similar experiments we found that only csal3-1–252 was able to interact with other spalt proteins (Fig. 6, Cand D). Immunoprecipitation of csal3-HA resulted in coprecipitation of csal3-1–252-FLAG (Fig. 6 C, lane 6). In contrast, immunoprecipitation of csal3-HA did not result in coprecipitation of either csal3-1–230-FLAG or csal3-1–85-FLAG (Fig.6 C, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). The bands migrating at a slightly higher molecular mass to csal3-1–252 observed in Fig. 6, C and D, lanes 5–12, are caused by detection of IgG light chains with protein A and are also seen in mock transfected controls (Fig. 6, Cand D, lanes 5 and 9). Immunoprecipitation of csal1-1–290-HA resulted in coprecipitation of csal3-1–252-FLAG (Fig. 6 D, lane 6) but not csal3-1–230-FLAG or csal3-1–85-FLAG (Fig. 6 D, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). Finally, immunoprecipitation of csal1-HA does not result in coprecipitation of csal3 protein, which lacks the 22 amino acids encompassing the glutamine-rich region (csal3-ΔQ-FLAG, Fig. 6 E, lane 6). These experiments show that the conserved glutamine-rich domain in csal1 and csal3 is necessary for interaction with other spalt proteins. We examined the subcellular localization of the two spalt proteins in COS-7 cells, transfected with tagged versions of both chick spalt proteins. Using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies and fluorescence microscopy, we detected csal1-HA exclusively in the nucleus (Fig.7, A, C, andD), whereas csal3-FLAG was found exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, F–H). Confocal microscopy confirmed that csal3-FLAG was excluded from the nucleus (data not shown). Interestingly, when csal1-HA and csal3-FLAG were cotransfected we observed a clear change in the subcellular localization of csal1-HA. In the presence of csal3, csal1 was detected in the cytoplasm colocalizing with csal3-FLAG (Fig. 7, I, J, and L). In the absence of csal3, we have been unable to detect cytoplasmic expression of csal1, indicating that subcellular localization of csal1 is altered by csal3. This suggests that csal3 may change the function of csal1 in regions of the embryo where both spalt proteins are expressed. We coexpressed full-length csal1-HA with csal1-1–290-FLAG to determine what effect this might have on protein distribution. In contrast to full-length csal1, truncated csal1 protein (csal1-1–290) was no longer restricted to the nucleus but instead could be detected throughout the cell (Fig. 7 , M–P). When this truncated form of csal1 was cotransfected with full-length csal1 protein we detected full-length csal1 in the cytoplasm with apparently increased levels immediately around the nucleus (Fig. 7,Q–T, compare Q and A). In contrast, the csal1 truncation that lacks the glutamine-rich region (csal1-1–218) was no longer able to relocalize full-length csal1 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, U–X, compare U, Q, and A). These experiments indicate that TBS-like amino-terminal truncations of spalt proteins alter the normal localization of full-length csal1, and this effect is mediated by the glutamine-rich region. To confirm that the glutamine-rich region is required for relocalization, we cotransfected csal1-HA and csal3-ΔQ-FLAG. Expression of csal3-ΔQ-FLAG was observed throughout the cell, including expression in the nucleus. However, expression of csal3-ΔQ-FLAG did not result in a change of csal1-HA localization, which remained exclusively nuclear (Fig. 7,Y–B′, compare B′ and L). The experiments presented here demonstrate for the first time that spalt proteins can interact with each other. The conserved glutamine-rich domain is necessary to mediate protein interactions of csal1 and csal3, two chick spalt family members. Furthermore, we determined the subcellular distribution of tagged csal1 and csal3 proteins and found that the localization of full-length csal1 is altered in the presence of csal3 or truncated forms of csal1. Relocalization required the presence of the conserved glutamine-rich region. We discuss our findings and their implications for spalt function during normal embryogenesis and in TBS. The structure of spalt proteins, in particular the presence of multiple zinc finger motifs of the C2H2 type, suggests a role as a transcription factor. This is supported by the finding thatDrosophila spalt-related protein can bind DNA and by the recent evidence demonstrating the ability of human and mouse sall1 to repress transcription from a heterologous reporter (23Netzer C. Rieger L. Brero A. Zhang C.D. Hinzke M. Kohlhase J. Bohlander S.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3017-3024Google Scholar, 24Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Google Scholar). Transcriptional repressor activity of msall1 is mediated by the amino-terminal zinc finger, which was shown to recruit histone deacetylase (24Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Google Scholar). This is in contrast to human sall1, where transcriptional repression was observed with GAL4DBD fusions, but this was independent of histone deacetylase (23Netzer C. Rieger L. Brero A. Zhang C.D. Hinzke M. Kohlhase J. Bohlander S.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3017-3024Google Scholar). The amino-terminal zinc finger domain is highly conserved in all vertebrate members of the spalt family described so far, suggesting that transcriptional repression may be a common property of different spalts from different species. Consistent with this, we found that both csal1 and csal3 repress transcription. However, our results suggest that only part of the sal-mediated transcriptional repression activity depends on direct binding to the active promoter. In addition, there may be a contribution that is independent of DNA binding. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon need further investigation, ideally in the context of a native target promoter of sal proteins, which has yet to be identified. We found that csal3 is expressed in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells. This seems to rule out a role as a transcriptional repressor in vivo. However, it is conceivable that stimulation of cells with an appropriate growth factor could cause translocation of csal3 into the nucleus where it could act on DNA. Alternatively, the role of csal3 could be to act as a negative regulator of csal1 function. In cells coexpressing both csal1 and csal3 we observed that csal1 is cytoplasmic and the removal of csal1 from the nucleus could provide a mechanism for abrogating its functions. These explanations are not exclusive, and csal3 could regulate csal1 by its effect on subcellular localization and also have a role as a transcriptional repressor in its own right. The glutamine-rich region is highly conserved in all invertebrate and vertebrate spalt family members isolated so far, but its function has never previously been characterized. Our experiments demonstrate that this domain is required for interaction of csal1 and csal3 with themselves and with other spalt proteins. The glutamine-rich region is sufficient to mediate spalt interactions, when present within the amino terminus. Furthermore, in the absence of this domain, we do not observe any interactions between the spalts, demonstrating that this domain is necessary. It is unclear at present whether glutamine-rich motifs of two spalt molecules bind directly to each other or to another motif within the amino terminus or whether they mediate binding to an unrelated protein, which will then in turn interact with another spalt molecule. We showed previously that the onset of csal1 expression at HH17 in wing and leg bud precedes that of csal3. During subsequent stages of limb bud outgrowth up to HH25, csal1 expression is restricted to the distal third of wing and leg bud and the apical ectodermal ridge. After HH26, csal1 expression was no longer detected in limb buds. In contrast, csal3 is only transiently expressed in HH18 wing buds, expression can be detected again from HH23–HH26 in a region of posterior mesenchyme (4Farrell E.R. Münsterberg A.E. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 447-458Google Scholar, 6Farrell E.R. Tosh G. Church E. Münsterberg A.E. Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 227-230Google Scholar). Here we showed csal1 andcsal3 transcripts overlap in a distinct region of the developing limb buds (Fig. 1), and full-length csal1 and csal3 proteins interact in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4 D). These observations raise the distinct possibility that csal proteins may also form homo- and heterodimers in vivo and interact functionally during embryogenesis to pattern the developing limb. We showed here that csal1 and csal3 show a distinct subcellular distribution with csal1 being mainly nuclear and csal3 mostly found in the cytoplasm. Although this localization to separate compartments of the cell seems to preclude a physical interaction in vivo we found that the distribution of csal1 changes in presence of csal3 (Fig.7). Thus it is interesting to speculate that in embryonic development csal3 protein may act as a modifier of csal1 by altering csal1 localization and consequently affecting its function in the nucleus. Both chick spalt genes are coexpressed in a subset of limb mesenchyme cells, and limb development is affected in patients with TBS. Expression of a truncated Hsall1 protein in the human congenital syndrome TBS has indicated an important role for spalt in normal development. To date it is unclear whether the complex phenotype in TBS is caused by haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect of the truncated protein. Interestingly, mouse embryos with homozygous deletions of csal1 have apparently normal limbs and show no sign of the polydactyly and other phenotypes that are typically seen in TBS patients. Instead they display a severe kidney phenotpye. The heterozygous mice appear normal (21Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S. Lacey D.L. Katsuki M. Asashima M. Yokota T. Development. 2001; 128: 3105-3115Google Scholar), and this finding argues against haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism. Instead, the TBS gene product may act in a dominant negative manner. In this scenario, it would not be surprising that complete loss of msall1 function does not mimic the TBS phenotype because other members of the family may be able to compensate. There is growing evidence that the Townes-Brocks protein retains important functional domains (23, 24, and this report), and this is more consistent with the possibility that the TBS phenotype is caused by dominant negative interference with the normal function of other proteins. The truncated Hsall1 proteins expressed in TBS patients are equivalent to csal1-1–290 and csal3-1–298. All proteins include the most amino-terminal single zinc finger as well as the glutamine-rich region, whereas they have lost all other zinc finger motifs (2, Fig.3). Our experiments show that csal1-1–290 and csal3-1–298 can still interact with full-length and truncated forms of csal1 and csal3 in coprecipitation assays (Figs. 5 and 6). In addition, both truncations localize to the cytoplasm and affect the nuclear localization of full-length csal1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 7). Thus our experiments strongly suggest that the mutant Hsall1 proteins expressed in TBS patients may retain the ability to interact with other members of the spalt family. Therefore, the phenotype may in part be the result of a functional interference of truncated Hsall1 protein with different spalt proteins in different tissues. There are other possible mechanisms by which a dominant negative effect might be created. As described in this paper, truncated csal1 has the ability to relocate full-length csal1. Second, truncated spalt may sequester corepressors, such as histone deacetylase, or it may form inactive complexes unable to bind DNA. All of these could have a role in TBS, and further work is required to establish which of these mechanisms are operating.

Because hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, we sought to determine whether HSL could be involved. HSL mRNA and protein were detected in all segments of the small intestine by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Immunocytochemistry experiments revealed that HSL was expressed in the differentiated enterocytes of the villi and was absent in the undifferentiated cells of the crypt. Diacylglycerol lipase and cholesterol esterase activities were found in the different segments. Analysis of gut from HSL-null mice showed that diacylglycerol lipase activity was unchanged in the duodenum and reduced in jejunum. Neutral cholesterol esterase activity was totally abolished in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of HSL-null mice. Analysis of HSL mRNA structure showed two types of transcripts expressed in equal amounts with alternative 5′-ends transcribed from two exons. This work demonstrates that HSL is expressed in the mucosa of the small intestine. The results also reveal that the enzyme participates in acylglycerol hydrolysis in jejunal enterocytes and cholesteryl ester hydrolysis throughout the small intestine.

Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription is a multifunctional enzyme with broad substrate specificity (1Holm C. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.-A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Google Scholar). It hydrolyzes tri-, di-, and monoacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters. The activity against diacylglycerol is higher than the activity toward tri- and monoacylglycerols. The enzyme also exhibits cholesterol esterase activity, which is almost twice the activity toward triacylglycerols. Much has been learned in the recent years about the domain structure of HSL. Sequence comparisons revealed that HSL belongs to a family of esterases which is mainly represented by prokaryotic enzymes (2Langin D. Holm C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 466-467Google Scholar, 3Hemilä H. Koivula T.T. Palva I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 249-253Google Scholar). From a structural point of view, HSL is the most complex protein of the family. Sequence alignments together with biochemical experiments suggest that adipocyte HSL is composed of two structural domains (4Contreras J.-A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Google Scholar,5Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.-A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Google Scholar). The first 315 amino acids make up the N-terminal domain, which shows very little sequence similarities to other known proteins. The region responsible for the interaction with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) was mapped to this domain (6Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Google Scholar, 7Shen W.-J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Google Scholar). In adipose tissue, ALBP could increase the hydrolytic activity of HSL through its ability to bind and sequester fatty acids and through specific protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal domain is divided in two functional parts, a catalytic core and a regulatory module. The latter is composed of 150 amino acids, including all of the known phosphorylation sites of HSL. Unlike other known mammalian triacylglycerol lipases, the activity of HSL is regulated by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation sites of protein kinase A, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and AMP-dependent protein kinase have been mapped (8Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Google Scholar, 9Greenberg A.S. Shen W.J. Muliro K. Patel S. Souza S.C. Roth R.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45456-45461Google Scholar, 10Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Google Scholar). The catalytic core is the region that shows homology with the other members of the family. Modeling of the part revealed that it adopts an α/β-hydrolase fold that harbors the catalytic triad constituted by Ser423, Asp703, and His733 (4Contreras J.-A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Google Scholar,11Wei Y. Contreras J.-A. Sheffield P. Østerlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C. Derewenda S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 340-345Google Scholar).Several forms of HSL transcripts and the exon-intron organization of the HSL gene have been characterized in humans. The 88-kDa adipocyte HSL is translated from a 2.8-kb mRNA and encoded by 9 exons (12Langin D. Laurell H. Holst L.S. Belfrage P. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4897-4901Google Scholar,13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). The transcription start site was mapped in a short noncoding exon called exon B. In the adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, two mRNA species are found, the adipocyte HSL mRNA and a mRNA with a different 5′-end transcribed from exon A. Two testicular forms of HSL have been characterized. The 3.9-kb mRNA encodes a 120-kDa protein that contains a unique N-terminal region encoded by exon T1, a region that presumably forms a third structural domain in this isoform (14Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Google Scholar). The 3.3-kb mRNA encodes a protein that is identical to the adipocyte HSL form (15Mairal A. Melaine N. Laurell H. Grober J. Stenson Holst L. Guillaudeux T. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 286-290Google Scholar). However, the mRNA species differ in their 5′-ends. Exon usage is mutually exclusive, exon T2 being only transcribed in testis and exon B being transcribed in adipose tissue.The nature and role of lipases and esterases participating in the digestion of dietary lipids in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract are well established. In addition to the enzymes in the lumen, there is evidence of lipase activity in enterocytes (16Shen H. Howles P. Tso P. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 50: S103-S125Google Scholar). The presence of cholesterol esterase activity is more elusive. The exact identity of the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of intracellular acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters is still unclear. Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase, microsomal triacylglycerol hydrolase, and pancreatic cholesterol esterase have all been suggested to be responsible for the hydrolytic activities (17Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 389-399Google Scholar, 18Dolinsky V.W. Sipione S. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 162-172Google Scholar, 19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar). Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase may be synthesized by the small intestine and accounts for the alkaline lipase activity of the enterocytes (19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar). Microsomal triacylglycerol hydrolase could also be involved (18Dolinsky V.W. Sipione S. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 162-172Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that most of the lipase activity is cytosolic (20Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 483-489Google Scholar). Pancreatic cholesterol esterase, also called bile salt-stimulated lipase, is able to hydrolyze cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols. In the absence of bile salts, the contribution of this enzyme is presumably minor (21Holm C. Olivecrona G. Ottosson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 155: 97-119Google Scholar). Because HSL is a cytosolic enzyme with a wide range of hydrolytic activities, the purpose of the present paper was to determine whether HSL was expressed in the intestine and could contribute to the hydrolysis of intracellular lipids.DISCUSSIONHere we have found that HSL contributes to lipase activity and is the major cholesterol esterase in the intestinal mucosa. HSL mRNA and protein were readily detected along the small intestine. Immunohistochemistry data revealed that the enzyme is expressed preferentially in differentiated cells of the villi. Data from HSL-null mice showed that HSL does not account for a significant part of total esterase activity. However, the enzyme is responsible for all neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity both in the cytosolic and particulate fractions. It also contributes between one-third and one-half of diacylglycerol lipase activity in the jejunum.The size of intestinal HSL mRNA and protein corresponds to those of mouse adipocyte HSL, i.e. a 2.6–2.8-kb mRNA and an 82-kDa protein. The 5′-ends of the mRNA species are transcribed from two exons that correspond to human exons A and B. Exon A is located in the mouse gene ≈ 7 kb upstream of exon B (25Laurin N.N. Wang S.P. Mitchell G.A. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 972-978Google Scholar). Use of the two exons is mutually exclusive. Interestingly, we have shown previously that HSL is expressed in the human adenocarcinoma cell line of intestinal origin HT29 (26Remaury A. Laurell H. Grober J. Reynisdottir S. Dauzats M. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 175-182Google Scholar). The two mRNA 5′-ends were found in HT29 HSL mRNA (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). In human and mouse adipose tissue, the main transcription start site is located in exon B. Exon A-containing transcripts are found at very low levels in humans (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar) and are much less abundant than mRNA with exon B in mice ((25) and present work). To date, there is little information on the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of HSL. We have shown that the first 95 bp of human exon T1 5′-flanking region conferred expression of a reporter gene exclusively in testis of transgenic mice (27Blaise R. Guillaudeux T. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Evrard B. Mairal A. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5109-5115Google Scholar). Exon B 5′-flanking region contains an active promoter with an E-box and two GC-boxes as functional cis-acting elements (28Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Google Scholar). In adipocytes, the E-box mediates the glucose-mediated induction of HSL gene expression. However, the sequences responsible for the adipose tissue-specific expression of HSL are not present in this region because the pattern of promoter activity up to 2.4 kb was similar in adipocytes and in HeLa cells that do not express HSL (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). No data are yet available for the exon A 5′-flanking region. In the enterocytes, exons A and B are represented in equal amounts, suggesting that two alternative promoters control HSL gene expression providing the possibility of distinct transcriptional regulation.Lipid processing through the intestine is a complex pathway with multiple control steps. The intestine is unable to transport neutral lipids into the lymph at the rate with which they are absorbed, especially at high input rates. Nearly half of the triacylglycerol mass infused into rat intestine does not appear in the lymph (29Mansbach C.M. II Arnold A. Cox M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G642-G648Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the lipids are oxidized because β-oxidation of lipid entering the mucosa from the lumen is limited. There is no evidence that triacylglycerols are transported via the portal vein (30Sabesin S.M. Frase S. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 496-511Google Scholar). These studies suggest that some triacylglycerols in the enterocyte are undergoing hydrolysis. In support of this concept, a mucosal triacylglycerol pool distinct from the chylomicron triacylglycerol precursor pool has been characterized (31Tipton A.D. Frase S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G871-G878Google Scholar). Lipolysis of the mucosal pool has been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Both acidic and alkaline lipase activities have been described in the mucosa (20Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 483-489Google Scholar, 32Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 273-280Google Scholar). Because most of the lipolytic activity was found at neutral or basic pH, the physiological importance of the acidic lipase is unclear. Here, we confirm that significant neutral lipase activity is found in the enterocyte. This activity was inhibited by diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate as shown previously for mucosal lipolysis in triolein-infused rats (31Tipton A.D. Frase S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G871-G878Google Scholar). Lipase activity was found in the different parts of the small intestine. Data from HSL-null mice show that HSL contributes to lipase activity in the distal section but not in the first part of the small intestine. Recently, Mansbach and colleagues (19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar) showed that pancreatic lipase was expressed in the intestine with most of the enzyme detected in the first quarter (19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar). Altogether, the data suggest that the hydrolysis of mucosal triacylglycerols is caused by pancreatic lipase in the proximal part of the small intestine and HSL in the more distal parts.The nature of the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in the intestine has remained unclear. Pancreatic cholesterol esterase (bile salt-stimulated lipase) is internalized upon binding to the surface of enterocytes (33Bruneau N. Lombardo D. Bendayan M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2665-2679Google Scholar). The esterase could hydrolyze intracellular cholesteryl esters or conversely participate, at acid pH, in the esterification of cholesterol (17Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 389-399Google Scholar, 34Ponz de Leon M. Carrubi F. Di Donato P. Carulli N. Digest. Dis. Sci. 1985; 30: 1053-1064Google Scholar). However, the intracellular esterase activity in the absence of cofactors such as bile salts may be very low. Contribution to cholesterol esterification is also unlikely because studies on knockout mice revealed that the enzyme is responsible for mediating intestinal absorption of cholesteryl esters but does not influence free cholesterol absorption (35Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Google Scholar). In contrast, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (36Buhman K.K. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Turley S. Farese R.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1341-1347Google Scholar). Localization of pancreatic cholesterol esterase in intestinal epithelium may therefore not be related to intracellular metabolism. There is evidence that the enzyme, via an apical-to-basolateral transcytotic pathway, is released at the basolateral membrane level and may contribute to serum pancreatic cholesterol esterase activity (37Bruneau N. Nganga A. Bendayan M. Lombardo D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 94-108Google Scholar). Our data reveal that HSL and not pancreatic cholesterol esterase accounts for neutral cholesterol esterase activity in the small intestine.The expression of HSL in the enterocytes may open new paths in our understanding of cholesterol intestinal absorption and metabolism. HSL-mediated hydrolysis of the intracellular pool of cholesteryl esters may contribute together with the esterification process mediated by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 and cholesterol transport mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to the control of cholesterol homeostasis. Several transporters are expressed in the intestinal epithelium. ABCA1 is expressed in the small intestine and may modulate cholesterol absorption. However, data from ABCA1-deficient mice are conflicting (38McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G. Francone O.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4245-4250Google Scholar, 39Drobnik W. Lindenthal B. Lieser B. Ritter M. Christiansen Weber T. Liebisch G. Giesa U. Igel M. Borsukova H. Buchler C. Fung-Leung W.P. Von Bergmann K. Schmitz G. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1203-1211Google Scholar). Studies in patients with sitosterolemia (40Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V.

Srivastava A.K. Salen G. Dean M. Patel S.B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 79-83Google Scholar) and in transgenic mice overexpressing ABCG5 and ABCG8 (42Yu L. Li Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Google Scholar) suggest that the half-transporters participate in cholesterol efflux. Hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters by HSL may produce free cholesterol for export through ABC transporters into the lumen. Because of the unique properties of HSL, the present work paves the way for future studies on lipid metabolism in the enterocyte. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ALBP, adipocyte lipid-binding protein; I-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription is a multifunctional enzyme with broad substrate specificity (1Holm C. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.-A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Google Scholar). It hydrolyzes tri-, di-, and monoacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters. The activity against diacylglycerol is higher than the activity toward tri- and monoacylglycerols. The enzyme also exhibits cholesterol esterase activity, which is almost twice the activity toward triacylglycerols. Much has been learned in the recent years about the domain structure of HSL. Sequence comparisons revealed that HSL belongs to a family of esterases which is mainly represented by prokaryotic enzymes (2Langin D. Holm C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 466-467Google Scholar, 3Hemilä H. Koivula T.T. Palva I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 249-253Google Scholar). From a structural point of view, HSL is the most complex protein of the family. Sequence alignments together with biochemical experiments suggest that adipocyte HSL is composed of two structural domains (4Contreras J.-A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Google Scholar,5Østerlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.-A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Google Scholar). The first 315 amino acids make up the N-terminal domain, which shows very little sequence similarities to other known proteins. The region responsible for the interaction with adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) was mapped to this domain (6Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Google Scholar, 7Shen W.-J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Google Scholar). In adipose tissue, ALBP could increase the hydrolytic activity of HSL through its ability to bind and sequester fatty acids and through specific protein-protein interactions. The C-terminal domain is divided in two functional parts, a catalytic core and a regulatory module. The latter is composed of 150 amino acids, including all of the known phosphorylation sites of HSL. Unlike other known mammalian triacylglycerol lipases, the activity of HSL is regulated by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation sites of protein kinase A, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and AMP-dependent protein kinase have been mapped (8Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Google Scholar, 9Greenberg A.S. Shen W.J. Muliro K. Patel S. Souza S.C. Roth R.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45456-45461Google Scholar, 10Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Google Scholar). The catalytic core is the region that shows homology with the other members of the family. Modeling of the part revealed that it adopts an α/β-hydrolase fold that harbors the catalytic triad constituted by Ser423, Asp703, and His733 (4Contreras J.-A. Karlsson M. Østerlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Google Scholar,11Wei Y. Contreras J.-A. Sheffield P. Østerlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C. Derewenda S. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 340-345Google Scholar). Several forms of HSL transcripts and the exon-intron organization of the HSL gene have been characterized in humans. The 88-kDa adipocyte HSL is translated from a 2.8-kb mRNA and encoded by 9 exons (12Langin D. Laurell H. Holst L.S. Belfrage P. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4897-4901Google Scholar,13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). The transcription start site was mapped in a short noncoding exon called exon B. In the adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, two mRNA species are found, the adipocyte HSL mRNA and a mRNA with a different 5′-end transcribed from exon A. Two testicular forms of HSL have been characterized. The 3.9-kb mRNA encodes a 120-kDa protein that contains a unique N-terminal region encoded by exon T1, a region that presumably forms a third structural domain in this isoform (14Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Google Scholar). The 3.3-kb mRNA encodes a protein that is identical to the adipocyte HSL form (15Mairal A. Melaine N. Laurell H. Grober J. Stenson Holst L. Guillaudeux T. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 286-290Google Scholar). However, the mRNA species differ in their 5′-ends. Exon usage is mutually exclusive, exon T2 being only transcribed in testis and exon B being transcribed in adipose tissue. The nature and role of lipases and esterases participating in the digestion of dietary lipids in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract are well established. In addition to the enzymes in the lumen, there is evidence of lipase activity in enterocytes (16Shen H. Howles P. Tso P. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 50: S103-S125Google Scholar). The presence of cholesterol esterase activity is more elusive. The exact identity of the enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of intracellular acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters is still unclear. Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase, microsomal triacylglycerol hydrolase, and pancreatic cholesterol esterase have all been suggested to be responsible for the hydrolytic activities (17Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 389-399Google Scholar, 18Dolinsky V.W. Sipione S. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 162-172Google Scholar, 19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar). Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase may be synthesized by the small intestine and accounts for the alkaline lipase activity of the enterocytes (19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar). Microsomal triacylglycerol hydrolase could also be involved (18Dolinsky V.W. Sipione S. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 162-172Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that most of the lipase activity is cytosolic (20Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 483-489Google Scholar). Pancreatic cholesterol esterase, also called bile salt-stimulated lipase, is able to hydrolyze cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols. In the absence of bile salts, the contribution of this enzyme is presumably minor (21Holm C. Olivecrona G. Ottosson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 155: 97-119Google Scholar). Because HSL is a cytosolic enzyme with a wide range of hydrolytic activities, the purpose of the present paper was to determine whether HSL was expressed in the intestine and could contribute to the hydrolysis of intracellular lipids. DISCUSSIONHere we have found that HSL contributes to lipase activity and is the major cholesterol esterase in the intestinal mucosa. HSL mRNA and protein were readily detected along the small intestine. Immunohistochemistry data revealed that the enzyme is expressed preferentially in differentiated cells of the villi. Data from HSL-null mice showed that HSL does not account for a significant part of total esterase activity. However, the enzyme is responsible for all neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity both in the cytosolic and particulate fractions. It also contributes between one-third and one-half of diacylglycerol lipase activity in the jejunum.The size of intestinal HSL mRNA and protein corresponds to those of mouse adipocyte HSL, i.e. a 2.6–2.8-kb mRNA and an 82-kDa protein. The 5′-ends of the mRNA species are transcribed from two exons that correspond to human exons A and B. Exon A is located in the mouse gene ≈ 7 kb upstream of exon B (25Laurin N.N. Wang S.P. Mitchell G.A. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 972-978Google Scholar). Use of the two exons is mutually exclusive. Interestingly, we have shown previously that HSL is expressed in the human adenocarcinoma cell line of intestinal origin HT29 (26Remaury A. Laurell H. Grober J. Reynisdottir S. Dauzats M. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 175-182Google Scholar). The two mRNA 5′-ends were found in HT29 HSL mRNA (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). In human and mouse adipose tissue, the main transcription start site is located in exon B. Exon A-containing transcripts are found at very low levels in humans (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar) and are much less abundant than mRNA with exon B in mice ((25) and present work). To date, there is little information on the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of HSL. We have shown that the first 95 bp of human exon T1 5′-flanking region conferred expression of a reporter gene exclusively in testis of transgenic mice (27Blaise R. Guillaudeux T. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Evrard B. Mairal A. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5109-5115Google Scholar). Exon B 5′-flanking region contains an active promoter with an E-box and two GC-boxes as functional cis-acting elements (28Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Google Scholar). In adipocytes, the E-box mediates the glucose-mediated induction of HSL gene expression. However, the sequences responsible for the adipose tissue-specific expression of HSL are not present in this region because the pattern of promoter activity up to 2.4 kb was similar in adipocytes and in HeLa cells that do not express HSL (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). No data are yet available for the exon A 5′-flanking region.

In support of this concept, a mucosal triacylglycerol pool distinct from the chylomicron triacylglycerol precursor pool has been characterized (31Tipton A.D. Frase S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G871-G878Google Scholar). Lipolysis of the mucosal pool has been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Both acidic and alkaline lipase activities have been described in the mucosa (20Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 483-489Google Scholar, 32Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M.

Contribution to cholesterol esterification is also unlikely because studies on knockout mice revealed that the enzyme is responsible for mediating intestinal absorption of cholesteryl esters but does not influence free cholesterol absorption (35Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Google Scholar). In contrast, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (36Buhman K.K. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Turley S.

There is evidence that the enzyme, via an apical-to-basolateral transcytotic pathway, is released at the basolateral membrane level and may contribute to serum pancreatic cholesterol esterase activity (37Bruneau N.

To date, there is little information on the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of HSL. We have shown that the first 95 bp of human exon T1 5′-flanking region conferred expression of a reporter gene exclusively in testis of transgenic mice (27Blaise R. Guillaudeux T. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Evrard B. Mairal A. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5109-5115Google Scholar). Exon B 5′-flanking region contains an active promoter with an E-box and two GC-boxes as functional cis-acting elements (28Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Google Scholar). In adipocytes, the E-box mediates the glucose-mediated induction of HSL gene expression. However, the sequences responsible for the adipose tissue-specific expression of HSL are not present in this region because the pattern of promoter activity up to 2.4 kb was similar in adipocytes and in HeLa cells that do not express HSL (13Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Google Scholar). No data are yet available for the exon A 5′-flanking region. In the enterocytes, exons A and B are represented in equal amounts, suggesting that two alternative promoters control HSL gene expression providing the possibility of distinct transcriptional regulation. Lipid processing through the intestine is a complex pathway with multiple control steps. The intestine is unable to transport neutral lipids into the lymph at the rate with which they are absorbed, especially at high input rates. Nearly half of the triacylglycerol mass infused into rat intestine does not appear in the lymph (29Mansbach C.M. II Arnold A. Cox M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G642-G648Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the lipids are oxidized because β-oxidation of lipid entering the mucosa from the lumen is limited. There is no evidence that triacylglycerols are transported via the portal vein (30Sabesin S.M. Frase S. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 496-511Google Scholar). These studies suggest that some triacylglycerols in the enterocyte are undergoing hydrolysis. In support of this concept, a mucosal triacylglycerol pool distinct from the chylomicron triacylglycerol precursor pool has been characterized (31Tipton A.D. Frase S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G871-G878Google Scholar). Lipolysis of the mucosal pool has been shown both in vitro and in vivo. Both acidic and alkaline lipase activities have been described in the mucosa (20Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 483-489Google Scholar, 32Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 273-280Google Scholar). Because most of the lipolytic activity was found at neutral or basic pH, the physiological importance of the acidic lipase is unclear. Here, we confirm that significant neutral lipase activity is found in the enterocyte. This activity was inhibited by diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate as shown previously for mucosal lipolysis in triolein-infused rats (31Tipton A.D. Frase S. Mansbach C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G871-G878Google Scholar). Lipase activity was found in the different parts of the small intestine. Data from HSL-null mice show that HSL contributes to lipase activity in the distal section but not in the first part of the small intestine. Recently, Mansbach and colleagues (19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar) showed that pancreatic lipase was expressed in the intestine with most of the enzyme detected in the first quarter (19Mahan J.T. Hada G.D. Rao R.H. Mansbach II, C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G1187-G1196Google Scholar). Altogether, the data suggest that the hydrolysis of mucosal triacylglycerols is caused by pancreatic lipase in the proximal part of the small intestine and HSL in the more distal parts. The nature of the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in the intestine has remained unclear. Pancreatic cholesterol esterase (bile salt-stimulated lipase) is internalized upon binding to the surface of enterocytes (33Bruneau N. Lombardo D. Bendayan M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2665-2679Google Scholar). The esterase could hydrolyze intracellular cholesteryl esters or conversely participate, at acid pH, in the esterification of cholesterol (17Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 389-399Google Scholar, 34Ponz de Leon M. Carrubi F. Di Donato P. Carulli N. Digest. Dis. Sci. 1985; 30: 1053-1064Google Scholar). However, the intracellular esterase activity in the absence of cofactors such as bile salts may be very low. Contribution to cholesterol esterification is also unlikely because studies on knockout mice revealed that the enzyme is responsible for mediating intestinal absorption of cholesteryl esters but does not influence free cholesterol absorption (35Howles P.N. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7196-7202Google Scholar). In contrast, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (36Buhman K.K. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Turley S. Farese R.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1341-1347Google Scholar). Localization of pancreatic cholesterol esterase in intestinal epithelium may therefore not be related to intracellular metabolism. There is evidence that the enzyme, via an apical-to-basolateral transcytotic pathway, is released at the basolateral membrane level and may contribute to serum pancreatic cholesterol esterase activity (37Bruneau N. Nganga A. Bendayan M. Lombardo D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 94-108Google Scholar). Our data reveal that HSL and not pancreatic cholesterol esterase accounts for neutral cholesterol esterase activity in the small intestine. The expression of HSL in the enterocytes may open new paths in our understanding of cholesterol intestinal absorption and metabolism. HSL-mediated hydrolysis of the intracellular pool of cholesteryl esters may contribute together with the esterification process mediated by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 and cholesterol transport mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to the control of cholesterol homeostasis. Several transporters are expressed in the intestinal epithelium. ABCA1 is expressed in the small intestine and may modulate cholesterol absorption. However, data from ABCA1-deficient mice are conflicting (38McNeish J. Aiello R.J. Guyot D. Turi T. Gabel C. Aldinger C. Hoppe K.L. Roach M.L. Royer L.J. de Wet J. Broccardo C. Chimini G.

Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Google Scholar) suggest that the half-transporters participate in cholesterol efflux. Hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters by HSL may produce free cholesterol for export through ABC transporters into the lumen. Because of the unique properties of HSL, the present work paves the way for future studies on lipid metabolism in the enterocyte.

More recently, BAG-1 was found in the nucleus where it decreases GR transactivation. Moreover, nonspecific DNA binding of BAG-1 has been reported. We discovered that of the N-terminal part of BAG-1M, the first 8 amino acids are sufficient for DNA binding, containing a stretch of three lysines and a stretch of three arginines. Changing the spacing between these stretches had no effect on DNA binding. Surprisingly, this small, nonsequence-specific DNA binding domain was nonetheless necessary for the inhibitory function of BAG-1 for GR-dependent transcription, whereas the following serine- and threonine-rich E2 X 4 repeat domain was not. Mutational analysis of these two domains revealed that only mutants retaining DNA binding capability were able to down-regulate GR-mediated transactivation. Intriguingly, lack of DNA binding could not be functionally rescued by BAG-1M harboring a point mutation abolishing interaction with hsp70. Thus, DNA binding and hsp70 interaction are required in cis. We propose that the nonsequence-specific DNA-binding protein BAG-1 acts at specific chromosomal loci by interacting with other proteins.

In addition, BAG-1 interaction with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) results in inhibition of binding of RAR to its response elements on DNA and of RAR-dependent transcription (12Liu R. Takayama S.

Likewise, BAG-1 has been described as a negative regulator of GR, because it binds to the hinge region of GR and inhibits DNA binding and transactivation of the receptor (13Kullmann M. Schneikert J.

Before hormone activation, GR resides in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with various molecular chaperones in a stepwise fashion to attain the state competent for hormone binding (14Bresnick E.H.

The chaperone activity of hsp70 can be modulated by BAG-1 and also by hsp40, C terminus of hsp70-interacting protein, and hsp70-interacting protein (hip). hsp40 enhances the ATPase activity of hsp70 in vitro (23Freeman B.C.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This seeming discrepancy could be explained by different protein concentrations of BAG-1 present in these assays, as the protein level of BAG-1 has been shown to be crucial for its inhibitory action (37Kanelakis K.C.

Although all these reports strongly suggest a cytosolic effect of BAG-1 on GR folding and activity, there are also data supporting a nuclear function of BAG-1. For example, BAG-1 has been reported to bind to DNA in a nonsequence-specific manner and to stimulate DNA transcription (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Deletion of, or mutations within, the N-terminal 10 amino acids of BAG-1 abolish its DNA binding (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that BAG-1 is transported into the nucleus upon steroid binding and nuclear translocation of GR (38Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This nuclear translocation is dependent on the C-terminal hsp70 binding domain of BAG-1. Moreover, the inhibiting effect of BAG-1 on DNA binding of GR (13Kullmann M. Schneikert J. Moll J. Heck S. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Cato A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14620-14625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) can be overcome in a cell-free system by supplementing with increasing amounts of hsp70 (40Schneikert J. Hübner S. Langer G. Petri T. Jäättelä M. Reed J. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both C- and N-terminal deletions deprive BAG-1 of its ability to inhibit GR function (38Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whereas an hsp70 interaction domain has been identified and characterized by crystallography and NMR analysis in the C-terminal region (41Briknarova K. Takayama S. Brive L. Havert M.L. Knee D.A. Velasco J. Homma S. Cabezas E. Stuart J. Hoyt D.W. Satterthwait A.C. Llinas M. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 42Sondermann H. Ho A.K. Listenberger L.L. Siegers K. Moarefi I. Wente S.R. Hartl F.U. Young J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33220-33227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the function of the N-terminal part seems less clear. It has been speculated that a serine- and threonine-rich E2 X 4 domain may be necessary for the inhibitory function of BAG-1 (38Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it also is conceivable that the described DNA binding domain is important for inhibition of GR function. Here we present a detailed mutational analysis of the N-terminal part of BAG-1 with the aim to 1) describe the unusual DNA binding domain in more detail, and 2) dissect the contributions of the E2 X 4 motif domain and the DNA binding domain to the inhibition of GR-dependent transcription. We demonstrate here that, surprisingly, the first eight amino acids of BAG-1 are required for the inhibitory effect of BAG-1 on GR, whereas the E2 X 4 domain is dispensable. Moreover, the binding of BAG-1 to DNA is because of the positive electric charge at the N terminus. Mutations that inhibit binding to DNA cannot be functionally rescued by overexpressing BAG-1 with a point mutation abolishing its interaction with hsp70, indicating that the DNA binding and the hsp70 interaction domain must be present in cis. Here we discuss a model in which the nonspecific DNA-binding motif of BAG-1 is essential for inhibiting GR function and becomes specific due to interaction with other factors like GR.

Cells were harvested at about 70–90% confluency, and about 0.5 to 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 400 μl of electroporation buffer (50 mmK2HPO4, 20 mm KAc, pH 7.35, 25 mm MgSO4). 3.5 μg of steroid-responsive firefly luciferase reporter plasmid MTV-Luc (44Hollenberg S.M.

Transfection was performed using an electroporation system (Biotechnologies & Experimental Research, San Diego) after determination of the optimal electrical field strength (47Chu G. Hayakawa H.

Electroporated cells were replated and cultured for 24 h in fresh medium (containing 10% steroid-free FCS) supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) or the solvent of dexamethasone (i.e. ethanol).Table IStructure of BAG-1M, BAG-1S, and the mutants BAG-1M ΔN10 and BAG-1MΔ11–67DNA, DNA-binding domain; UBI, ubiquitin-like-domain; hsp70-IAD, Hsp70-interacting-domain; E2 X 4, E2 X 4-repeat motif domain.

A series of BAG-1 mutants was generated by PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pRK5mcs. The plasmid pRK5mcs was derived from pRK5SV40PUR (46Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) by cutting with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI andHindIII and inserting an annealed linker oligonucleotide with the sequences 5′-AATTCTCGAGATATCGGGCCCGGATCCGCGGCCGCTCGCGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCGCGAGCGGCCGCGGATCCGGGCCCGATATCTCGAG-3′ for the opposite strand. For cloning, the wild type and mutant sequences of BAG-1 were amplified by PCR from the plasmid pMal-c2-Bag-1 (34Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We chose the vector pProExHTa (Invitrogen) to express BAG-1 proteins in bacteria. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used are provided as Supplemental Material. Firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were as described before (48Herr A. Wochnik G.M. Rosenhagen M.C. Holsboer F. Rein T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Either cells were scraped in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 mKHPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and cytosolic extracts were made by three freeze and thaw cycles and subsequent centrifugation. 50 μl of each supernatant (corresponding to ∼1–2 × 105 cells) were transferred to a 96-well plate. 150 μl of 33 mm KHPO4, pH 7.8, 1.7 mm ATP, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 13 mm luciferin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to each sample by the injector of an automatic luminometer (Luminat LB 96, Wallac GmbH, Freiburg, Germany), and light emission was measured for 10 s. To correct for variations in transfection efficiencies, values of the luciferase assay were normalized to either β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase activities. To measure β-galactosidase activity, 50 μl of cell extract was added to 100 μl of galactosidase buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) on a 96-well plate. 20 μl of 2 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C. After 10–30 min, absorption was measured at 405 nm in a multiphotometer (Dynatech MR5000). When using the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid in combination with the firefly reporter plasmid, cell extracts were scraped in 200 μl of a lysis buffer provided and prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega Inc.), and firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were measured on a 96-well plate in 50 μl of cell extract in the automatic luminometer on a 96-well plate. Histidine-tagged BAG-1 encoding plasmids were grown in pBL3Lys bacteria (Invitrogen). Lysis and purification was performed using Ni-NTA-agarose according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). The histidine tag was removed by cleavage with tobacco edge virus protease for 6 h at 30 °C (Invitrogen). The cleaved proteins were rebound to Ni-NTA-agarose columns again to remove traces of uncleaved proteins and purified afterward with Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) to remove dithiothreitol from cleavage buffer and traces of liquid columns. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). DNA binding of BAG-1 was essentially performed as described (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 or 2 μg of purified and tobacco edge virus-cleaved BAG proteins (isoforms or mutant) were incubated with 0.2 ng of 32P-end-labeled 125-bp λ/HindIII DNA fragment in binding buffer (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. Protein DNA complexes were resolved on native 5% acrylamide gels in TBE buffer and visualized after overnight incubation on x-ray films (Eastman Kodak). 25 μg of total protein from whole cell lysates used for luciferase assays was separated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions (Lämmli buffer containing 10% SDS). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer, and then specific antibodies were added. BAG protein was detected by addition of a monoclonal anti-BAG antibody (anti-BAG-C16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). The HA tag on GR was detected by a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Ingelheim) followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (Sigma). Signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system solution (AmershamBiosciences). BAG-1S, the short isoform of BAG-1, is unable to inhibit the transcriptional activity of GR (38Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid stretch missing in BAG-1S as compared with BAG-1M contains a serine- and threonine-rich E2 X 4 repeat domain and a recently described DNA binding domain (Table I) (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To clarify which features in the N terminus are required for inhibition of GR, we created two deletion mutants, either missing the E2 X 4 domain (BAG-1M Δ11–67, Table I) or the putative DNA binding domain (BAG-1M ΔN10, Fig. 1). These mutants were analyzed in transient transfection assays in two cell lines, COS-7 cells and the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC. Cells were expressed with a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene driven by the GR-sensitive mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, a Renilla luciferase reference plasmid, and either an empty expression vector or a vector expressing one of the BAG-1M mutants. The light units measured for the reporter enzyme were normalized by the light units of the control enzyme (Renilla luciferase). Stimulation after incubation with 100 nm dexamethasone was in the range of 200–300-fold and was set to 100%. BAG-1M clearly inhibited GR-dependent reporter gene transcription, as expected (Fig. 1 A). To our surprise, however, deletion of the E2 X 4 motif domain had no influence on the ability of BAG-1 to inhibit GR-mediated transcription. On the other hand, deletion of the N-terminal 10 amino acids completely abolished the effect of BAG-1 on GR. The same pattern of activity of the BAG-1 mutants was observed in COS-7 cells and HeLa cells (data not shown). Because co-expression of various plasmids can produce misleading results in case of expression interference (49Hofman K. Swinnen J.V. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Heyns W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 168: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we checked the relative amounts of GR and of BAG-1. The protein levels of GR were similar in all the experiments (Fig. 1 B). Likewise, the levels of the expressed BAG-1 proteins were comparable throughout our experiments (Fig. 1 C). We did not detect significant levels of endogenous BAG-1 in SK-N-MC or COS-7 cells. However, endogenous BAG-1 was detected in HeLa cells (data not shown). Thus, our results do not depend on the presence or absence of endogenous BAG-1. We conclude that the domain recently put forward as DNA binding domain of BAG-1 (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is necessary for the inhibitory effect of BAG-1 on GR. To characterize the DNA binding domain of BAG-1 in more detail, we created a series of additional mutants (Table II); all proteins derived from BAG-1 mutants and isoforms in Tables I and II were expressed in bacteria and purified (Fig. 2, A andB). As a reference, we mutated lysines 2, 3, and 4 to alanines (BAG-1M KA), which has been described to abolish DNA binding of BAG-1. To reduce the DNA binding domain essentially to the positively charged amino acids lysine and arginine, we deleted amino acids 9–67 (Δ9–67). Moreover, we changed the spacing between lysines 2–4 and arginines 6–8 by either deleting threonine 5 (BAG-1M −Thr5) or inserting one alanine (BAG-1M +Ala5) or two alanines (BAG-1M +2Ala5). After expression in bacteria, proteins were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose (Fig. 2, A and B, 1st lane of each mutant), and the histidine tails were cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease (Fig. 2, A and B, 2nd lane of each mutant). The purified and cleaved proteins were used to examine their ability to bind to DNA. The 125-bp fragment of an HindIII cleavage of DNA from bacteriophage λ was chosen as template. Gel shift assays (Fig. 2 C) revealed that mutation of lysines 2–4 to alanines abolished DNA binding, consistent with a recent report (39Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, deletion of the E2 X 4 domain (BAG-1M Δ11–67; Fig. 2 D) had no influence on DNA binding. Even additional deletion of two N-terminal amino acids retained DNA binding (BAG-1M Δ9–67; Fig. 2 C). BAG-1S, as expected, did not bind to DNA. Therefore, it appears that the first 8 N-terminal amino acids are sufficient to confer the ability of BAG-1 to bind to DNA. Moreover, spacing between the positively charged amino acids lysines 2–4 and arginines 6–8 is not important for DNA binding, because these mutants bind to DNA as efficiently as BAG-1M (Fig. 2, C and D). Therefore, BAG-1M apparently contains a short, unusual DNA binding domain. The results shown in Fig. 1 suggest that DNA binding of BAG-1 is necessary for its inhibitory effect on GR function. We set out to either strengthen this correlation or to prove that, although this domain per se is necessary, it is not DNA binding but some other property of this domain that causes the inhibitory effect. Therefore, we constructed expression clones of all mutants and tested them in our transient reporter gene assay as described in Fig. 2. We find that BAG-1M Δ9–67, BAG-1M −Thr5, BAG-1M +Ala5, and BAG-1M +2Ala5 all are able to inhibit GR-dependent transcription (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, BAG-1S and BAG-1M KA lost the inhibitory effect on GR. Again, the protein levels of GR were comparable throughout the experiments (Fig. 3 B), as were the levels of the different BAG-1 mutants (Fig. 3 C). Similar data were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). Therefore, the data in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 demonstrate that all mutants of BAG-1M that are able to bind to DNA inhibit the transcriptional activity of GR, whereas those that are unable to bind to DNA have no influence on GR activity. Besides the N-terminal domain, deletion of the C-terminal 70 amino acids also abolishes the ef"

Considering that sorLA is mainly intracellular (10Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol.

Petersen C.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that Vps10p-D receptors other than sortilin might be targeted by similar sorting mechanisms. SorCS1 is expressed in the murine central nervous system like sortilin and sorLA, and transcripts have also been observed in kidney, liver, and heart (1Hermey G. Riedel I.B. Hampe W. Schaller H.C. Hermans- Borgmeyer I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The receptor prevails in neurons, and during embryonic development sorCS1 is expressed in a transient and dynamic pattern in areas of the nervous system where precursors proliferate as well as in regions where cells differentiate (17Hermey G. Schaller H.C. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to begin elucidating sorCS1 function. We cloned human sorCS1b, whose cd is highly similar to that of the murine orthologue, and identified two new isoforms with distinct cds and different distributions in tissues. The common lumenal domain was cleaved by furin in the late synthetic pathway demonstrating that sorCS1 is synthesized as a proprotein. Analysis of cells stably transfected with wild type and chimeric receptors showed that the three cds convey different distributions of sorCS1 in cells and have different capabilities for internalization. Neither the mature lumenal domain nor any of the cds bound any of the ligands previously shown to interact with sortilin and sorLA, demonstrating that sorCS1 is functionally different from the previously characterized Vps10p-D family receptors. Murine sorCS1b cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF195056) was radiolabeled and used for screening a human brain cDNA library in the lambda ZAP vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Five positive clones were purified and rescued into the pBK-CMV vector, and sequencing revealed three different overlapping clones representing bp 462–3504 of human sorCS1b cDNA in addition to a 3′ untranslated region. The 5′ part of the open reading frame was obtained by reverse transcription PCR. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg human fetal brain RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the primer 5′-AGGTGAAGGTGTAGTGAGCAATAGGG representing bp 1549–1574. RNA was denatured in the presence of 40 pmol primer for 10 min at 94 °C and transferred to prewarmed reaction mixture (50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 200 mmdithiothreitol). Following addition of reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Invitrogen), first strand reaction was performed for 55 min at 42 °C. The reaction was terminated by 15 min heating to 70 °C followed by 5 min on ice and incubation for 20 min at 37 °C with RNase-H (AP Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). A two-step PCR reaction was performed using Advantage-GC polymerase (Clontech). The same reverse primer was used as for the first strand reaction, and the forward primer (5′-CTCCCGCGATGGGAAAAGTTGGC) was obtained from a sequence in the human chromosome 10 derived bacterial artificial chromosome RP11-557K21 (GenBank™ accession number AL356439) homologous to the 5′ end of murine sorCS1. The 1.5-kb product was subcloned into the pGem-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The full-length cDNA was obtained by ligation of overlapping fragments using thePstI (bp 1522), SapI (bp 1753), and BamHI (bp 3128) sites and transferred into pBluescript (Stratagene).

Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) at the NCBI (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Exonic sequences were determined by aligning cDNA and genomic sequences, and exon/intron boundaries were in agreement with consensus splice sites (19Goldstrohm A.C. Greenleaf A.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Gene. 2001; 277: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Primers corresponding to the 3′ ends of putative terminal exons of sorCS1a and sorCS1c (5′-TTAATAGAAACCATCACTGCTATG and 5′-TGGTGGCTACTGGGAATCATTTAC) were used for first strand synthesis on 1 μg of total RNA from human fetal brain followed by two-step PCR reactions using the forward primer for generation of full-length sorCS1b. A multiple tissue blot (AP Biotech) was hybridized with a [32P]dCTP randomly labeled probe of sorCS1 (bp 463–1924) and washed under high stringency conditions followed by autoradiography. For identification of sorCS1 isoforms, reverse transcription PCR reactions were performed on 1 μg of total human RNA from fetal liver, fetal brain, adult cerebellum, and adult total brain (Clontech) using the reverse primer 5′-GCCTGTAGCCTTTGGGGGTTTTCC for sorCS1b as well as the reverse primers designed for isolation of sorCS1a and -c cDNA. The forward primer (5′-TACCCACCACTGCTGAACTCTTTG) common to all isoforms was derived from exon 23. The PCR products were verified by sequencing. For generation of wild type receptor constructs, the sorCS1 cDNA was cut out of pBluescript using the KpnI site of the polylinker preceding the 5′ end of the cDNA and the natural BamHI site at bp 3128. This was combined either with a BamHI/ApaI 3′ fragment and cloned into pcDNA4/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen) for expression of the lumenal part of sorCS1 (l-sorCS1) or withBamHI/NotI 3′ fragments and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) for expression of full-length receptor isoforms. ApaI and NotI sites were introduced by PCR to the 3′ ends using modified primers corresponding to nucleotides 2991–3308 or to segments following the stop codons. Alternatively, sorCS1a–c cDNA was transferred via NheI andNotI restriction sites from pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) to pcDNA3.1/Hygro(−) (Invitrogen) to generate doubly transfected cells. To produce l-sorCS1 mutated in the furin cleavage site (74RRRR to 74GRGR) we performed a two-step PCR using Advantage-GC polymerase. Overlapping 5′ and 3′ fragments were amplified from the original expression construct using the primers 5′-ATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAG, 5′-GATCCGCTCCGCTCCGTCCCCTCCCGC, 5′-CCGGCGGGAGGGGACGGAGCGGAG, and 5′-TTGTTCCATAATCGGTTGACCTCC. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and SacI and used to replace the 5′ end of l-sorCS1 cDNA in the pcDNA4/Myc-HisA vector. To produce chimeric constructs covering the lumenal and transmembrane parts of the interleukin-2 receptor-α (IL2R, Tac/CD25) and the sorCS1 cytoplasmic tails (chi-a, -b, and -c), cDNA encoding the three tails was amplified by standard PCR technique using primers generating a 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ XhoI site. The primers for the a, b, and c tail constructs were: 5′-TCGTAAGCTTAAGTTTAAAAGGTGCG and 5′-CCTCTCGAGTTAATAGAAACCATCACTGCTATG, 5′-CGTCAAGCTTAAGTTTAAAAGGAGAGTAGCTTTACCC and 5′-GGGGCTCGAGTTAAATTGCATACTGTGCCCCAGCAGATCC, and 5′-CAAGCTTAAGTTTAAAAGGAA GATC and 5′-TACCTCGAGTCATTTACCTATGAGC. The HindIII/XhoI fragments were ligated into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) together with a NheI/HindIII fragment representing the lumenal and transmembrane parts of IL2R cut out of pCMV-IL2R/CD25/Tac (20LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in HyQ-CCM5 (HyClone, Logan, UT) and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and identified by Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. Double transfectants were generated by transfecting CHO cells expressing IL2R/sorCS1 chimeras with pcDNA3.1/Hygro(−) wild type receptor constructs followed by additional selection using 500 μg/ml Hygromycin (Invitrogen). Secreted His6-taggedl-sorCS1 was purified by affinity chromatography on Talon Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech). Prewashed resin (3 ml) was recirculated for 16 h at 4 °C with about 90 ml of culture medium followed by washings in 50 mmNa2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.0, and elution in 50 mm NaAc, 300 mmNaCl, pH 5.0. The propeptide sequence was amplified from sorCS1 cDNA using a 5′ primer (5′-TCTGGATCCGGCGGCTCCTGCTGC) introducing aBamHI site to the propeptide N-terminal sequence and a 3′ primer (5′-ATCCTCGAGTCACCGTCTCCTCCG) introducing a stop codon and aXhoI site after the furin cleavage site 72RRRR. Following two-step PCR, the product was cloned viaBamHI/XhoI into pGEX-4T-1 (AP Biotech). For expression of the leucine-rich domain (Glu942-Ile1023) the nativeEcoRI and EcoRV sites were used to generate a construct in pGEX-4T-1. Both constructs were expressed in the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3), and the resulting GST-tagged proteins were purified using glutathion-Sepharose beads. EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites were introduced into cDNA of the three sorCS1 cytoplasmic tails via PCR followed by insertion into the pLexA vector to generate bait strains. A Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used as described before (13Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjær A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Antisera were raised in rabbits against GST-sorCS1-(942–1023)(anti-Leu sorCS1), l-sorCS1, and GST-sorCS1-(1–77) propeptide (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Monoclonal mouse anti-IL2Rα (anti-Tac) was from Roche. Recombinant RAP, GST-sortilin and −sorLA propeptides, as well as the lumenal domains of sortilin (l-sortilin) and sorLA, were produced as described (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J.

The medium was harvested, and washed cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (CompleteMini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Labeled l-sorCS1 was precipitated from lysate (200 μl + 600 μl of non-labeled medium) and medium (600 μl + 200 μl of non-labeled lysate) via its His6 tag using Talon beads. For treatment with PNGase-F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the beads were washed, heated in 10 μl 1% SDS (3 min, 95 °C), heated again after addition of 90 μl 20 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na-azide, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.2, and cooled before the addition of 0.5 units PNGase-F and incubation for 16 h at 30 °C. Alternatively, washed beads were treated with endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H, Roche) as described (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For furin cleavage, beads with bound l-sorCS1 were incubated in 100 μl of 100 mm Hepes, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.6, and 4 units of furin (Alexis Biochemicals) followed by successive incubations for 2 h at 30 °C and 2 h at 37 °C. For immunoblotting, medium or cell lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and blotted following standard procedures. For detection of sorCS1 in blots of human kidney and spleen (Chemicon), anti-l-sorCS1 was used, followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig (DAKO), and visualization by ECL (AP Biotech). Measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument using CM5 sensor chips activated as described (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). l-sorCS1 and the lumenal domains of sortilin and sorLA were immobilized to an estimated density of ∼60 fmol/mm2, and samples for binding (40 μl, 25 °C) were injected at 5 μl/min in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Binding was expressed in units as the response obtained with immobilized receptor minus the response with an activated but uncoupled chip. The chips were regenerated as described, and kinetic parameters were determined using BIAevaluation 3.0 software as described (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cells were surface-labeled with the impermeable reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), washed and lysed as described previously (10Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S.

The fractions of streptavidin-bound and unbound IL2R/sorCS1 chimera or sorCS1 isoforms in cell lysates were detected by Western blotting and quantified using a FUJIFILM LAS-1000 luminescence image analyzer. Transfected or control cells were washed in 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, fixed in the same buffer with 4% paraformaldehyde, and finally washed in buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 followed by incubation with primary (anti-Tac or anti-l-sorCS1) and secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse, DAKO, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). To visualize internalization, cells were surface-labeled with primary antibody at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation at 37 °C for various times. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a laser scanning confocal unit (LSM510, Zeiss). Alternatively, cells transfected with chimeras were incubated at 4 °C with 125I-labeled monoclonal anti-Tac (3 × 104 cpm/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and reincubated at 37 °C for 0–60 min. Incubations were stopped by the addition of ice cold acetic acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.5. After 5 min, the supernatant was recovered, the cells lysed in 1 m NaOH, and radioactivity determined in the two fractions was defined as surface-associated and internalized antibody, respectively. The human sorCS1b cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF284756) encodes a 33 amino acid signal peptide followed by a 1135 amino acid type 1 receptor (Fig. 1 A) with 92% sequence identity to the murine sorCS1b protein. The N-terminal part contains the sequence (74RRRR77) corresponding to the optimal multibasic motif (RXR/KR) for cleavage by furin and the sequence (93RSPR96) corresponding to the minimal requirements (RXXR) for cleavage. The human sorCS1b gene maps at 10q23.3, and analysis of genomic sequences indicated the presence of 26 exons. As two isoforms (sorCS1a and -b) differing only in their cds have been identified in the mouse (2Hermey G. Schaller H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and only the sorCS1b variant was found by human cDNA library screening, we searched in human genomic databases for sequences corresponding to the 3′ end of murine sorCS1a. However, no such sequence was found, and genomic sequences between exon 25 (encoding the transmembrane domain and four residues of the cytoplasmic tail) and exon 26 (encoding the remaining sorCS1b tail) were therefore analyzed to identify possible splice variants with little or no homology to murine sorCS1a. Putative exon sequences identified as open reading frames followed by polyadenylation signals were analyzed using primers 3′ to potential stop codons and a 5′ primer corresponding to exon 23 encoding part of the leucine-rich domain (cf. Fig. 1 B). This approach revealed two new splice variants in human fetal brain RNA, and cDNA clones encoding the complete proteins were identified using a primer corresponding to the 5′ untranslated region and the primers corresponding to sequences 3′ to the stop codons. Fig. 1 B shows the generation of human sorCS1 isoforms. Like in the mouse, human sorCS1a (GenBank™ accession numberAY099453) is generated by using exon 25 as the terminal exon (stop codon a), but the amino acid sequence encoded by the part of exon 25 that is specific for the sorCS1a-cd is completely different from that of the murine receptor (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 2Hermey G. Schaller H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When the 5′ splice site within exon 25 is active, sorCS1b is generated by skipping the 3′ part of this exon and using exon 26 as the terminal exon. Comparison of the amino acid encoded by exon 26 of human sorCS1b showed 89% sequence identity with the corresponding segment of the mouse sorCS1b. Finally, human sorCS1c (GenBank™ accession numberAY099452) is generated by skipping the middle part of exon 25 by using both splice sites within the exon. Because a murine counterpart was expected, we subsequently cloned mouse sorCS1c (GenBank™ accession number AF284755), 2G. Hermey, unpublished result. which revealed a cd with 87% amino acid sequence identity to the human sorCS1c-cd. Searches in databases indicated that the cds of human sorCS1a and -b show little similarity to other receptor cds, whereas the sorCS1c-cd exhibits about 50% identity to the cds of sorCS2 and -3. Northern blotting of human tissues using a probe common to all three isoforms showed high levels of transcripts in adult kidney and comparatively moderate levels in brain, heart, and small intestine (Fig.2 A). To identify the sorCS1 protein, we performed immunoblots on two human tissue homogenates and on extracts of CHO cells mock-transfected or stably transfected with sorCS1a cDNA. A band of ∼130 kDa was detected in the sorCS1a-transfected CHO cells and in kidney, but not in non-transfected CHO cells and spleen (Fig. 2 B), in agreement with the Northern blots. We next examined expression of the three splice variants in human adult brain, adult cerebellum, fetal brain, and fetal liver by reverse transcription PCR. As shown in Fig. 2 C, all three splice variants were detected in the brain samples (lanes 2–4), whereas only sorCS1c was found in human fetal liver (lane 1), demonstrating that sorCS1 isoforms are differentially expressed among tissues. To determine whether sorCS1 processing includes propeptide cleavage, CHO cells were stably transfected with the His6-tagged lumenal part (amino acid 1–1067) of sorCS1 (l-sorCS1). The transfectants were biolabeled, and l-sorCS1 secreted into the medium or present in cell lysates was recovered on Talon beads. Fig. 3 A shows that labeledl-sorCS1 in the medium (lane 1) has a higher apparent molecular size than that obtained from lysates (lane 2), whereas, after deglycosylation with PNGase-F, the cellular form (lane 4) is larger than the secreted form (lane 3), demonstrating cleavage of l-sorCS1. This occurred within cells because labeled l-sorCS1 isolated from cell lysates was unchanged by incubation in conditioned CHO medium (not shown). Fig. 3 further shows that the cellular form of the receptor was cleaved upon incubation with furin (panel B, lane 4 versus lane 3), whereas the secreted form was unaffected (lane 2 versus lane 1), and that only the uncleaved cellular form was sensitive to Endo-H (panel C, lane 4 versus lane 3), demonstrating that cleavage occurs in the furin-containing distal synthetic pathway. Western blotting was then performed, and antibody against sorCS1-(1–77) propeptide reacted only with the cellular form of the"
https://openalex.org/W2105691290,"Abstract Doppel (Dpl) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expressed in the testis. It exhibits 26% sequence identity with the prion protein (PrP) but lacks the octarepeat region implicated as the major copper-binding domain. Contrary to expectations, Cu(II) induced a 26% reduction in the intrinsic fluorescence of Dpl(27–154) and a calculatedK d for a single-site model of 0.16 ± 0.08 μm. Other metals had minimal effects on fluorescence quenching. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of a Dpl peptide revealed binding of copper (but not other metals) to the helical αB/B′-loop-αC subregion of Dpl. Fluorescence quenching and equilibrium dialysis analyses of this Dpl(101–145) peptide were compatible with a binding site of K d = 0.4 μm. Diethylpyrocarbonate footprinting (Qin, K., Yang, Y., Mastrangelo, P., and Westaway, D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 1981–1990) of Dpl(27–154) defined one residue/molecule was protected by copper from diethylpyrocarbonate adduct formation, and reiteration of this analysis with Dpl(101–145) suggested that His131 may contribute to Cu(II) binding. Taken together, our data indicate that the α-helical region of mouse Dpl possesses a selective copper-binding site with a submicromolarK d and perhaps one or more lower affinity sites. Although metallated forms of Dpl might exist in vivo, analyses of Tg(Dpl)10329 mice were inconsistent with reports that Dpl expression is associated with increased carbonylation and nitrosylation of brain proteins. Thus, rather than comprising an important source of free radical damage, copper binding may serve to modulate the activity, stability, or localization of the Dpl protein."

MAGUKs are composed of modular protein-protein interaction motifs including L27, PDZ, Src homology (SH) 3, and guanylate kinase domains that aggregate adhesion molecules and receptors. Genetic analyses reveal that lethal mutations of MAGUKs often occur in the guanylate kinase domain, indicating a critical role for this domain. Here, we explored whether GMP binding to the guanylate kinase domain regulates MAGUK function. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previously published studies, we failed to detect GMP binding to the MAGUKs postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and CASK. Two amino acid residues in the GMP binding pocket that differ between MAGUKs and authentic guanylate kinase explain this lack of binding, as swapping these residues largely prevent GMP binding to yeast guanylate kinase. Conversely, these mutations restore GMP binding but not catalytic activity to PSD-95. Protein ligands for the PSD-95 guanylate kinase domain, guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP) and MAP1A, appear not to interact with the canonical GMP binding pocket, and GMP binding does not influence the intramolecular SH3/guanylate kinase (GK) interaction within PSD-95.

A variety of high affinity protein ligands have been identified for GK domains from several MAGUKs (26Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J.

In addition to binding exogenous ligands, protein fragments containing the proposed SH3 and GK regions of MAGUK proteins interact with each other (31McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the SH3GK region of PSD-95 reveals that this interaction is the assembly of the SH3 fold from discontinuous structural components (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O.

Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This SH3/GK interaction, may oligomerize MAGUK scaffolds, but factors that regulate intermolecular SH3 assembly remain uncertain. Despite our limited understanding of the biochemical roles for the SH3 and GK domains, these regions are clearly critical as most genetically identified mutations of MAGUKs occur in the SH3 and GK domains (2Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 97-111PubMed Google Scholar, 5Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The GK domains of MAGUKs share 40% sequence homology with authentic GK enzymes, which phosphorylate GMP to form GDP. The connection of MAGUK GK domains to guanine nucleotide metabolism is uncertain. Most MAGUKs lack enzymatic activity, although p55, a MAGUK in red blood cells, apparently shows modest GK catalysis (35Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Rather than having robust GK activity MAGUKs are suggested to bind potently to GMP (36Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Li Y. Spangenberg O. Paarmann I. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which may then regulate GK domain interactions. To explore for a regulatory role of GMP on MAGUK function, we have now quantitated GMP binding using a straightforward and sensitive assay, equilibrium dialysis. Surprisingly, we found that MAGUK proteins PSD-95 and CASK fail to interact detectably with GMP, whereas yeast GK (YGK) binds with an affinity of 30 μm. This lack of binding by MAGUKs is explained in part by two residues in the GMP binding pocket of YGK that are not conserved in MAGUK proteins. Mutating these residues in YGK to those in PSD-95 drastically reduces GMP binding by YGK. Conversely, replacing these two residues in PSD-95 with those occupying the identical positions in YGK facilitates GMP binding, albeit of low affinity (∼1 mm), but does not confer GK activity on the double mutant PSD-95 GK domain. This double mutant PSD-95 construct can still properly assemble the SH3 domain as well as bind the exogenous GK ligands GKAP and MAP1A, and these protein binding activities of the double mutant PSD-95 are not competitive with GMP. These studies demonstrate that MAGUK proteins lack detectable GMP binding activity and suggest that other related ligands may associate with the canonical GMP binding pocket in MAGUK proteins. DNA sequences encoding YGK (residues 2–187), rat PSD-95 (SH3GK, residues 417–724; GK, residues 532–711), and rat CASK (SH3GK, residues 591–909) were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into a His6-tagged expression vector (16Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by site-directed PCR-based mutagenesis. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) expressing PSD-95 and YGK constructs were grown in LB to an OD600 = 0.8, induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and sonicated in Buffer A (50 mm NaPO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). His6-tagged proteins were purified from bacterial lysates using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Following incubation with bacterial lysates, resin was extensively washed with 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 6.5), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and subsequently with Buffer A containing 5 and 15 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with Buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole and concentrated with 15 ml Centriprep centrifugal filters (Millipore). Purity was >95% as determined by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Dialysis was performed at room temperature in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 100 mmKCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and different concentrations of GMP ranging from 10 nm to 10 mm. Tracer amounts of [8,3′-3H]GMP (AmershamBiosciences) were included to determine bound and free concentrations of GMP. Samples were collected after 24 h of dialysis, and the content of radioactivity was determined using liquid scintillation. Data were analyzed by nonlinear least square fit to the following equation, Kd=PtLf−LfLbLbEquation 1 where L b and L f are the bound and free GMP concentrations, respectively; P tis the protein concentration, and K d is the dissociation constant. GK activity was measured as described previously by Agarwal et al. (38Agarwal K.C. Miech R.P. Parks Jr., R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of reaction buffer consisted of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm sodium phospho(enol)pyruvate, 0.25 unit of pyruvate kinase, 0.33 unit of lactate dehydrogenase, 150 μmβ-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and 4 mm ATP. To initiate the GK reaction, different amounts of GMP were added to the reaction buffer containing protein, and the rate ofA 340 decay was recorded. Background decay rate of A 340 absorbance was determined by addition of protein to reaction buffer in the absence of GMP and subtracted from total reaction rate. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's protocols. 48 h post-transfection cells were harvested and solubilized in TEEN (100 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA) containing 1% Triton X-100. The soluble fraction was collected following a 20,000 × g spin for 15 min at 4 °C and used for in vitro binding assays. DNA sequences encoding the wild type and mutant PSD-95 GK domains and MAP1A (residues 1861–1930) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The SH3 (residues 417–532) and E-GK-F (residues 523–724) constructs were used as described previously (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the GFP-GKAP construct was subcloned in-frame into the pEGFP-C1 plasmid from a cDNA product kindly provided by M. Sheng (MIT). E. coli strain DH5α expressing the various constructs were grown in LB to OD600 = 0.8, induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and sonicated in MTPBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA). Approximately 20 μg of GST fusion protein was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) beads and washed extensively with MTPBS. Prior to the interaction assays, His6-tagged proteins, COS cell lysate, and coupled GST proteins were incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mm GMP for 1 h at 4 °C. Coupled GST fusion proteins were then incubated with 20 μg of His6-tagged fusion proteins or 80 μl of COS cell lysate for 40 min ± 5 mm GMP at 4 °C and extensively washed with either Buffer A or TEEN ± 5 mm GMP. Retained proteins were eluted with SDS protein loading buffer, separated by PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. We assessed possible binding of [3H]GMP to the SH3GK domain of PSD-95 by equilibrium dialysis. For a typical experiment, we dialyzed SH3GK or YGK at 100 μm protein concentration in a volume of 100 μl against a 1-liter volume of buffer containing [3H]GMP at varying concentrations. When only tracer concentrations of [3H]GMP were present in the buffer (100 nm), the YGK dialysis compartment accumulated [3H]GMP levels 3-fold those in the dialysis buffer. On the other hand, dialysate containing either the SH3GK region of PSD-95 or of CASK showed no increased accumulation of [3H]GMP above that in the dialysis buffer. Previous studies have suggested that the SH3GK domain of PSD-95 binds GMP with an affinity of 300 nm (36Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such an affinity would have yielded counts in the dialysis bag ∼250-fold above those in the dialysis buffer in our experiments containing only tracer levels of [3H]GMP. An affinity as low as 1 mm would have yielded counts in the dialysis bag 10% above those in the buffer, and this would have been detectable. We therefore conclude that the SH3GK domains of PSD-95 and CASK do not bind GMP with affinities <1 mm. Our protein appeared stable during the dialysis, as it was not degraded when evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A), and dialyzed PSD-95 SH3GK was able to specifically interact with GST-MAP1A (data not shown). By varying the concentrations of [3H]GMP in the dialysis buffer, we determined the affinity for YGK to be ∼30 μm(Fig. 1 A and Table I), which is similar to that reported by others (39Li Y. Zhang Y. Yan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28038-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also evaluated GK activity and found that YGK was active with a K m of ∼40 μm, but that neither PSD-95-SH3GK nor CASK-SH3GK showed catalytic activity (Fig. 1 B and Table I).Table ISummary of GMP binding affinity and enzyme kinetics for various YGK and PSD-95 constructsK dK mSpecific activityYGK28.5 μm ± 4.340.6 μm ± 0.11581 ± 39YGK S35P1.2 mm ± 0.32.0 mm ± 0.52.5 ± 0.2YGK S35P/D101S1.1 mm ± 0.32.5 mm ± 0.32.5 ± 0.2SH3GKNDNDNDSH3GK*1.3 mm ± 0.2NDNDSpecific activity is expressed in μmol/min mg, and 95-SH3GK* denotes the PSD-95-SH3GK domain harboring the P564S/S631D mutations.

The SH3 domain structurally flanks the GK domain in MAGUK proteins potentially constraining the GK domain from binding GMP. We therefore expressed the GK domain from PSD-95 alone. Again, we found that the isolated GK domain failed to bind [3H]GMP (Fig.2). A previously published crystal structure of the SH3GK domain of PSD-95 showed that GMP co-crystallized with PSD-95 only in the presence of 100 mm added guanidine (25Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, we found that addition of guanidine did not influence [3H]GMP binding to PSD-95 (Fig. 2). The GK domain of PSD-95 shares 40% sequence identity with YGK (Fig.3 A), and the crystal structures of these domains are similar (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of YGK bound to GMP showed that nine residues from the enzyme make specific contact with the GMP molecule (40Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Seven of these nine residues are conserved in the GK domains of PSD-95 and CASK (Fig. 3,A and B). To test whether these amino acid differences explained the failure of PSD-95 or CASK GK domains to bind GMP, we first mutated one or both of these residues in YGK and evaluated the effects on GMP binding and GK activity. Strikingly, we found that mutation of serine 35 in YGK to proline, which resembles the residue in PSD-95 and is conserved within all PSD-95 members, reduced the affinity for GMP by 40-fold (Table I). This mutation also drastically reduced the guanylate kinase activity nearly 1000-fold (Fig. 4 and Table I). A double mutation of YGK, changing both serine 35 to proline and aspartic acid 101 to serine to mimic that in PSD-95, yielded an enzyme with compromised binding properties (Table I) and GK catalytic activity similar to the single mutation (Fig. 4).Figure 4Mutation of the GMP binding residues of YGK to those in PSD-95 dramatically reduces GK activity. The YGK S35P (open cicles) and S35P/D101S (open triangles) mutants have a significantly higher K m and dramatically reduced velocity compared with the wild type (closed circles) enzyme (note different scales, left axis forclosed symbols and right axis for open symbols). Despite conferring GMP binding to PSD-95, the P564S/S631D mutations (95-SH3GK*) do not produce a catalytically active enzyme (open squares).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These changes suggested that differences at these crucial residues may explain our failure to detect [3H]GMP binding to PSD-95. Therefore, we mutated these residues in the SH3GK domain of PSD-95 to resemble those in YGK. This double mutant of PSD-95 showed very weak binding to GMP (K d = 1.3 mm; Table I). This mutant, however, lacked guanylate kinase activity (Fig. 4). Rather than binding to GMP, PSD-95 interacts with several synaptic proteins, including GKAP/SAPAP (synapse-associated protein-associated protein) (29Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 30Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and MAP1A (26Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the canonical GMP binding pocket in PSD-95 might be the site for interaction with these proteins. To evaluate this possibility, we examined binding of GKAP to PSD-95 GK constructs containing the mutations in the GMP binding pocket that permit low affinity GMP binding. As previously reported, we found that the isolated GK domain of PSD-95 expressed as a GST fusion protein binds to GKAP protein expressed in heterologous cells in a “pull-down” assay. The double mutation of the GK domain of PSD-95 that permits binding to GMP does not abolish binding to GKAP (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, addition of high concentrations of GMP, which bind to this mutant PSD-95 construct, do not compete with GKAP binding, suggesting that GMP and these protein ligands interact noncompetitively (Fig. 5 A). We did similar experiments to evaluate binding of the GK domain of PSD-95 to a GST fusion of MAP1A. Again, we found that mutations that enable PSD-95 to bind GMP do not impair binding to MAP1A and that addition of 5 mm GMP does not disrupt binding of wild type or mutant PSD-95 to MAP1A (Fig. 5 B). We also asked whether the GMP binding site might regulate assembly of the SH3 domain, which mediates the previously observed interaction of the SH3 and GK domains (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As previously reported (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), intermolecular interaction of SH3 and GK domains in vitro is only observed when the SH3 is split and subdomains are expressed in separate molecules (Fig. 5 C). The disrupted SH3 domain does not interact with a complete SH3GK module, because intramolecular assembly is favored (Fig. 5 C). Similarly, an SH3GK construct containing the double mutations in the GMP binding site also preferentially assembled in an intramolecular manner as it failed to bind to the partial SH3 domain. Addition of GMP failed to promote an intermolecular SH3/GK interactions (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the GMP binding site is not involved in assembly of SH3GK modules. This study shows that the GK domains of MAGUK proteins PSD-95 and CASK do not bind to GMP with detectable affinity. This lack of binding is explained in part by two residues that differ between MAGUK proteins and authentic GK enzymes. However, even a PSD-95 protein with “back mutations” to contain these residues shows only weak binding, which suggests that other differences between MAGUK proteins and authentic GK also contribute to the lack of binding. Our study also suggests that the residues involved in GMP binding likely do not contribute to interactions of MAGUK proteins with certain neuronal protein ligands, including GKAP and MAP1A. Previous studies suggested that MAGUK proteins bind to GMP with very high affinity (36Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Li Y. Spangenberg O. Paarmann I. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One study showed that full-length PSD-95 as a GST fusion protein bound to a Cibacron blue dye column and could be eluted from such a column with 1 μm GMP (36Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We repeated those experiments and indeed found that PSD-95 either expressed in bacteria or from brain extracts does bind to a Cibacron blue dye column. However, we were unable to elute PSD-95 with concentrations of GMP up to 1 mm (data not shown). Reasons for this discrepancy are unclear; it is conceivable that differences in the Cibacron blue preparation might explain the disparate results. Another study used equilibrium dialysis and found that the GK region of CASK binds to [3H]GMP with an affinity of 300 nm(37Li Y. Spangenberg O. Paarmann I. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This high affinity, which is 100-fold greater than that of YGK for GMP, is very difficult to reconcile with our results. Unfortunately, the binding reported in that study (37Li Y. Spangenberg O. Paarmann I. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was presented as “data not shown,” so it is impossible for us to compare our conditions with theirs. Conceivably, the GK constructs used in our study could have failed to bind GMP, because they were inactivated during purification. We feel this is unlikely for three reasons. First, our proteins migrated as single bands by SDS-PAGE and were not degraded during the dialysis experiments. Second, we used very mild conditions for purification of these proteins from bacteria. Third, our GK constructs retained binding to other ligands such as GKAP and MAP1A. Another possibility is that GMP may have been tightly bound to our constructs purified from bacteria; therefore, the site would have been unavailable for binding to exogenous GMP. This is also unlikely because the SH3GK protein used here is identical to that which we previously crystallized and found no GMP in the canonical binding site (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of GK domains from PSD-95 and CASK have yielded ambiguous results concerning GMP binding (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For all three published structures, GMP did not co-purify with the GK domain from bacteria and was not found in the native structure. Attempts to co-crystallize CASK with added GMP were unsuccessful (37Li Y. Spangenberg O. Paarmann I. Konrad M. Lavie A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4159-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For PSD-95, co-crystallization with GMP was achieved only in the presence of 100 mm guanidine (25Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), an additive screened to obtain high quality crystals. Indeed, a guanidine bound near the GMP and formed one of the crucial hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group of GMP and with an Asp residue from a crystallographically related GK molecule (25Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Based on these results and our new findings, GMP binding in the crystal likely occurred as a result of the crystallization conditions and likely has no biological relevance. Rather than binding GMP, the GK domain of MAGUK proteins associate with specific protein ligands such as GKAP (29Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As no crystal structure has yet been solved for a MAGUK bound to a protein ligand, the binding site(s) for these protein ligands remain(s) uncertain. One reasonable location would be the crevice into which GMP sits in the structure of YGK. Our experiments suggest that this is not the site for binding to MAP1A or GKAP. That is, mutation of two residues in this binding pocket that produces weak binding to GMP do not abolish binding to MAP1A or GKAP. Furthermore, adding high concentrations of GMP to these mutants, which should occupy the nucleotide binding site, does not prevent additional contemporaneous binding of MAP1A or GKAP. This does not exclude the possibility that MAP1A and GKAP interactions are not disrupted, because the GMP binding affinity is too low to efficiently compete. Future structural studies of MAGUK proteins complexed with ligands would seem essential to determine decisively binding sites for these protein partners. Why might the GK structure be so tightly conserved in MAGUK proteins? This conservation includes all four residues that coordinate the phosphate of GMP and three of five residues that bind the guanine base. This may suggest that MAGUK proteins interact with a distinct phosphorylated nucleotide or even a phosphorylated residue from a polypeptide. Our results here showing that back mutations of the residues in PSD-95 that differ from GK restore weak binding suggests that MAGUK proteins may have lost their ability to bind GMP in favor of a distinct ligand. In addition to binding exogenous ligands, the SH3 and GK domains of MAGUK proteins mediate a unique intramolecular association (31McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3580-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This SH3/GK interaction actually reflects assembly of the unique MAGUK SH3 domain, which has a peculiar pair of β-strands that surround the GK domain (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Tavares G.A. Panepucci E.H. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1313-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this assembly of MAGUK SH3 domains can occur in both an intramolecular as well as an intermolecular fashion and can thereby mediate a regulated oligomerization of MAGUK proteins (32Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol.

It is unlikely that residues of the NBD are directly involved in intermolecular assembly, as the GK double mutant retains the ability to interact with the SH3 domain (data not shown). Instead, this swapping between monomer and MAGUK oligomer may be regulated by protein interactions or increased rigidity of the HOOK insert within the SH3 domain (24McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O.

Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that conformational changes associated with binding sites in the GK domain of MAGUKs could also induce oligomerization. Although biochemical functions for the SH3GK region of MAGUK proteins remain uncertain, genetic studies indicate that this region is critical for MAGUK function (2Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 97-111PubMed Google Scholar, 5Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A single point mutation in the SH3 domain ofDrosophila discs large yields a lethal phenotype, as do small truncations in the GK domain (5Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Furthermore, truncations of the GK domain of lin-2 in C. elegans cause a vulvaless phenotype (2Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 97-111PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations all disrupt the previously identified SH3/GK interaction, suggesting a critical role for that mode of protein assembly (31McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17431-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whether the largely conserved GMP binding pocket also is essential for MAGUK protein function has not yet been investigated at the genetic level. Future biochemical and genetic studies of this region are warranted. Also critical will be to determine whether another nucleotide or other phosphorylated molecule occupies this pocket and how this binding controls MAGUK protein function. We thank A. McGee, S. Dakoji, and K. Moore for discussions and technical help."

In order to obtain more information about this role, the study of the effect of zinc on several properties of the visual photoreceptor rhodopsin has been investigated. A specific effect of Zn2+ on the thermal stability of rhodopsin, obtained from bovine retinas and solubilized in dodecyl maltoside detergent, in the dark is reported. The thermal stability of rhodopsin in its ground state (dark state) is clearly reduced with increasing Zn2+ concentrations (0–50 μmZn2+). The thermal bleaching process is accelerated in the presence of Zn2+ with k rate constants, at 55 °C, of 0.028 ± 0.002 min−1 (0 μmZn2+) and 0.056 ± 0.003 min−1 (50 μm Zn2+), corresponding tot 12 values of 24.4 ± 1.6 min and 11.8 ± 0.1 min, respectively.

Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor protein of the vertebrate retina (1Hargrave P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pepe I.M. Prog. Retin.

It is the main protein component of the rod outer segments (ROS) of the retinal photoreceptor cells, and its easy isolation from bovine retinas has made of this receptor a widely used model for the GPCR superfamily. Rhodopsin is a key molecule in the biochemistry of vision and alterations in its sequence have been associated with retinal disease. In particular, a high number of mutations in the opsin gene have been associated with the autosomal form of the retinal degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa (7Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1197-2000PubMed Google Scholar, 8Farrar G.J. Kenna P.F. Humphries P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A number of factors have been proposed to be related to retinal function, and among them a possible role for Zn2+ in the retina and its metabolism has been proposed (9Wu S.M. Qiao X. Noebels J.L. Yang X.L. Vis. Res. 1993; 33: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Zn2+ is present at particularly high concentrations in the retina (10Ugarte M. Osborne N.N. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) being a component of the disc membranes in the rod outer segments of the photoreceptor cells (11McCormick L.D. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Zn2+ has been histochemically localized to ROS (12Hirayama Y. Acta Histochem. 1990; 89: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and it has been shown to copurify with ROS proteins as well (13Tam S.W. Wilber K.E. Wagner F.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite this presence, the role of Zn2+ in the visual cycle and specifically in its interaction with rhodopsin remains unclear. Zn2+ is required for the function of numerous proteins, serving both as a part of the active site in, for example, metalloenzymes, and acting to stabilize protein domains, such as the Zn2+ finger-binding motif in transcription factors (14Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The structure of many Zn2+-binding sites is known from x-ray crystallography of Zn2+-binding proteins and, thus, the geometry of the interaction between Zn2+ and different coordinating residues is well characterized (14Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This, together with the small size of the zinc (II) ion, makes artificially generated Zn2+-binding sites a highly useful approach for probing structure-function relationships in proteins. In GPCRs, for example, construction of bis-His Zn2+-binding sites has led to important information about both the organization of the transmembrane helices and their movements during receptor activation to be obtained (16Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17He B. Zhang Y. Wang H.R. Zhour H.M. J.

Therefore, engineered Zn2+ binding sites created by site-directed mutagenesis is an interesting tool for probing intramolecular interactions in these types of receptors (23Schetz J.A. Sibley D.R. Wess J. Structure-Function Analysis of G Protein-coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 121-140Google Scholar). Particularly in the case of rhodopsin, important structural information about helical orientation, connectivities, and the conformational change upon light activation, has been obtained from engineered Zn2+-binding sites in this visual photoreceptor (19Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). There is experimental evidence indicating the presence of naturally occurring Zn2+-binding sites in several GPCR proteins. These include the dopamine transporter (24Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), D1 dopamine receptor (25Schetz J.A. Sibley D.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1990-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and all D2-like dopamine receptors: D2L, D3, and D4 (26Schetz J.A. Chu A. Sibley D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar). Molecules participating in the visual phototransduction process are already known to have Zn2+-binding sites, including rhodopsin (27Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Conly D.C. Farber D.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6αβ) (28He F. Seryhev A.B. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20572-20577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Previous reports showed direct Zn2+ binding to rhodopsin, both in ROS membranes and in detergent-solubilized-purified protein systems, by means of 65Zn competition binding experiments, indicating that there may be coordination sites for Zn2+ in native rhodopsin (27Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Conly D.C. Farber D.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This binding occurs in the dark and it increases upon illumination of the protein (27Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Conly D.C. Farber D.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Also, previous reports indicated that Zn2+ enhanced azido-[α-32P]ATP binding to rat ROS, suggesting a structural effect of Zn2+ on rhodopsin (29Shuster T.A. Maring F. Nagy A.K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Four Zn2+ were included in the crystal structure of rhodopsin at 2.8-Å resolution (30Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar, 31Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Recently this crystal structure was refined, and seven Zn2+ were identified, three per monomer and one which was at a boundary region of the two monomers forming the unit cell of the crystal, as well as water molecules that would play a functional role in rhodopsin activation (32Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Four of these ions are located in the intradiscal domain of the receptor. Although these binding sites occur under crystallization conditions, they also provide evidence for direct Zn2+binding to rhodopsin. In the present study we have undertaken the study of the Zn2+ effect on rhodopsin structure and stability, by taking advantage of the proposed endogenous Zn2+-binding sites in the receptor. We find a clear specific effect of Zn2+ on the thermal stability of rhodopsin when compared with other metal ions tested. At the same time we can also see an effect for this metal ion on several properties of rhodopsin like pigment regeneration and metarhodopsin II (MetaII) stability. The results obtained indicate that Zn2+ clearly reduces the thermal stability and regeneration of rhodopsin in detergent solubilized form and in ROS membranes. These results suggest that Zn2+ binding to rhodopsin results in specific effects on the structure and stability of the receptor. This effect alone may not be accountable for the physiological role proposed for Zn2+ in visual function. Other effects like those related to increased rhodopsin phosphorylation, or the proposed effect upon other proteins of the visual phototransduction cascade, or upon some component of the retinoid cycle, may also play a role in vivo. Bovine retinas were from J. A. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) detergent was from Anatrace (Maumee, Ohio, USA). 11-cis-Retinal was a gift from Prof. P. P. Philippov (Moscow State University). Water used for buffer preparation was Milli-Q (Millipore) quality and was received with 10–18 mΩ. Traces of zinc were detected using a polarographic instrument (Metrohm Ltd., Herisau, Switzerland). The zinc concentration was determined to be <5 × 10−2μm by the inverse voltammetric (anodic stripping) method, using the hanging mercury drop electrode. ROS membranes were prepared under dim red light from frozen bovine retinas using a sucrose gradient method. The membranes were suspended in isolation buffer (buffer A): 70 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 6.9) and pelleted by centrifugation. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (hypotonic buffer). Two alternating washes with these buffers were carried out to decrease the amount of any further contaminating proteins. Finally, ROS membranes were split in several aliquots and stored in the dark at −20 °C. Typically, 1 mg of ROS membranes was solubilized in 2 ml of buffer A containing 1% DM. Solubilization was done at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h (33Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The solution was then centrifuged for 30 min in a T865 Sorvall rotor at 30000 rpm, and the supernatant was used for the assays as solubilized rhodopsin (Rho). Rho was usually stored in the dark at 4 °C or kept at −20 °C for long term storage. Rho concentration was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient value ε500 of 40,600 m−1 cm−1, and a molecular weight of 40,000 Da. The preparations showed UV/vis absorbance ratios (A 280/A 500) in the 1.8–2.0 range. Zinc binding to Rho was carried out in the dark. Rho was diluted with 20 mm HEPES, containing 145 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.012% DM in the spectrophotometric cuvette to a final DM concentration of 0.02% DM. These preparations were monitored by UV/vis spectroscopy. A stock solution of 1 m ZnCl2 was prepared in the same dilution buffer. Small aliquots of the stock zinc solution were added to obtain the final desired zinc concentration in the sample. The sample was then incubated for 1 h at 15 °C or 20 °C in the dark, and it was monitored by recording UV/vis spectra at 5-min intervals over cycle mode to ensure that there was no spectral change with time. The procedure for the control experiments was the same, but zinc addition was omitted. Sample preparation for ROS rhodopsin in membranes (unsolubilized samples) was carried out essentially as described for the detergent-solubilized samples. Other metal ions (Ca2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+) were assayed as chloride salts to rule out unspecific charge effects. In these cases, sample preparation was carried out in the same way as with zinc. Choline was used as a control model compound to completely rule out the possible unspecific electrostatic nature of the observed effects. All measurements were made on a Cary 1E spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia), equipped with water-jacketed cuvette holders connected to a circulating water bath. Temperature was controlled by a Peltier accessory connected to the spectrophotometer. All spectra were recorded, in the 250–650-nm range, with a bandwidth of 2 mm, a response time of 0.1 s, and scan speed of 250 nm/min. The protein sample binding reaction was carried out in the spectrophotometric cuvette during 1 h at 20 °C and was monitored by UV/vis spectroscopy as described above. These reaction samples were used for photobleaching, thermal stability, and regeneration experiments. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Fourth derivative spectra were obtained, from five absorption spectra coadded to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, by using the Savitzsky-Golay algorithm and 200 points with the Grams/32 software (Galactic Industries). Samples were bleached with a 150 watt power source equipped with an optic fiber guide and using a 495 nm cut-off filter. Dark-adapted Rho samples with 50 and 100 μm zinc or without zinc were illuminated for 10 s to ensure complete photoconversion to 380-nm absorbing species. Acidification was carried out, immediately after photobleaching, by addition of 2 nH2SO4 to a final pH of 1.9 (1% of the sample volume), and after 2 min to allow for stabilization an absorption spectrum was recorded. In the case of the photobleaching efficiency experiments, dark-adapted Rho samples with 100 μm zinc or without zinc were illuminated with subsaturating light (with a 25 watt light source and a distance between the sample and the light source of 5 cm) at 5-s intervals. Immediately at the end of each bleaching interval, changes in the absorption spectra were recorded until complete photobleaching was achieved (complete disappearance of the 500-nm chromophoric band). The formation of MetaIII was measured, after Rho illumination for 60 s (saturating illumination), in the presence of different zinc concentrations or without zinc (control) at 15 °C. Complete absorption spectra in the range studied were recorded starting immediately after illumination and at 2.5-min intervals thereafter. MetaIII formation was monitored at A 480. All absorbance values were normalized to the same initialA 500 nm before photoconversion. Rho thermal stability in the dark was followed by monitoring the rate of A 500loss, and the appearance of A 380 as a function of time, at constant temperature. Rho, in the presence of 5, 15, 30, 50, 100, and 200 μm zinc, or in the absence of zinc (control), was thermally bleached in the dark at 55 °C. The process was carried out in a similar way as previously described (34Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) over 3 h. Complete absorption spectra were recorded at 5 min intervals. Other experiments, using the same conditions but with 50 μm calcium and other metal ions, were performed to rule out a possible unspecific charge effect. Thermodynamic parameters for the dark thermal bleaching process were determined as a function of temperature. This method regards thermal bleaching as an irreversible process (34Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic parameters E a, ΔG ‡, ΔH ‡, and ΔS ‡ were calculated from the decay rate constants versus 1/T (Arrhenius plot) using the values for the slopes of these plots, which were derived from least-squares analysis. For this purpose, Rho samples in the dark and in the presence of 50 μm zinc (or without zinc in the control sample) were thermally bleached in the dark at different temperatures in the range of 53 to 58 °C. The regeneration of Rho was carried at 15 °C in the dark. 11-cis-Retinal in an ethanolic stock solution was added to a 2.5-fold molar excess over dark Rho in the presence of 50, 100, and 200 μm zinc or without zinc (control). Then, the sample was illuminated for 60 s (light-saturated), and absorption spectra were immediately recorded at 2.5-min cycles over 4 h. Rho regeneration rate was monitored at 500 nm. Samples were eventually acidified to confirm the presence of Schiff base-linked species. Regeneration experiments were also carried out with ROS rhodopsin samples essentially in the same way as for the detergent-solubilized samples. The presence of Zn2+, at a concentration of 200 μm, did not affect the spectral properties of rhodopsin in the dark or in the light (Fig. 1). The characteristic 500-nm visible chromophoric band remained unchanged in the Zn2+ containing sample (compare Fig. 1, A and B). The presence of Zn2+ did not interfere with the ability of rhodopsin to form the 380-nm band, corresponding to the MetaII intermediate, upon illumination under light-saturating conditions (Fig. 1 B) indicating the same photobleaching behavior than the non-zinc containing sample (Fig. 1 A). In both cases the presence of a protonated Schiff base linkage was detected by acidification of the illuminated samples, with the corresponding shift of the band to 440 nm, confirming that the 380-nm band can be attributed to the MetaII species, and indicating that the protonation status of the Schiff base linkage was not affected by Zn2+ (Fig. 1 B). These results are in agreement with studies using wild-type recombinant rhodopsin in which even in the presence of 5 mmZn2+ similar results were obtained (19Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), suggesting that the rhodopsin-Zn2+ complex is functional, although some differences in the transducin activation ability were detected in the presence of zinc (19Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The photobleaching efficiency is not altered by zinc when rhodopsin is illuminated with subsaturating light intensities (Fig. 2 A). However, MetaIII formation is decreased in the presence of zinc when compared with the non-zinc-containing sample (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, when Rho samples are acidified at different times after photobleaching a 2-fold decrease under the studied conditions in the MetaII stability can be detected (the determined t 12 values are 30 and 15 min in the absence and in the presence of Zn2+, respectively).Figure 2Time-course of rhodopsin photobleaching and MetaIII photoproduct formation. A, relative photobleaching of rhodopsin in the absence (○) and in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+ (●). Samples were illuminated with subsaturating light at 5-s intervals, and the decay of the band at 500 nm was then recorded as a function of time. B, MetaIII formation was measured at 480 nm in the absence (○) and in the presence of 200 μm Zn2+ (●). Rhodopsin samples were illuminated for 10 s using >495-nm light and 150 watts. UV/vis scans were recorded at 15 °C in the dark each 2.5 min, and the absorbance at 480 nm was normalized to the initialA 500 nm before illumination. Values are mean ± S.E. of experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fourth derivative spectroscopy allows separation of the different electronic components corresponding to Phe, Tyr, and Trp residues in proteins. This allows a detailed analysis of the structural environment of these aromatic amino acids to be performed (35Padrós E. Duñach M. Morros A. Sabés M. Mañosa J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 508-510Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fourth derivative represents the best compromise between the best resolution and the best signal-to-noise ratio (35Padrós E. Duñach M. Morros A. Sabés M. Mañosa J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 508-510Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This technique has been successfully applied to the study of conformational changes in native and recombinant proteins (36Mombelli E. Afshar M. Fusi P. Mariani M. Tortora P. Connelly J.P. Lange R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8733-8742Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). No significant differences were detected in the fourth derivative UV spectra of rhodopsin in the dark upon Zn2+ addition to the sample (Fig. 3, A and Band Table I). The wavelengths of the fourth derivative peaks at 285.6 and 292.2 nm and troughs at 289.0 and 295.5 nm remained unchanged upon zinc addition to the sample (compare a traces in Fig. 3, A and B; see Table I). However, some differences were detected after illumination of the control rhodopsin sample in the absence of zinc (compare a and c traces in Fig. 3 A; see Table I). These differences were increased when Zn2+was present in the sample (compare Fig. 3, A andB; see Table I) with larger blue-shifts in the 275–300-nm region and increased intensity changes in some of the bands. In contrast, peaks in the 240–275 nm underwent only minor changes when compared with the spectra of the non-zinc-containing samples.Table IChanges in Tyr and Trp environmentλ (nm)ControlZincDarkLightΔλDarkLightΔλnmnmλmaxTyr285.6285.10.5285.6284.80.8λminTyr289.0288.40.6289.0288.10.9λmaxTyr-Trp292.2291.70.5292.2291.50.7λminTrp295.5295.10.4295.5294.90.6The wavelength for the maximum and minimum peak values (λmaxand λmin) were obtained from UV fourth derivative spectra (see Fig. 3). Tyr and Trp residues of rhodopsin (control, in the absence of Zn2+) in the dark and after bleaching have different wavelength location reflecting a blue-shift (Δλ). In the presence of Zn2+ (200 μm Zn2+), these peaks become further blue-shifted reflecting changes in Tyr and Trp residues of rhodopsin to a more polar environment. Open table in a new tab The wavelength for the maximum and minimum peak values (λmaxand λmin) were obtained from UV fourth derivative spectra (see Fig. 3). Tyr and Trp residues of rhodopsin (control, in the absence of Zn2+) in the dark and after bleaching have different wavelength location reflecting a blue-shift (Δλ). In the presence of Zn2+ (200 μm Zn2+), these peaks become further blue-shifted reflecting changes in Tyr and Trp residues of rhodopsin to a more polar environment. The thermal stability of Rho in the presence of different concentrations of Zn2+ was determined at 55 °C in the dark. The kinetics of the thermal bleaching process of rhodopsin in the dark was spectroscopically monitored by measuring the decay of the 500-nm chromophoric band at constant temperature (55 °C) as a function of time (Fig. 4 A). At this temperature, a progressive faster decay of this band was observed as a function of Zn2+ concentration with regard to the control sample without Zn2+. This reflects a decrease in the thermal stability of rhodopsin in its ground state (dark state) with increasing Zn2+ concentrations. Thus, the thermal process is accelerated in the presence of Zn2+ withk rate constants of 0.028 ± 0.002 min−1(control, 0 μm Zn2+) and 0.056 ± 0.003 min−1 at 50 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 4 A, inset). It corresponds to thermal bleaching processes with t 12 values of 24.4 ± 1.6 min and 11.8 ± 0.1 min, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters derived from Arrhenius plots obtained from experiments performed at different temperatures (Fig. 4 B) are shown in Table II. Activation energy (E a), and the ΔH ‡component were significantly increased (by about 58%) for the thermal bleaching process of rhodopsin in the presence of Zn2+. A ΔG ‡ decrease of 17% was also observed in the presence of Zn2+. In the case of the entropic component, this showed an increase of about 63% in the zinc-containing sample.Table IIThermodynamic parameters for the thermal bleaching of rhodopsinParameterNo zinc (Control)Zinc (50 μm)Kcal/molE a99.09 ± 0.06156.18 ± 0.20*ΔH‡98.44 ± 0.05155.53 ± 0.19*ΔG‡5.74 ± 0.034.77 ± 0.04*ΔS‡ (10−3)282.62 ± 0.06460.00 ± 0.09*These parameters were determined from experiments in the absence and in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+.

Open table in a new tab These parameters were determined from experiments in the absence and in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+. TheEa parameter was determined using values from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 4 B), which were derived from least-squares analysis.

These parameters were significantly different for the Zn2+-rhodopsin complex (*,p < 0.05). The previous experiments were done with Rho samples. We also performed similar experiments with rhodopsin in its native membrane environment (ROS membranes). Although rhodopsin in membranes is more stable than Rho (compare Fig. 5 and Fig. 4 A), a decrease in stability is also observed upon addition of 100 μm zinc when compared with the sample with no zinc added (the t 12 derived for the process is 121.6 min in the absence of zinc and 53.0 min in the presence of 100 μm zinc) (Fig. 5). In order to assess the presumed specificity of zinc on the thermal stability of rhodopsin several other metal divalent cations were tested. To this aim the decrease of the visible band at 500 nm with time was recorded as a measure of the thermal stability of the protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results indicate that in the presence of Cd2+, Co2+, and Ca2+ the thermal stability of rhodopsin was similar to that of rhodopsin alone (Fig. 6). Among the different metal ions tested, only Cu2+ showed a significant effect with a similar decay to that observed in the case of Zn2+. This result is in agreement with the reported ability of Cu2+ to compete with Zn2+ for rhodopsin binding, both in membranes and in purified form in detergent (27Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Conly D.C. Farber D.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also tested the model compound choline to rule out a mere possible electrostatic effect. Choline increased the thermal stability of rhodopsin and this effect could be related to interactions of the molecule with rhodopsin micelles. The effect of zinc on pigment regeneration with 11-cis-retinal after rhodopsin photobleaching is shown in Fig. 7 A. A clear decrease is observed for maximal rhodopsin regeneration with increasing zinc concentration. This decrease is about 30% at 200 μmadded zinc. Higher zinc concentrations tested indicated further reduction of the regeneration percentage (to very low regeneration level), but the corresponding values could not be reliably obtained due to a high aggregation propensity of the samples with time. Regeneration experiments carried out with rhodopsin in ROS membranes (non-solubilized samples, Fig. 7 B) indicated a similar behavior to that found for Rho samples (compare Fig. 7, Aand B). In the case of ROS membranes the maximal regeneration observed was slightly lower than that observed for the Rho samples, but the effect of zinc addition was comparable. Previous studies have reported specific Zn2+ binding to purified rhodopsin and disc membranes in both dark and light conditions (27Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Conly D.C. Farber D.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Shuster T.A. Maring F. Nagy A.K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Zn2+ was shown to enhance rhodopsin phosphorylation (29Shuster T.A. Maring F. Nagy A.K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Structurally bound zinc has been also found in the recent crystal structure of rhodopsin (30Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T.

A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Despite these reports, a detailed study of the effect of Zn2+ on rhodopsin properties has not been previously reported. We find a clear effect of zinc on several rhodopsin properties. Our spectroscopic results indicate that zinc does not alter the retinal binding pocket of rhodopsin and the formation of the MetaII intermediate. Also, the status of the protonated Schiff base is not affected by the presence of zinc ions. Under physiological conditions, inactive dark state rhodopsin changes almost entirely to the active MetaII conformation upon photon absorption. In vitro there is an equilibrium between the MetaI and MetaII conformations that is modulated by several experimental conditions (37Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5054-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 39Lamola A.A. Yamane T. Zipp A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Baldwin P.A. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2624-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that this equilibrium is also influenced by salts, which shift the equilibrium to the MetaII side (41Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 42Delange F. Merkx M. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Pistorius A.M. DeGrip W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Vogel R. Fan G.-B. Sheves M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In our case and under our experimental conditions, zinc does not seem to alter the MetaI-MetaII equilibrium. We find that the MetaII intermediate of the Zn2+-rhodopsin complex formed upon illumination is destabilized, and MetaIII formation is reduced. These two facts could be reconciled if we assume as a likely interpretation that the faster MetaII decay is also accompanied by direct formation of opsin and free all-trans-retinal (without going through a MetaIII intermediate). Detailed analysis of the fourth derivative results indicates small but significant differences as a consequence of illuminating the rhodopsin sample. Changes in the amplitude of the fourth derivative peaks together with blue-shifts of their maxima can be interpreted as reflecting exposure of Trp and Tyr residues to a more hydrophilic microenvironment upon the rhodopsin-MetaII conformational transition. This is consistent with previous studies on UV photobleaching difference absorption spectra of ROS rhodopsin (44Rafferty C.N. Mullenberg C.G. Shichi H. Biochemistry. 1980; 32: 2145-2151Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and rhodopsin tryptophan mutants (45Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic differences observed upon rhodopsin photobleaching are increased, mainly in the Tyr-Trp region, when Zn2+ is present in the illuminated sample. The observed effect suggests differential Zn2+ binding to dark and illuminated rhodopsin. Zinc ions found in the crystal structure of rhodopsin are mainly located at the intradiscal side of the protein (32Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In particular, one of these zinc ions is located close to Tyr-96 in chain B of the receptor (32Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic parameters measure macroscopic changes representing the sum of all reaction events of the Zn2+-rhodopsin complex formation. The thermal bleaching process is accompanied by a decrease in ΔG ‡ and an increase in ΔH ‡ and ΔS ‡ for the Zn2+-containing samples when compared with the values in the absence of Zn2+. Changes in enthalpy can be interpreted as reflecting conformational changes, and entropy effects can be interpreted as a reordering of water molecules as proposed previously (23Schetz J.A. Sibley D.R. Wess J. Structure-Function Analysis of G Protein-coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 121-140Google Scholar, 24Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar interpretation has been provided for the binding of zinc to the D2-like dopamine receptor. In this latter case, the fact that the reaction was entropy driven suggested that zinc was essentially chelated by dopamine receptors, possibly resulting in the reordering of hydrogen bonds (23Schetz J.A. Sibley D.R. Wess J. Structure-Function Analysis of G Protein-coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 121-140Google Scholar). Thermodynamic changes could reflect a structural rearrangement of native rhodopsin, during the formation of the Zn2+-rhodopsin complex, without affecting the retinal binding pocket and the protonated Schiff base linkage in the dark state of rhodopsin. The observed effect, reflecting reordering of water molecules, may be significant in the case of rhodopsin where a functional role for water molecules has been recently proposed (32Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In this latter study more than ten water molecules are found structurally associated with each one of the two monomers, and two of these water molecules are in the intradiscal domain of the receptor, where four of the seven zinc atoms are located (32Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The preceding section of the discussion has dealt with results obtained with Rho (rhodopsin solubilized in DM detergent). However, it is known that rhodopsin is more stable in native ROS membranes than in detergent-solubilized form. Thus, it could be possible that the effect observed with Rho would be different when rhodopsin was assayed in disc membranes. Our results show that, although the rhodopsin samples are more stable in membranes, the differential effect found in the case of the zinc-containing sample is maintained, i.e. rhodopsin in membranes with zinc has lower thermal stability than control samples without zinc. Furthermore, the same behavior is detected in the case of the pigment regeneration experiments. In that case the reduction in rhodopsin regeneration induced by zinc is also observed when rhodopsin is found in its native membrane. These findings argue for the physiological relevance of the results obtained. A structural effect of Zn2+ on rhodopsin was also detected in a previous study, using engineered Zn2+-binding sites. In this case Zn2+ binding to wild-type recombinant rhodopsin resulted in a somewhat reduced transducin activation (19Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We find that zinc specifically alters several rhodopsin properties: a definite reduction in thermal stability of ground state dark rhodopsin, reduced stability of the active MetaII conformation, altered pathway of photointermediates after MetaII formation, and reduced pigment regeneration with 11-cis-retinal. These effects are accompanied by conformational changes of the protein that are shown to be specific of zinc and not of other divalent metal ions studied. The effect of zinc on retinal function seems to strongly depend on the local concentration and the ratio of free to bound cation (10Ugarte M. Osborne N.N. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The proposed effect of Zn2+ on visual function may be also related to effects upon other proteins of the visual phototransduction cascade (28He F. Seryhev A.B. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20572-20577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or upon some component of the retinoid cycle. Furthermore, the proposed increase in rhodopsin phosphoylation caused by Zn2+ (29Shuster T.A. Maring F. Nagy A.K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) could be also related to other processes, like receptor internalization, necessary for its recycling, thus changing the normal turnover of the receptor in the membrane.

We focused on the sequence around the 9-amino acid region deleted in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (Ala-400 to Ala-408), which gives rise to nonfunctional band 3, and also on the portion of the protein N-terminal to the transmembrane domain (amino acids 361–396). We examined the effects of mutations in these regions on endoplasmic reticulum insertion (using cell-free translation), chloride transport, and cell-surface movement in Xenopus oocytes. We found that the hydrophobic length of TM1 was critical for membrane insertion and that formation of a transport-active structure also depended on the presence of specific amino acid sequences in TM1.

The red cell anion exchanger (band 3, AE1) is composed of two distinct domains: a C-terminal transmembrane domain predicted to span the membrane up to 14 times and a N-terminal cytosolic domain (1Tanner M.J.

SAO is prevalent in areas where malaria is endemic (8Serjeantson S. Bryson K. Amato D. Babona D. Hum.

Blood. 1995; 85: 2929-2936Google Scholar) indicate that the SAO deletion results in the misfolding of the transmembrane domain. The α-helical content of band 3 SAO is similar to normal band 3 (15Sarabia V.E. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10676-10680Google Scholar, 18Moriyama R. Ideguchi H. Lombardo C.R. Van Dort H.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25792-25797Google Scholar), but the transmembrane helices of band 3 SAO are disorganized while remaining folded (18Moriyama R. Ideguchi H. Lombardo C.R. Van Dort H.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25792-25797Google Scholar). Transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) of SAO band 3 does not insert into microsomes in an alkali-stable fashion, unlike TM1 of normal band 3 (19Chambers E.J. Bloomberg G.B. Ring S.M. Tanner M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1289-1307Google Scholar). However, TMs 1–3 and larger fragments of SAO band 3 are incorporated stably into microsomal membranes. Lys-430, which is located in the first extracellular loop of band 3 between TM1 and TM2, is labeled with eosin maleimide in normal band 3, but not in SAO band 3 (18Moriyama R. Ideguchi H. Lombardo C.R. Van Dort H.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25792-25797Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the TM1–5 region of band 3 SAO is misfolded. However, other data indicate that the gross topology and structure of band 3 SAO between TMs 5 and 6 and TMs 7 and 8 is similar to normal band 3 (15Sarabia V.E. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol.

Recent studies show that band 3 SAO has a dominant structural effect on normal band 3 in SAO membranes, altering the structure of all the normal band 3 molecules (20Kuma H. Abe Y. Askin D. Bruce L.J. Hamasaki T. Tanner M.J. Hamasaki N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3311-3320Google Scholar). The structural changes are transmitted throughout the normal band 3 molecules. The structures of domains encompassing TMs 1–5, TMs 13 and 14, the fourth and sixth extracellular loops, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth cytoplasmic loops are all altered (20Kuma H. Abe Y. Askin D. Bruce L.J. Hamasaki T. Tanner M.J. Hamasaki N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3311-3320Google Scholar). The SAO deletion is situated within the region of band 3 that acts as a signal sequence for insertion of TM1 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. A NMR study of synthetic peptides encompassing the region of the SAO deletion showed that the SAO deletion leads to formation of an α-helix with only 8 contiguous hydrophobic residues, too short to stably insert into the ER membrane (19Chambers E.J. Bloomberg G.B. Ring S.M. Tanner M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1289-1307Google Scholar). The study also indicated that Pro-403 was at the N-terminal end of the α-helix forming TM1 of normal band 3. The region immediately preceding Pro-403 also had helical character. Spectroscopic studies on synthetic peptides incorporated into either micelles or liposomes also indicate that the region encompassing the SAO deletion has a high degree of structure (21Kuma H. Inoue K. Fu G. Ando S. Lee S. Sugihara G. Hamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 509-518Google Scholar). In this study, we performed an extensive mutational analysis of the region of band 3 within and around the SAO region. Our results highlight three critical factors controlling both the insertion of TM1, and the assembly of a transport-active band 3 molecule. First, the hydrophobic length of TM1 is critical for correct insertion of TM1 into membranes, and specific amino acid sequences in TM1 are critical for the formation of a transport-active structure. Second, individual amino acid residues at the interface between the cytoplasmic domain and TM1 are not essential for band 3 activity, and deletions of two or three amino acids, which include Pro-403, retain transport activity provided that a polar residue is located 2 or 3 amino acids C-terminal to Asp-399. Third, we show that mutation of the basic cluster R387RR to AAA has no effect on band 3 chloride transport. Surprisingly, deletion of the sequence G381LVRD more distal from TM1 at the cytoplasmic membrane surface abolished anion transport. We suggest that this sequence (in conjunction with other cytoplasmic loops of band 3) makes an essential contribution to the structure of the anion transport site of band 3. DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–518 and 375–518 (with an additional N-terminal methionine to act as translational initiator) of band 3 and the reporter domain of mutant prolactin, either without (PL) or with an N-glycosylation site (gPL) (22Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Google Scholar), were amplified by PCR. The band 3 fragments were digested with NcoI and XhoI, and the prolactin fragment was digested with XhoI and XbaI. The fragments were subcloned into the pCITE2b vector (Novagen) usingNcoI and XbaI to create the band 3-prolactin chimeras. The SAO and mutant constructs were made using the previously described method of overlap extension (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). Constructs containing internal N-glycosylation sites either between transmembrane spans 3 and 4 (375–484-G loop-485–518-PL, with an additional N-terminal methionine to act as translational initiator) or between transmembrane spans 1 and 2 (1–432-G loop-433–518-PL) were made by inserting a fragment encoding amino acids Ile-627 to Pro-660 of band 3 (the fourth extracellular loop including Asn-642, theN-glycosylation site of band 3; termed the G loop) between Leu-484 and Glu-485 or between Arg-432 and Asn-433 respectively. The construct containing a trileucine insertion within the central region of transmembrane span 1 (417LLL), was made by inserting a fragment encoding the insertion into 1–432-gPL SAO between Leu-417 and Ser-418. The constructs pBSXG1.b3 and pBSXG.GPA have been described previously (24Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Google Scholar). They contain the cDNAs encoding human intact red cell band 3 and glycophorin A (GPA) respectively, flanked by the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of Xenopus β-globin. For functional studies each of the mutations was also prepared in pBSXG1.b3, so that the mutant band 3 proteins could be expressed in Xenopusoocytes. In vitro transcription was carried out essentially as described previously (24Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Google Scholar, 25Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Google Scholar). For cell-free translation and the topology assay, each plasmid was linearized with ScaI and then transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. For expression into Xenopus oocytes, the BSXG-based plasmids were linearized with HindIII and transcribed using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) to produce capped cRNA. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (26Jackson R.J. Campbell E.A. Herbert P. Hunt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 289-301Google Scholar) and canine pancreatic microsomes (27Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Google Scholar) were prepared as previously described. The canine pancreatic microsomes were washed with 25 mm EDTA and treated with staphylococcal nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove endogenous mRNA. Cell-free translation of cRNA was performed in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes using the cell-free system containing 20% reticulocyte lysate and 15.5 kBq/μl EXPRE35SS protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Microsomal membranes were isolated from the translation mixture by ultracentrifugation through a high salt cushion (0.5 m sucrose, 30 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm potassium acetate, 500 mm magnesium acetate; 200,000 ×g for 10 min). Endoglycosidase H treatment was performed as previously described (28Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Google Scholar). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel image was visualized using a phosphorimager (FLA2000, Fuji). Quantitation was performed using MacBAS software (Fuji). The methods used for isolation of Xenopus oocytes, injection with cRNA, chloride transport assay, and chymotrypsin assay have been described previously (24Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Google Scholar, 29Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 81-88Google Scholar, 30Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Google Scholar). For the oocyte chymotrypsin assay, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blotting as described in the figure legends. Fig. 1 A shows a “bubble diagram” representation of the N-terminal side of the transmembrane domain of band 3. SAO band 3 lacks the 9-amino acid region at the cytoplasmic face of TM1 (shaded in Fig. 1 A). We have already reported that the first transmembrane domain (TM1) of SAO band 3 does not insert into the ER membrane independently, using a construct encompassing both the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 and TM1 in a cell-free translation system (19Chambers E.J. Bloomberg G.B. Ring S.M. Tanner M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1289-1307Google Scholar). However, the inability of TM1 of SAO band 3 to insert into membranes may affect the topology of the adjacent C-terminal TM segments. We made constructs corresponding to the region of band 3 from TM1 to TM4 and inserted a loop containing anN-glycosylation site (the fourth extracellular loop of band 3), termed the G loop, between TM3 and TM4 (Fig. 1 B). This construct also contained the reporter domain of prolactin lacking anN-glycosylation site (PL) at its C terminus. The constructs were expressed in the reticulocyte lysate cell free translation system in the presence of microsomes. As reported (22Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Google Scholar), the G loop in the construct corresponding to normal band 3 was efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 1 C, lane 1), implying that TM3 and TM4 integrate into the membrane with the expected orientation. The same result was obtained when the SAO mutation was present (Fig.1 C), indicating that the membrane topologies of TM3 and TM4 are not grossly affected by the SAO mutation, because the loop between TM3 and TM4 is translocated into the ER lumen irrespective of whether TM1 and TM2 are properly inserted into the membrane (Fig.1 D). To examine the portions of the 9-residue SAO deletion that are essential for membrane insertion, we made series of N- and C-terminal deletions within the SAO region (constructs -A400 to -PQVLAA in TableI) in a fragment containing the N terminus and TM1 of normal band 3 fused at the C terminus to a prolactin reporter (gPL) containing an N-glycosylation site (Fig. 2 A). Glycosylation at the gPL site will occur if TM1 takes up a transmembrane topology with the correct orientation. Fig. 2 C shows the results of transmembrane insertion experiments for some of the mutants, and the percentage of the construct that was glycosylated (i.e. the percentage of the construct inserted into ER membranes) of all the mutants is summarized in Table II(Insertion column). Deletion of up to six residues at the N-terminal side of the SAO deletion (–AFSPQV) gave high levels of glycosylation, but when seven residues were deleted (–AFSPQVL), the glycosylation decreased. Deletion of eight residues (–AFSPQVLA) completely abolished glycosylation (Fig. 2 C, Table II).Table ISAO region mutants constructedConstruct nameSequence of regionBand 3RRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPASAO band 3RRRYPYYLSDITDVIFIYFAALSPA−A400RRRYPYYLSDITDFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFRRRYPYYLSDITDSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−FSRRRYPYYLSDITDAPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFSRRRYPYYLSDITDPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFSPRRRYPYYLSDITDQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFSPQRRRYPYYLSDITDVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFSPQVRRRYPYYLSDITDLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFSPQVLRRRYPYYLSDITDAAVIFIYFAALSPA−AFSPQVLARRRYPYYLSDITDAVIFIYFAALSPA−A408RRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQVLAVIFIYFAALSPA−AARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQVLVIFIYFAALSPA−LAARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQVVIFIYFAALSPA−VLAARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQVIFIYFAALSPA−QVLAARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPVIFIYFAALSPA−PQVLAARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSVIFIYFAALSPAA400GRRRYPYYLSDITDg FSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAF401GRRRYPYYLSDITDAgSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAS402GRRRYPYYLSDITDAFgPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAP403GRRRYPYYLSDITDAFSgQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAP403ARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSaQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAQ404ARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPaVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAV405ARRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQaLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−P403RRRYPYYLSDITDAFSQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−Q404RRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−V405RRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPQLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−SPRRRYPYYLSDITDAFQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−PQRRRYPYYLSDITDAFSVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−QVRRRYPYYLSDITDAFSPLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−FSPRRRYPYYLSDITDAQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−SPQRRRYPYYLSDITDAFVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA−PQVRRRYPYYLSDITDAFSLAAVIFIYFAALSPA417LLLRRRYPYYLSDITDVIFIYFAALLLLSPAR387RR → AAAAAAYPYYLSDITDAFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA+ERRRYPYYLSDITDeAFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA+SERRRYPYYLSDITDseAFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA+LSERRRYPYYLSDITDlseAFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPA+ELSERRRYPYYLSDITDelseAFSPQVLAAVIFIYFAALSPAThe sequence shown for wild-type band 3 encompasses amino acids 387–420.ER insertion was measured using constructs containing amino acids 1–432 of band 3 fused to an N-glycosylation acceptor sequence (1–432-gPL series; see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.2 A).

NT indicates mutants not tested for ER insertion. *, anomalously high surface percentage caused by either low expression or internal degradation of protein (discussed under “Results”). It is possible that TM2 or more distant TM spans may facilitate integration of TM1 of SAO band 3 into the membrane. To examine this possibility, constructs were made corresponding to a region encompassing the N terminus of band 3 and TM spans 1–4, with the G loop inserted between TM1 and TM2, and fused at the C terminus with the prolactin reporter lacking an N-glycosylation site (Fig.2 B). When the construct corresponding to normal band 3 was expressed, it was efficiently glycosylated as previously reported (4Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Google Scholar). The constructs corresponding to band 3 SAO and band 3 deletions in the SAO region (Fig. 2 D) displayed a parallel trend ofN-glycosylation to the constructs containing TM1 only (73, 44, and 32% for the TM1–4 constructs compared with 86, 58, and 7% for the TM1 constructs of –AFSPQV, –AFSPQVL, and –AFSPQVLA respectively (Table II)). Although deletion of eight residues (–AFSPQVLA) gave a less marked decrease in glycosylation than the corresponding construct that only included TM1, these results strongly suggest that the membrane insertion of TM1 and TM2 is dependent solely upon the translocation initiation function of TM1. They also suggest that the topogenesis of TM1 + TM2 and of TM3 + TM4 is independent. Studies of the C-terminal deletion series constructs (shown in Fig.3 A) showed that deletion of up to two residues from the C-terminal side of the SAO region led to no change in the insertion of TM1 (Fig. 3 C and Table II). Deletion of three residues (–LAA) reduced insertion, and deletion of four or five residues abolished insertion (Table II). ER insertion returned upon deletion of six residues (Fig. 3 C, Table II). These results suggested that, for efficient TM1 insertion, the length of the continuous sequence of hydrophobic residues was important. This was particularly clear in the case of –VLAA and –QVLAA, as Pro-403 would have been brought too near to the membrane and the turn propensity or helix-breaking action of this residue would not allow a sufficiently long membrane-spanning helical region to be formed. Helix formation and membrane insertion would be allowed if Pro-403 was absent, as in the deletion –PQVLAA, because the helix could now extend at the N-terminal side with the addition of the sequence -AFS- (TableI) so that the hydrophobic helical length is the same as in the –AA mutant, which is able to insert into the ER membrane. To confirm that the length of hydrophobic sequence of TM1 was essential for membrane insertion, we added a trileucine sequence to the central region of TM1 of SAO band 3. The construct comprised the N terminus and TM1 of SAO band 3, with three leucine residues inserted consecutively between amino acids 417 and 418, fused at the C terminus (residue 432) to the prolactin reporter, which contained an N-glycosylation site (417LLL, see Fig. 3 B). Glycosylation of this construct occurred at a similar level to the construct corresponding to normal band 3 (Fig. 3 D), indicating that it took up the transmembrane orientation as normal band 3. This result adds support to the view that the inability of band 3 SAO TM1 to integrate into the membrane is the result of the insufficient length of its hydrophobic sequence. We also constructed several mutants within and around the SAO region to analyze their effects on ER insertion and band 3 anion transport function (the substitution; single, double, or triple deletion; insertion; and N-terminal truncation mutants shown in Table I). For ER insertion studies, all the mutations were prepared in the normal 1–432-gPL construct represented in Fig. 2 A, so that the mutant TM1 region of band 3 was fused to a prolactin reporter containing an N-glycosylation site. All the mutant constructs were efficiently glycosylated because they maintained a sufficient length of hydrophobic residues, indicating that the mutant TM1s took up the same transmembrane orientation as normal TM1 in ER membranes (results summarized in Table II). We also examined the effects of the mutations on the anion transport function and surface expression of band 3 using constructs that expressed whole band 3 (amino acids 1–911) containing each mutation. In vitro transcribed mRNA was co-injected intoXenopus oocytes with mRNA corresponding to erythrocyte GPA (known to enhance the surface presentation of band 3 in oocytes (Ref. 30Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Google Scholar)), and the band 3-specific anion transport was estimated from the stilbene-sensitive chloride uptake induced in the oocytes (Fig.4). Chloride transport of all the mutants was measured for ∼15 oocytes/experimental sample, and in duplicate sets of experiments using different batches of oocytes. Relevant positive and negative controls were also measured in each experiment to allow the normalization of the data sets. Because reduction in transport activity in this assay could reflect impaired movement of the mutant constructs to the cell surface, as well as a reduction in their intrinsic transport activity, we also measured the proportion of band 3 that moved to the oocyte surface using a protease accessibility assay (30Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Google Scholar). Band 3 has a single site susceptible to extracellular chymotrypsin cleavage, which is located between TM5 and TM6. Intact oocytes expressing the mutant band 3 were treated with chymotrypsin, and the 35-kDa C-terminal band 3 fragment generated by extracellular cleavage of band 3 at the oocyte surface was separated from the uncleaved band 3 located within the cells using SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody was used to detect and estimate the relative proportions of 35-kDa (surface band 3) and intact band 3 (internal band 3) in the cells (Fig.5). Data for all the mutants studied are summarized in Table II. Although each lane in the blots on Fig. 5represents the protein from 5 oocytes of the same batch, the protease accessibility assays for each mutant were repeated at least once on a different batch of oocytes, to allow for batch variability. The values for the percentage of band 3 mutant at the surface of the oocyte (TableII) are representative values from two experiments on separate batches of oocytes, except for wild-type band 3 and SAO band 3, where these values are presented as an average of six separate experiments. As previously reported, SAO band 3 showed no anion transport activity (Fig. 4 A; Ref. 12Groves J.D. Ring S.M. Schofield A.E. Tanner M.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 186-190Google Scholar). However, although ∼27% of normal band 3 reached the oocyte surface, only ∼11% of SAO band 3 was surface-located (Fig. 5 A, Table II). Although it has previously been reported that similar proportions of band 3 and SAO band 3 reach the surf"

The polymerization dynamics of MT is under strict control (1Desai A. Mitchinson T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). In addition to small molecules (inorganic ions, guanine nucleotides, and drugs), numerous proteins are known to interact with MT as positive regulators of MT assembly (MAPs) either by promoting the polymerization of tubulin or by stabilizing MT (1Desai A.

Recently, we found that two of the glycolytic enzymes, the M1 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PK) and Dictyostelium discoideum phosphofructokinase, can act as microtubule-destabilizing factors by inhibiting paclitaxel-induced polymerization of tubulin and by promoting disassembly of microtubules into thread-like oligomers (7Vértessy B.G.

In the present study we have further characterized the PK-tubulin/MT interaction with purified proteins using surface plasmon resonance technology, and we present data on the heterologous association of PK with MTs in brain extract, the protein composition of which approximates that of the living cells. We present evidence on the crucial role of acidic C-terminal fragments of MTs in the PK binding. We show the modulating role of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) on tubulin-PK as well as on MT-PK interaction at different organization levels and demonstrate that the distribution of PK in mouse fibroblasts is highly dependent on the integrity of microtubular network. Rabbit muscle PK, ATP, EGTA, GDP, GTP, lactate dehydrogenase, MES, NADH, PEP, PK, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, subtilisin, paclitaxel, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. Biotin-XX SSE (catalog no. B6352) was from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were reagent grade commercial preparations. Solutions were prepared using Millipore's Milli-Q ultra-pure water. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit. To determine the composition of pellets and supernatants in sedimentation experiments, proteins were separated on 9% SDS-PAGE. Stained gels as well as immunoblots were scanned using the Bio-Rad GelDoc 1000 densitometer system and quantitated using NIH Image software run on a Macintosh desktop computer. MAP-depleted tubulin was purified from bovine brain by the method of Na and Timasheff (10Na G.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6214-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and stored in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1m sucrose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm GTP at −80 °C. Purified tubulin showed no contamination with MAPs on overloaded SDS-PAGE. Before use, stored tubulin was dialyzed against 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, at 4 °C for 3 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. MT was assembled by adding 20 μm paclitaxel to 10 mg/ml tubulin, followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The activity of PK was followed by monitoring the NADH consumption at 340 nm with a Cary 50 or a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer utilizing a coupled enzymatic reaction with lactate dehydrogenase at 25 °C. The conditions for PK activity measurement corresponds to that described previously (7Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 10 μm tubulin was assembled to MT at 37 °C in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.6, containing 2 mm dithioerythritol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA (polymerization buffer), and KCl in concentrations as indicated. The polymerization was initiated with 20 μm paclitaxel at 37 °C. PK was either incubated with tubulin for 20 min at 4 °C before starting the polymerization or added to the paclitaxel-stabilized MTs. For turbidity measurements, absorbance was monitored at 350 nm with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. The error rate of determinations of turbidity measurements was ±5% within a series of experiments, i.e.using the same tubulin stock solution and polymerizing buffer or the same freshly prepared cell-free extract. In another set of experiments the absolute value of the rate of turbidity increase could be different; however, the relative inhibitory effect caused by PK was within ±5% error. The standard error of fitting of the polymerization curves for determination of the rates was ±2%. The acidic C-terminal fragments of paclitaxel-stabilized MTs were selectively removed by limited subtilisin digestion as described by Wang and Sheetz (11Wang Z. Sheetz M.P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1955-1964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which provided evidence for the cleavage of the fragments from both tubulin subunits. MAP-free tubulin or subtilisin-treated MTs at final concentrations of 10 μmwere incubated with or without 2 μm PK in polymerizing buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 30 °C. Under these conditions MTs and MT-bound PK are completely pelleted, whereas uncomplexed PK remains in the supernatant (7Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The partition of the proteins into pellet and supernatant fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE separation in 9% polyacrylamide gels. To study the influence of PEP on the partition of PK, a set of pelleting experiments was performed in the presence of 100 μm PEP. Cell-free cytosolic fraction containing the soluble proteins of cells including tubulin and MAPs (30 mg/ml total protein concentration) was prepared from bovine brain as described previously (12Liliom K. Wágner G. Pácz A. Cascante M. Kovács J. Ovádi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To initiate MT formation, the fraction was warmed to 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm GTP and 20 μm paclitaxel. Serum against rabbit muscle PK was raised by immunizing rats as described previously (7Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was purified according to Tracey et al. (13Tracey D.E. Lin S.H. Cebra J.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Proteins from the brain cell-free extract and from the pellet and supernatant fractions of the co-sedimentation experiments were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The anti-PK IgG was used at a 500-fold dilution from a 20 mg/ml stock solution. The secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:5000. The immunocomplex was visualized by the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) chromogenic detection system. L929 cells were pleated on glass coverslips and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For testing the effect of anti-microtubular drugs, the cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml paclitaxel or 1 μg/ml vinblastine. For immunostaining, the cells were fixed in cold methanol. PK-antiserum, prepared as described above, was used to label PK at 1:50 dilution followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Sigma) to visualize the immunocomplex under a fluorescent microscope. MT-containing samples were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pellets were pre-fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% tannic acid in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, for 60 min and then washed with 0.1 msodium cacodylate, post-fixed with 0.5% OsO4 in 0.1m sodium cacodylate, stained en bloc with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Durcupan (Fluka). Thin sections, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, were examined and photographed in a JEOL CX 100 electron microscope. The binding kinetics of PK to tubulin was monitored in real-time with a BIAcore X instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Tubulin at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was biotinylated with a sulfosuccinimidyl ester derivative of biotin, and the biotinylated tubulin at a concentration of 0.5 μmwas immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (Sensor Chip SA, product code BR-1000-32, BIAcore) as described previously (12Liliom K. Wágner G. Pácz A. Cascante M. Kovács J. Ovádi J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Sensorgrams were recorded at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 3 min at different concentrations of PK in the absence and presence of PEP. In some cases the injected sample contained 100 mm KCl in addition to PK. Dissociation and association rate constants were calculated using the Langmuir (1:1) binding model by the BIAevaluation 3.0 software supplied by the manufacturer or by the linearization methods based upon Equation 1(14Pharmacia AB BIAtechnology Handbook. Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden1994Google Scholar), lndRdt=ln(konCRmax)−(konC+koff)tEquation 1 where R is the resonance signal in RU at timet, dR/dt is the rate of change of the SPR signal, C is the concentration of the analyte (PK), andR max is the maximum analyte binding capacity in RU. The slope of the plot of ln(dR/dt)versus t is −(k on C +k off), which we designatedk obs, and the tangent ofk obs versus C givesk on (the knowledge ofR max is not necessary). For linear fitting we used Microcal Origin version 5.0 software (Microcal Software Inc.). The error of determination was ±10%. To obtain direct quantitative data on the binding of PK to tubulin, the association and dissociation kinetics of the interaction were followed by surface plasmon resonance measurements. Fig. 1 A shows typical sensorgrams obtained at 65, 86, 108, and 129 nm PK concentrations. The kinetic constants obtained by nonlinear fitting are: k on = 2.44 × 105m−1s−1;k off = 1.02 × 10−2s−1. The dissociation constant, K d =k off/k on, is 4.18 × 10−8m. The k onvalue was also calculated from the slope of k obs versus C (Fig. 1 C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The value of k onis (1.94 × 105 ± 2.9 × 103) m−1s−1, which is in good agreement with the value obtained from nonlinear direct fitting of SPR sensorgrams. In the presence of 100 mm KCl, virtually no PK binding could be detected (data not shown). To study the effect of PEP on tubulin-PK interaction, a solution of 65 nm PK containing different concentrations of PEP was injected over the tubulin-coated surface. The rate constant of the dissociation process evaluated from the sensorgrams obtained at various PEP concentrations is independent of the PEP concentration (data not shown), however, the RUequ values, which are characteristic for the amount of PK bound to tubulin, decreased with increasing PEP concentrations (see Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that PEP competes with tubulin for PK binding. Previously we demonstrated by differential centrifugation that PK induces the formation of less sedimentable tubulin oligomers and binds preferentially and substoichiometrically to this tubulin oligomer fraction (7Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The finding that the kinase is present in the high speed pellet (100,000 × g) provided evidence for its binding to the tubulin oligomer/MT. Here we have investigated the effect of ionic strength on the binding of PK to MTs. 2 μm PK was added to paclitaxel-stabilized MTs in the presence of either 50 or 150 mm KCl in the polymerizing buffer, and then the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g, and the pellets were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Long smooth-surfaced intact MTs are seen in the control samples (Fig. 2 A). When PK was added to these MTs at low ionic strength, the samples became crowded with large thread-like aggregates. Among these aggregates, bundled MTs arranged in parallel and connected by rows of small dense particles could be observed (Fig. 2 B). Bundled MTs and the aggregates were practically absent in samples prepared at high ionic strength (Fig. 2 D), which is in agreement with our SPR data obtained with unpolymerized tubulin, showing that high salt concentration inhibits the complex formation of tubulin with PK. The aggregates and bundled MTs were also conspicuous in samples containing PK and 1 mm pyruvate at low salt concentration (data not shown). By contrast, if the sample contained 1 mmPEP instead of pyruvate, the amount of both bundled MTs and thread-like aggregates was greatly reduced (Fig. 2 C). The effect of PEP on the association of PK to MTs was demonstrated by pelleting experiments as well. As shown in Fig.3 A, after centrifugation of samples containing MT + PK practically all MT appeared in the pellet together with significant amounts of PK. The addition of 1 mm PEP reduced the amount of PK co-sedimented with MTs. These observations indicate that PEP specifically inhibits the association of PK to MTs. To study the role of the acidic C-terminal tail of tubulin exposed on the surface of MTs in the salt-sensitive binding of PK, the pelleting experiments were also performed with “tail-free” MT prepared by limited subtilisin digestion as suggested by Wang and Sheetz (11Wang Z. Sheetz M.P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1955-1964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The release of the C-terminal tails of tubulin subunits was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and as shown in Fig 3 B, after a 60-min digestion the limited proteolysis was completed. When PK was added to the tail-free MTs under the conditions used for intact MTs, and the pellet fractions were analyzed, no PK was detected in the pellet fraction. Examination of the subtilisin-digested MTs by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the tail-free MTs are significantly shorter than their intact counterparts in accordance with the observation of Wang and Sheetz (11Wang Z. Sheetz M.P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1955-1964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and neither the oligomerization nor the bundling of MTs could be observed in the PK-containing samples prepared even at low salt concentration (data not shown). These data are in contrast to those obtained with intact MTs (cf. Fig. 3 A) and reveal the crucial role of the negatively charged C-terminal tails of MT in the PK-MT interaction. The experiments with purified proteins described above clearly show that both tubulin and MT bind PK and the binding occurs at relatively low protein concentrations. To obtain direct evidence for the occurrence of this hetero-association in a complex system, the interaction of PK with tubulin/MT was investigated in brain extract, which mimics the cellular conditions concerning the composition of soluble proteins. In one set of experiments the co-pelleting of endogenous PK with MTs formed by paclitaxel-induced polymerization was tested by analyzing the partition of PK in the supernatant and the pellet fractions in the absence and presence of assembled MTs. The MT assembly was induced by adding GTP plus paclitaxel to the concentrated cell-free extract (30 mg/ml), and the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed for the partition of PK by activity measurements as well as by immunoblotting using anti-PK antibody. As shown in TableI, both methods revealed that about 20% of the endogenous PK co-sedimented with the MTs. It has to be noted that less than 5% of the extract proteins, including endogenous PK, appeared in the pellet prepared without the addition of GTP + paclitaxel.Table IEffect of MT assembly on the distribution of PK in brain cell-free extractSampleActivity measurementsImmunoblottingControlGTP + paclitaxelControlGTP + paclitaxelunits/ml%units/ml%%%Extract54.110054.1100100100Supernatant51.69543.380>9575Pellet2.5510.820<519Brain cell-free extract (30 mg/ml total protein concentration) was warmed to 37 °C, and MT formation was initiated by adding 1 mm GTP and 20 μm paclitaxel.

Relative error of determinations is less than 10%. Open table in a new tab Brain cell-free extract (30 mg/ml total protein concentration) was warmed to 37 °C, and MT formation was initiated by adding 1 mm GTP and 20 μm paclitaxel. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the amount of PK in the pellet and supernatant was analyzed by activity measurements and densitometry of immunoblots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are the average of at least three independent measurements. Relative error of determinations is less than 10%. In another set of experiments, MT assembly in brain extract was also initiated by adding paclitaxel and followed by turbidimetry in the absence and presence of exogenous PK or PK plus PEP added to the extract prior to starting the polymerization of endogenous tubulin. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PK decreases the rate of polymerization. However, the simultaneous addition of PEP with exogenous PK partially suspends this effect. Fig. 4 Bshows the counteracting effect of PEP on PK-induced inhibition of tubulin polymerization with purified proteins as well. These data reveal that PK and MT can mutually recognize and interact with each other not only in purified systems but in extract containing a number of other microtubular (e.g. MAPs) and cytosolic proteins, which suggests the binding of PK to microtubular apparatus in complex biological systems. Previously we demonstrated the localization of PK on tubulin polymers by immunoelectron microscopy in an in vitro system using anti-PK immunogold labeling (7Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we aimed to visualize the distribution of PK, known as cytosolic enzyme, in living cells. The distribution of the enzyme was studied by immunohistochemical method in L929 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, although the intact L929 cells have an elongated shape, PK as shown by the bright fluorescence is concentrated in a juxtanuclear part of their cytoplasm. The nucleus and the extensions of the cells are not stained. To obtain information about the role of the microtubular network in the localization of PK, cells treated with the anti-microtubular drugs paclitaxel or vinblastine were also studied. The paclitaxel-treated cells maintained the elongated shape characteristic of intact L929 cells, showing, however, an altered staining pattern in most cells (Fig. 5 B). Although cells similar to the untreated cells are found because of the inhomogeneity of the cells, however, the major fraction of these cells behaved differently than the control cells; the distinct juxtanuclear concentration of the stain was no longer visible, and instead diffuse staining over extended areas of cytoplasm could be observed (Fig. 5 B). The difference in PK localization is more evident in the colored images with high power magnification. The shape of the vinblastine-treated cells was changed dramatically because of the collapse of the microtubular network, and the round cells showed an unlocalized distribution of the fluorescently labeled PK (Fig. 5 C). Although colocalization of PK and individual MTs was not examined in these experiments, our observations show that the intracellular localization of the kinase is strongly influenced by the organization of the MT network. Our data demonstrate that both the polymerized and unpolymerized tubulin interacts with PK. SPR technique was used here for the first time to characterize the kinetic and affinity parameters of this interaction. The high affinity of PK to tubulin, characterized by a low dissociation constant, made it possible to use low protein concentrations in the experiments with purified proteins for association studies and to detect this hetero-association in cell-free extract. As shown by electron microscopy, the bundling of MTs and the appearance of thread-like oligomeric aggregates are the morphologic manifestations of this interaction. Both processes were suppressed under high salt conditions and were absent in subtilisin-treated MT samples. These data are in good agreement with earlier observations demonstrating the sensitivity of PK-tubulin interaction to salt concentration (15Walsh J.L. Keith T.J. Knull H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and to proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal segment of tubulin (16Volker K.W. Knull H.R. J. Mol. Rec. 1993; 6: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanism of formation of oligomeric aggregates needs further elucidation. These aggregates accumulated in the presence of PK in samples during paclitaxel-induced tubulin polymerization as well as in samples of preassembled paclitaxel-stabilized MTs, which are practically free of nonsedimenting tubulin dimers. This suggests that the enzyme induces partial depolymerization of MTs. The presence of PK in the oligomeric aggregates was demonstrated earlier by SDS-PAGE analysis as well as by immunocytochemistry (7Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that occupation of the C-terminal tails of tubulins by PK may weaken the contacts necessary for the ordered arrangement of tubulin dimers in the cylindrical wall of MTs but do not suppress their propensity to bind each other and form atypical tubulin assemblies as observed in our experiments. An important finding of our study is that PEP can suppress the binding of PK to tubulin/MTs. This effect was demonstrated by four independent methods, SPR, pelleting, electron microscopy, and turbidimetry, in a system containing pure proteins only and in brain extracts as well. PK is a key glycolytic enzyme, present in the brain in micromolar concentrations (17Ottaway J.H. Mowbray J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1977; 12: 107-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which is within the range used in our experiments. Our data suggest that in living cells a significant fraction of the PK could be in an associated form around the nucleus. The localization of PK could be the result of the hetero-association of the kinase in which the microtubular network might be involved. The organization of the microtubular network is an important issue in the formation of macromolecular superstructure, as indicated by the results obtained using various drug treatments. Under physiological conditions, however, the PEP could modulate the distribution of PK within the cytoplasm. The binding is counteracted by PEP, a crucial intermediary in glycolysis, the concentration of which is controlled by the metabolic state of the cells.

https://openalex.org/W2076671273,"Binding of fibronectin to the small proteoglycan decorin plays an important role in cell differentiation and cell migration. The cartilage-specific (V+C)<sup>−</sup> fibronectin isoform, in which nucleotides that normally encode the protein segments V, III<sub>15</sub>, and I<sub>10</sub> are spliced out, is one of the major splice variants present in cartilage matrices. Full-length and truncated cDNA constructs were used to express recombinant versions of fibronectin. Results demonstrated that the (V+C)<sup>−</sup> isoform has a higher affinity for decorin. Dissociation constants for decorin and fibronectin interaction were calculated to be 93 nm for the V<sup>+</sup>C<sup>+</sup>isoform and 24 nm and 223 nm for (V+C)<sup>−</sup> fibronectin. Because heparin competed with decorin competitively, binding of decorin to fibronectin likely occurs at a heparin-binding region. We propose that alternative splicing of the V and C regions changes the global conformation of fibronectin in such a way that it opens an additional decorin-binding site. This conformational change is responsible for the higher affinity of the (V+C)<sup>−</sup> fibronectin isoform for decorin."

The basic isozyme (hereafter AdSS1) has a higher K m value for IMP and a lower K m value for l-aspartate than the acidic form (AdSS2). AdSS2 is less susceptible to inhibition by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) than AdSS1 but more strongly inhibited by nucleotides (7Matsuda Y. Ogawa H. Fukutome S. Shiraki H. Nakagawa H.

On the basis of these findings alone, investigators assigned AdSS2 to de novobiosynthesis of AMP and AdSS1 to the PNC (2Honzatko R.B. Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, in muscle, where exercise can increase IMP concentration up to 50-fold, the PNC may work asynchronously; AMP deaminase works only when AdSS1 and/or adenylosuccinate lyase is quiescent (3Guicherit O.V.

No study has demonstrated regulation of AdSS1 in the context of the PNC, although slight inhibition of the basic isozyme occurs at high concentrations of IMP (8Muirhead K.M. Bishop S.H. J. Biol.

Human and mouse AdSS2 have been cloned (3Guicherit O.V. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. Cooper B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22582-22587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Powell S.M. Zalkin H.

Native states of oligomerization for each isozyme remain ambiguous, as reports of monomeric and dimeric AdSS1 and AdSS2 are in the literature (8Muirhead K.M. Bishop S.H. J. Biol.

Reported here are first instances of heterologous overproduction and kinetic characterization of mouse AdSS2. Thek cat values for recombinant AdSS2 and AdSS1 are almost identical. AdSS2, relative to AdSS1, has a slightly lowerK m for IMP and GTP and a significantly higherK m for l-aspartate. High (but physiologically relevant) concentrations of IMP inhibit AdSS1 but not AdSS2. Adenylosuccinate, GDP, and GMP are strong inhibitors of both isozymes, but AMP, which potently inhibits AdSS2, is a weak inhibitor of AdSS1. Furthermore, the kinetic mechanism of AMP inhibition differs for the two isozymes. Fru-1,6-P2 might be a physiologically significant inhibitor of AdSS1 but not of AdSS2. Truncated isozymes (N-terminal leader sequence removed) retain the kinetic properties and state of oligomerization of their full-length counterparts. Mouse isozymes exhibit a monomer-dimer equilibrium, and both GTP and IMP stabilize the dimer. Differences in mouse synthetases reported here do not support mutually exclusive metabolic roles for the two isozymes. Moreover, our findings support the asynchronous operation of the PNC in muscle. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), plasmid pET28b, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and the thrombin cleavage capture kit were from Novagen, Inc. Restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, and Vent Polymerase were from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were from Sigma unless noted otherwise. The cloning of full-length AdSS1 into the expression plasmid pET28b was described previously (28Iancu C.V. Borza T. Choe J.Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42146-42152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). cDNA for mouse acidic adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS2) was kindly provided by Dr. F. B. Rudolph (Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, TX) as a pSPORT1clone (11Guicherit O.M. Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment of 1371 bp was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-CCCTTGTCATATGTCGATCTCCGAGAGCAGC-3′ (NdeI restriction site underlined), and reverse, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGAAGAGCTGAATCATGGACTC-3′ (XhoI restriction site underlined). Insertion of the amplified fragment into corresponding sites of the pET28b expression vector resulted in the plasmid pAdSS2a. An NdeI restriction site located into the AdSS2 open reading frame was removed by a silent mutation. Truncated AdSS1 (AdSS1-Tr) and AdSS2 (AdSS2-Tr) were generated using the forward primers 5′-CCCTTGTCATATGACTGGCTCTCGCGTGACCGTG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTGTCATATGGGGAACCGGGTGACTGTGGTG-3′, respectively (NdeI restriction sites underlined). All constructs were checked by sequencing (Iowa State University DNA sequencing facility). DNA and protein sequences were aligned using Multalign (35Carpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Published sequences of mouse AdSS2 (GenBankTM gi, 404056 and 6671520) (11Guicherit O.M. Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were compared with other full-length sequences from mouse (GenBankTM gi: 12845574, 20831732, and 12836391) and expressed sequence tags (GenBankTM gi: 3519613, 12089636, 3521474, and 1738606). The published sequence of human AdSS2 (GenBankTM gi: 415848) (4Powell S.M. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was compared with other (redundant) sequences (GenBankTM gi: 10438053 and 15214462). The sequence for human AdSS1 came from available full-length clones and expressed sequence tags (GenBankTM gi: 18583312, 16549233, 12889641, 12901898, 16181164, 13408903, 14817011, and 14676160). AdSS1 was produced and purified as described previously (28Iancu C.V. Borza T. Choe J.Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42146-42152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The same procedure was used for AdSS1-Tr. AdSS2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) at 37 °C in LB media containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were collected by centrifugation (4,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and then disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation (24,000 × g for 30 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, previously equilibrated with 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8. The column was washed sequentially with 10 volumes of each of the three buffers, differing from the above only in the concentration of imidazole (20, 30, and then 40 mm). Bound protein eluted with 300 mm imidazole. After dialysis in 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, the enzyme was loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a DEAE-Sepharose column, equilibrated with dialysis buffer. AdSS2 was eluted by a linear gradient (0–200 mm NaCl). AdSS2-Tr was overproduced and purified as above with one modification; cell cultures were maintained at 25 °C after induction. At 37 °C the truncated protein appears in inclusion bodies. Removal of the polyhistidyl tag employed the thrombin cleavage capture kit. Recombinant E. coli adenylosuccinate synthetase was overproduced and purified as described elsewhere (34Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme activity was determined at an absorbance of 280 nm and at 22 °C as described previously (37Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard assay buffer for AdSS1 contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 6.7, 8 mmmagnesium acetate, 150 μm GTP, 250 μm IMP, and 2 mm aspartate. For AdSS2, the assay buffer contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 6.7, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 150 μm GTP, 200 μm IMP, and 8 mm l-aspartate. The reaction was started by the addition of up to 1 μg/ml enzyme. Under these conditions the reaction was linear for 1 min. The Hill coefficient for Mg2+ was determined by varying the concentration of magnesium acetate from 0.2 to 4 mm and from 0.05 to 2 mm for AdSS1 and AdSS2, respectively. K i values for Fru-1,6-P2, AMP, GDP, and GMP were determined by holding two substrates at saturating levels and varying the concentration of the third substrate over 1−8 K m, at different fixed concentrations of inhibitors ranging over 0.5−2 K i. In experiments to determine the K i of IMP inhibition, concentrations of GTP varied from 15 to 200 μm, those of IMP ranged from 40 to 4,000 μm, and concentrations ofl-aspartate and Mg2+ were 2 and 8 mm, respectively. Kinetic data were analyzed with the computer program GraFit (38Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an An-60 Ti rotor, rotor speeds of 9,000 and 15,000 rpm, a temperature of 4 °C, and protein concentrations of 0.1−0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mmNaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Centrifugation in the presence of ligands (25 μm IMP, 25 μm GTP, 1 μm hadacidin, 2 mm magnesium acetate) employed only one concentration of protein (0.3 mg/ml). Samples were centrifuged for 12 h. Equilibration was verified then by 3 scans recorded at 4-h intervals. Stepwise radial scans were performed at 280 nm, using a step-size of 0.001 cm, with each datum being the average of 30 measurements. Data were analyzed using the “Ideal” model on the Optima XL-A Analysis software (version 2.0). Partial specific volumes of 0.741, 0.743, 0.740, and 0.745 ml/g for AdSS1, AdSS1-Tr, AdSS2, and AdSS2-Tr, respectively, were determined from the amino acid composition and published tables (39Laue T.M. Bhaivari D.S. Ridgway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 15 h to sediment all protein, and then radial scans were recorded to obtain a base-line correction for each cell. Inclusion of the second virial coefficient did not improve fits, indicating that nonideality is not present in the system. Mouse liver and skeletal muscle were disrupted using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 15 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The recovered supernatant fluid was heated (60 °C, 1 min) and then centrifuged (25,000 × g, 45 min). The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. Proteins that precipitated in the range of 40−60% (w/v) ammonium sulfate were retained. At this point adenylosuccinate synthetase activity was readily detected. Precipitated protein was dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column retained the acidic but not the basic isozyme. 1m NaCl washed the acidic isozyme from the column. Identities of the acidic and basic isozymes were confirmed by Western blots and their kinetic properties. Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant AdSS1 were raised in rabbits at the Iowa State University protein facility and were then purified by affinity chromatography, using an Econo-Pac serum IgG purification kit (Bio-Rad). A Sepharose 4B column containing immobilized AdSS2 eliminated cross-reacting antibodies. Protein transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.05% SDS. Detection of antigen-antibody complexation employed the Opti-4CN kit (Bio-Rad). Nucleotide sequences of mouse AdSS2, reported here and by Guicherit et al. (11Guicherit O.M. Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), differ at positions 499 (C in Ref. 11Guicherit O.M. Cooper B.F. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4488-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar is now G) and 595 (A becomes G). As a consequence, Arg167 and Thr199 become glycine and alanine, respectively, identical to corresponding residues in human AdSS2 (4Powell S.M. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gly167 is invariant among synthetases from 43 organisms, representing 30 major phylogenetic lineages. The published sequence of human AdSS2 (4Powell S.M. Zalkin H. Dixon J.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) also differs with respect to other sequence information; Ala24 should be arginine and an additional residue (proline) comes after position 24. The N-terminal leader sequence in mouse and human AdSS2 then each have 26 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). Sequence identity between AdSS1 and AdSS2 from the same source (mouse or human) is ∼75% but exceeds 95% between like isozymes from different sources. N-terminal leader sequences of AdSS1 and AdSS2 from the same source are only 25% identical. In contrast, N-terminal leader sequences between mouse and human AdSS1 are 97% identical, and those between mouse and human AdSS2 are 73% identical. AdSS1-Tr and AdSS2-Tr are shorter by 28 and 26 amino acid residues, respectively, than their full-length counterparts (Fig. 1). The yield of purified AdSS1-Tr was comparable with that of full-length AdSS1 (5–10 mg/liter of cell culture), but substantial quantities of AdSS1 and AdSS1-Tr did appear in inclusion bodies. In contrast, yields of recombinant AdSS2 and AdSS2-Tr were ∼ 25 mg/liter of cell culture, ∼20% of the total soluble protein. SDS-PAGE of samples revealed a single band of ∼50 kDa. Full-length and truncated AdSS2 are stable for several days at 4 °C. AdSS2 is stable with respect to freeze/thaw cycles in buffers supplemented with 30% glycerol. Full-length AdSS1, with or without their N-terminal polyhistidyl tags, have identical kinetic parameters and crystallize under the same conditions (28Iancu C.V. Borza T. Choe J.Y. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42146-42152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, truncation of the N-terminal polyhistidyl tag from AdSS2 does not change its kinetic properties (data not shown). In the absence of ligands, the E. coli synthetase is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (K d ∼10 μm) (34Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The presence of active site ligands, such as IMP and GTP, significantly increases thermal stability of E. coli synthetase. Moreover, the thermal stability of the E. coli synthetase increases with protein concentration. 2T. Borza and H. J. Fromm, unpublished results. In the absence of ligands, AdSS1 and AdSS2 are more stable than theE. coli synthetase, but IMP and GTP do not greatly enhance the thermal stability of the mammalian isozymes (Fig.2). AdSS1-Tr and AdSS2-Tr have the same thermal stability as their full-length counterparts, ruling out an effect due to the N-terminal leader sequence.

Its primary function is the regulation of expression of pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) genes by binding to specific sites onpyr mRNA in a uridine nucleotide-dependent manner and altering the folding of downstream RNA to promote termination of transcription. PyrR also catalyzes the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase) reaction even though it bears little amino acid sequence similarity to other bacterial UPRTases. The PyrR-catalyzed UPRTase reaction obeyed a Ping Pong steady state kinetic pattern under all conditions examined, but no catalysis of [14C]uracil-UMP and [32P]PPi-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate exchange reactions could be detected. Steady state equations for Ordered Bi Bi mechanisms for PyrR that include a kinetically irreversible conformational change after binding of PRPP but before uracil binding were shown to account for the Ping Pong pattern of the enzyme. This mechanism was supported by the following experimental observations. The reverse reaction was extremely slow with a catalytic rate constant 3300 times smaller than for the forward reaction. Patterns of product inhibition of the forward reaction were consistent with a version of the irreversible conformational change model in which PyrR returns to the unliganded conformation before dissociation of UMP and were inconsistent with several other kinetic mechanisms. UMP and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate were shown by equilibrium dialysis to bind to free PyrR (dissociation constants of 27 ± 3 and 18 ± 2 μm, respectively), but uracil and PPi did not bind at equilibrium concentrations up to 750 μm. We propose that the conformational change kinetic model developed for PyrR can also account for numerous other reports of Ping Pong kinetics for various phosphoribosyltransferases that do not form the phosphoribosyl-enzyme intermediate predicted by classic Ping Pong kinetics.

Turner R.J. Lu Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 329-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PyrR acts by binding to a specific RNA sequence and secondary structure in the attenuation regions of pyroperons or genes (2Bonner E.R. D'Elia J.N. Billips B.K. Switzer R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4851-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding of PyrR at this site stabilizes a secondary structure in the mRNA that favors formation of a downstream intrinsic transcription terminator RNA stem-loop, which results in reduced expression of the full-length mRNA that encodes the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes. Because the binding of PyrR to its specific sites is enhanced by uridine nucleotides UMP and UTP (2Bonner E.R. D'Elia J.N. Billips B.K. Switzer R.L.

The supernatant fluid from the streptomycin precipitation step was applied directly to the QAE-Sepharose column without ammonium sulfate precipitation or dialysis, the column was washed with 400 ml of Buffer R (100 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm Na+-phosphate, pH 7.0) (8Turner R.J.

The purified PyrR fractions were concentrated with powdered ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and dialyzed three times against 2 liters of 100 mm Tris acetate, 10 mmpotassium acetate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, at 4 °C.PRPP, uracil, UMP, UDP, and UTP were commercial products of Sigma-Aldrich. The concentrations of PRPP solutions was determined after preparation and monthly thereafter by a variation of the forward UPRTase assay using limiting PRPP, excess [14C]uracil, and PyrR and allowing the reaction to proceed to completion. The concentrations of solutions of uracil and uridine nucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically.[α-32P]UTP (25 Ci/mmol) was the commercial product of ICN Biomedicals, and [14C]uracil (50 mCi/mmol) and [32P]PPi (1000 mCi/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [32P]UMP was prepared from commercial [α-32P]UTP by hydrolysis in 0.25n HCl at 100 °C for 35 min. The radiochemical purity of the [32P]UMP was determined to be 71% by thin layer chromatographic analysis on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. Impurities were UDP (2%), Pi (11%), and unknown (16%). The [32P]UMP was diluted with pure nonradioactive UMP of known concentration for use in equilibrium dialysis, correcting the specific radioactivity for its 71% purity. [32P]PRPP was synthesized from 10 nmol of ribose 5-phosphate and 10 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/nmol, ICN Biochemicals) using 10 μg (0.36 units) of purified human PRPP synthetase isozyme II (12Nosal J.M.

After reaction for 30 min at room temperature, unreacted [γ-32P]ATP was removed from the reaction mixture by the addition of 30 ml of a 50% suspension of acid-washed (13Zimmerman S.B.

Before its use in equilibrium dialysis the RNA was deprotected according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration of stock solutions was determined from their UV absorbance.Assays for UPRTase and Exchange ReactionsThe UPRTase forward (uracil + PRPP → PPi + UMP) reaction was assayed by Method 2 previously described (8Turner R.J. Bonner E.R. Grabner G.K. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5932-5938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The [14C]uracil-UMP exchange reaction was assayed by the same method, except that PRPP was omitted from the reactions. The UPRTase reverse (UMP + PPi→ uracil + PRPP) reaction was assayed by enzymatic conversion of PRPP to [14C]AMP with an excess of [14C]adenine and purified human erythrocyte adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (a gift of Prof. Michael Becker, University of Chicago). Each assay contained in 50 μl of final volume 0.1 mm[14C]adenine (14 μCi, ICN Biomedicals), 0.006 IU of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (134 μg), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm serine buffer, pH 8.7, 30–240 μm UMP, and 300–1000 μm PPi. It was necessary to incubate all components except PPi at 37 °C for 5 min and to initiate the reactions with PPito obtain reaction rates that were linear with the amount of PyrR. Samples (5 μl) were removed at various time intervals less than 2 min (necessary to ensure linearity of product formation with time) and spotted and dried on DEAE-cellulose paper, which was washed to remove unreacted [14C]adenine and analyzed as for the UPRTase forward reaction.The [32P]PPi-PRPP exchange reaction was assayed by incubating 2 mm[32P]PPi (8 × 105 cpm), 1 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm serine buffer, pH 8.7, and up to 244 μg of PyrR at 37 °C for 1 h. Uracil, when added, was at 1 mm. Samples (5 μl) were removed, spotted together with nonradioactive PRPP and PPi, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Selecto Scientific) using 2m LiCl, 0.75 m ammonium formate, pH 5, as the developing solvent (28Bhatia M.B. Vinitsky A. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10480-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Authentic [32P]PPiand [32P]PRPP were also analyzed as standards. In all cases only one radioactive spot, which co-migrated with [32P]PPi, was detected, and all of the radioactivity added to the reaction mixtures was recovered in that spot.Equilibrium Dialysis Studies of Ligand Binding by PyrRThe procedure described by Gibson et al. (14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for equilibrium dialysis, except that ultrathin regenerated cellulose circular (1 cm diameter) dialysis membranes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off, The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) were used. Dialysis was in 100 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, pH 7.5, at 0 °C for 40–48 h. Equimolar MgCl2 was included when uracil, UMP, and UTP are ligands; 3- and 2-fold molar excess MgCl2 were added with PRPP and PPi, respectively. The concentration of PyrR was 100 μm. All experiments were performed in duplicate except that the ligand and PyrR were mixed together in one chamber and buffer only was placed in the other chamber (“dialyzing out”) in one set, and the ligand and PyrR were initially in different chambers in the other set (“dialyzing in”). Coincidence of the two final binding curves established that equilibrium had been reached. Quadruplicate samples were removed from the ligand, and PyrR chambers and their radioactivity were determined by liquid scintillation counting. These determinations permitted the concentrations of free and bound ligand and their associated standard errors to be calculated. The data were fit to a hyperbolic binding curve using Kaleidagraph 3.0 for Windows.Analysis of Kinetic DataSteady state kinetic data were analyzed using the computer program Kinsim (kindly provided by Bryce Plapp, University of Iowa), in which the Fortran code of Cleland (15Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar) was adapted to run on an IBM PC. Bisubstrate saturation kinetics were fit to the equations for Ping Pong mechanisms to calculate kinetic constants, which always gave much lower standard errors for the fit than when the data were fit to the equation for a Sequential mechanism. Product inhibition data were fit to the equations for competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive modes of inhibition. The equation that gave the lowest standard errors was used to determine kinetic constants so long as the pattern of double reciprocal plots was also clearly consistent with that equation. Steady state kinetic equations for the four mechanisms shown in Fig. 2, including their product inhibition patterns, were derived using the method of King and Altman (17King E.L. Altman C. J. Phys. Chem. 1956; 60: 1375-1378Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The details of these lengthy derivations are shown in Grabner (11Grabner G.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4851-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to bind to PyrR with a dissociation constant in the 1–10 nm range was chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Before its use in equilibrium dialysis the RNA was deprotected according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration of stock solutions was determined from their UV absorbance.Assays for UPRTase and Exchange ReactionsThe UPRTase forward (uracil + PRPP → PPi + UMP) reaction was assayed by Method 2 previously described (8Turner R.J. Bonner E.R. Grabner G.K. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5932-5938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The [14C]uracil-UMP exchange reaction was assayed by the same method, except that PRPP was omitted from the reactions. The UPRTase reverse (UMP + PPi→ uracil + PRPP) reaction was assayed by enzymatic conversion of PRPP to [14C]AMP with an excess of [14C]adenine and purified human erythrocyte adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (a gift of Prof. Michael Becker, University of Chicago). Each assay contained in 50 μl of final volume 0.1 mm[14C]adenine (14 μCi, ICN Biomedicals), 0.006 IU of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (134 μg), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm serine buffer, pH 8.7, 30–240 μm UMP, and 300–1000 μm PPi. It was necessary to incubate all components except PPi at 37 °C for 5 min and to initiate the reactions with PPito obtain reaction rates that were linear with the amount of PyrR. Samples (5 μl) were removed at various time intervals less than 2 min (necessary to ensure linearity of product formation with time) and spotted and dried on DEAE-cellulose paper, which was washed to remove unreacted [14C]adenine and analyzed as for the UPRTase forward reaction.The [32P]PPi-PRPP exchange reaction was assayed by incubating 2 mm[32P]PPi (8 × 105 cpm), 1 mm PRPP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm serine buffer, pH 8.7, and up to 244 μg of PyrR at 37 °C for 1 h. Uracil, when added, was at 1 mm. Samples (5 μl) were removed, spotted together with nonradioactive PRPP and PPi, and analyzed by thin layer chromatography polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Selecto Scientific) using 2m LiCl, 0.75 m ammonium formate, pH 5, as the developing solvent (28Bhatia M.B. Vinitsky A. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10480-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Authentic [32P]PPiand [32P]PRPP were also analyzed as standards. In all cases only one radioactive spot, which co-migrated with [32P]PPi, was detected, and all of the radioactivity added to the reaction mixtures was recovered in that spot.Equilibrium Dialysis Studies of Ligand Binding by PyrRThe procedure described by Gibson et al. (14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for equilibrium dialysis, except that ultrathin regenerated cellulose circular (1 cm diameter) dialysis membranes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off, The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) were used. Dialysis was in 100 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, pH 7.5, at 0 °C for 40–48 h. Equimolar MgCl2 was included when uracil, UMP, and UTP are ligands; 3- and 2-fold molar excess MgCl2 were added with PRPP and PPi, respectively. The concentration of PyrR was 100 μm. All experiments were performed in duplicate except that the ligand and PyrR were mixed together in one chamber and buffer only was placed in the other chamber (“dialyzing out”) in one set, and the ligand and PyrR were initially in different chambers in the other set (“dialyzi"
https://openalex.org/W2057819340,"At least three peptidases are involved in cleaving presequences from imported mitochondrial proteins. One of the peptidase, the inner membrane peptidase, has two catalytic subunits, Imp1p and Imp2p, which are structurally related but functionally distinct in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Whereas both subunits are members of the type I signal peptidase family, they exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificities. A clue to the substrate specificity mechanism has come from our discovery of the importance not only of the −1 and −3 residues in the signal peptides cleaved by Imp1p and Imp2p but also the +1 cargo residues attached to the signal peptides. We specifically find that Imp1p prefers substrates having a negatively charged residue (Asp or Glu) at the +1 position, whereas Imp2p prefers substrates having the Met residue at the +1 position. We further suggest that the conformation of the cargo is important for substrate recognition by Imp2p. A role for the cargo in presequence recognition distinguishes Imp1p and Imp2p from other type I signal peptidases.

Mitochondria have an outer and inner membrane enclosing two water-soluble compartments, the intermembrane space and the matrix. This complex membrane structure and the 400 or so proteins residing within mitochondria support a wide range of activities including respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and iron homeostasis (1Morgan-Hughes J.A. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 1610-1660Google Scholar). The mitochondrial genome encodes only 13 translational products in humans, whereas yeast mitochondria make only eight proteins. Therefore, the majority of mitochondrial proteins rely on targeting, translocation, and processing systems to arrive at and be inserted into mitochondria. Mitochondrial targeting is achieved to a large extent by N-terminal presequences whose cleavage by mitochondrial peptidases is often necessary for the attached proteins (referred to as cargo) to achieve their mature conformations (2Verner K. Schatz G. Science. 1988; 241: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). At least three endoproteases are involved in processing presequences. The first is the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IMP, inner membrane protease; cyt, cytochrome; SP, signal peptidase; HA, hemagglutinin that cleaves an N-terminal targeting peptide on a majority of imported mitochondrial proteins (3Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 4Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The second peptidase is the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase, which cleaves an octapeptide immediately following the MPP-cleaved signal in a subset of mitochondrial proteins (5Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 6Gavel Y. von Heijne G.

The third peptidase, the inner membrane peptidase (IMP), cleaves signal peptides from at least four proteins located in the inner membrane and intermembrane space (8Pratje E. Mannhaupt G. Michaelis G. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A.

Ramage L. Schatz G. Cell. 1994; 79: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our understanding of IMP function has come exclusively from studies using the yeast S. cerevisiae. The IMP has three known subunits: Imp1p, Imp2p, and Som1p (11Pratje E. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Behrens M.

Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Imp1p and Imp2p are catalytic subunits and members of the type I signal peptidase (SP) family that includes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) SP and a large number of eubacterial SPs (16Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As with most eubacterial SPs and unlike ER SP, Imp1p and Imp2p contain Ser/Lys catalytic dyads (16Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the widely accepted endosymbiont hypothesis in which mitochondria evolved from a eubacterial progenitor. Som1p is a small protein (74 amino acids) required for cleavage of signal peptides from a subset of Imp1p substrates (15Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Som1p functions is not known. The crystal structure of only one type I SP, the leader peptidase fromEscherichia coli, has been determined previously (20Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Its structure reveals small binding pockets for amino acids located at the −1 and −3 positions upstream from cleavage sites in signal peptides. Similar binding pockets are probably present in the eukaryotic members of the type I SP family, as −1 and −3 amino acids are important for substrate recognition by ER SP (21Folz R.J. Nothwehr S.F. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 3979-3987Google Scholar) and Imp1p (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Imp1p and Imp2p exhibit nonoverlapping substrate specificities, which sets them apart from other type I SPs (12Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Imp1p cleaves an N-terminal peptide from NADH-cytochrome (cyt) b 5 reductase and precursors to cyt b 2 (l-lactate dehydrogenase) and subunit II of cyt c oxidase (complex IV in the respiratory chain) (11Pratje E. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Hahne K. Haucke V. Ramage L. Schatz G. Cell. 1994; 79: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Imp2p cleaves the signal peptide from the precursor to cyt c 1, a subunit of complex III (12Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cyt b 2 and cytc 1 precursors have a bipartite presequence (9Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,10Guiard B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). MPP cleaves the mitochondrial-targeting signal fromp-cyt b 2 and p-cytc 1, generating i-cytb 2 and i-cytc 1 intermediates that are cleaved by Imp1p and Imp2p, respectively. Almost all of the type I SPs including Imp2p recognize small, uncharged amino acids at the −1 position and, to a lesser extent, −3 positions of signal peptides (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Folz R.J. Nothwehr S.F. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Imp1p substrates have a Asn−1 (Fig. 1), which is unconventional in substrates of type I SPs. Based on this observation, the prevailing hypothesis for the nonoverlapping substrate specificity mechanism has been that Imp1p cleaves unconventional signal peptides (12Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A recent study from our laboratory provides evidence that the −1 residue is not the sole determinant for substrate specificity. Construction of an extensive set of mutations in which the Asn−1 ofi-cyt b 2 was substituted with 19 amino acids (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reveals that Imp1p efficiently cleaves signal peptides containing (in addition to Asn) Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Met at the −1 position. This recognition of a Ala−1 means that Imp1p can cleave not only unconventional signal peptides but also conventional signal peptides. Taken together, the data argue that amino acids present within and outside the −1 and −3 positions of the IMP substrates are responsible for nonoverlapping substrate specificity. In agreement with this conclusion, the double mutant i-cytb 2 (Ala−1-Ala −3), which contains −1 and −3 residues like those found in Imp2p substratei-cyt c 1 (Fig. 1), is not cleaved by Imp2p (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we have sought to identify presequence and cargo residues important for Imp1p and Imp2p recognition. For simplicity, our efforts are focused on substrates i-cytb 2 and i-cytc 1 that do not require Som1p for their processing (15Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). Our strategy is to construct a series of mutations and chimeras that allow all or part of these substrates to be switched from one IMP catalytic subunit to the other catalytic subunit. Yeast strain XCY101 (MATα imp1::HIS3 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 lys2–80), which expresses Imp2p but not Imp1p, was constructed in our laboratory (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Yeast strain JNY34/pXC3 (imp2 S41A) (MATa imp2Δ-1 ura3–52 trp 1), which expresses functional Imp1p but not Imp2p, has been described previously (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Yeast strain CVY1 (MATa ura3–52 his3-Δ200 lys2–80 trp1-Δ901), which expresses both Imp1p and Imp2p, has been described previously (18VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A two-step PCR was used to create mutations as described previously (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To mutagenize theCYB2 gene encoding p-cytb 2, upstream primer (amino acids1–21, 5′-AAA CTG CAG ATG CTA AAA TAC AAA CCT TTA-3′) and downstream primer (amino acids 1753–1773, 5′-CCG GAA TTC TGC ATC CTC AAA TTC TGT TAA-3′) were paired with different internal oligonucleotides (Table I). The second-step PCR created mutated full-length CYB2 having aPstI site at the 5′ end and a EcoRI site at the 3′ end of CYB2 gene. This construct was introduced into pHF454 (2 μm of TRP1), which placed the protein immediately downstream of the ADH1 promoter and upstream of a triple HA epitope. To mutagenize the CYT1-encoding p-cytc 1, procedures were the same as in the mutagenisis of CYB2 with the exception of the use of upstream primer (amino acids 1–23, 5′-AAA CTG CAG ATG TTT TCA AAT CTA TCT AAA CG-3′) and downstream primer (amino acids 904–927, 5′-CCG GAA TTC CTT TCT TGG TTT TGG TGG ATT GAA-3′). These primers were paired with internal primers listed in Table I for constructions of mutations. To create the CYT1/CYB2 chimeras, the procedures were the same as in the mutagenesis of CYB2 and CYT1 with the exception of the use of different upstream and downstream primers and the pairing of different internal primers (Table I).Table IOligonucleotides used in the construction of mutations and gene fusionsPlasmid nameMutationInternal oligonucleotide primers1-aThe sequences of mutations and fusion joints are in boldface.pWL3i-cytc 1(−3I −1N +1E)5′-ACTATC GAA AAT GAG ACC GCA GCT GAA-3′5′-TTC AGC TGC GGT CTC ATT TTC GATAGT-3′pWL4cyt b 2 (+1M)5′-CAA ATA GAC AAC ATG CCG AAA CTG GAT-3′5′-ATC CAG TTT CGGCAT GTT GTC TAT TTG-3′pWL5cyt c 1(+1E)5′-ACT GCC GAA GCT GAG ACC GCA GCT GAA-3′5′-TTC AGC TGC GGT CTC AGC TTC GGC AGT-3′pWL6i-cyt b 2(−3A −1A +1M)5′-CAA GCA GAC GCC ATG CCG AAA CTG GAT-3′5′-ATC CAG TTT CGG CAT GGC GTCTGC TTG GC-3′pWL7p-cytc 1(aa 1–61)/cyt b 25′-ACT GCC GAA GCT ATG CCG AAA CTG GAT ATG AAT-3′(aa 81–591) (+1M)5′-CAT ATC CAG TTT CGG CAT AGC TTC GGC AGT TAA-3′pWL8p-cyt c 1 (aa 1–61) [+1M]5′-ACT GCC GAA GCT ATG GAG CCG AAA CTG GAT-3′cyt b 2 (aa 81–591)5′-ATC CAG TTT CGG CTC CAT AGC TTC GGC AGT-3′pWL9i-cyt b2 (−3A −1A) [+1M]5′-AAT GGC CAA GCA GAC GCC ATG GAG CCG AAA CTG-3′5′-TTT CGG CTC CAT GGC GTC TGC TTG GCC ATT ATG-3′pXC4p-cyt c 1 (aa 1–61)/cytb 25′-ACT GCC GAA GCT GAG CCG AAA CTG GAT ATG AAT-3′(aa 81–591)5′-CAT ATC CAG TTT CGG CTC AGC TTC GGC AGT TAA-3′pXC5p-cytc 1(aa 1–61) (−1 N)/cyt5′-ACT GCC GAA AAC ATG CCG AAA CTG GAT ATG AAT-3′b 2 (aa 81–591)5′-CAT ATC CAG TTT CGG CAT GTT TTC GGC AGT TAA-3′pXC6i-cyt c 1(−1N)5′-ACT GCC GAA AAT ATG ACC GCA GCT GAA-3′5′-TTC AGC TGC GGT CAT ATT TTC GGC AGT-3′pXC7i-cyt c 1 (−3I)5′-ACTATC GAA GCT ATG ACC GCA GCT GAA-3′5′-TTC AGC TGC GGT CAT AGC TTC GAT AGT-3′pXC8i-cytc 1 (−3I−1N)5′-ACT ATC GAAAAT ATG ACC GCA GCT GAA-3′5′-TTC AGC TGC GGT CAT ATT TTC GAT AGT-3′aa, amino acids.a The sequences of mutations and fusion joints are in boldface. Open table in a new tab aa, amino acids. Yeast cells were cultured overnight to log phase at 30 °C, and four optical density (600nm) cell equivalents were used for each experiment. Cells were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in minimal medium lacking methionine and cysteine. Cells expressing i-cyt b 2 and chimeric proteins described in the text were labeled with 48 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min and then subjected to a chase for 30 min in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine/cysteine mixture. Cells expressing i-cytc 1 were labeled with 48 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and then subjected to a chase for 30 min in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine/cysteine mixture. Yeast cells were broken using glass beads in 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet fraction was boiled in 20 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with 0.75 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. After another round of centrifugation, 10 μl of rat anti-HA high affinity monoclonal antibody was added to the supernatant, which was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Twenty microliters of agarose-conjugated protein G were added, and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. After washing of the agarose bead pellet, 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. After boiling for 5 min, immunoprecipitation was repeated as described above. Ten microliters of the solution was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Our published work (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrates the importance of the −1 and −3 residues in the signal peptide of Imp1p substrate i-cyt b 2. To determine whether the −1 and −3 residues are important for cleavage of an Imp2p substrate, we constructed mutations that changed the −1 and/or −3 amino acids of i-cyt c 1 to residues found in i-cyt b 2 (Table I) (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the pulse-chase experiment depicted in Fig. 2, two results are noteworthy. (i) When the Ala−1 and/or Ala−3 of i-cytc 1 are changed to Asn and/or Ile, respectively, cleavage by Imp2p is blocked (compare lane 6 withlanes 7–9), revealing a critical role for the −1 and −3 amino acids. (ii) When the −1 and −3 residues of i-cytc 1 are changed to Asn and Ile, respectively, Imp1p cannot cleave the protein (lane 5), even thoughi-cyt b 2 has a Asn−1 and a Ile−3 (Fig. 1). Taken together with our prior results (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), substrate specificity is determined not only by the −1 and −3 amino acids but also by amino acids outside the −1 and −3 positions in the IMP substrates. To address whether cargo sequences are important for substrate specificity, we constructed a gene fusion in which the presequence of p-cyt c 1 was fused to the cyt b 2 cargo (C1–61B81–591) (Table I). We introduced into this chimera the A−1N substitution, as Imp1p does not efficiently cleave signal peptides containing Ala at both the −1 and −3 positions such as that found in the i-cyt c 1signal peptide (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 3 show that Imp1p cleaved with good efficiency the C1–61(−1N)B81–591 chimera (compare lane 3 with lane 1, which depicts wild-type cyt b 2). In contrast, Imp1p did not efficiently cleave the C1–61B81–591 chimera, which contains the wild-type signal peptide of i-cytc 1 (compare lane 2 with lane 1). In Fig. 2, we showed that Imp1p did not cleave thei-cyt c 1 signal peptide (−1N) when it was attached to the i-cyt c 1 cargo (lane 3). These results indicate that Imp1p can cleave thei-cyt c 1 signal peptide provided it contains Asn−1 and is attached to cytb 2 cargo, thus demonstrating roles for the signal peptide and cargo in the substrate specificity of Imp1p. In considering cargo sequences that may be important for substrate recognition by Imp1p, we noted that all of the known Imp1p substrates have a negatively charged amino acid, Glu or Asp, immediately following the cleavage site (the +1 position in the cargo) (Fig. 1). Reasoning that the +1 residue may be important for substrate recognition, we prepared a i-cyt c 1 construct in which its Met+1 was changed to Glu (Table I). We also introduced Asn at the −1 position and Ile at the −3 position. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that Imp1p cleaved i-cytc 1 (−3I −1N +1E) although slightly inefficiently (Fig. 4 A, compare lane 1 with lane 3, which depicts Imp2p cleavage of wild-type i-cytc 1). We confirmed the importance of the +1 residue in Imp1p substrates by constructing a mutation that changed the +1 Glu of i-cyt b 2 to Met (Table I) and by showing that Imp1p cleaved this protein inefficiently (Fig. 4 B, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). The pulse-chase depicted in Fig. 3 demonstrated that Imp2p did not cleave chimera C1–61B81–591(lane 4), suggesting that Imp2p does not recognize the presequence of its natural substrate i-cytc 1 when the presequence is fused to the cytb 2 cargo. We were unable to analyze in vivo a complementary chimera consisting of the p-cytb 2 presequence and cyt c 1cargo, because the fusion protein was not stably expressed in yeast cells. Therefore, we employed the following strategy. As the +1 residue is important for substrate recognition by Imp1p, we asked whether the +1 residue mediates Imp2p substrate recognition. We constructed a mutation that changed the Met+1 ofi-cyt c 1 to Glu, a +1 residue found in some Imp1p substrates (Table I) (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 5 A, this mutation strongly inhibited signal peptide cleavage by Imp2p (compare lanes 3and 4), revealing an important role for the +1 residue in substrates recognized by Imp2p. We next asked whether the triple mutation (−3A −1A +1M) (Table I) causes Imp1p substratei-cyt b 2 to be switched to Imp2p in a manner similar to the substrate switching produced by a corresponding triple mutation in i-cyt c 1 (Fig. 4 A). However, Imp2p did not cleave i-cytb 2 containing the triple mutation (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). These data demonstrate that although the −1, −3, and +1 residues are important for substrate recognition by Imp2p, residues outside the −3, −1, and +1 positions preventi-cyt b 2 from being switched to Imp2p. We decided to utilize our C1–61B81–591chimera to further define the role of cargo sequences in substrate specificity by Imp2p. Imp2p inefficiently cleaved chimera C1–61B81–591(+1M) in which the Glu1 of the cyt b 2 cargo was changed to Met (Fig. 6, lane 5). However, cleavage efficiency dramatically increased by an insertion mutation [+1M] that placed a Met residue between the Ala−1 of the i-cyt c 1signal peptide and Glu1 of the i-cytb 2 cargo in chimera C1–61[+1M]B81–591 (lane 6). The amino acid sequence of the fusion joint and amino acid changes are shown in Fig. 1. This result indicated that a spacing of the cytb 2 cargo from the i-cytc 1 signal peptide by a single Met residue led to efficient cleavage of the chimera by Imp2p. Although the data presented in Fig. 6 demonstrate the importance of cargo sequences in switching a substrate from Imp1p to Imp2p, we still do not know whether residues outside the −1 and −3 positions in thep-cyt b 2 presequence contribute to substrate specificity. To address this issue, we constructed a mutation that introduced a single Met residue between the p-cytb 2 presequence and the cytb 2 cargo (Table I). We also constructed mutations that introduced Ala residues at the −1 and −3 positions of the p-cyt b 2 presequence. Despite having the appropriate −1 and −3 residues and the required Met1 spacing residue, Imp2p did not cleave i-cytb 2 (−3A −1A [+1M]) (Fig. 7, lane 3), suggesting that the presequence of p-cyt b 2 has residues outside the −1 and −3 positions that prevent cleavage by Imp2p. Multiple factors contribute to nonoverlapping substrate specificity. We will discuss separately the roles played by the signal peptide and the attached cargo. Results from a previous study (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and this study (Fig. 2) demonstrate the importance of −1 and −3 residues for signal peptide recognition by Imp1p and Imp2p. As with most type I SPs, Imp2p recognizes small, uncharged amino acids at the −1 and −3 positions (Figs. 1 and 2). Imp1p differs from Imp2p in that Imp1p substrates have a Asn−1 (Fig. 1). This unusual −1 residue contributes to nonoverlapping substrate specificity because Imp2p cannot cleave i-cyt c 1 when the Ala−1 is substituted with Asn (Fig. 2, lane 7). The −3 residue also contributes to substrate specificity, because Imp2p cannot cleave i-cyt c 1 when its Ala−3 is substituted with Ile (Fig. 2, lane 8), the residue found at the −3 position in Imp1p substratei-cyt b 2 (Fig. 1). Similarly, Imp1p cannot efficiently cleave i-cyt b 2when Ala residues are placed at the −1 and −3 positions, although Imp1p can efficiently cleave i-cyt b 2when an Ala residue is present at either the −1 position or −3 position (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the −1 and −3 residues play an important role in the nonoverlapping substrate specificity exhibited by Imp1p and Imp2p. The presequence of p-cyt b 2 plays a further undefined role in substrate specificity. As shown in Fig. 7, we are unable to switch Imp1p substrate i-cytb 2 to Imp2p even when Ala residues are present at the −1 and −3 positions and the appropriate spacing mutation is present in the sequence of the cyt b 2 cargo (described below). The p-cyt b 2 andp-cyt c 1 have bipartite presequences, and both presequences exhibit hydrophobic amino acid stretches that are typical of signal peptides cleaved by type I SPs (23von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Thep-cyt b 2 presequence is longer (80 residues) than the p-cyt c 1presequence (61 residues), although it is presently unclear whether this difference contributes to nonoverlapping substrate specificity. Cargo sequences are generally not important for substrate recognition by most type I SPs. Indeed, ER SP can cleave signal peptides cotranslationally (i.e. before a significant portion of the cargo has been synthesized) (24Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). However, our results show that cargo sequences play an essential role in nonoverlapping substrate specificity. The clearest example of this role comes from our results showing the importance of the +1 residue in the cargo. Imp1p substrates have a negatively charged residue at the +1 position, whereas the Imp2p substrates have a Met residue at the +1 position (Fig. 1). When these +1 residues are interchanged, cleavage efficiency of i-cyt b 2 (by Imp1p) andi-cyt c 1 (by Imp2p) is significantly reduced (Figs. 4 B and 5 A). The +1 residue is generally thought to play no role in substrate recognition by type I SPs, because most of the enzymes in this family cleave signal peptides irrespective of the +1 residue (21Folz R.J. Nothwehr S.F. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 3979-3987Google Scholar, 22von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 25Fikes J.D.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Karamyshev A.L. Karamysheva Z.N. Kajava A.V. Ksenzenko V.N. Nesmeyanova M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An important exception is that Pro is not tolerated at the +1 position in substrates of type I SPs. The crystal structure of leader peptidase from E. coli reveals binding pockets for the −1 and −3 residues but no such site for the +1 residue (20Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Therefore, Pro probably alters the conformation of the cleavage site rather than interfere with a specific interaction between enzyme and +1 residue. One interpretation for the importance of +1 residues in IMP substrates is that, unlike other type I SPs, Imp1p and Imp2p have specific binding sites for the +1 residues. However, at this time, we cannot rule out the possibility that the +1 residues confer specific conformations necessary for substrate cleavage by Imp1p and Imp2p. The cyt b 2 cargo presents additional features that direct it to Imp1p and away from Imp2p. We find that when the cytb 2 cargo is fused directly to thei-cyt c 1 signal peptide, cleavage by Imp2p is blocked even when the Glu1 is changed to Met (Fig. 6). However, Imp2p can cleave this chimera if a Met residue is present between the i-cyt c 1 signal peptide and cyt b 2 cargo (Fig. 6). This means that the spacing of the cyt b 2 cargo by one amino acid from the i-cyt c 1 signal peptide is sufficient for cleavage. From these data, we conclude that the conformation of the cyt b 2 cargo inhibits presequence recognition by Imp2p. This conclusion is supported by prior data indicating that the attachment of heme c to thei-cyt c 1 apoprotein is necessary for cleavage of the signal peptide by Imp2p (28Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the conformation of the i-cyt c 1apoprotein interferes with Imp2p recognition. These data lead us to suggest that signal peptides of Imp2p substrates and perhaps Imp1p substrates are cleaved after at least a portion of the cargo has been translocated across the outer mitochondrial membrane. The unusual substrate preferences of Imp1p and Imp2p offer some hope that anti-microbial drugs specifically inhibiting eubacterial SPs can be found. Most eubacterial type I SPs have a Ser/Lys catalytic dyad, whereas ER SP catalytic site contains His (18VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11519-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It may be possible to exploit this difference in the development of compounds specifically inhibiting eubacterial SPs (29Paetzel M. Chernaia M. Strynadka N. Tschantz W. Cao G. Dalbey R.E. James M.N.G. Proteins. 1995; 23: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Allsop A. Brooks G. Edwards P.D. Kaura A.C. Southgate R. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1996; 49: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One problem with this approach is that Imp1p and Imp2p also have Ser/Lys dyads (17Chen X. VanValkenburgh Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, our observed role for cargo sequences, particularly the +1 residues, in the recognition of substrates by the IMP is clearly unique in the type I SP family. Therefore, it is plausible that drugs specifically targeting eubacterial SPs can be developed. We thank Reeha Arunkumar for technical assistance and Haobo Liang for critical reading of this paper."
