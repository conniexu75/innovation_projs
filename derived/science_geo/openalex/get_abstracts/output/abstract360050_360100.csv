https://openalex.org/W2079458003,"Erik Jorgensen and colleagues report a highly efficient method for generating single-copy transgene insertions in C. elegans. Notably, these single-copy transgenes are expressed at endogenous levels and can be expressed in the female and male germlines. At present, transgenes in Caenorhabditis elegans are generated by injecting DNA into the germline. The DNA assembles into a semistable extrachromosomal array composed of many copies of injected DNA. These transgenes are typically overexpressed in somatic cells and silenced in the germline. We have developed a method that inserts a single copy of a transgene into a defined site. Mobilization of a Mos1 transposon generates a double-strand break in noncoding DNA. The break is repaired by copying DNA from an extrachromosomal template into the chromosomal site. Homozygous single-copy insertions can be obtained in less than 2 weeks by injecting approximately 20 worms. We have successfully inserted transgenes as long as 9 kb and verified that single copies are inserted at the targeted site. Single-copy transgenes are expressed at endogenous levels and can be expressed in the female and male germlines."

We analyzed the expression of 484 miRNAs in the lungs of rats exposed to environmental cigarette smoke (ECS) for 28 days. ECS down-regulated 126 miRNAs (26.0%) at least 2-fold and 24 miRNAs more than 3-fold. We previously demonstrated that 107 of 4858 genes (2.9%) and 50 of 518 proteins (9.7%) were up-regulated by ECS in the same tissue, which is consistent with the role of microRNAs as negative regulators of gene expression. The most remarkably down-regulated microRNAs belonged to the families of let-7, miR-10, miR-26, miR-30, miR-34, miR-99, miR-122, miR-123, miR-124, miR-125, miR-140, miR-145, miR-146, miR-191, miR-192, miR-219, miR-222, and miR-223, which regulate stress response, apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and expression of genes. In contrast, miR-294, an inhibitor of transcriptional repressor genes, was up-regulated by ECS. There was a strong parallelism in dysregulation of rodent microRNAs and their human homologues, which are often transcribed from genes localized in fragile sites deleted in lung cancer. Five ECS-down-regulated microRNAs are known to be affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms. Thus, changes in microRNA expression are an early event following exposure to cigarette smoke."
https://openalex.org/W2091499641,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a 55-kDa type I membrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Ligand-induced up-regulation of RAGE is involved in various pathophysiological processes, including late diabetic complications and Alzheimer disease. Application of recombinant soluble RAGE has been shown to block RAGE-mediated pathophysiological conditions. After expression of full-length RAGE in HEK cells we identified a 48-kDa soluble RAGE form (sRAGE) in the culture medium. This variant of RAGE is smaller than a 51-kDa soluble version derived from alternative splicing. The release of sRAGE can be induced by the phorbol ester PMA and the calcium ionophore calcimycin via calcium-dependent protein kinase C subtypes. Hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors block the release of sRAGE, and by RNA interference experiments we identified ADAM10 and MMP9 to be involved in RAGE shedding. In protein biotinylation experiments we show that membrane-anchored full-length RAGE is the precursor of sRAGE and that sRAGE is efficiently released from the cell surface. We identified cleavage of RAGE to occur close to the cell membrane. Ectodomain shedding of RAGE simultaneously generates sRAGE and a membrane-anchored C-terminal RAGE fragment (RAGE-CTF). The amount of RAGE-CTF increases when RAGE-expressing cells are treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor, suggesting that RAGE-CTF is normally further processed by γ-secretase.

Several groups have shown that soluble RAGE derives from alternative splicing of the RAGE mRNA (11Schlueter C. Hauke S. Flohr A.M. Rogalla P. Bullerdiek J. Biochim. Biophys.

Brain Res. 1999; 71: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The primary secreted splice variant of human RAGE is esRAGE (endogenous secretory RAGE, also named RAGE_v1 (14Hudson B.I. Carter A.M. Harja E. Kalea A.Z. Arriero M. Yang H. Grant P.J. Schmidt A.M. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar)), and also in mouse a secreted homologue of esRAGE was identified (15Harashima A. Yamamoto Y. Cheng C. Tsuneyama K. Myint K.M.

Both esRAGE variants contain nearly the entire extracellular part of full-length RAGE, including the V-type ligand binding domain. In human lung 80! of the RAGE mRNA encodes for full-length RAGE and only 7! for esRAGE (14Hudson B.I. Carter A.M. Harja E. Kalea A.Z. Arriero M. Yang H. Grant P.J. Schmidt A.M. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in human lung samples the full-length membrane-bound RAGE protein is difficult to detect, whereas the majority of the RAGE protein is found in a soluble form (16Englert J.M. Hanford L.E. Kaminski N. Tobolewski J.M. Tan R.J. Fattman C.L. Ramsgaard L. Richards T.J. Loutaev I. Nawroth P.P. Kasper M. Bierhaus A. Oury T.D. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 172: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, mechanisms different from alternative splicing may account for the secretion of RAGE. Because the amount of membrane-bound RAGE is increased in the brain vasculature of AD patients, we hypothesized that besides an increased expression also a reduced proteolysis of RAGE may be responsible for the presence of cellular RAGE. In this report we demonstrate that the ligand binding domain of RAGE is proteolytically released from membrane-bound RAGE by a metalloproteinase, and we identified calcium-dependent PKC isoenzymes to be involved in activation of that process. Furthermore, we show that after ectodomain shedding RAGE is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti human RAGE N-terminal antibody Mab5328 (Millipore) was used for detection of human RAGE. Rabbit serum Ab3260, which recognizes soluble human RAGE, was made at Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). For immunization the RAGE peptide sequence VSISIIEPGEEGPTAG (Val-316 to Gly-331 of human RAGE) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody 9E10 (hybridoma cell culture supernatant) and an anti V5 antibody (Invitrogen) were used to detect N-terminally myc- and C-terminally V5-tagged human RAGE. The anti-actin antibody A2066 was from Sigma-Aldrich. Human ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteins were detected with antibodies from Millipore. Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies either peroxidase-coupled or 35S-labeled were from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Freiburg, Germany). ECL detection reagent was from Perbio Science; all other chemicals were from Merck Biosciences (Bad Schwalbach, Germany) and Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Expression Vectors—The human RAGE cDNA clone IRALp962E1737Q2 was from RZPD (Berlin, Germany). With DNA from clone IRALp962E1737Q2 as template, PCR mutagenesis was performed to insert a myc tag coding sequence 3′ after the signal peptide coding region and a SacII site 5′ to the stop codon of human RAGE, the PCR product was inserted between KpnI and SacII sites of pcDNA6/V5-HisB (Invitrogen), thus creating a myc-RAGE-V5-His (tgRAGE)-expressing construct. To generate the untagged wild-type human RAGE expression vector pcDNA6-RAGE the human RAGE cDNA, including its own translation termination codon, was sub-cloned from IRALp962E1737Q2 into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA6/V5-HisB. Mutated RAGE cDNAs were made by standard PCR mutagenesis. Transfection of Cells—HEK Flp-In™ 293 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with pcDNA6 RAGE expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with blasticidin to generate stable cell lines expressing N-terminally Myc-tagged and C-terminally V5-His-tagged RAGE (HEK-tgRAGE cells) as well as wild-type human RAGE (HEK-RAGE) and mutated RAGE. Small Interference RNA Experiments—Stealth RNAi duplexes were purchased from Invitrogen, and transfections were performed according the manufacturer's protocol. The RAGE cleavage assay, gelatin zymography, and Western blot analysis were performed 48 h after transfection. RAGE Cleavage Assays and Inhibitor Treatments—RAGE-expressing cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates and grown for 24 h to 80–90! confluence. Cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM, and then secretion medium (SM, serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and chemicals of interest) was added. Shedding inducers like PMA or Calcimycin (A23187) were added to the secretion medium (SM) directly at the beginning of the incubation time. If experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors of proteinases, intracellular protein transport or PKC, cells were preincubated in SM containing the respective substances for 1 h at 37°C to secure uptake of the compounds. Afterward this medium was replaced by fresh SM containing the substance of interest together with the inhibitor. The concentrations of the compounds used in the experiments are given in the results part. Following an appropriate incubation period (indicated in the text and the figures) cell culture supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 660 × g to remove residual cells. Proteins in the cleared supernatants were precipitated with 10! trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C and dissolved in reducing Laemmli buffer. Always the whole amount of precipitated proteins was used for Western blot analysis (see below). For comparative and quantitative analysis, effects observed with DMSO-treated cells were used as control and were set to 100!. Adherent cells on the coated plates were washed with PBS and dissolved in reducing Laemmli buffer. The protein content of cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method after chloroform/methanol precipitation of sample aliquots. For Western blot analysis of cell lysates always 20 μg of protein was used. Deglycosylation Assay—Serum-free cell culture supernatant of RAGE-expressing cells was collected from 10-cm plates as described above. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the proteins were dissolved in 5! SDS containing 10! β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 10 min at 100 °C. Subsequently, the protein solution was diluted with 9 volumes of H2O and equally divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was treated with PNGaseF (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), which removes nearly all types of N-glycan chains from glycoproteins, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The second aliquot was treated equally but without applying PNGaseF. Finally proteins were precipitated again with trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in reducing Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Deglycosylation of cell-bound full-length RAGE was performed similarly with cell lysates as starting material. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Adherent cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for protein biotinylation with PBS containing 0.1 mm Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) the cells were incubated in secretion medium for different periods as indicated in the results part. The cells and supernatants were collected separately, and the supernatants were adjusted to 0.1! SDS. The cells were dissolved in 5! SDS, and then SDS was diluted to 0.1! by adding PBS. Biotinylated proteins were captured with NeutrAvidin Biotin-binding agarose (Pierce) for 2 h at 4°C. After that the agarose beads were washed three times with PBS/0.1! SDS. Proteins were eluted from the binding agarose with reducing Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Actin could not be detected in isolated biotinylated protein fractions, thus demonstrating the integrity of the cells and the biotinylation reagent during the course of the experiment. As a control, actin could be detected in the cell lysate (5! SDS fraction; see above). Western Blotting—Proteins of the cell culture supernatant or cells lysates were separated either by 10! SDS-PAGE or NuPAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen) electrophoresis and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were probed with respective primary and secondary antibodies. Labeled proteins were detected and quantified by chemiluminescence or phosphorimaging using the Versa-Doc system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany) or the Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS-1800 (FujiFilm Medical Systems, Düsseldorf, Germany). Expression of the housekeeping protein actin was routinely determined to confirm equal loading of proteins. Gelatin Zymography—Cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM, then SM supplemented with either PMA (1 μm) or DMSO was added to the cells. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, supernatants were collected and cleared from cells by centrifugation (660× g, 10 min). For gelatin zymography 30 μl of serum-free cell culture supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of 4 × NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen), and subsequently proteins were separated under non-reducing conditions in 10! SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1! gelatin. After electrophoresis gels were washed in 2.5! Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2). Finally the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Clear areas within the stained gel result from digestion of gelatin by the gelatinase activity of either MMP9 or MMP2. Full-length RAGE-expressing Cells Secrete a Soluble Form of RAGE Smaller Than the Splice Variant “Endogenous Secretory RAGE”—To investigate the putative proteolytic processing of human RAGE, we generated HEK cell lines stably expressing either wild-type human RAGE (HEK-RAGE cells) or esRAGE (HEK-esRAGE cells) with esRAGE being a recombinant version of the splice variant endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE). In the cell culture supernatant of HEK-RAGE and HEK-esRAGE cells soluble proteins were detected with antibody Mab5328 directed against the N terminus of human RAGE. In the supernatant of full-length RAGE-expressing cells (HEK-RAGE) we found a major 48-kDa form of RAGE and a minor one of 45 kDa (Fig. 1A). Larger RAGE variants were identified to be secreted from HEK-esRAGE cells: a major form of 51 kDa and a minor of 49 kDa (Fig. 1A). After PNGaseF-mediated deglycosylation of secreted proteins in both cases smaller forms could be detected. In lysates of HEK-RAGE cells a double band at ∼55 kDa corresponding to full-length RAGE was detected, and in lysates of HEK-esRAGE cells a diffuse band at ∼51 kDa was present (Fig. 1A). After PNGaseF-mediated deglycosylation of full-length RAGE still a double band at ∼53 kDa was detected (Fig. 1B). The occurrence of a double band is likely to be caused by different O-glycosylation and/or protein size, e.g. presence or absence of the signal peptide. Because RAGE secreted from full-length RAGE-expressing cells is smaller than endogenous secreted RAGE usually generated by alternative splicing, the data imply that sRAGE might be released by proteolysis of full-length RAGE. The Release of Soluble RAGE from Full-length RAGE-expressing Cells Is Inducible and Mediated by Proteolysis—To distinguish between shedding and proteolysis-independent protein secretion, we compared the release of soluble RAGE among cells expressing either full-length membrane-bound RAGE or recombinant versions of soluble RAGE under different experimental conditions. If RAGE-expressing cells were treated with the organomercurial agent APMA, which enables latent matrix metalloproteinases to undergo autolytic self-activation (17Stricklin G.P. Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.T. Eisen A.Z. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the release of RAGE was strongly induced exclusively in cells expressing full-length membrane-bound RAGE (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with the phorbol ester PMA induced the release of soluble RAGE from cells expressing full-length RAGE, esRAGE, or recombinant sRAGE (sRAGE, composed of amino acids 1–331 of full-length RAGE). PMA is a known inducer of shedding events, but it also enhances the release of soluble proteins via exocytosis in the secretory pathway (18Ozaki N. Miura Y. Yamada T. Kato Y. Oiso Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To differentiate induced shedding from enhanced exocytosis, we treated cells with compounds known to prevent vesicle-dependent protein secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. In cells expressing recombinant soluble RAGE forms PMA slightly enhanced RAGE expression (Fig. 2, B and D), but both brefeldin A (10 μm) as well as monensin (2 μm) prevented the PMA-induced release of RAGE from these cells (Fig. 2A). This resulted in increased amounts of intracellular RAGE (Fig. 2B). In contrast, brefeldin A and monensin were not able to block the release of RAGE from cells expressing full-length RAGE suggesting that sRAGE is released from these cells by proteolysis of already membrane-located RAGE and not by exocytosis of an intracellular sRAGE form. After PMA induction of full-length RAGE-expressing cells the secretion of RAGE was less pronounced when cells had been treated with brefeldin A (Fig. 2A, lane 5 versus 4). This observation can be explained by a reduced delivery of full-length RAGE from its site of biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to its site of proteolysis at the cell surface, because brefeldin A is known to block protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Treatment of RAGE-expressing cells with GM6001, a metalloproteinase inhibitor known to block shedding events, further supports this assumption. In full-length RAGE-expressing cells the release of RAGE was almost completely prevented by GM6001 (Fig. 2C), furthermore administration of GM6001 increased full-length RAGE levels (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the release of RAGE from cells expressing recombinant soluble RAGE forms was not affected by GM6001 (Fig. 2C). Treatment of full-length RAGE-expressing cells with either PMA or APMA always induced the release of the soluble 48-kDa RAGE form (Fig. 2, A and C); the occurrence of a 51-kDa variant, corresponding to alternatively spliced esRAGE, was not observed. This result shows that both compounds did not induce an alternative splicing mechanism. Therefore, our data clearly demonstrate that full-length RAGE is subjected to protein ectodomain shedding. When HEK-RAGE cells were treated with shedding inducers, an obvious difference became evident after either APMA or PMA stimulation. Incubation with the more potent proteinase activator APMA strongly induced the release of sRAGE (Fig. 2A) and in parallel decreased the amount of the full-length RAGE substrate (Fig. 2B). Such a clear substrate/product relationship was not observed after treatment with the shedding inducer PMA under the experimental conditions applied. Therefore, we further examined the effect of PMA under two different experimental conditions: To analyze whether RAGE located at the cell membrane is the substrate of proteolysis, proteins located at the plasma membrane were labeled with a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent before shedding was induced by PMA. Afterward the amounts of biotinylated secreted RAGE and biotinylated membrane-bound RAGE were quantified by Western blotting, as control unlabeled cells were treated equally. Treatment of full-length RAGE-expressing cells with the phorbol ester PMA (1 μm for 2 h) strongly induced the release of the soluble 48-kDa RAGE form (Fig. 3A). Compared with unstimulated conditions the increase of sRAGE was usually 2.5- to 5-fold. Quantification of full-length RAGE in total cell lysates showed only a slight decrease of full-length RAGE (Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, a significant decrease (33!) of full-length RAGE in the plasma membrane was obvious after PMA treatment (Fig. 3B, right), when the subcellular portion of RAGE located on the cell surface was investigated after biotinylation of cell-membrane proteins. Quantification of actin in cell lysates demonstrates that samples with equal amounts of proteins were compared (Fig. 3C). The experiment with biotinylated proteins demonstrates that PMA stimulates the release of already cell-surface-located full-length RAGE by a shedding mechanism. To verify our finding that the increased amount of secreted RAGE after PMA treatment is not caused by de novo gene expression, we investigated the proteolysis of RAGE in the presence of the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The PMA-induced release of sRAGE was not affected after treatment of RAGE-expressing cells with cycloheximide. When compared with DMSO-treated cells, PMA induced a 3-fold increase in sRAGE in the presence and the absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 4); further supporting the hypothesis that sRAGE is generated by proteolysis. Treatment with PMA did not alter the amount of RAGE in total cell lysates (Fig. 4). To confirm that full-length RAGE is a substrate for proteolytic cleavage, we also investigated the presence of a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment of RAGE, which should be generated simultaneously in addition to sRAGE. By using an anti-V5 antibody directed against the C terminus of epitope-tagged human RAGE (tgRAGE), we detected a ∼13-kDa RAGE fragment next to full-length RAGE (∼55 kDa) in cell lysates (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Furthermore, treatment with the shedding inducer PMA clearly increased the amount of the RAGE C-terminal fragment (Fig. 5A, lane 1 versus 3). For a variety of proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptor ectodomain shedding is known to be followed by a second proteolytic step by γ-secretase. This cleavage liberates the C-terminal intracellular part, which, at least in the case of Notch, modulates gene expression. To examine the possibility that ectodomain shedding of RAGE precedes further γ-secretase processing, we investigated the effect of γ-secretase inhibition on RAGE metabolism. Compared with DMSO-treated cells, treatment of RAGE-expressing cells with the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT increased the amount of the membrane-bound 13-kDa RAGE C-terminal fragment (RAGE-CTF) under unstimulated (Fig. 5A, lane 1 versus lane 2) and PMA-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5A, lane 3 versus lane 4). DAPT neither enhanced the expression of RAGE (Fig. 5A) nor stimulated its secretion (Fig. 5B, lane 1 versus lane 2 and lane 3 versus lane 4). Therefore, the larger amount of RAGE-CTF can most likely be assigned to its increased stability in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor. This indicates that RAGE-CTF generated by ectodomain shedding of full-length RAGE is a substrate for subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. Human RAGE Can Be Released Efficiently from the Cell Surface—To analyze the efficiency of RAGE shedding, we investigated the proteolysis of biotinylated cell surface located full-length RAGE. The release of biotinylated RAGE was monitored after isolation of biotinylated proteins from the cell culture supernatant and Western blot analysis. In parallel, the amount of biotinylated full-length RAGE remaining on the cells was analyzed. During a 5-h treatment with PMA (1 μm), a strong decrease in the amount of full-length RAGE was observed on the cell surface (Fig. 6A, lane 3 versus lanes 1 and 2). In parallel to this decrease, the amount of biotinylated shedded RAGE in the cell culture supernatant significantly increased during 5 h of PMA stimulation (Fig. 6A, lane 7 versus lanes 5 and 6). In addition, unstimulated cells demonstrated constitutive shedding of RAGE (Fig. 6A, lane 8 versus lanes 5). APMA treatment efficiently enhanced the release of the ectodomain of biotinylated RAGE from cells; within a 15-min treatment ∼75! of previously cell-membrane bound RAGE was secreted (Fig. 6B). APMA treatment (15 min) induced a much faster release of sRAGE than PMA treatment (2 h in this experiment), most likely caused by a direct APMA-dependent activation of the RAGE sheddase. Both treatments reduced the amount of cell-bound RAGE to the same extent but in the supernatant o"
https://openalex.org/W2004740563,"Many neuromuscular conditions are characterized by an exaggerated exercise-induced fatigue response that is disproportionate to activity level. This fatigue is not necessarily correlated with greater central or peripheral fatigue in patients, and some patients experience severe fatigue without any demonstrable somatic disease. Except in myopathies that are due to specific metabolic defects, the mechanism underlying this type of fatigue remains unknown. With no treatment available, this form of inactivity is a major determinant of disability. Here we show, using mouse models, that this exaggerated fatigue response is distinct from a loss in specific force production by muscle, and that sarcolemma-localized signalling by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in skeletal muscle is required to maintain activity after mild exercise. We show that nNOS-null mice do not have muscle pathology and have no loss of muscle-specific force after exercise but do display this exaggerated fatigue response to mild exercise. In mouse models of nNOS mislocalization from the sarcolemma, prolonged inactivity was only relieved by pharmacologically enhancing the cGMP signal that results from muscle nNOS activation during the nitric oxide signalling response to mild exercise. Our findings suggest that the mechanism underlying the exaggerated fatigue response to mild exercise is a lack of contraction-induced signalling from sarcolemma-localized nNOS, which decreases cGMP-mediated vasomodulation in the vessels that supply active muscle after mild exercise. Sarcolemmal nNOS staining was decreased in patient biopsies from a large number of distinct myopathies, suggesting a common mechanism of fatigue. Our results suggest that patients with an exaggerated fatigue response to mild exercise would show clinical improvement in response to treatment strategies aimed at improving exercise-induced signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2105688902,"Subtelomeric regions are often under-represented in genome sequences of eukaryotes. One of the best known examples of the use of telomere proximity for adaptive purposes are the bloodstream expression sites (BESs) of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei. To enhance our understanding of BES structure and function in host adaptation and immune evasion, the BES repertoire from the Lister 427 strain of T. brucei were independently tagged and sequenced. BESs are polymorphic in size and structure but reveal a surprisingly conserved architecture in the context of extensive recombination. Very small BESs do exist and many functioning BESs do not contain the full complement of expression site associated genes (ESAGs). The consequences of duplicated or missing ESAGs, including ESAG9, a newly named ESAG12, and additional variant surface glycoprotein genes (VSGs) were evaluated by functional assays after BESs were tagged with a drug-resistance gene. Phylogenetic analysis of constituent ESAG families suggests that BESs are sequence mosaics and that extensive recombination has shaped the evolution of the BES repertoire. This work opens important perspectives in understanding the molecular mechanisms of antigenic variation, a widely used strategy for immune evasion in pathogens, and telomere biology."
https://openalex.org/W2020830206,"The cellular tropisms of eukaryotic viruses are shaped by their need for entry receptors and intracellular transcription factors. Here we show that viral tropisms can also be regulated by tissue-specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Target sequences complementary to muscle-specific miRNAs were inserted into the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of an oncolytic picornavirus that causes lethal myositis in tumor-bearing mice. The recombinant virus still propagated in subcutaneous tumors, causing total regression and sustained viremia, but could not replicate in cells expressing complementary miRNAs and therefore did not cause myositis. This altered tropism was not due to insertional attenuation, as a control virus containing a 3′ UTR insert with a disrupted miRNA target sequence fully retained its lethal myotropism. Tissue-specific destabilization of viral genomes by miRNA target insertion provides a potentially versatile new mechanism for controlling the tropism of replicating viruses for therapy and may serve as a new modality for attenuating viruses for vaccine purposes. Kelly et al. offer a method for controlling the tropism of replicating viruses. Viral replication in a specific target tissue is inhibited by incorporation of tissue-specific microRNA targets within the viral genome. Using an oncolytic picornavirus that causes myositis in tumor-bearing mice, they show the virus is unable to replicate in muscle but still retains oncolytic activity, with implications for the clinical use of oncolytic viruses and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2021060564,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including various benzamides and hydroxamates, are currently in clinical development for a broad range of human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We recently reported the identification of a family of benzamide-type HDAC inhibitors that are relatively non-toxic compared with the hydroxamates. Members of this class of compounds have shown efficacy in cell-based and mouse models for the neurodegenerative diseases Friedreich ataxia and Huntington disease. Considerable differences in IC50 values for the various HDAC enzymes have been reported for many of the HDAC inhibitors, leading to confusion as to the HDAC isotype specificities of these compounds. Here we show that a benzamide HDAC inhibitor, a pimelic diphenylamide (106), is a class I HDAC inhibitor, demonstrating no activity against class II HDACs. 106 is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of HDACs 1, 2, and 3, although inhibition for these enzymes occurs through different mechanisms. Inhibitor 106 also has preference toward HDAC3 with Ki of ∼14 nm, 15 times lower than the Ki for HDAC1. In comparison, the hydroxamate suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid does not discriminate between these enzymes and exhibits a fast-on/fast-off inhibitory mechanism. These observations may explain a paradox involving the relative activities of pimelic diphenylamides versus hydroxamates as gene activators.

Class II is further divided into class IIa (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9) and IIb (HDAC 6 and 10), according to their sequence homology and domain organization. HDAC11 is the lone member of class IV (9de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 11Gao L.

Wieland H. Gimmnich P. Ciossek T. Maier T. Sanders K. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These compounds can be broadly grouped in four chemical classes: the hydroxamates, the benzamides, butyrate analogs, and cyclic peptides, such as depsipeptide and related compounds (12Beckers T.

Hydroxamate-based inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroamic acid (SAHA; Fig. 1A) are believed to be pan-HDAC inhibitors (14Butler L.M. Agus D.B. Scher H.I. Higgins B.

Studies of benzamide-based HDAC inhibitors have shown that these compounds are class I-specific inhibitors, and have claimed distinct pharmacological properties of the benzamide HDAC inhibitors due to specific inhibition of class I HDACs (mainly HDAC1 and HDAC3) (20Saito A. Yamashita T. Mariko Y. Nosaka Y. Tsuchiya K. Ando T. Suzuki T. Tsuruo T. Nakanishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4592-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 21Bonfils C.

Some benzamides (BML-210 and related pimelic diphenylamides 4b and 106; Fig. 1A) have been shown to up-regulate specific genes, including the frataxin gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease Friedriech ataxia, at subtoxic inhibitor concentrations (22Herman D.

Thus, the distinct pharmacological properties of the pimelic diphenylamides, as compared with the hydroxamates, cannot be explained by specificity for class I HDACs. Additionally, other benzamide HDAC inhibitors, such as MS-275, have reported IC50 values ranging from ∼740 nm to 8 μm for HDAC3, whereas the reported IC50 values for HDAC1 are more consistent, at around ∼200 nm (12Beckers T.

We discovered that the benzamide inhibitor 106, unlike the hydroxamate SAHA, is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of HDACs 1, 2, and 3, with different inhibitory mechanisms and half-lives of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. IC50 values for inhibitor 106 decreased significantly during preincubation with HDAC3, but this slow inhibition behavior is less pronounced for HDAC1 or -2. Hydroxamates, on the other hand, are fast-on/fast-off inhibitors of both HDAC1 and HDAC3. The kinetic parameters for these two classes of compounds were determined for HDACs 1 and 3, and compared with the cellular activities of 106 and SAHA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3/N-CoR2, and HDAC8 expressed in baculovirus, were purchased from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Western blots were done to verify that no HDAC1 and HDAC3 cross-contamination was present in these enzyme preparations (supplemental Fig. S1). Acetylated-Lys(acetyl)-4-methylcoumarin-7-amide (acetyl-Lys(Ac)-AMC) was purchased from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Lys-C peptidase was purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). For the class II HDACs, 4, 5, and 7, we obtained cDNAs for these human enzymes from Addgene in pcDNA3.1 with a C-terminal FLAG epitope. Protein overexpression was achieved by transfecting plasmids into HEK293t cells with 293-fectin reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed at 72 h with whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5! Triton X-100, 10! glycerol), and passed over FLAG-M2 affinity resin (Sigma) for purification. Following several washes, HDAC proteins were eluted with 5 bead volumes of 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma), and assayed without further purification. HDAC inhibitor SAHA was purchased from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA) through a custom synthesis order, and 106 (N1-(2-aminophenyl)-N7-p-tolylheptanediamide) was synthesized as previous described (23Rai M. Soragni E. Jenssen K. Burnett R. Herman D. Coppola G. Geschwind D.H. Gottesfeld J.M. Pandolfo M. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and provided by Repligen Corporation (Waltham, MA).Assay of HDAC Activities and Inhibition Kinetics—The deacetylase activities of HDACs 1, 2, and 3 were measured by assaying enzyme activity using peptidase (Lys-C peptidase and trypsin) and the synthetic substrate acetyl-Lys(Ac)-AMC, as previously described (26Wegener D. Wirsching F. Riester D. Schwienhorst A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 61-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 27Wegener D. Hildmann C. Riester D. Schwienhorst A. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 321: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Deacetylated lysine-AMC was released by the peptidase and free fluorogenic 4-methylcoumarin-7-amide (MCA) was generated. The fluorogenic MCA could then be read with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm. Assays for class II HDACs were done using acetyl-Lys(trifluoroacetyl)-AMC under the same conditions (17Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (synthesized at Scripps). All assays for HDAC activity on the acetylated lysine substrates were performed in 96-well, non-binding plates (Greiner Bio-one, NC) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (standard HDAC buffer) at ambient temperature. The final assay volume was 50 μl, except for the dilution experiment described below, which was at 100 μl. The amount of MCA generated was equal to deacetylated substrate and was normalized with a non-acetylated substrate standard (supplemental Fig. S2A).Determination of the Inhibitor IC50 Values with Preincubation—Deacetylation assays were based on the homogenous fluorescence release assay, described above. Purified recombinant enzymes were incubated with serial-diluted inhibitors at the concentrations indicated in the figures, with preincubation times ranging from 0 to 3 h, in the standard HDAC buffer (as in Fig. 1B). Acetyl-Lys(Ac)-AMC substrate (at 10 μm, corresponding to the Km for both HDAC1 and HDAC3, supplemental Fig. S2B) was added after the preincubation period, and the reaction was allowed to run for 1 h. The trypsin peptidase developer, at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, was added after 1 h, and the fluorescence emission was then measured using a Tecan M200 96-well plate reader (San Jose, CA). The IC50 was determined by fitting the data using the KaleidaGraph nonlinear regression program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).Slow, Tight-binding Kinetic Determination Using the Progression Method—Slow tight-binding kinetics of 106 with class I HDACs were evaluated by the progression curve approach described by Morrison and Walsh (28Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). In theory, there are three possible slow, tight-binding mechanisms, as previously described (29Duggleby R.G. Attwood P.V. Wallace J.C. Keech D.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3364-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The two most common ones are shown here as Mechanisms 1 and 2. E+S↔kmES↔kcatE+P+|k1↓↑k-1EIMECHANISM 1 E+S↔kmES↔kcatE+P+|k1↓↑k-1EI⇄k-2k2EI*MECHANISM 2 To determine the mechanism and associated kinetic values, a series of inhibition progression curves for HDACs 1, 2, and 3, at different concentrations of inhibitor 106, were generated by adding 100 ng of each enzyme into separate reaction mixtures containing 50 μm acetyl-Lys(Ac)-AMC substrate (5 times the Km) and 2 milliunits of Lys-C peptidase developer. Lys-C was used in the progression curve method to prevent degradation of the HDAC enzymes during the assay, allowing a linear no-inhibitor control. The generation of the fluorogenic MCA, due to the deacetylation of the lysine substrate, was assessed continuously for up to 1 h at ambient temperature. Data from each progression curve, at different inhibitor concentrations, were fit using the nonlinear regression program KaleidaGraph to the integrated rate equation for slow-binding inhibitors: [F]=vst+(v0-vs)(1-exp(-kobst))/kobs(Eq. 1) where [F] is the amount of MCA fluorophore generated, represented in arbitrary fluorescence units (r), which is proportion to the deacetylated substrate at time t. v0 and vs are the initial and the final steady-state velocities, respectively. kobs is the apparent first-order rate constant obtained by the best fit to the data. Because kobs is the only value that is not significantly altered by small systematic errors (29Duggleby R.G. Attwood P.V. Wallace J.C. Keech D.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3364-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the kobs values were then plotted against the inhibitor concentrations for which each kobs value was obtained. For Mechanism 1, the relationship between kobs and the inhibitor concentration is linear, kobs=k-1+k1[I]/(1+[S]/Km)(Eq. 2) and Ki=k-1/k1(Eq. 3) For Mechanism 2, the relationship between kobs and the inhibitor concentration is hyperbolic, kobs=k-2+k2[I]/[[I]+Ki*(1+[S]/Km)](Eq. 4) and Ki=Ki*[k-2/(k2+k-2)](Eq. 5) where Ki* is the stable complex forming constant and Ki is the overall final inhibitory constant for the entire process.Determination of Ki for Fast On/Off Inhibitors—For a classical fast on/off competitive inhibitor, such as SAHA, the steady state HDAC enzyme velocities are achieved within seconds. The deacetylation rate in the presence (vi) and absence (v0) of the inhibitor are linear, with no time dependence. Therefore, the Ki of the inhibitor can easily be determined using the ratio of vi over v0 (single step fast on/off) according to the relationship (31Tornheim K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Koh C.Y. Kazimirova M. Trimnell A. Takac P. Labuda M. Nuttall P.A. Kini R.M. J. Biol.

The Ki was then determined by fitting the data to Equation 6, using the KaleidaGraph nonlinear regression program.Comparative Disassociation through 100-fold Dilution—HDAC1 (10 μg) and HDAC3 (10 μg) were each incubated with 2 μm 106 or 100 nm SAHA, in standard deacetylase assay buffer, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, for 1 h. After this preincubation time, 1 μl of each mixture was diluted into a final volume of 100 μl, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm acetyl-Lys(Ac)-AMC substrate, and 2 milliunits of Lys-C peptidase developer, without or with each inhibitor at the initial concentration (2 μm 106 or 100 nm SAHA). The amounts of HDAC1 and HDAC3 after dilution were 100 ng in the final assay solution. Progression curves were then measured for an additional hour.Cell Culture, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—A lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a Friedreich ataxia patient (GM15850) was obtained from the NIGMS Genetic Repository (Coriell Medical Institute). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media with 10! fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES, at 37 °C in 5! CO2. After the 5th split, the cells were treated with inhibitor 106 (2 μm) or SAHA (2 μm) for 24 h, in culture medium. The treatment concentrations were determined based on growth inhibition through an MTS cell proliferation assay (Promega) (supplemental Fig. S3). These concentrations correspond approximately to the EC10 for 106, and 2 μm SAHA is near its EC50 for blocking cell proliferation. 24 h after treatment, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salts buffer (Invitrogen) to remove the inhibitor. A portion of the cell population was then harvested immediately after washing, and referred to as a time 0 point (24 h treatment point), and the rest of the cells were then re-cultured in cell culture media without added inhibitor. The re-cultured cells and controls were then harvested every hour for a total of 7 h. The cells were washed twice before lysis with a low salt lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10! glycerol, 0.5! Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitors, Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min, and followed by a 15-s sonication pulse at 3 watts (Branson Sonifier 150, Branson, CT). The cell lysates were then denatured with LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) and run on 4–12! SDS gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Total histone H3, acetylated histone H3 (K9+K14), and frataxin were visualized with primary histone H3 antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), acetylated K9+K14 histone H3 antibody from Upstate (Temecula, CA), and anti-frataxin antibody from MitoSciences (Eugene, OR), respectively, followed by rabbit (for histone H3 and acetylated H3) or mouse (for frataxin) IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, MA).RESULTSHDAC Inhibition Assays—We assayed each of the recombinant class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) and representative class II (HDACs 4, 5, and 7) enzymes with the pimelic diphenylamide HDAC inhibitor 106 (Fig. 1A). For HDAC3, a recombinant fragment of the co-repressor protein N-CoR2 was co-expressed because the deacetylase activating domain of N-CoR is required for HDAC3 activity (reviewed in Ref. 33Karagianni P. Wong J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5439-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Enzyme and inhibitor were preincubated for 1 to 3 h prior to addition of a fluorogenic substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”), and from compound titrations, IC50 values are calculated. Compound 106 exhibits good inhibitory activity against class I HDACs, with IC50 values of 150 nm for HDAC1 and 370 nm for HDAC3. 106 exhibits weaker inhibitory activities against HDAC2 and -8, 106 has an IC50 of 760 nm with HDAC2 and an IC50 of 5 μm after a 3-h preincubation with HDAC8 (supplemental Fig. S4). Because recent studies indicate that class II HDACs are not active on standard acetylated lysine peptide substrates (17Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), assays with recombinant class II HDACs 4, 5, and 7 used a trifluoracetylated lysine substrate (see Ref. 17Lahm A. Paolini C. Pallaoro M. Nardi M.C. Jones P. Neddermann P. Sambucini S. Bottomley M.J. Lo Surdo P. Carfi A. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17335-17340Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and we find that 106 has essentially no inhibitory activity against these enzymes (IC50 > 180 μm; supplemental Fig. S5). Previous studies have established that benzamide-type HDAC inhibitors are selective for class I HDAC enzymes and in particular MS-275 and other o-aminobenzamides show a ∼4 to 10-fold preference for HDAC1 over HDAC3 (12Beckers T.

Secrist P.J. Miller T.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results are thus consistent for 106 compared with other benzamides.Effects of Preincubation Time on Observed IC50 Values—SAHA has been shown to be a competitive HDAC inhibitor (12Beckers T. Burkhardt C. Wieland H. Gimmnich P. Ciossek T. Maier T. Sanders K. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Dose-response curves of SAHA showed an average IC50 of 17.3 (± 2.1) nm for HDAC1 and 24.1 (± 3.7) nm for HDAC3, independent of preincubation time (Fig. 1B), showing that SAHA rapidly reaches equilibrium with these enzymes. 106 also inhibited the deacetylase activities of HDACs 1,2, 3, and 8; however, unlike SAHA, dose-response curves and calculated IC50 values for 106 vary with enzyme-inhibitor preincubation time (Fig. 1B for HDAC1 and HDAC3; supplemental Fig. S4 for HDAC2 and HDAC8). This was especially true for HDAC3. Even after 2 h of incubation, the IC50 for 106 with HDAC3 was still decreasing. Without preincubation, 106 exhibited an IC50 of 460 nm for HDAC1, and 5.8 μm for HDAC3. After a 15-min preincubation, the IC50 for HDAC1 came to equilibrium at 138 (± 38) nm. For HDAC3, however, the IC50 for 106 did not reach a steady-state value for several hours. After a 3-h preincubation, the IC50 decreased to 380 nm; a 15-fold decrease in the IC50 value compared with the IC50 measured without preincubation. Similar results were also observed for HDAC2 and HDAC8, with higher IC50 values (supplemental Fig. S4). These observations suggest that 106 is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of class I HDACs. Also, there was a great difference in the on-rate (and presumably the off-rate) for 106 for HDAC1 and HDAC3, respectively. Thus, the IC50 of a particular enzyme/inhibitor pair is not a reliable measurement due to the variability with different procedures; i.e. preincubation periods. To better understand the mechanisms for inhibition of these enzymes and to determine the kinetic constants of slow, tight-binding inhibitors, progression curve experiments for class I HDACs were next performed.HDAC Inhibitor 106 Is a Slow, Competitive Tight-binding Inhibitor of HDACs 1 and 2—HDAC1 deacetylation progression curves were measured in the presence of different concentrations of 106 (ranging from 0.5 nm to 20 μm), performed in triplicate (Fig. 2A). The data were fit with Equation 1, using the estimated v0 and vs values to determine the kobs for each run. The kobs was then plotted against the concentration of 106 used for each determination of kobs. A linear trend was observed, indicating a competitive tight-binding mechanism, as described by Mechanism 1 (Fig. 2A). The data were then fit with Equation 2, and Ki, k1, and k–1 were determined using Equations 2 and 3. For HDAC1 and inhibitor 106, k1 was 4.9 × 104 (± 1.2 × 104) m–1 min–1, and k–1 was 0.0072 (± 0.0017) min–1. Based on a presumed first-order decay, k–1 corresponds to a half-life of ∼1.5 h for the 106-HDAC1 complex. The Ki was then determined from triplicate experiments, using Equation 3. The Ki was found to be 148 (± 36) nm for HDAC1. The kinetics for HDAC2 were also investigated at various concentrations of 106, and found to be similar to HDAC1, suggesting that inhibition follows Mechanism 1, as described above (supplemental Fig. S4). From progression curves obtained at different concentrations of 106,a Ki of 102 nm was determined for HDAC2. Due to the high peptidase sensitivity of HDAC8 (data not shown), we were unable to perform a similar kinetic analysis.FIGURE 2Time-dependent inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3 as a function of inhibitor 106 concentration. The reaction mixture contained 100 ng of enzyme in the standard HDAC Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 50 μm acetylated-lysine substrate, various concentrations of inhibitor 106 (indicated) and Lys-C peptidase (2 milliunits).

The rate constant kobs as a function of inhibitor 106 concentration was plotted (right).

Again, the data were fit with Equation 1, using the estimated v0 and vs values to determine kobs for each concentration of 106. The kobs values were then plotted against 106 concentration, and a hyperbolic relationship with an increasing inhibitor concentration was observed (Fig. 2B). This upward slope hyperbolic relationship was consistent with Mechanism 2, reflecting slow, tight-binding inhibition (having a slow step for forming a stable complex with a possible conformation change in the protein). The data were fit with Equations 4 and 5 to determine the kinetic parameters. The overall Ki value was determined to be 14 nm (± 3) nm, with Ki* of 224 nm (± 62 nm); k2 was 0.021 (± 0.002) min–1, and k–2 was 0.00143 (± 0.00197) min–1 for HDAC3. Based on a presumed f"

Irditoxin subunit amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation and cDNA sequencing. The crystal structure revealed two subunits with a three-finger protein fold, typical for ""nonconventional"" toxins such as denmotoxin, bucandin, and candoxin. This is the first colubrid three-finger toxin dimer, covalently connected via an interchain disulfide bond. Irditoxin showed taxon-specific lethality toward birds and lizards and was nontoxic toward mice. It produced a potent neuromuscular blockade at the avian neuromuscular junction (IC(50)=10 nM), comparable to alpha-bungarotoxin, but was three orders of magnitude less effective at the mammalian neuromuscular junction. Covalently linked heterodimeric three-finger toxins found in colubrid venoms constitute a new class of venom peptides, which may be a useful source of new neurobiology probes and therapeutic leads."
https://openalex.org/W2132056336,"Significant insight about biological networks arises from the study of network motifs--overly abundant network subgraphs--but such wiring patterns do not specify when and how potential routes within a cellular network are used. To address this limitation, we introduce activity motifs, which capture patterns in the dynamic use of a network. Using this framework to analyze transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we find that cells use different timing activity motifs to optimize transcription timing in response to changing conditions: forward activation to produce metabolic compounds efficiently, backward shutoff to rapidly stop production of a detrimental product and synchronized activation for co-production of metabolites required for the same reaction. Measuring protein abundance over a time course reveals that mRNA timing motifs also occur at the protein level. Timing motifs significantly overlap with binding activity motifs, where genes in a linear chain have ordered binding affinity to a transcription factor, suggesting a mechanism for ordered transcription. Finely timed transcriptional regulation is therefore abundant in yeast metabolism, optimizing the organism's adaptation to new environmental conditions."

Adenosine, via activation of A(2A) receptors, antagonizes dopamine signaling at D2 receptors and A(2A) receptor antagonists have been tested as therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease. We found a direct physical interaction between the G protein-coupled A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) and the receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). Concomitant activation of these two classes of receptors, but not individual activation of either one alone, caused a robust activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, differentiation and neurite extension of PC12 cells, spine morphogenesis in primary neuronal cultures, and cortico-striatal plasticity that was induced by a previously unknown A(2A)R/FGFR-dependent mechanism. The discovery of a direct physical interaction between the A(2A) and FGF receptors and the robust physiological consequences of this association shed light on the mechanism underlying FGF functions as a co-transmitter and open new avenues for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2073643304,"Rice architecture is an important agronomic trait and a major limiting factor for its high productivity. Here we describe a novel CCCH-type zinc finger gene, OsLIC (Oraza sativa leaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture. OsLIC encoded an ancestral and unique CCCH type zinc finge protein. It has many orthologous in other organisms, ranging from yeast to humane. Suppression of endogenous OsLIC expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice. OsLIC is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud. Genetic analysis suggested that OsLIC is epistatic to d2-1, whereas d61-1 is epistatic to OsLIC. Interestingly, sterols were significantly higher in level in transgenic shoots than in the wild type. Genome-wide expression analysis indicated that brassinosteroids (BRs) signal transduction was activated in transgenic lines. Moreover, transcription of OsLIC was induced by 24-epibrassinolide. OsLIC, with a single CCCH motif, displayed binding activity to double-stranded DNA and single-stranded polyrA, polyrU and polyrG but not polyrC. It contains a novel conserved EELR domain among eukaryotes and displays transcriptional activation activity in yeast. OsLIC may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2108143027,"Background Specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) results in the conversion of pluripotent epiblast cells into monopotent germ cell lineage. Blimp1/Prmt5 complex plays a critical role in the specification and maintenance of the early germ cell lineage. However, PGCs can be induced to dedifferentiate back to a pluripotent state as embryonic germ (EG) cells when exposed to exogenous signaling molecules, FGF-2, LIF and SCF. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we show that Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, is a highly potent agent that can replace FGF-2 to induce dedifferentiation of PGCs into EG cells. A key early event during dedifferentiation of PGCs in response to FGF-2 or TSA is the down-regulation of Blimp1, which reverses and apparently relieves the cell fate restriction imposed by it. Notably, the targets of Blimp1, which include c-Myc and Klf-4, which represent two of the key factors known to promote reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent state, are up-regulated. We also found early activation of the LIF/Stat-3 signaling pathway with the translocation of Stat-3 into the nucleus. By contrast, while Prmt5 is retained in EG cells, it translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it probably has an independent role in regulating pluripotency. Conclusions/Significance We propose that dedifferentiation of PGCs into EG cells may provide significant mechanistic insights on early events associated with reprogramming of committed cells to a pluripotent state."

We determined the three-dimensional structures of HMP-P synthase and its complexes with the product HMP-P and a substrate analog imidazole ribotide. The structure of HMP-P synthase reveals a homodimer in which each protomer comprises three domains: an N-terminal domain with a novel fold, a central (βα)8 barrel and a disordered C-terminal domain that contains a conserved CX2CX4C motif, which is suggestive of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Biochemical studies have confirmed that HMP-P synthase is iron sulfur cluster–dependent, that it is a new member of the radical SAM superfamily and that HMP-P and 5′-deoxyadenosine are products of the reaction. Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy confirm the presence of one [4Fe-4S] cluster. Structural comparisons reveal that HMP-P synthase is homologous to a group of adenosylcobalamin radical enzymes. This similarity supports an evolutionary relationship between these two superfamilies."

Micron. 2005; 36: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but the detailed arrangement of the subunits in the complex, especially in the stalk region, remains a matter of ongoing controversy. Previously, we have determined the binding sites of subunits H (23Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41942-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and C (31Zhang Z. Inoue T. Forgac M. Wilkens S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in the V-ATPase stalk region and we have argued that these two subunits are positioned to play a key role in the mechanism of reversible dissociation and activity silencing, respectively (32Wilkens S. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Micron. 2005; 36: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the vacuolar ATPase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae calculated from electron microscopic images at a resolution of 25 Å. Antibody labeling was used to localize subunits A, E, and G. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of intact yeast V1-ATPase revealed that subunits E and G are most easily lost during collision-induced dissociation, consistent with a peripheral binding location of these two subunits. This information together with our recent localization of subunits C and H and the published x-ray crystal structures of V- and F-ATPase subunits and domains allowed us to construct a detailed structural model of the yeast vacuolar ATPase. We speculate that the C subunit is interacting with two peripheral stalks and that breaking or forming these interactions is a key step in the mechanism of reversible V-ATPase dissociation/re-association. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Premixed YEPD (1! yeast extract, 2! peptone, 2! glucose) and leucine dropout medium were from Difco and Invitrogen, respectively. M2 anti-FLAG affinity-agarose, anti-FLAG IgG, and FLAG peptide anti-HA IgG were from Sigma. Anti-subunit A and B monoclonal antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay system (Pierce). Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—The yeast strains expressing Vma10p fused to a N-terminal FLAG tag and Vma4p fused to a C-terminal triple HA tag were described earlier (30Zhang Z. Charsky C.

Preparation of Yeast V1- and V1V0-ATPase—Yeast V1-ATPase with a FLAG tag fused to the N terminus of subunit G (Vma10p-FLAG) was purified as described (30Zhang Z. Charsky C. Kane P.M. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47299-47306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intact yeast V1V0-ATPase (Vma10p-NT-FLAG) was purified as described (31Zhang Z. Inoue T. Forgac M. Wilkens S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Briefly, vacuoles were extracted at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml with 1! dodecyl maltoside and the extracted protein was subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.05! P-MAL C12 (Anatrace). Prior to use, the P-MAL C12 was subjected to ultrafiltration through a 10-kDa cut-off Amicon Ultra centrifugation filter device to remove the larger polymers. V-ATPase containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and used for antibody labeling experiments (see below). Purified yeast V-ATPase containing a HA tag fused to the N terminus of subunit C (Vma5p-HA; characterized in Ref. 34Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Forgac, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA. Initial image analysis of the Vma5p-HA V-ATPase has been described (31Zhang Z. Inoue T. Forgac M. Wilkens S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The V1-ATPase sample was subjected to buffer exchange into 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, by using an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter device with a cut-off of 10 kDa (Millipore). The sample was sprayed from a solution of 2 μl containing 0.5 μm (0.3 mg/ml) of the complex. The native and tandem mass spectrometry measurements were performed in positive ion mode on a modified Q-TOF (quadrupole time-of-flight) instrument (Micromass, UK) (35Sobott F. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 36van den Heuvel R.H. $4 Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 7473-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Nanospray glass capillaries were used to introduce the samples into the Z-spray source. The source pressure was increased to 10 mbar to create increased collisional cooling. The needle voltage was 1,500 V, and the sample cone voltage was 150 V. For the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) measurements, precursor ions of specific m/z were selected in the quadrupole. Subsequently, they were accelerated before the collision cell applying voltages from 10 to 200 V over this cell. Xenon was used as the collision gas in the MS/MS experiments to increase ion transmission and energy transfer efficiency during the process (37Lorenzen K. Versluis C. van Duijn E. van den Heuvel R. H.H. Heck A. J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 268: 198-206Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Preparation of Anti-subunit A Fab—Anti-subunit A monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG2a 8B1) was digested by immobilized papain (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The progress of monoclonal antibody digestion was followed by SDS-PAGE. Fab fragments were used without further purification. Immunolabeling—For immunolabeling, V-ATPase containing the targeted antigen was mixed with the corresponding antibody at a defined molar ratio and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. V1-ATPase was mixed with 8B1 Fab at a 1:6 molar ratio. For detection of subunits E and G, Vma4p-CT-HA and Vma10p-NT-FLAG V-ATPase were incubated with antibody and the unbound antibody was separated from labeled V-ATPase by glycerol density centrifugation in the presence of 0.05! dodecyl maltoside as described in Ref. 31Zhang Z. Inoue T. Forgac M. Wilkens S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. V-ATPase containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration for analysis by SDS-PAGE or used directly for negative stain electron microscopy. Negative Stain Electron Microscopy—For negative staining, 5 μl of protein solution at a concentration of between 20 and 50 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) was applied to glow discharged carbon-coated copper grids. Grids were washed once with water, stained with 1! uranyl acetate for 1 min, and air-dried. Grids were examined in a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Images were recorded in low dose mode with a 2048 × 2048 pixel charge-coupled device (Ultrascan 1000, Gatan Inc.) in single frame or 2X2 montage mode. Images of stained samples were recorded with an underfocus of ∼1 μm and an electron optical magnification setting of ×26,500, placing the 1st zero of the contrast transfer function at around 1/20 Å-1. Images of anti-HA antibody-labeled Vma4p-CT-HA V-ATPase were recorded with a JEM-2100 (JEOL) transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Images were recorded with a F224HD CCD camera (TVIPS) at an electron optical magnification of ×40,000 and an underfocus of 1500 nm. Pixel sizes on the specimen level were determined with bacteriorhodopsin and catalase two-dimensional crystals as standards. Image Analysis and Three-dimensional Reconstruction—Images were analyzed with the EMAN (38Lüdtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar) and IMAGIC 5 (39van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) software packages running on Macintosh G5 and SGI workstations (O2 and Octane) essentially as described (21Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Single particles were selected interactively from CCD frames using the Boxer program in the EMAN package (38Lüdtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). All subsequent image analysis was performed with the IMAGIC5 package of programs (39van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The images were normalized and band pass filtered to remove low (<0.008 Å-1) and high (>0.133 Å-1) spatial frequencies. The data sets were then analyzed by the alignment by classification procedure (40Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) leading to sets of initial references that were used in a first multireference alignment step. The multireference alignment was iterated until no further improvement in the class sums was obtained. Three-dimensional Reconstruction—To start up the yeast V-ATPase three-dimensional reconstruction, projections of the three-dimensional model of the bovine V-ATPase (23Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41942-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were used as references to align a data set of ∼25,000 images of yeast V-ATPase (Vma5p-HA) (31Zhang Z. Inoue T. Forgac M. Wilkens S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After seven rounds of refinement, the resulting model was filtered to remove noise (density not connected to the main volume of the model) and forward-projected along 49 directions uniformly distributed over the Euler sphere. The 49 projections were normalized and used as references in a new multireference alignment step. Two hundred images aligned to each reference were averaged and used as input projections for a new three-dimensional model. This process was iterated increasing the numbers of forward projections and images averaged for each reference until no further improvement was observed. At this point, classification of the aligned data set produced very similar class sums compared with the ones used to start up the three-dimensional reconstruction (not shown). The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated by calculating the Fourier shell correlation between two three-dimensional models each calculated from half the input projections as described in Ref. 41Böttcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar. The final model was filtered to 0.05 Å-1, corresponding to the first zero in the contrast transfer function. Fitting of Atomic Structures of Subunits—The atomic structures we used to fit into the V-ATPase model were the crystal structure of the α3β3 subcomplex of ATP synthase from Bacillus PS3 (Protein Data Bank 1sky), the crystal structure of subunit C of the yeast V-ATPase (PDB 1u7l; and the low resolution conformer, Ref. 42Drory O. Frolow F. Nelson N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, coordinates kindly provided by Dr. Nathan Nelson, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel), the crystal structure of the γ subunit of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (PDB 1e79), the crystal structure of subunit H of the yeast V-ATPase (PDB 1ho8; Ref. 43Sagermann M. Stevens T.H. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 7134-7139Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the ac12 subcomplex of Escherichia coli ATP synthase derived from NMR data and modeling (PDB 1c17) and the k10 ring of the A/V-ATPase from Enterococcus hirae (PDB 2bl2). The following structures were used as templates for homology modeling using Fugue and SwissModel: the crystal structure of the A subunit of the archaeal A-ATPase from P. horikoshii (PDB 1vdz), the crystal structure of the B subunit of the A-ATPase from Methanosarcina mazei (PDB 2c61), and the crystal structure of subunit C (the homolog of yeast V-ATPase subunit d) of V-ATPase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 1r5z). The structural model of the subunit EG heterodimer (peripheral stalk) included the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of subunit E from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PDB 2dma). The N-terminal domains of the EG heterodimer were modeled as a pair of interacting α helices based on secondary structure and coiled coil prediction (44Kish-Trier E. Briere L.A. Dunn S.D. Wilkens S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Automated, semi-automated, and manual docking was done with Situs (45Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. McCammon J.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and Chimera (46Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28898) Google Scholar), respectively. A description of the fitting procedures and the rationales for placing the subunits is given in supplementary information Table S2. Yeast V-ATPase Three-dimensional Model—Fig. 1 shows surface representations of the three-dimensional EM-derived model of the yeast vacuolar ATPase. The volume was reconstructed from 220 averages obtained from a data set of ∼25,000 molecular images. The resolution of the final model was 25 Å as determined by the Fourier shell correlation algorithm using a cut-off of 0.5 (see supplemental Fig. S1). Image analysis was initiated by a first round of multireference alignment using projections of the three-dimensional model of the bovine V-ATPase (23Wilkens S. Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41942-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All subsequent refinements were performed independently of the bovine model (a comparison of the yeast and bovine V-ATPase models is shown in supplemental Fig. S2). Overall, the complex has a cylinder-like shape with a diameter of about 13.9 nm and a height of about 24.5 nm. The cytoplasmic V1 domain (see Fig. 1, A1, for the assignment of the V1 and V0 domains) has a pseudo 3-fold symmetry as evident from the top view shown in image B1 (see arrows and arrowheads). The pseudo 3-fold symmetry of the V1 is due to the alternating arrangement of the three A and B subunits. Three of the large subunits show the earlier described “knob”-like densities (Ref. 21Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, see short arrows in images A1-A3 and B1). The other three subunits have elongated densities bound at their periphery (see arrowheads). The membrane-embedded V0 has a smooth surface without obvious protrusions. The bottom view of the V0, however, shows a significant asymmetry due to the presence of the C-terminal domain of the single copy V0-a subunit at the outside of the proteolipid ring (see red circle in image B3). The V1 and V0 domains are joined by a collar-like structure that surrounds the central stalk in an arc-like fashion for about 270° (see image B2). The arc is connected to the V1 by two clearly resolved densities (peripheral stalks; see long arrows in images A1 and A3). These two peripheral stalks extend from the elongated densities running down from the top of the V1 domain. An elongated density can also be seen at the peripheral top half of the third subunit of that kind (see arrowhead in image A2), this third elongated density is less well resolved and does not seem to extend into a peripheral stalk at the contour level chosen to render the volumes (see Fig. S3 for a map at lower contour showing the third peripheral stalk density more clearly). The arc surrounding the central stalk is connected to the membrane-embedded V0 by the N-terminal domain of the V0-a subunit (see asterisk in image a1). Another weak connection is seen on the opposite side (see open arrow). Immunolocalization of Subunits: Subunit A—The catalytic core of the V-ATPase is made of three subunit AB heterodimers that are arranged in a pseudo-hexagonal fashion around a central cavity. Both A and B subunits bind nucleotide, but only the A subunits catalyze the hydrolysis reaction. To determine which of the large densities in the V1 domain correspond to subunit A, purified yeast V1-ATPase was incubated with Fab fragments derived from subunit A-specific 8B1 monoclonal antibody at a molar ratio of 1:6. Fig. 2A shows image analysis of anti-subunit A-labeled V1 ATPase. A data set of 7000 single particles was analyzed by alignment and classification. Fig. 2A, images 1 and 4 show a side and top view projection of unlabeled V1-ATPase, respectively (32Wilkens S. Zhang Z. Zheng Y. Micron. 2005; 36: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Images 2, 3, 5, and 6 of Fig. 2A show four of the most representative averages of V1-ATPase labeled with the 8B1 Fab. The comparison with unlabeled V1-ATPase (images 1 and 4) revealed that the Fab binds to the knob-like densities at the top of V1-ATPase (see arrow in image 1 of Fig. 2A), confirming our earlier speculation (21Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that the three knob-like structures are part of the three A subunits (see arrowheads). As seen in the class averages, up to two copies of Fab can be seen bound to one V1 molecule. It is possible that a third Fab was hidden in projection, but the possibility that the three A subunits exist in different conformations and that one of them was unable to bind the Fab cannot be excluded at this point. Immunolocalization of Subunits E and G—Purified yeast V-ATPase containing subunit G tagged with a FLAG peptide at the N terminus was mixed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody at a molar ratio of 1:5 and excess antibody was separated from labeled V-ATPase by density gradient centrifugation. SDS-PAGE of gradient fractions showed that anti-FLAG antibody was co-migrating with the V-ATPase peak during the centrifugation indicating binding of the antibody to the G-subunit N terminus in the native complex (SD"
https://openalex.org/W2051577992,"Background Bone remodeling relies on the tightly regulated interplay between bone forming osteoblasts and bone digesting osteoclasts. Several studies have now described the molecular mechanisms by which osteoblasts control osteoclastogenesis and bone degradation. It is currently unclear whether osteoclasts can influence bone rebuilding. Methodology/Principal Findings Using in vitro cell systems, we show here that mature osteoclasts, but not their precursors, secrete chemotactic factors recognized by both mature osteoblasts and their precursors. Several growth factors whose expression is upregulated during osteoclastogenesis were identified by DNA microarrays as candidates mediating osteoblast chemotaxis. Our subsequent functional analyses demonstrate that mature osteoclasts, whose platelet-derived growth factor bb (PDGF-bb) expression is reduced by siRNAs, exhibit a reduced capability of attracting osteoblasts. Conversely, osteoblasts whose platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) expression is reduced by siRNAs exhibit a lower capability of responding to chemotactic factors secreted by osteoclasts. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that, in vitro mature osteoclasts control osteoblast chemotaxis via PDGF-bb/PDGFR-β signaling. This may provide one key mechanism by which osteoclasts control bone formation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2014346447,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members, including TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins, exert diverse biological activities in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, embryonic development, and many other processes. These effects are largely mediated by Smad proteins. Smad7 is a negative regulator for the signaling of TGF-β family members. Dysregulation of Smad7 is associated with pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases. However, the in vivo physiological roles of Smad7 have not been elucidated due to the lack of a mouse model with significant loss of Smad7 function. Here we report generation and initial characterization of Smad7 mutant mice with targeted deletion of the indispensable MH2 domain. The majority of Smad7 mutant mice died in utero due to multiple defects in cardiovascular development, including ventricular septal defect and non-compaction, as well as outflow tract malformation. The surviving adult Smad7 mutant mice had impaired cardiac functions and severe arrhythmia. Further analyses suggest that Smad2/3 phosphorylation was elevated in atrioventricular cushion in the heart of Smad7 mutant mice, accompanied by increased apoptosis in this region. Taken together, these observations pinpoint an important role of Smad7 in the development and function of the mouse heart in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2006037174,"Wnt5a is a morphogen that activates the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and serves multiple functions during development. PCP signaling controls the orientation of cells within an epithelial plane as well as convergent extension (CE) movements. Wnt5a was previously reported to promote differentiation of A9–10 dopaminergic (DA) precursors in vitro. However, the signaling mechanism in DA cells and the function of Wnt5a during midbrain development in vivo remains unclear. We hereby report that Wnt5a activated the GTPase Rac1 in DA cells and that Rac1 inhibitors blocked the Wnt5a-induced DA neuron differentiation of ventral midbrain (VM) precursor cultures, linking Wnt5a-induced differentiation with a known effector of Wnt/PCP signaling. In vivo, Wnt5a was expressed throughout the VM at embryonic day (E)9.5, and was restricted to the VM floor and basal plate by E11.5–E13.5. Analysis of Wnt5a−/− mice revealed a transient increase in progenitor proliferation at E11.5, and a precociously induced NR4A2+ (Nurr1) precursor pool at E12.5. The excess NR4A2+ precursors remained undifferentiated until E14.5, when a transient 25% increase in DA neurons was detected. Wnt5a−/− mice also displayed a defect in (mid)brain morphogenesis, including an impairment in midbrain elongation and a rounded ventricular cavity. Interestingly, these alterations affected mostly cells in the DA lineage. The ventral Sonic hedgehog-expressing domain was broadened and flattened, a typical CE phenotype, and the domains occupied by Ngn2+ DA progenitors, NR4A2+ DA precursors and TH+ DA neurons were rostrocaudally reduced and laterally expanded. In summary, we hereby describe a Wnt5a regulation of Wnt/PCP signaling in the DA lineage and provide evidence for multiple functions of Wnt5a in the VM in vivo, including the regulation of VM morphogenesis, DA progenitor cell division, and differentiation of NR4A2+ DA precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2115550020,"Serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -1 is secreted mainly by the liver and circulates bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), either as binary complexes or ternary complexes with IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5 and an acid-labile subunit (ALS). The purpose of this study was to genetically dissect the role of IGF-1 circulatory complexes in somatic growth, skeletal integrity, and metabolism. Phenotypic comparisons of controls and four mouse lines with genetic IGF-1 deficits-liver-specific IGF-1 deficiency (LID), ALS knockout (ALSKO), IGFBP-3 (BP3) knockout, and a triply deficient LID/ALSKO/BP3 line-produced several novel findings. 1) All deficient strains had decreased serum IGF-1 levels, but this neither predicted growth potential or skeletal integrity nor defined growth hormone secretion or metabolic abnormalities. 2) IGF-1 deficiency affected development of both cortical and trabecular bone differently, effects apparently dependent on the presence of different circulating IGF-1 complexes. 3) IGFBP-3 deficiency resulted in increased linear growth. In summary, each IGF-1 complex constituent appears to play a distinct role in determining skeletal phenotype, with different effects on cortical and trabecular bone compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2089120494,"Gram-negative bacteria utilize specialized machinery to translocate drugs and protein toxins across the inner and outer membranes, consisting of a tripartite complex composed of an inner membrane secondary or primary active transporter (IMP), a periplasmic membrane fusion protein, and an outer membrane channel. We have investigated the assembly and function of the MacAB/TolC system that confers resistance to macrolides in Escherichia coli. The membrane fusion protein MacA not only stabilizes the tripartite assembly by interacting with both the inner membrane protein MacB and the outer membrane protein TolC, but also has a role in regulating the function of MacB, apparently increasing its affinity for both erythromycin and ATP. Analysis of the kinetic behavior of ATP hydrolysis indicated that MacA promotes and stabilizes the ATP-binding form of the MacB transporter. For the first time, we have established unambiguously the dimeric nature of a noncanonic ABC transporter, MacB that has an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain, by means of nondissociating mass spectrometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and atomic force microscopy. Structural studies of ABC transporters indicate that ATP is bound between a pair of nucleotide binding domains to stabilize a conformation in which the substrate-binding site is outward-facing. Consequently, our data suggest that in the presence of ATP the same conformation of MacB is promoted and stabilized by MacA. Thus, MacA would facilitate the delivery of drugs by MacB to TolC by enhancing the binding of drugs to it and inducing a conformation of MacB that is primed and competent for binding TolC. Our structural studies are an important first step in understanding how the tripartite complex is assembled."
https://openalex.org/W2032297112,"The glycan determinant CD15 (also known as Lewis x, or Le(x)) is a distinguishing marker for human myeloid cells and mediates neutrophil adhesion to dendritic cells. Despite broad interest in this structure, the mechanisms underlying CD15 expression remain relatively uncharacterized. Accordingly, we investigated the molecular basis of increasing CD15 expression associated with human myeloid cell differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis of differentiating cells together with biochemical studies using inhibitors of glycan synthesis and of sialidases showed that increased CD15 expression is not due to de novo biosynthesis of CD15, but results predominantly from induction of alpha(2-3)-sialidase activity, which yields CD15 from cell-surface sialyl-CD15 (also known as sialyl-Lewis x, sLe(x) or CD15s). This differentiation-associated conversion of surface CD15s to CD15 occurs mainly on glycoproteins. Until now, modulation of post-translational glycan modifications has been attributed solely to dynamic variations in glycosyltransferase expression. Our results unveil a new paradigm by demonstrating a critical role for post-Golgi membrane glycosidase activity in the 'biosynthesis' of a key glycan determinant."
https://openalex.org/W2116320278,"Macrophages are key to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. They take up and store excessive amounts of cholesterol associated with modified low density lipoprotein, eventually becoming foam cells that display altered immune responsiveness. We studied the effects of cholesterol accumulation on phagosome formation and maturation, using lipid transport antagonists and cholesterol transport-deficient mutants. In macrophages treated with U18666A, a transport antagonist that prevents cholesterol exit from late endosomes/lysosomes, the early stages of maturation proceeded normally; phagosomes acquired Rab5, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, and EEA1 and merged with LAMP-containing vesicles. However, fusion with lysosomes was impaired. Rab7, which is required for phagolysosome formation, was acquired by phagosomes but remained inactive. Maturation was also studied in fibroblasts from Niemann-Pick type C individuals that have defective cholesterol transport. Transfection of FcγIIA receptors was used to confer phagocytic capability to these fibroblasts. Niemann-Pick type C phagosomes failed to fuse with lysosomes, whereas wild type fibroblasts formed normal phagolysosomes. These findings indicate that cholesterol accumulation can have a detrimental effect on phagosome maturation by impairing the activation of Rab7, sequestering it and its effectors in cholesterol-enriched multilamellar compartments. Macrophages are key to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. They take up and store excessive amounts of cholesterol associated with modified low density lipoprotein, eventually becoming foam cells that display altered immune responsiveness. We studied the effects of cholesterol accumulation on phagosome formation and maturation, using lipid transport antagonists and cholesterol transport-deficient mutants. In macrophages treated with U18666A, a transport antagonist that prevents cholesterol exit from late endosomes/lysosomes, the early stages of maturation proceeded normally; phagosomes acquired Rab5, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, and EEA1 and merged with LAMP-containing vesicles. However, fusion with lysosomes was impaired. Rab7, which is required for phagolysosome formation, was acquired by phagosomes but remained inactive. Maturation was also studied in fibroblasts from Niemann-Pick type C individuals that have defective cholesterol transport. Transfection of FcγIIA receptors was used to confer phagocytic capability to these fibroblasts. Niemann-Pick type C phagosomes failed to fuse with lysosomes, whereas wild type fibroblasts formed normal phagolysosomes.

Macrophages are key to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. They take up and store excessive amounts of cholesterol associated with oxidized low density lipoproteins through scavenger receptors, eventually becoming foam cells that display altered immune responsiveness. Circulating blood monocytes are attracted and activated by a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1, -6, -8, -10, and -12 and tumor necrosis factor-α, produced by subendothelial cells in response to infiltrating lipoproteins (1Takahashi K. Takeya M. Sakashita N. Med. Electron Microsc. 2002; 35: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the arterial intima, monocytes differentiate into macrophages (2Bobryshev Y.V. Micron. 2006; 37: 208-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), at least in part in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor present in atherosclerotic lesions (3Clinton S.K. Underwood R. Hayes L. Sherman M.L. Kufe D.W. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 301-316PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rosenfeld M.E. Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Ord V.A. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar). These subendothelial macrophages proceed to ingest oxidized low density lipoprotein and other modified forms of low density lipoprotein by either endocytosis or phagocytosis, depending on the size of the particles. Scavenger receptors feature prominently in the uptake of modified LDL particles, but other receptors also contribute (1Takahashi K. Takeya M. Sakashita N. Med. Electron Microsc. 2002; 35: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Vainio S. Ikonen E. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A key event during atherogenesis is the conversion of blood-derived macrophages into foam cells, which are characterized by a massive accumulation of cholesterol esters in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (6Wustner D. Mondal M. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2005; 6: 396-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lipid-laden foam cells are found within the subendothelial space of arteries in the fatty streaks of early lesions as well as in more advanced atherosclerotic plaques (7Lucas A.D. Greaves D.R. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2001; 3: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Excessive uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein is thought to be the primary cause of the accumulation of free and esterified cholesterol in foam cells. Normally, internalized lipids are delivered to lysosomes, where cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed. The released free cholesterol is then transported out of the lysosomes and, if present in excess, it is re-esterified in the endoplasmic reticulum for storage in lipid droplets (8Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). During the early fatty streak phase of atherosclerotic disease, the inordinate amount of accumulated lipid generates the large cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of foam cells. As the disease advances from a fatty streak to a fibrous plaque, lipid accumulates also in the lysosomes of macrophages. Lysosomes play a critical role in the innate immune function of macrophages by fusing with phagosomes. Insertion of lysosomal proton pumps is required for effective phagosomal acidification that, together with the delivery of microbicidal lysosomal contents, is key for the elimination of pathogens. Luminal acidification and protein degradation are also central to antigen presentation. These functions could in principle be altered by the excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the lysosomes of late stage foam cells. Remarkably little is known about the effects of excess lysosomal lipid accumulation on the immune function of macrophages. This paucity of information is most likely the result of technical limitations; it is virtually impossible to isolate and analyze primary late stage foam cells, and generation of foam cells in vitro by exposure to synthetically modified LDL is a time-consuming and expensive enterprise that has yielded varying results in different laboratories. In this report, we used pharmacological and genetic means to induce a pronounced and reliable accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes and were able to study its consequences on the formation, acidification, and maturation of phagosomes.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-donkey antibodies were also from Jackson. Cell Culture and Transfection—RAW264.7 cells (called RAW cells hereafter) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5! fetal bovine serum (v/v) at 37 °C in 5! CO2 under a humidified atmosphere. Where indicated, the cells were incubated overnight with the specified concentration of U18666A. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) fibroblasts (cell lines 18684 and 20849) and control fibroblasts (cell lines 4212 and 4103) were a gift from Dr. John Callahan (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). The NPC and control fibroblasts were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium with 10! fetal bovine serum (v/v) and 1:100 antibiotic at 37 °C in 5! CO2 under a humidified atmosphere. Transfections were performed using either FuGene-6 or FuGene-HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were used within 24–48 h of transfection. DNA Constructs—The generation of the plasmids used for the expression of wild-type GFP-conjugated Rab5 (9Scott C.C. Cuellar-Mata P. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12770-12776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and Rab7, Rab7(Q67L) (10Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and EEA1 (11Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) is described in detail elsewhere. RFP-conjugated Rab7 (plasmid 14436) was purchased from AddGene. The plasmid encoding FcγIIA-GFP was constructed by cloning FcγIIA cDNA into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) at HindIII and SacII sites (12Booth J.W. Kim M.K. Jankowski A. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis Assay—IgG-opsonized latex beads and RBC were used interchangeably as phagocytic targets, with indistinguishable results. Latex beads were opsonized with 1 mg/ml human IgG for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Sheep RBC were opsonized with donkey anti-sheep IgG at 1:50 for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. RAW cells grown on glass coverslips were changed to prewarmed serumfree Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were overlaid with 50–100 μl of opsonized beads or RBC. In most experiments, phagocytosis was synchronized by centrifugation of the cells after the addition of beads or RBCs at 300 × g for 1 min. The samples were incubated with the beads or RBC for 3–15 min at 37 °C, as specified. RBCs that were not internalized were lysed by hypotonic shock with water. External beads were distinguished from ingested beads by labeling with Cy5-, Cy3-, or Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG antibodies. The cells were then placed back at 37 °C to allow maturation to proceed for the indicated time. The phagocytic index is defined as the number of phagosomes per 100 macrophages. This value was estimated by differential interference contrast microscopy, and the external adherent beads were discounted based on their fluorescence as a result of secondary labeling with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies against human IgG or rabbit IgG. In the case of NPC fibroblasts, phagocytosis was permitted for 20 min, followed by secondary antibody labeling of external beads and then maturation for 40 min. Fluid Phase Endocytosis—To label the lysosomal compartment, RAW cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium with 0.2 mg/ml rhodamine dextran (Mr 10,000) in the presence or absence of U18666A. The dextran-containing medium was then removed, and the cells were chased in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of U18666A for 2 h to ensure delivery of contents to lysosomal compartments. A similar pulse-chase protocol was applied to NPC and control fibroblasts. Immunostaining, Fluorescence Microscopy, and Image Analysis—Detection of LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 by immunofluorescence was performed after fixing and permeabilizing the cells in methanol, blocking in 5! donkey serum, and then probing with rat anti-mouse LAMP-1 or rat anti-mouse LAMP-2 at 1:20 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, samples were incubated with Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rat antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed and mounted on slides using Dako. A similar procedure was used to detect LAMP-2 and EEA1. Detection of cholesterol by fluorescence microscopy was performed after fixing cells in 4! paraformaldehyde, followed by quenching with 100 mm glycine and then staining for 16 h at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml filipin. Analysis of the distribution and density of the membrane markers was performed using either an LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) or a spinning-disk laser confocal microscope (Quorum) with a ×63 oil immersion objective. Image analysis was performed using Volocity version 3.2 (Improvision). Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Cells grown on coverslips were transfected with wild-type GFP-Rab7 or YFP-Rab7(Q67L), and after 24–48 h, individual coverslips were placed into Attofluor chambers that were mounted on the heated stage of the confocal laser-scanning microscope. After acquiring two base-line fluorescence measurements, one of the selected areas was irreversibly photobleached, and then the fluorescence of both areas was measured over time. The fractional fluorescence recovery of the bleached area was determined relative to the average of the two prebleach measurements. The unbleached area was used to estimate and correct for possible bleaching incurred during image acquisition. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 2! glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorenson's phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 5 min before being scraped off of the coverslip and centrifuged. Fixation was continued at room temperature for at least a further 1 h. Cells were then postfixed in 1! OsO4 in phosphate buffer at room temperature for 2 h, stained en bloc for 1 h with 1! uranyl acetate in H2O, and then dehydrated and embedded in Epon resin. Sections 80 nm in thickness were collected on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were viewed using an FEI Tecnai 20 electron microscope, and images were captured using a Gatan Dualview camera. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1× Laemmli buffer. Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7! polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 1 h with 5! bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (v/v) with 0.1! Tween 20 (v/v), and then probed for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibody in blocking solution. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature, washed vigorously, and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Spectroscopic Determination of LAMP Content—RAW cells were grown on 6-well plates and treated with or without U18666A. Following treatment with the drug, the cells were fixed in methanol and exposed to LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 antibodies, followed by a secondary, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. The amount of horseradish peroxidase associated with the cells was then quantified using the o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent kit, followed by spectrophotometric measurement at 492 nm. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a loading control and was quantified similarly. Statistics—All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. For comparisons of means, paired t-tests or analysis of variance were used, as appropriate. A probability of <0.05 was deemed significant. Signals were deemed “strong” if the marker was visible all around the phagosome with intensity comparable with that of the punctate signal from endosomes or lysosomes. Signals were scored as “weak” when the marker was visible all around the phagosome with intensity lower than that of the endosomes or lysosomes. Significance was determined combining the strong and weak signals as positive. A signal was considered negative if the marker was absent from the vicinity of the phagosome or if its distribution around the phagosome was discontinuous, indicative of vesicle apposition without fusion. To mimic the effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein on lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, we treated cultured RAW macrophages with compound U18666A, a commercially available cholesterol transport antagonist. This compound has been previously shown to reduce cholesterol efflux from lysosomes (13Liscum L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tangirala R.K. Mahlberg F.H. Glick J.M. Jerome W.G. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9653-9660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It specifically inhibits the movement of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the plasma membrane, resulting in the accumulation of free cholesterol in the lumen of late endosomes/lysosomes. The advantages of this cholesterol-loading method include its rapidity, homogeneous effectiveness, and low cost. As reported earlier for other cells, macrophages incubated 16 h with 0.75 or 1.0 μg/ml U18666A displayed a marked intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, visualized by staining with filipin (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with previous reports (16Sobo K. Le Blanc I. Luyet P. P Fivaz M. Ferguson C. Parton R. G Gruenberg J. van der Goot F.G. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e851Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the excess cholesterol was found in comparatively large intracellular structures, probably late endosomes/lysosomes. Accordingly, ultrastructural analysis of U18666A-treated cells revealed a marked increase in the number, size, and electron density of multivesicular and multilamellar structures that are typical of the late stages of the endocytic pathway (Fig. 1, C and D). Two other lines of evidence suggest that the excess cholesterol accumulated in enlarged lysosomes. LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, both resident membrane proteins of lysosomes, concentrated in large punctate structures in cells treated with U18666A (Fig. 1, E and F). The enlarged appearance of the LAMP-containing compartments was due in part to a net accumulation of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in the cholesterol-laden cells, as revealed by immunoblotting and by the quantitative spectroscopic immunoassay described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1I). Second, the enlargement of the lysosomes was validated when this compartment was labeled selectively using a pulse-chase protocol with a fluorescent fluid-phase marker (Fig. 1, G and H). We proceeded to study the effect of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation on the immune responsiveness of macrophages. Specifically, we compared the ability of control and cholesterolladen macrophages (as a result of U18666A treatment) to engulf IgG-opsonized particles by phagocytosis. The phagocytic index, defined as the number of particles ingested per 100 cells, was quantified in cells treated without or with U18666A. The phagocytic index was depressed by ∼40 and 55! after treatment with 0.75 and 1.0 μg/ml U18666A, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1). Although the degree of inhibition was significant, the remaining phagocytic activity enabled us to assess whether excess cholesterol affects the ability of lysosomes to fuse with formed phagosomes. Early Stages—Phagosome maturation entails sequential fusion of distinct endocytic compartments with the formed phagosome. Nascent phagosomes merge initially with early and recycling endosomes, followed by fusion with late endosomes and ultimately with lysosomes in a unidirectional and time-dependent manner (17Jahraus A. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Habermann A. Storrie B. Ullrich O. Griffiths G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30379-30390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effects of cholesterol loading on the individual stages of the maturation sequence. Rab5, a hallmark of early endosomes (18Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), is the first endosomal marker detectable on sealed phagosomes (19Vieira O.V. Bucci C. Harrison R.E. Trimble W.S. Lanzetti L. Gruenberg J. Schreiber A.D. Stahl P.D. Grinstein S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous GTPase cannot be detected by immunostaining with available antibodies, we transfected macrophages with a GFP-tagged construct of wild-type Rab5. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, Rab5 was detectable in the majority of control phagosomes within 5 min of completion of phagocytosis. Similarly, Rab5 was present on the membranes of phagosomes formed by U18666A-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Under the conditions studied, the extent of acquisition of Rab5 was indistinguishable between normal and cholesterol-loaded cells (p = 0.494 and p = 0.587 for cells exposed to 0.75 and 1.0 μg/μl U18666A, respectively) (Fig. 2G). Rab5 is involved in the recruitment of EEA1 and Vps34 to phagosomes. We next analyzed these subsequent stages of the maturation process. Immunostaining was used to visualize the endogenous EEA1 on the phagosomal membrane and was reinforced with transfection of cDNA encoding EEA1-GFP. As found for Rab5, most of the early (10 min) phagosomes were positively stained for EEA1, and a similar degree of staining was found for control and cholesterol-loaded macrophages (Fig. 2, C and D; insets in H show endogenous EEA1). Recruitment and activation of Vps34, the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase results in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) on the phagosomal membrane (20Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The formation of this phosphoinositide can be monitored in live cells using genetically encoded biosensors consisting of a protein domain fused to a fluorescent protein that binds to the headgroup of PI(3)P with high specificity and affinity. We transfected RAW cells with one such construct, the PX-GFP chimera, and observed its distribution by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2, E and F). As reported, PI(3)P was detectable on the phagosomal membrane shortly after sealing (Fig. 2, E and I). The accumulation of PI(3)P persisted for ∼10–15 min, waning abruptly thereafter. When analyzed 30 min after the initiation of phagocytosis, virtually all phagosomes were again devoid of the phosphoinositide (Fig. 2, E and F, insets). Neither the extent nor the kinetics of PI(3)P acquisition were significantly affected in cells treated with U18666A (Fig. 2, F and I, and supplemental Fig. 2). Together, these findings indicate that although phagocytic efficiency is partially depressed, the early stages of phagosomal maturation are unaffected by the excessive accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. Intermediate Stages—Following the recruitment of PI(3)P and EEA1, phagosomes acquire Rab7 and LAMP, which serve as indicators of the intermediate stages of maturation. The effects of cholesterol loading on these markers were investigated next. Control and U18666A-treated macrophages were allowed to internalize particles for 15 min, and maturation was allowed to proceed for a further 45 min. When analyzed by immunostaining, virtually all of the phagosomes in both control and drug-treated cells were positive for LAMP-1 (Fig. 3, A, B, and E). As for Rab5, we resorted to transfection of a fluorescent chimera to study the fate of Rab7. Using a phagocytosis and maturation protocol like that described for LAMP-1, we found that the vast majority (>80!) of the phagosomes had recruited Rab7 in both control and cholesterol-loaded cells (Fig. 3, C, D, and F). No statistically significant differences were recorded for either marker in three separate experiments. The final step in the maturation sequence is the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes. Although LAMP isoforms and Rab7 are present in both late endosomes and lysosomes, the latter can be unambiguously identified by preloading them with fluid phase markers. This involves a well defined protocol consisting of a prolonged (>16-h) pulse to reach the lysosomal compartment, followed by a long (≥2-h) chase period to clear the marker from all of the earlier compartments of the endocytic pathway. We used this protocol to load lysosomes with fluorescent dextrans in order to assess the effect of cholesterol accumulation on phagolysosome fusion. The cells were then induced to internalize opsonized beads, and the resulting phagosomes were allowed to undergo maturation for 45 min. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, otherwise untreated cells displayed a clear ring of fluorescence surrounding the ingested beads, indicative of phagolysosome fusion. Nearly 90! of the control phagosomes were dextran-positive (Fig. 4E). In stark contrast, most of the phagosomes in U18666A-treated cells were devoid of fluorescence (Fig. 4, B and E), implying that loading with cholesterol impaired the fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes. The lumen of late phagosomes is highly acidic, due largely to the high density of vacuolar ATPases. This extreme acidification promotes the accumulation of weak bases like LysoTracker, a lysosomotropic fluorescent probe. We took advantage of this feature of phagolysosomes to analyze by an alternate method the effects of cholesterol accumulation on lysosome fusion. As reported by others, at times ≥1 h after ingestion, virtually all of the phagosomes of control cells were stained by Lyso-Tracker (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the phagosomes of U18666A-treated cells failed to accumulate the probe (Fig. 4D). However, the enlarged cholesterol-loaded lysosomes did accumulate LysoTracker, indicating that they possessed active vacuolar ATPases. The ability of the cholesterol-laden lysosomes to maintain a low pH implies that their membrane remains intact, capable of retaining the concentrated protons. Impairment of traffic of intracellular cholesterol has been reported to impact Rab GTPase function (21Choudhury A. Sharma D.K. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Ganley I.G. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 18: 2667-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Importantly, fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes is thought to be directed by Rab7 in its active GTP-loaded conformation (25Harrison R.E. Bucci C. Vieira O.V. Schroer T.A. Grinstein S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6494-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This GTPase was found earlier to be recruited to the phagosomal membrane (Fig. 3), although its activation state was not defined. In principle, the state of activation of Rab7 can be deduced from its subcellular localization, since the inactive, GDP-bound form normally associates with a soluble guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor and therefore resides largely in the cytosol, whereas the active, GTP-bound state is membrane-anchored. However, the ability of guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor to extract GDP-Rab7 may depend on the lipid composition of the membrane (23Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H. Cosson P. Cavalli V. Mayran N. Faure J. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which is likely to be altered in U18666A-treated lysosomes and phagosomes. To assess the state of activation of Rab7 on phagosomes, we expressed RFP-tagged Rab7 along with GFP-tagged RILP. RILP is a Rab7 effector that interacts exclusively with the active, GTP-bound state of Rab7 and is therefore a reliable index of its activation state (26Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As reported (26Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), RILP was present together with Rab7 in late endosomes/lysosomes, and its ectopic (over)expression induced the juxtanuclear clustering of these organelles (Fig. 5, A and B). In control cells, Rab7 and RILP co-localized also in phagosomes (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, although U18666A-treated phagosomes acquired Rab7, they were markedly devoid of"

https://openalex.org/W2105028664,"Hannie Kremer and colleagues report the identification of mutations in LROMT associated with profound nonsyndromic hearing loss. LRTOMT has two alternative reading frames and encodes two different proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Many proteins necessary for sound transduction have been identified through positional cloning of genes that cause deafness1,2,3. We report here that mutations of LRTOMT are associated with profound nonsyndromic hearing loss at the DFNB63 locus on human chromosome 11q13.3–q13.4. LRTOMT has two alternative reading frames and encodes two different proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2, detected by protein blot analyses. LRTOMT2 is a putative methyltransferase. During evolution, new transcripts can arise through partial or complete coalescence of genes4. We provide evidence that in the primate lineage LRTOMT evolved from the fusion of two neighboring ancestral genes, which exist as separate genes (Lrrc51 and Tomt) in rodents."

To achieve this, platelets express a diverse array of cell surface receptors and signaling proteins that induce rapid platelet activation.

Constitutive and agonist signaling by both receptors is dependent on Src and Syk family kinases, and is inhibited by G6b-B, a platelet immunoglobulin receptor that has two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytosolic tail. Mutation of the conserved tyrosines in the two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs prevents the inhibitory action of G6b-B. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of G6b-B is independent of the Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, and the inositol 5′-phosphatase, SHIP. Constitutive signaling via Src and Syk tyrosine kinases is observed in platelets and is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of GPVI-FcR γ-chain and CLEC-2. We speculate that inhibition of constitutive signaling through Src and Syk tyrosine kinases by G6b-B may help to prevent unwanted platelet activation. Platelets play an essential role in wound healing by forming thrombi that plug holes in the walls of damaged blood vessels.

ITIMs are defined by the consensus sequence (L/I/V/S)-X-Y-X-X-(L/V) and are commonly found in pairs separated by 15 to 30 amino acid residues (11Vivier E. Daeron M. Immunol.

The other two platelet ITIM receptors are platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and TREM-like transcript-1 (14Washington A.V. Quigley L. McVicar D.W.

Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ITIM-containing receptors were originally identified by their ability to inhibit signaling by ITAM receptors, as demonstrated by the selective inhibition of the B-cell receptor when cross-linked by surface immunoglobulin to Fcγ receptor IIb (FcγRIIb) (17Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Daeron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, it is now recognized that ITIM-containing receptors can also generate stimulatory signals or inhibit activation by G protein-coupled receptors. For example, PECAM-1 has been reported to induce integrin activation in T cells (19Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), whereas it causes mild inhibition of platelet activation by the ITAM and ITAM-like receptors, GPVI and CLEC-2, and by the G protein-coupled receptor agonist, thrombin (20Dhanjal T.S.

The latter action is similar to that of G6b-B, which upon cross-linking by a specific antibody inhibits activation of platelets by the GPVI-specific agonist, collagen-related peptide, and the G protein-coupled receptor agonist ADP (13Newland S.A.

In contrast, the ITIM receptor, TREM-1, which is present on platelet intracellular granules, is translocated to the surface of activated platelets and reinforces platelet activation (16Barrow A.D. Astoul E. Floto A. Brooke G. Relou I.A. Jennings N.S. Smith K.G. Ouwehand W. Farndale R.W. Alexander D.R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5838-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study we have used a sensitive NFAT reporter assay that monitors activation of PLCγ in DT40 B cells to investigate the effect of G6b-B on signaling by the GPVI-FcR γ-chain complex and CLEC-2. The NFAT reporter assay monitors weak, sustained signaling events and gives robust detection of activation of GPVI by collagen and of CLEC-2 by rhodocytin and podoplanin (7Christou C.M. Pearce A.C.

The availability of variants of the DT40 cell line deficient in key signaling proteins allows dissection of the signaling pathways used by the above receptors. Here we show that expression of the GPVI-FcR γ-chain complex and CLEC-2 in DT40 cells leads to the generation of both constitutive and agonist-induced signals that are inhibited by G6b-B. This effect is dependent on the two ITIMs in the cytosolic tail of G6b-B, although it is independent of the two SH2-domain containing tyrosine phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2, and of the inositol lipid 5′-phosphatase, SHIP. Significantly, we also provide evidence for constitutive signaling through Src and Syk-dependent kinases in platelets, thereby raising the possibility that inhibition of this by G6b-B could help to prevent unwanted platelet activation in the vasculature.

Calaminus S.D. Berlanga O. Auger J.M. Bori-Sanz T. Meyaard L. Watson S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 2274-2283Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by testing whether activation of GPVI by collagen is dependent on its associated FcR γ-chain. Activation was monitored in the absence and presence of collagen and compared with mock-transfected cells that had been allowed to settle on fibronectin using a NFAT-luciferase reporter assay. Adhesion to fibronectin alone did not induce NFAT activation (not shown). As anticipated, collagen stimulated NFAT activation in DT40 cells expressing both GPVI and an NH2-terminal Myc-tagged version of FcR γ-chain, whereas it had no effect when either subunit was transfected on its own (Fig. 1A and not shown). The Myc-tagged version of FcR γ-chain supports a similar level of activation to that of the wild-type protein (not shown) and has the advantage that it can be used to monitor surface expression by flow cytometry, which is not altered by expression of GPVI (Fig. 1A, panel ii). In contrast, GPVI was not expressed on the surface of DT40 cells in the absence of the FcR γ-chain (not shown), as is the case for platelets (34Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a model in which cross-linking of GPVI by collagen leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. These studies further revealed the unexpected observation that expression of the Myc-tagged or wild-type FcR γ-chain caused a significant increase in luciferase activity that approached almost 10! of the response to collagen (Fig. 1, A, panel i and B, panel i). Furthermore, the constitutive signal from the FcR γ-chain was not altered by co-expression with GPVI (Fig. 1A, panel i). Thus the increase in luciferase activity that was observed in the absence of a stimulatory agonist reflects signaling by the ITAM-containing protein. To investigate constitutive signaling in further detail, DT40 cells were transfected with varying concentrations of the FcR γ-chain plasmid and the level of NFAT activation monitored. Increasing levels of transfection of FcR γ-chain led to a corresponding increase in both NFAT activation (Fig. 1B, panel i) and FcR γ-chain expression as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 1B, panel ii). Furthermore, Western blotting of GPVI-FcR γ-chain-transfected cells demonstrated an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a band of 72 kDa that comigrates with Syk, along with constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain (Fig. 1C, panel i). Confirmation that the 72-kDa protein corresponds to Syk was confirmed using a phosphospecific antibody (phospho-Syk Tyr525/526) that binds to the activated tyrosine kinase (not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and FcR γ-chain were inhibited in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PD0173952 (Fig. 1C, panel i, and not shown). These results demonstrate that the FcR γ-chain generates constitutive signals in DT40 cells that lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and NFAT activation. Stimulation of GPVI-FcR γ-chain-transfected cells with collagen leads to a further increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (Fig. 1C, panel ii), consistent with the activation of Syk by the collagen receptor complex, as described in earlier studies. Constitutive Signaling of CLEC-2 in DT40 Cells—The above studies were extended to CLEC-2, which is a recently identified platelet glycoprotein receptor that mediates activation through a single YXXL motif in its cytosolic tail. CLEC-2 is a receptor for the snake venom toxin, rhodocytin, and the lymphatic marker podoplanin. Both agonists induce activation of CLEC-2-transfected DT40 cells, with the response being dependent on the conserved tyrosine in the cytoplasmic YXXL motif (7Christou C.M. Pearce A.C. Watson A.A. Mistry A.R. Pollitt A.Y. Fenton-May A.E. Johnson L.A. Jackson D.G. Watson S.P. O'Callaghan C.A. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 8Fuller G.L. Williams J.A.

In the present study, we have confirmed that rhodocytin stimulates NFAT activation in CLEC-2-transfected DT40 cells, with the level of response increasing with the level of surface expression of CLEC-2 (Fig. 2A, panels i and ii). Moreover, as is the case with the FcR γ-chain, expression of CLEC-2 was sufficient to increase NFAT activity in the absence of agonist stimulation, with the level of response increasing in parallel with that of CLEC-2 (Fig. 2A, panels i and ii). The level of constitutive activity approached between 10 and 20! the response to rhodocytin. Constitutive signaling by CLEC-2 is abolished following mutation of the tyrosine in the CLEC-2 YXXL sequence to a phenylalanine (Y7F) (Fig. 2B, panel i), as is the case for stimulation by rhodocytin (8Fuller G.L.

Gpr48/LGR4 is a recently identified orphan GPCR with unknown functions. To reveal the functions of Gpr48 in vivo, we generated Gpr48-/- mice and found that Gpr48-/- fetuses displayed transient anemia during midgestation and abnormal definitive erythropoiesis. The dramatic decrease of definitive erythroid precursors (Ter119pos population) in Gpr48-/- fetal liver at E13.5 was confirmed by histological analysis and blood smear assays. Real-time PCR analyses showed that in Gpr48-/- mice both adult hemoglobin α and β chains were decreased while embryonic hemoglobin chains (ζ, βH1, and ϵy) were increased, providing another evidence for the impairment of definitive erythropoiesis. Furthermore, proliferation was suppressed in Gpr48-/- fetal liver with decreased c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression, whereas apoptosis was unaffected. ATF4, a key transcription factor in erythropoiesis, was down-regulated in Gpr48-/- fetal livers during midgestation stage through the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway, suggesting that Gpr48 regulated definitive erythropoiesis through ATF4-mediated definitive erythropoiesis.

Erythropoiesis occurs sequentially in distinct anatomical locations in two different phases during embryogenesis. The earlier phase is defined as primitive erythropoiesis, which, in the mouse, originates from the yolk sac at embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), 3The abbreviations used are: Eembryonic day(s)GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorLGRleucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRRTreverse transcriptionBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinewtwild typeCDKcyclin-dependent kinasePKAprotein kinase ACREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinEpoerythropoietinSTAT5signal transducer and activator of transcription 5JAK2Janus kinase 2TUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigen and the later phase is definitive erythropoiesis, which was carried out in the fetal liver during midgestation after E12.5. Non-nucleated adult-type red blood cells are first generated in the fetal liver, the primary organ for erythropoiesis during midgestation from E12 to E16 (1Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Erythropoiesis then transfers to bone marrow and spleen in the adult (2Godin I.

Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of regulating erythropoiesis has not been completely delineated. Most of the studies were focused on the transcription factors to explore the mechanisms of erythropoiesis (4Perry C. Soreq H. Eur. J.

In recent years, several transcription factors were also identified to regulate definitive erythropoiesis in fetal liver during midgestation (6Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Kondoh G. Takeda J. Ohsawa Y.

One of the transcription factors is ATF4, which has been shown to regulate cell proliferation in response to a broad spectrum of cell stresses and can be either an activator or a repressor in response to different extracellular signals (12Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). ATF4-/- mice have been reported to cause defective definitive erythropoiesis, and severe anemia at midgestation (13Masuoka H.C. Townes T.M.

GPCRs can recognize their ligands, a diverse array of extracellular signals, then transmit these signals to intracellular responses by the ligand-receptor interaction. For its versatile roles, the GPCR family is one of the most promising and attractive targets to develop pharmaceutical drugs for human diseases ranging from allergic rhinitis to pain, hypertension, and schizophrenia (16Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S27-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein hormone receptors represent a subgroup of GPCRs that have a large N-terminal extracellular (ecto-) domain containing leucine-rich repeats, a versatile structural domain that is important for glycoprotein hormone ligands recognition (19Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1830-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Osuga Y. Kudo M. Kaipia A. Kobilka B. Hsueh A.J. Mol.

Based on the comparison of peptide hormones and glycoprotein hormone receptors, a sub-group of GPCRs, leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs (LGRs), was identified (22Hsu S.Y. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Many studies suggest that the expanding family of LGRs, including three known glycoprotein hormone receptors (LH, FSH, and TSH), the orphan receptors LGR4 (also termed Gpr48), LGR5, and LGR6 are homologous and conservative (22Hsu S.Y.

The mammalian glycoprotein hormone receptors have diverse structural features and mainly couple through the cAMP-dependent pathway for signal transduction (25Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Bhalla A. van der Spek P.J. van D.M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Gpr48 (LGR4) has a putative horseshoe-like structure composed of 17 leucine-rich repeats, which is proposed to be the ligand-binding site for this family of receptors (21Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 26Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The molecular structure and evolutionary features of Gpr48 have been well studied; however, the ligands and physiological functions remain unclear (19Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G. Hsueh A.J. Mol.

Recent studies from our and other laboratories have indicated that Gpr48 plays an important role in renal, eye, and reproductive system development (30Hoshii T. Takeo T. Nakagata N. Takeya M.

In this study, we demonstrated that Gpr48 is expressed in both embryonic and adult liver, and that the deletion of Gpr48 in mouse impairs definitive erythropoiesis at midgestation through down-regulation of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and ATF4 pathways. Generation of GPR48 Knockout Mice—Gpr48 gene trap ES clone (LST020) was obtained from Bay Genomics (34Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A.

The Gpr48 ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and transferred to ICR females. Male chimera mice were mated with C57BL/6 females, resulting in transmission of the inserted allele to the germ line. Positive mice were interbred and maintained on a mixed 129×C57BL/6 background. Gpr48 knockout mice were generated based on the secretory-trap approach as previously described (33Mazerbourg S. Bouley D.M. Sudo S. Klein C.A. Zhang J.V. Kawamura K. Goodrich L.V. Rayburn H.

This vector (Pgt0,1,2tm-pfs, 11.98 kb) includes the mouse En-2 SA sequence, a fragment of CD4 containing the transmembrane domain inserted in-frame with β-geo together with a downstream internal ribosome entry site, the PLAP gene, and the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal in the Pgt1tm vector. The vector was inserted into intron 1 of Gpr48 to produce a transcript containing exon 1 fused to the β-geo-PLAP cassette. A male chimeric mouse line was intercrossed to B6/129 wild-type mice so as to obtain heterozygous mice with Gpr48 mutant. Homozygosity was obscured by intercrossing these heterozygous mice. Mice were housed under controlled humidity, temperature, and light regimen and fed ad libitum. Animal care was consistent with institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines. DNA-based Genotyping—Genotype of mice was determined by using four primers, for wild-type, forward (5′-TGT TTC AAC CTT TTA AAG ACT GTA GCG AGA-3′), reverse (5′-TAA AGG ACT TAA TGC CAA ATG TGA TTG GTT-3′); for mutant, forward (5′-CCA ATC ACC ACT CTT ACA CAA TGG CTA AC-3′), reverse (5′-GGT CTT TGA GCA CCA GAG GAC-3′). PCR was carried out by using standard techniques. PCR conditions were 35 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 53 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. DNA was prepared from 0.5 cm of clipped tail of embryos and extracted by using DirecPCR kit (Viagen Biotech, Los Angeles, CA) protocols. Genomic DNA was extracted by ethanol precipitation after proteinase K digestion in a tissue lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Reaction products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Two expected products were 450 bp for wild-type and 750 bp for mutant. Due to the insertion of the large 11.98-kb trap vector between primer A and primer B, the A/B PCR product could not be amplified in the mutant allele under the present PCR conditions. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Amplification—Total RNA was extracted from fetal livers by using TRIzol RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers used for Gpr48 wild-type and mutant transcripts analysis were: forward (5′-GGA ATT CGC CGC CAT GCC GGG CCC G-3′) and reverse (5′-AGC TCT TTA AGG CTG GGA AGG GCT TT-3′). The conditions for reaction were 30 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The primers used for ATF4 were: forward (5′-CCC ACA ACA TGA CCG AGA T-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC ATC TGG CAT GGT TTC C-3′) under the amplified reaction conditions of 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used as controls. The primers used for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were forward (5′-GGT GAA GGT CGG TGT GAA CG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTT CTG GGT GGC AGT GAT GG-3′). Sample Preparation and LacZ Histochemistry—Sample preparation and LacZ staining followed the protocol from Dr. James Martin's laboratory (Texas A&M Health Science Center, Institute of Bioscience and Technology, Houston). The embryos were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in the fixation buffer containing 25% glutaraldehyde, 100 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.3), 1 m MgCl2, and 37% formaldehyde. Samples were then washed three times with rinse buffer containing deoxycholic acid, Nonidet P-40, and 1 m MgCl2. Then these samples were stained overnight at room temperature with LacZ staining buffer containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6. After LacZ staining, the samples were stored in 70% alcohol overnight, then dehydrated sequentially by 95% alcohol, 100% alcohol, 100% isopropyl alcohol, and embedded in paraffin to be sectioned at 6 and 12 μm. Subsequently these slides were counter-stained with eosin using standard procedures. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesize from E13.5 blood cells collected by centrifuge of whole blood, and fetal livers were performed as previously described. Primers were used to detect embryonic hemoglobin chains for blood cells: ϵy, forward (5′-CAA GCT ACA TGT GGA TCC TGA GAA-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCCGAAGTGACTAGCCAAA-3′); ζ, forward (5′-GCGAGCTGCATGCCTACAT-3′), reverse (5′-GCCATTGTGACCAGCAGACA-3′); βh1, forward (5′-AGGCAGCTATCACAAGCATCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-AACTTGTCAAAGAATCTCTGAGTCC-3′); and glycophorin A, forward (5′-GCC GAA TGA CAA AGA AAA GTT CA-3′) and reverse (5′-TCA ATA GAA CTC AAA GGC ACA CTG T-3′). Glycophorin A mRNAs were used as internal controls. Amplification reactions (25 μl) were prepared using SuperArray Real-time SYBR Green/ROX PCR master mix (SuperArray) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR were carried out using an Mx3000PTM PCR System (Stratagene) and analyzed with Mx3000P software. The reaction conditions were performed at 40 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s) with glycophorin A as an internal control. For fetal livers, the following primers were used: adult α-globin forward (5′-AAT ATG GAG CTG AAG CCC TGG-3′) and reverse (5′-AAC ATC AAA GTG AGG GAA GTA GGT CT-3′); adult-β, forward (5′-GTG AGC TCC ACT GTG ACA AGC T-3′) and reverse (5′-GGT GGC CCA GCA CAA TCA CGA TC-3′); and β-actin, forward (5′-GCA CCA GGG TGT GAT GGT G-3′) and reverse (5′-TGG ATG GCT ACG TAC ATG GC-3′). The conditions of amplification reactions (25 μl) were performed at 40 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s), and β-actin was used as an internal control. ATF4 primers used for real-time PCR were the same as performed in RT-PCR with β-actin used as an internal control. The conditions of amplification reactions (25 μl) were performed at 37 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s). Western Immunoblot Analysis—Fetal liver lysates were harvested according to the method described by Mitchell et al. (37Mitchell D.C. Abdelrahim M. Weng J. Stafford L.J. Safe S. Bar-Eli M. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 51-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using a BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's procedure. Samples were then diluted into loading buffer at 1 mg/ml. Following heat denaturation, samples containing 8 μg of protein were loaded onto and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels as needed. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to a 140-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). After incubating the membranes in blocking solution, primary antibody and second antibody were used at appropriate dilution. Proteins were detected using the Super-Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-ATF4 (1:300), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc (1:400), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Cyclin D1 (1:400). Goat polyclonal anti-actin (1:500) was used as internal control. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Embryos dissected from mice were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin according to the standard techniques. 5-μm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For proliferation assays, the sections were stained with anti-PCNA using a mouse PCNA kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and then counterstained with hematoxylin. For BrdUrd incorporation, mice were injected with 100 mg/kg BrdUrd (Sigma) intraperitoneally 2 h before liver tissue harvesting. BrdUrd incorporation studies were performed using a BrdUrd labeling kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) on paraffin-covered slides. The ApopTaq peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used for apoptosis assay according to the manufacturer's instructions with methyl green as counterstain. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by using ABC staining kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-ATF4 (C-20) (1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc (1:200), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Cyclin D1(1:200). Hematoxylin was carried out as counterstain. Blood Smear—Blood was harvested from the carotid arteries of decapitated embryos. Blood smears were prepared by using the wedge technique followed by air drying and Wright-Giemsa staining (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's staining protocol. The number of nucleated erythrocytes and enucleated erythrocytes were counted in high power views. Flow Cytometry—Single-cell suspensions were obtained from E13.5 wild-type and homozygous fetal livers. Briefly, fetal livers were dissected from embryos, then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) with 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were dissociated by repeated flushing with a 23-gauge needle to obtain the single cell suspension, and the cell number was counted. Cell suspensions with the same concentration were first incubated on ice with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Pharmingen) to block nonspecific binding to Fc-receptors. Subsequently, cells were incubated with rat anti-mouse phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-c-Kit and anti-CD44, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD34 and anti-Ter-119 (all from Pharmingen). Appropriate isotype control antibodies were used. Then the cells were washed and transferred to phosphate-buffered saline 1% paraformaldehyde A. Cell surface expression of different markers was analyzed in a BD Biosciences FACScan using CellQuest software. To measure cell size of erythrocyte in fetal livers, liver cells from E13.5 GPR48-/- fetus and their wild-type littermates were harvested by flushing the femoral medullary cavity with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells are then centrifuged at 4 °C 1500 rpm for 5 min followed by resuspending in phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 m and pH 7.2) and staining with anti-Ter119 (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated) as a marker of mature erythrocyte for flow cytometry assay. Generation of Constitutive Activated Gpr48—PCR-based point mutagenesis was performed to generate mutant Gpr48 using cDNA encoding human Gpr48 receptors. To introduce the amino acid mutation at T755I into the wild-type cDNA of human Gpr48 gene, overlapping primers containing mutated sequences (forward: 5′-CGC TTG GCT AAT CTT CAT CAA TTG C-3′; reverse: 5′-GCA ATT GAT GAA GAT TAG CCA AGC G-3′) were used to replace the wild-type amino acid in the region. All cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (-) (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and plasmids were purified using a Maxi plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen). Fidelity of the PCR was confirmed by sequencing on both strands of the final constructs before use in expression studies. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293T was maintained in modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Before transfection, cells (5 × 104/culture) were seeded in a 24-well plate (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). When cells were 70-80% confluent, transient transfection was performed with 0.25 μg of plasmid using the Lipofectamine method following replacement of culture media. After 6-12 h of incubation with the Lipofectamine, media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, harvested from the plate. For luciferase transfection experiments, 48 h after transfection, cell lysate was collected, and luminescence assays were performed. Within a given assay, plate wells were set up in triplicate for each transfected construct or control vector. To allow for normalization of firefly luciferase values based on transfection efficiency, a co-reporter vector expressing β-galactosidase (pcDNA3-LacZ) was included at a ratio of 1:20 of co-reporter plasmid to experimental promoter construct (or control vector) in the transfection mixture. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or Student t test. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Targeted Inactivation of Gpr48 Gene and the Expression of Gpr48 in Fetal Liver—The murine Gpr48/LGR4 gene was disrupted by inserting a large secretory trap vector (11.98 kb) to the intron 1 (supplemental Fig. S1A). The Gpr48 ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Heterozygous Gpr48 mutant offspring were obtained by intercross between male chimera mice and C57BL/6 female mice. Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to obtain homozygous mice. The genotypes of offspring of mutant mice were confirmed by PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. S1B). The mRNA level of Gpr48 in the liver of homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice was detected by RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that Gpr48 is expressed in the fetal liver of wild-type fetus, and that there was no expression of Gpr48 in homozygous mutant (Fig. 1A), confirming the successful deletion of Gpr48 in homozygous mutant. Because the mutant Gpr48 gene generates a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRRNT) domain and β-galactosidase, the expression patterns of Gpr48 in both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice can be examined with the activity of β-galactosidase (LacZ staining) in fetal liver. As shown in Fig. 1B, LacZ staining was performed to measure β-galactosidase activity and the expression of Gpr48 in E15.5 fetal liver tissue sections. The expression of Gpr48 was found not only in hepatocytes but also in erythroid precursor cells (Fig. 1C). During midgestation, the erythroid precursors are mainly derived from liver cells, homologous to the hepatocytes. The expression of Gpr48 in erythroid precursor cells suggests a potential role of the receptor in erythropoiesis. Deletion of Gpr48 Affects Fetal Liver Size and Definitive Erythropoiesis at Midgestation in Gpr48-/- Embryos—To understand the in vivo function of Gpr48 in fetal liver growth and erythropoiesis, we examined fetal liver weight and body weight in Gpr48-/- mice compared with wt mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, at E14.5, inactivation of Gpr48 gene affected liver growth with a 41% weight reduction (Fig. 2A, panel a) and 25% reduction in body weight (data not shown). Furthermore, the ratio of liver to body weight showed significant decrease (Fig. 2A, panel b), and the fetal livers of Gpr48 null embryos showed marked smaller size, indicating hypoplastic development during fetal liver development from E12.5 to E16.5 (Fig. 2B). Because fetal liver is the predominant site for definitive erythropoiesis during embryonic stages, we further examined the morphological features of fetal liver from E12.5 to E16.5. As shown in Fig. 2B, Gpr48-/- embryos and fetal livers from E12.5 to E15.5 appeared considerably paler than their control wt littermates, suggesting less number of erythrocytes with low hemoglobin. However, little difference was found at E16.5 between wt and Gpr48-/- mice (Fig. 2B). In fetal liver, erythropoietic precursor cells can be distinguished from hepatocytes based on their smaller cell size and their more condensed and deeply stained nucleus. Histological examination and hematoxylin and eosin staining show that the gross morphologic features of homozygous fetal livers (green arrows) were normal in cellular architecture (Fig. 3). However, fewer erythroid precursor or definitive progenitors (yellow arrows) and erythroid foci (orange a"

We found that long-term modification of developing rat hippocampal GABAergic synapses that was induced by repetitive coincident pre- and postsynaptic spiking was also frequency dependent. Spiking at 20-50 Hz resulted in synaptic potentiation, whereas spiking at 5 Hz led to synaptic depression. The potentiation was abolished by blocking GABA(B) receptors (GABA(B)Rs), whereas the depression was independent of GABA(B)R activation and could be converted to potentiation by elevating GABA(B)R activity. The potentiation could be attributed to a local postsynaptic increase in Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporter activity near activated synapses. The activity of postsynaptic Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II was necessary for long-term potentiation of these developing GABAergic synapses and its phosphorylation at Thr286 could be enhanced by activating GABA(B)Rs with baclofen. Together with our finding that activation of GABA(B)Rs is frequency dependent, these results indicate that postsynaptic GABA(B)R activation mediates frequency-dependent potentiation of developing GABAergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1970424241,"In mammals, the circadian clock relies on interlocked feedback loops involving clock genes and their protein products. Post-translational modifications control intracellular trafficking, functionality and degradation of clock proteins and are keys to the functioning of the clock as recently exemplified for the F-Box protein Fbxl3. The SCFFbxl3 complex directs degradation of CRY1/2 proteins and Fbxl3 murine mutants have a slower clock. To assess whether the role of Fbxl3 is phylogenetically conserved, we investigated its function in the sheep, a diurnal ungulate. Our data show that Fbxl3 function is conserved and further reveal that its closest homologue, the F-Box protein Fbxl21, also binds to CRY1 which impairs its repressive action towards the transcriptional activators CLOCK/BMAL1. However, while Fbxl3 appears to be ubiquitously expressed, Fbxl21 expression is tissue-specific. Furthermore, and in sharp contrast with Fbxl3, Fbxl21 is highly expressed within the suprachiasmatic nuclei, site of the master clock, where it displays marked circadian oscillations apparently driven by members of the PAR-bZIP family. Finally, for both Fbxl3 and Fbxl21 we identified and functionally characterized novel splice-variants, which might reduce CRY1 proteasomal degradation dependent on cell context. Altogether, these data establish Fbxl21 as a novel circadian clock-controlled gene that plays a specific role within the mammalian circadian pacemaker."

The rapidly increasing number of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative microorganisms, including the Enterobacteriaceae family and the Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella genera, represents a grave threat to human health. The first-line treatments for such infections are β-lactam antibiotics, and the most common mechanism of resistance to such agents is bacterial production of β-lactamases. Regrettably, Enterobacteriaceae resistant to penicillins and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (e.g. ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefepime) are continuing to threaten the efficacy of our available β-lactam antibiotics (1Paterson D.L.

Among the β-lactam class of antibiotics, only carbapenems are recommended for the therapy of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria (1Paterson D.L. Bonomo R.A. Clin. Microbiol.

Many ESBL-producing bacteria possess β-lactamases that are susceptible to β-lactamase inhibitors, but the clinical efficacy of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations still remains to be established conclusively (5Bradford P.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 933-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 12Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). β-Lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations offer an extremely attractive approach to combating infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria. Unfortunately, current commercial β-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam) narrowly target class A enzymes. Thus, there is an urgent need for the design and development of more clinically useful β-lactam antibiotic/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Early studies demonstrated that selected 6-alkylidene-2′-substituted penicillin sulfones and 7-alkylidene-3′-substituted cephalosporin sulfones (Fig. 1, A and B) are effective β-lactamase inhibitors (14Beharry Z.

In an effort to assess the activity and understand the efficacy of these compounds, we investigated one of the most potent of these derivatives, a 6-alkylidene-2′-substituted penicillin sulfone, which has become known as LN-1-255 (18Buynak J.D. Rao A.S. Doppalapudi V.R. Adam G. Petersen P.J. Nidamarthy S.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 1997-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This inhibitor was designed with a catecholic functionality that could potentially resemble a natural bacterial siderophore, thus enabling LN-1-255 to utilize the iron uptake system to traverse the outer membrane (18Buynak J.D.

In this report, LN-1-255 was evaluated as a class A β-lactamase inhibitor and compared with tazobactam against SHV-1, an ESBL variant of SHV-1 (SHV-2), and selected “inhibitor-resistant” SHV β-lactamases. In addition, we tested LN-1-255 as a broad spectrum inhibitor against representative clinical isolates possessing a variety of β-lactamases. To elucidate the mechanism of inactivation, the crystal structure of SHV-1 in complex with LN-1-255 was determined at 1.55 Å resolution. We show that LN-1-255 inactivates SHV-1 by forming a bicyclic aromatic intermediate that resists deacylation. Chemical Synthesis—The chemical structure of LN-1-255 and tazobactam are shown in Fig. 1. The synthesis and initial evaluation of LN-1-255 were reported (18Buynak J.D. Rao A.S. Doppalapudi V.R. Adam G. Petersen P.J. Nidamarthy S.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Mutagenesis to Create ESBL Variants of SHV-1—As described previously, blaSHV-1 was first cloned into phagemid vector pBC SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from a clinical strain of K. pneumoniae 15571 and maintained in E. coli DH10B™ cells (Invitrogen) (19Rice L.B.

This E. coli strain with blaSHV-1 was used for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations, mutagenesis, and protein purification. The construction of blaSHV-2, blaSHV-5, and other inhibitor-resistant blaSHV enzymes was described previously (20Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Thomson J.M. Ruszczycky M.W. Anderson V.E.

Antibiotic Susceptibility—The MICs of E. coli DH10B expressing blaSHV β-lactamases were performed in Luria Bertani (LB) agar. MICs were determined using a Steers replicator, which delivered 10 μl of LB broth containing 104 colony-forming units/spot. The inhibitors were screened using piperacillin as the partner β-lactam. In the first set of MICs, both β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were tested using an 8/1 ratio of piperacillin/β-lactamase inhibitor. Piperacillin was obtained from (Sigma), and sodium tazobactam was a kind gift from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (Pearl River, NY). Additional susceptibility testing was performed to assess the potency of LN-1-255 with candidate broad spectrum β-lactam antibiotics using a collection of well defined clinical isolates. These isolates represent a worldwide collection of important patient-derived strains that possess contemporary β-lactamases used in screening studies. Against these strains, MICs were performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Here, we used microdilution panels with cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth. The β-lactam antibiotics and tazobactam employed here were acquired from Sigma. LN-1-255 was used in a fixed (4 μg/ml) ratio with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and meropenem. Tazobactam was tested at a fixed ratio of 4 μg/ml combined with increasing concentrations of piperacillin. β-Lactamase Purification—The SHV-1 and SHV-2 β-lactamases were harvested from E. coli DH10B according to a previously published method employing preparative isoelectric focusing (pIEF) (20Bethel C.R.

Crude enzyme preparations were further purified using pIEF. We assessed the purity of these preparations of SHV-1 and SHV-2 using 5% stacking, 12% resolving SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) to visualize proteins. In certain instances we were required to further purify SHV-1 and SHV-2 β-lactamases using size exclusion chromatography with a Pharmacia ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare). We employed a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). We determined protein concentrations using Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Kinetic Parameters—Kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, kcat) for SHV-1 and SHV-2 β-lactamases were determined from initial steady state velocities using an Agilent™ 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The kinetic determinations were performed at room temperature (23 °C) in 20 mm PBS, pH 7.4. Vmax and Km were obtained with nonlinear least squares fit of the data (Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation) using Enzfitter™ (Biosoft Corp., Ferguson, MO) (20Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M.

We measured the ability of LN-1-255 to inhibit and inactivate SHV-1 and SHV-2. We first determined the dissociation constants for the preacylation complex (KD) according to two published methods (23Helfand M.S. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A. J.

First, we performed a direct competition assay using 100 μm nitrocefin (BD Biosciences) as the indicator substrate (Δ∊482 = 17,400 m-1 cm-1), 21 nm SHV-1 or SHV-2, and varying concentration of inhibitor (tazobactam, 0.3–1.2 μm, or LN-1-255, 10–500 nm). After the data were obtained, the KD was “corrected” according to the following equation to account for the affinity of nitrocefin (ncf) for SHV-1 and SHV-2 β-lactamases. KD(corrected)=KD(observed)/[1+([S]/Km ncf)](Eq. 1) Next, we also determined the KD by measuring the initial velocity (vi) in the presence of increasing concentrations of LN-1-255 (0–50 nm) or tazobactam (0–500 nm) against the colorimetric substrate nitrocefin (0–100 μm). Care was taken to initiate the reaction with the addition of both nitrocefin and the inhibitor and to limit the initial velocity to the first 5–10 s so that the only inhibition observed would be derived from formation of the noncovalent Henri-Michaelis-Menten complex. Three experimental determinations were made for each unique nitrocefin/inhibitor concentration, and progress curves in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitor were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a competitive model of inhibition, corrected as above. Each value was presented. The first-order rate constant for enzyme and inhibitor complex inactivation, kinact, was measured directly by monitoring the reaction time courses in the presence of inhibitor and nitrocefin. A fixed concentration of enzyme (E; 21 nm), 100 μm nitrocefin, and increasing concentrations of tazobactam (0.5–6 μm) or LN-1-255 (50–600 nm) (inactivator (I)) were used in each assay. The kobs values were determined using a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to Equation 2 employing Origin 7.5®. A=A0+vft+(v0-vf)[1-exp(-kobst)]/kobs(Eq. 2) Here, A is absorbance, v0 (expressed in variation of absorbance per unit time) is initial velocity, vf is final velocity, and t is time.

Ultraviolet Difference (UVD) Spectroscopy—According to a previously published method, UV difference spectra (absorption spectra of LN-1-255 reacted with SHV-1 and SHV-2 β-lactamases in a 1000:1 inhibitor to enzyme (I:E) ratio) were measured from λ = 190–400 nm (29Pagan-Rodriguez D.

Chelation Protocol—Five ml of 1 n HCl (Fisher HealthCare, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to activate 1 g of chelating resin (iminodiacetic acid) (Sigma) to remove ambient iron. HCl was then removed using 10 ml of 20 mm PBS (pH 7.4) after which 5 ml of 1 m LN-1-255 in 20 mm PBS was passed through the column. Flow-through was collected, and LN-1-255 recovery was measured based on inhibitory activity of SHV-1 versus LN-1-255, which was not passed through the column. Recovery was ∼60%. LN-1-255 passed through the chelating resin was then used for mass spectrometry analysis. Electrospray Ionization (ESI) Mass Spectrometry (MS)—ESI-MS of the intact SHV-1 and SHV-2 β-lactamases inactivated by LN-1-255 was performed on an Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Q-STAR XL quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray source as described previously (26Thomson J.M.

Experiments were performed by first desalting the reaction mixtures using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein sample was then diluted with acetonitrile, 1% formic acid to a concentration of 10 μm. This protein solution was infused at a rate of 0.5 μl/min, and data were collected for 2 min. Spectra were deconvoluted using the Applied Biosystems Analyst program. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals for x-ray diffraction analysis of SHV-1 β-lactamase were obtained as described previously (31Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R.

One crystal was soaked for 24 h with 50 mm LN-1-255 in mother liquor containing CYMAL-6 detergent also present in the crystallization condition. The crystal was cryoprotected in 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentandiol before immersing into liquid nitrogen for data collection. A 1.55 Å data set were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source X-29 and processed using HKL2000 (33Minor W. Tomchick D. Otwinowski Z.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). After initial refinement and model fitting, strong density was observed for a bound bicyclic aromatic LN-1-255 intermediate covalently attached to Ser-70. Topology and parameter files for this LN-1-255 ligand intermediate were obtained using PRO-DRG2 for further refinement in CNS (37Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). Two conformations were modeled for the LN-1-255 atoms beyond the bicyclic aromatic system with occupancies of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, as determined using B-factor refinement while varying their relative occupancies and monitoring difference density maps. The final model, refined to an R/Rfree of 16.8/19.7%, contains residues 26–292, 248 water molecules, one complete and one partial CYMAL-6 molecule, and one LN-1-255 intermediate of which a subset of the atoms are in two alternative conformations. Antibiotic Susceptibility—We compared the in vitro efficacy of piperacillin/LN-1-255 with that of piperacillin/tazobactam (Table 1). Against the blaSHV-1 and blaSHV-2 in E. coli DH10B, susceptibility tests revealed that LN-1-255 was much more potent than an equal amount of tazobactam combined with piperacillin. In addition, we also demonstrated that LN-1-255 combined with piperacillin was very effective at lowering MICs against E. coli containing blaSHV-5 and a series of five different inhibitor-resistant blaSHV enzymes (blaSHV S130G, R244S, M69I, M69L, M69V). This broad effect is extremely notable because piperacillin/tazobactam does not lower MIC significantly when tested against E. coli strains containing inhibitor-resistant SHV β-lactamases.TABLE 1Minimum inhibitory concentrations of Laboratory Isolates According to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, MIC breakpoints for piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam are: ≤8 μg/ml, susceptible; 8–16 μg/ml, intermediate; ≥32 μg/ml, resistant.Laboratory IsolatePiperacillinPiperacillin/tazobactam (8:1 ratio)Piperacillin/LN-1-255 (8:1 ratio)μg/mlμg/mlμg/mlE. coli DH10B22/0.252/0.25blaSHV-11024512/6432/4blaSHV-251232/416/2blaSHV-5102432/416/2blaSHV-S130G128128/1664/8blaSHV R244S6432/432/4blaSHV-M69I25664/816/2blaSHV-M69L256256/3216/2blaSHV-M69V256256/3216/2 Open table in a new tab Further susceptibility testing was performed using LN-1-255 with ceftazidime, cefpirome, meropenem, and piperacillin. Against this selection of clinical isolates (E. coli and K. pneumoniae), which represents a Gram-negative bacteria harboring contemporary class A and D β-lactamase enzymes (e.g. TEM-10, SHV-5 and -7, OXA-2, and CTX-M-3 β-lactamases), LN-1-255 combined with ceftazidime and cefpirome markedly lowered the MICs (Table 2). Moreover LN-1-255 improved the activity of ceftazidime against E. coli and K. pneumoniae containing the class C β-lactamases CMY-6 and CMY-7. The overall effect seen here was substantial when compared with piperacillin alone and piperacillin/tazobactam. In contrast, improvement was not evident against AmpC cephalosporinase producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens.TABLE 2Minimum inhibitory concentrations of clinical isolates According to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, MIC breakpoints for ceftazidime are: ≤8 μg/ml, susceptible; 8–16 μg/ml, intermediate; ≥32 μg/ml, resistant.

https://openalex.org/W2032547208,"Mounting evidence suggests that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) may serve as an important link between chronic inflammation and cancer development. The proinflammatory and proangiogenic activities of MIF position it as a potentially important player in the development and progression of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). To assess the role of MIF in the development and progression of NMSC, we exposed MIF(-/-) BALB/c mice to acute and chronic ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation. Our studies demonstrate that MIF(-/-) BALB/c mice have a significantly diminished acute inflammatory response to UVB exposure compared to wild-type mice, as measured by myeloperoxidase activity, dermal neutrophil infiltration, and edematous response. Relative to wild-type mice, MIF(-/-) mice also show significantly lower vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in whole skin and significantly lower 8-oxo-dG adduct concentrations in epidermal DNA following UVB exposure. Furthermore, MIF(-/-) mice showed significant increases in p53 activity, epidermal thickness, and epidermal cell proliferation following acute UVB insult. In response to chronic UVB exposure, MIF(-/-) mice showed a 45% reduction in tumor incidence, significantly less angiogenesis, and delayed tumor progression when compared to their wild-type counterparts. These data indicate that MIF plays an important role in UVB-induced NMSC development and progression."

We used super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP)-tagged KAR subunit GluR6a to investigate real-time changes in KAR surface expression in hippocampal neurons. Sindbis virus-expressed SEP-GluR6 subunits efficiently co-assembled with native KAR subunits to form heteromeric receptors. Diffuse surface-expressed dendritic SEP-GluR6 is rapidly internalized following either N-methyl-d-aspartate or kainate application. Sustained kainate or transient N-methyl-d-aspartate application resulted in a slow decrease of base-line surface KAR levels. Surprisingly, however, following the initial loss of surface receptors, a short kainate application caused a long lasting increase in surface-expressed KARs to levels significantly greater than those prior to the agonist challenge. These data suggest that after initial endocytosis, transient agonist activation evokes increased KAR exocytosis and reveal that KAR surface expression is bidirectionally regulated. This process may provide a mechanism for hippocampal neurons to differentially adapt their physiological responses to changes in synaptic activation and extrasynaptic glutamate concentration.

The rates, extent, and location of KAR trafficking and plasma membrane expression are modulated by interactions with intracellular proteins, which orchestrate KAR function and plasticity (1Coussen F.

In hippocampal neurons, internalized GluR6-containing KARs are sorted into recycling or degradative pathways depending on the endocytic stimulus. Sustained kainate activation causes a protein kinase A-independent but protein kinase C-dependent internalization of KARs targeted to lysosomes for degradation. In contrast, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation evokes protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-dependent endocytosis of KARs to early endosomes with subsequent reinsertion in the plasma membrane (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Posttranslational protein modification by SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is also involved in KAR endocytosis (6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). GluR6 SUMOylation in hippocampal neurons occurs at the plasma membrane in response to direct activation of the receptors, leading to their rapid removal from the cell surface (7Martin S. Wilkinson K.A. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In dorsal root ganglion neurons, GluR5-containing KARs are also internalized via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism to regulate the number of surface-expressed KARs (8Rivera R. Rozas J.L. Lerma J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C activity participates in KAR trafficking in the perirhinal cortex, where it is involved in NMDAR-independent KAR-mediated long term depression (9Park Y.

We show that SEP-GluR6 forms heteromeric assemblies with native KAR subunits and that the plasma membrane KAR population is differentially regulated by NMDA or kainate stimulation. Both sustained KAR and transient NMDAR stimulations lead to decreased surface GluR6-containing KARs, whereas transient kainate application results in a long lasting increase in surface levels of KARs, indicating that KAR surface expression is bidirectionally regulated. Dissociated Hippocampal Cultures—Primary hippocampal neuron cultures are a well established and extensively used model for studying receptor trafficking that allows access to the plasma membrane for antibody labeling, biotinylation, and surface fluorophore imaging. Hippocampal cultures were prepared as described previously (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 500,000/35-mm dish or 50,000 onto 22-mm coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Plasmid and Sindbis Virus Preparation—SEP-Myc-GluR6a was constructed by inserting the SEP fragment at the 5′-ClaI site of the Myc tag of pcDNA3-Myc-GluR6. To remove unnecessary 3′-untranslated region fragment, a new NotI site was introduced after the stop codon of GluR6 in pcDNA3-Myc-GluR6 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangeXL kit (Stratagene). The D718I-NotI insert fragment containing the entire SEP-GluR6a cDNA was then subcloned into the same sites of the entry plasmid pENTR1A (Invitrogen). The Sindbis expression vector was generated by site-specific recombination between the entry plasmid and pSinRep5-DEST by using LR Clonase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Attenuated Sindbis virus-expressing SEP-GluR6a was prepared and used as described previously (6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Neurons were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 1 at 18–20 DIV and then returned to the incubator for an additional 20–30 h before use. Biotinylation Experiments—Live hippocampal neurons (18–21 DIV) were preincubated in Neurobasal medium in the presence of TTX (2 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Neurons were then washed in Earle's-TTX buffer (25 mm HEPES, Tris-buffered to pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 2 μm TTX) and subsequently incubated in Earle's-TTX buffer at 37 °C in the absence or presence of drugs for the times indicated under “Results.” After three washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated using the membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.15 mg/ml; Pierce) in PBS for 10 min on ice. Labeled neurons were then washed with cold Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.143 g/liter Na2HPO4) to quench free biotin-reactive groups. After two further washes with PBS on ice, cells were lysed in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Following centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), supernatants containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with streptavidin beads to immunoprecipitate the surface-biotinylated proteins. Following extensive washes in extraction buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling in reducing sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using anti-GluR6/7 antibody (1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology). Standard actin controls were included to ensure that there was no biotinylation of intracellular proteins. In no case was actin retained on streptavidin pulldowns (see Fig. 1B), confirming that there was no unspecific uptake of biotin. Band intensities were quantified using NIH ImageJ 1.38 software and normalized to the total receptor band. Exocytosis Assays—Live TTX-treated hippocampal neurons (18–21 DIV) were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-acetate (Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. Neurons were washed twice with PBS and twice with Tris-buffered saline to quench remaining free reactive groups. Cells were then stimulated in Earle's-TTX buffer (±10 μm kainate, 3 min, 37 °C), followed by incubation without kainate for the times indicated to allow exocytosis. Neurons were biotinylated using the membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.10 mg/ml) in PBS for 10 min on ice and processed as described above. Fluorescence Imaging of SEP-GluR6 in Fixed Neurons—Live SEP-GluR6-expressing neurons were surface-labeled at room temperature for 20 min with both a chicken anti-GluR6 N-terminal antibody (1:4000) (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an Alexa Fluor 647-coupled anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes). After extensive washes in PBS at room temperature, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then mounted in Mowiol (Sigma), and images were taken with an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M) as previously described (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Live Cell Confocal Imaging—Protocols were as previously described (11Ashby M.C. De La Rue S.A. Ralph G.S. Uney J. Collingridge G.L. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Ashby M.C. Maier S.R. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, live SEP-GluR6-expressing neurons (18–21 DIV) were preincubated in Neurobasal medium containing TTX (2 μm) for 10 min and then transferred in Earle's-TTX buffer for live confocal imaging experiments. Neurons were placed on the heated stage (set at 37 °C) of an inverted Zeiss Axiovert microscope and were continually perfused at 2 ml/min with warm Earle's-TTX solution. For a low pH external solution, equimolar MES was used instead of HEPES, and pH was adjusted to 6.0. NH4Cl (50 mm) was used in place of equimolar NaCl to collapse the pH gradient. Fluorescence was excited using a 63× water-immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.2) by 488 nm laser light, and emission was detected through a 505-nm long pass filter. Time series were collected as repetitively scanned image stacks. Image stacks were then flattened using the maximum projection algorithm from the Zeiss LSM software. All SEP-GluR6 experiments included a brief (10 s) low pH wash at the beginning to ensure that the fluorescence from the area of interest came from surface-expressed KARs. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were calculated using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t tests and one-way analysis of variance were performed with a Newman-Keuls post-test for multiple comparison data sets when required. Surface GluR6 Expression Is Differentially Regulated—KARs are activity-dependently internalized in hippocampal neurons (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of NMDA and kainate receptor activation on the surface-expressed KARs, we designed a surface protein biotinylation-based assay (Fig. 1A). Both NMDA and kainate application invoke KAR endocytosis (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms are not well defined. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), both sustained KAR and transient NMDAR activation induced an ∼40% reduction of native GluR6 subunits at the cell surface. In contrast, transient (3 min) direct KAR activation by kainate was followed by a time-dependent increase in GluR6-containing KAR at the plasma membrane (125.2 ± 4.01% 20 min after transient kainate treatment) with no alteration in the total level of GluR6 (Fig. 1, D and E). These results show that unlike NMDAR and sustained KAR stimulation, which cause down-regulation of KAR surface content, direct transient KAR activation up-regulates plasma membrane GluR6-containing KARs. SEP-GluR6 Is Trafficked to the Plasma Membrane and Assembles with Native KAR Subunits—To further investigate the mechanisms by which transient KAR activation induces increased KAR surface expression, we tagged the KAR subunit GluR6a with SEP (Fig. 2A), an enhanced version of pH-sensitive GFP (13Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). When expressed in COS-7 cells, fluorescent SEP-GluR6 forms fully functional homomeric receptors with electrophysiological properties indistinguishable from wild-type untagged GluR6a (data not shown). The validated SEP-GluR6 was cloned into Sindbis virus for efficient neuronal expression (6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Ashby M.C. De La Rue S.A. Ralph G.S. Uney J. Collingridge G.L. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Ashby M.C. Maier S.R. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7046-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Using Sindbis virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1, ∼90% of 19–21 DIV-cultured hippocampal neurons expressed the SEP-GluR6 transgene 20–28 h after infection. Importantly, the total levels of recombinant SEP-GluR6 protein were similar to the levels of native GluR6 subunits at 24 h after transduction (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, the levels of surface-expressed SEP-GluR6 and endogenous GluR6 were also similar, accounting for ∼25% of the total SEP-GluR6 or GluR6, respectively, indicating that the SEP tag does not affect GluR6 forward trafficking (Fig. 2B). We have shown previously that virally expressed AMPAR subunits do not efficiently assemble with native subunits (14Perestenko P.V. Henley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43525-43532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine whether this is the case for KARs, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays on SEP-GluR6-expressing hippocampal neurons using anti-GFP, anti-GluR6, anti-KA2, and anti-GluR1 antibodies. In contrast to recombinant AMPAR subunits, our data demonstrate that SEP-GluR6 does heteromultimerize with native GluR6 and KA2 KAR subunits but not with AMPAR subunit GluR1 in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2, C and D). As expected, SEP-GluR6 fluorescence co-localized with both anti-GluR6 N-terminal (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Martin S. Nishimune A. Mellor J.R. Henley J.M. Nature. 2007; 447: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Fleck M.W. Cornell E. Mah S.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-GFP antibodies in fixed non-permeabilized neurons (Fig. 2E). We also investigated the co-localization of SEP-GluR6 with synaptic markers SV2A and PSD95 (Fig. 2, F and G). Entirely consistent with a previous report on native GluR6 in hippocampal neurons (15Salinas G.D. Blair L.A. Needleman L.A. Gonzales J.D. Chen Y. Li M. Singer J.D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40164-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), there was a distinct but limited co-localization of SEP-GluR6 with 20.60 ± 4.30% and 22.74 ± 5.04% for SV2A and PSD95 markers, respectively. SEP-GluR6 Reports Fluorescent Surface-expressed KARs—We next investigated the surface expression of Sindbis virus-expressed SEP-GluR6 in living hippocampal neurons. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), the fluorescence can be almost entirely attributed to surface-expressed SEP-GluR6 because transient exposure to external pH 6.0 buffer rapidly eclipsed the fluorescent signal. To reveal total levels of SEP-GluR6 fluorescence (surface plus intracellular), cells were transiently exposed to 50 mm NH4Cl-containing buffer to equilibrate all internal pools to pH 7.4. Application of pH 6.0 buffer in the presence of 50 mm NH4Cl eclipsed all SEP fluorescence (Fig. 3, A and B). Additional confirmation that SEP-GluR6 was surface expressed was obtained by surface labeling SEP-GluR6 with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-GFP antibody (red) in a dendrite of a living neuron. Rapid exchange of pH 7.4 to pH 6.0 resulted in the reversible loss of the intrinsic SEP fluorescence with no changes in antibody staining (Fig. 3C). Both bright punctate areas of fluorescence and diffuse lower levels of fluorescence (Fig. 3D) were observed. The punctate fluorescence was directly facing presynaptic FM4-64-labeled active terminals (Fig. 3E), consistent with postsynaptic surface KARs. These results demonstrate that SEP-GluR6 is correctly targeted to synaptic compartments. Effects of NMDA and Kainate on Diffuse and Punctate Surface SEP-GluR6 Fluorescence—We next determined the properties of NMDA- and kainate-evoked KAR endocytosis (Fig. 4, A–D). The levels of surface SEP-GluR6 were monitored at defined puncta on spines and at diffuse non-spiny dendritic regions. Dramatically different profiles were observed for these two pools of receptors. Diffuse SEP-GluR6 fluorescence was rapidly decreased by NMDA application (Fig. 4, A and C; supplemental Movie 1) with recovery starting soon after NMDA washout and return to base-line levels within 10 min. Punctate SEP-GluR6 fluorescence was also reduced by NMDAR activation but with a much slower onset and a less marked decrease. Furthermore, the punctate SEP-GluR6 fluorescence continued to decrease after removal of NMDA, and the gradual reduction persisted throughout the 12-min time course of the experiments (Fig. 4, A and C). None of these NMDA effects occurred when neurons were preincubated with the NMDAR antagonist d(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (data not shown). Kainate application also evoked very different changes in SEP-GluR6 fluorescence (Fig. 4, B and C). Immediately upon exposure to kainate, there was a rapid and substantial decrease in diffuse SEP-GluR6 fluorescence, and levels continued to decrease, albeit more slowly, during the 3-min kainate incubation period. In the continued presence of kainate, the levels of surface SEP-GluR6 remained decreased (data not shown). Following kainate removal, diffuse SEP-GluR6 recovered and then increased to values similar to base-line levels. Intriguingly, despite the initial loss of diffuse fluorescence, kainate application did not decrease punctate spine-associated SEP-GluR6 fluorescence (Fig. 4, B and C; supplemental Movie 2). Rather, there was a gradual increase in punctate fluorescence that started after removal of kainate and was maintained at 12 min. The fact that both the punctate and diffuse fluorescence increased after kainate removal suggests that exocytosis may occur simultaneously at spiny and non-spiny areas of dendrites (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the increase in surface KAR following short exposure to kainate (Figs. 1D and 4, B and C) was due to KAR exocytosis, we designed a plasma membrane receptor insertion assay using a modified cell surface biotinylation experimental approach (Fig. 4D) (16Rajagopal R. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6650-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Surface-expressed proteins were saturated with membrane-impermeant sulfo-NHS-acetate and then stimulated with kainate for 3 min. Control neurons from the same cultures were incubated with sulfo-NHS-acetate but not exposed to kainate. After treatment, neurons were surface-biotinylated at various time points to label newly exocytosed native KARs. Only de novo exocytosed KARs were labeled because previously surface-expressed/recycled receptors were covalently modified by the acetate group (Fig. 4, D and E). Transient kainate treatment led to a slow and persistent increase in exocytosis of new KARs, whereas no de novo insertion of native KARs was observed in control untreated neurons during the time course of the experiment (Fig. 4E). The fine-tuning of functional glutamate receptors is fundamental for the regulation of synaptic strength and cell excitability. Endocytosis, recycling, exocytosis, and lateral diffusion all contribute to changes in the surface expression and compartmentalization of membrane receptors (for a recent review, see Ref. 17Newpher T.M. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2008; 58: 472-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Here we have used SEP-GluR6 to show that surface expression of GluR6-containing KARs is dynamically regulated. Sindbis virus-expressed SEP-GluR6 represents a valuable tool for the study of real-time dynamic movement of KARs in neurons. SEP-GluR6 efficiently assembles in heteromultimers with endogenous KAR subunits and consequently acts as an effective reporter for KAR containing native subunits. Thus, SEP-GluR6 trafficking is subject to regulation by interactions occurring at the GluR6 subunit as well as interactions occurring at other subunits within the multimeric subunit complex. Taken together, our data indicate that analysis of the SEP fluorescent signal provides a faithful readout for the behavior of endogenous GluR6-containing KARs. NMDAR stimulation elicited a decrease in fluorescence of punctate and diffuse SEP-GluR6 populations, similar to responses observed previously for the AMPAR subunit pHluorin-GluR2 (18Ashby M.C. Ibaraki K. Henley J.M. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 257-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unlike NMDAR and sustained KAR stimulation, which cause down-regulation of surface KARs, transient KAR activation up-regulates plasma membrane GluR6-containing KARs. During a 3-min kainate pulse, there was a rapid and substantial decrease in diffuse SEP-GluR6 fluorescence due to their endocytosis but no change in punctate spine-associated SEP-GluR6 fluorescence. After kainate removal, however, both punctate and diffuse SEP-GluR6 increased with similar time courses. This suggests either that exocytosis occurs simultaneously at spiny and non-spiny areas of dendrite or that, following transient kainate stimulation, KARs that remain on the non-spiny dendritic shaft membrane are recruited to spines and that this lateral diffusion is more than compensated for by exocytosis to the shaft. We do not attribute these differential trafficking events to differences in degradation rates because we previously showed that the time course of KAR degradation is in the hour time scale (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms underlying this could include that the kainate-induced current is not desensitized and that the residual current produces the long term effects. Alternatively, the desensitized state of the KAR might, under sustained kainate application, contribute to differences in the trafficking properties. However, we propose that differential modulation of posttranslational GluR6 modification occurs in the continuous presence of the agonist. KAR activation induces SUMOylation of GluR6 at the plasma membrane of hippocampal neurons, leading to their endocytosis (7Martin S. Wilkinson K.A. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that after endocytosis under sustained KAR activation, SUMOylated KARs are retained in intracellular compartments and can subsequently be targeted for degradation at lysosomes. Furthermore, de-SUMOylation after a relatively brief agonist application may provide a downstream signal for KAR retrieval in a recycling pool and exocytosis because kainate removal results in increased surface expression of KARs. Indeed, we demonstrated previously that a fraction of KARs are subject to lysosomal degradation (5Martin S. Henley J.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4749-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Relevant to this, high frequency stimulation with pulses of 50 μm kainate triggers a rundown of kainate-induced GluR5-containing KAR responses in dorsal root ganglion neurons, whereas this rundown does not occur with kainate pulses that were delivered at 5-min intervals (8Rivera R. Rozas J.L. Lerma J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4359-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, both the type and the frequency of stimuli determine the regulation of KAR surface expression. This is of particular importance with respect to KAR physiopathologies. For example, a prominent feature of ischemia is massive glutamate release that leads to excessive glutamate receptor activation and consequent excitotoxic cell death. It would therefore be advantageous to reduce KAR signaling in such circumstances. Another important implication of our findings comes from the fact that during cerebral development, filopodial motility is differentially regulated by KARs. In young immature hippocampal slices, synaptic stimulation of KARs enhances filopodial motility, but it inhibits it in mature slices (19Tashiro A. Dunaevsky A. Blazeski R. Mason C.A. Yuste R. Neuron. 2003; 38: 773-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transient stimulation of GluR6-containing KARs evokes a fast and reversible growth cone stalling (20Ibarretxe G. Perrais D. Jaskolski F. Vimeney A. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7684-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a prerequisite for synapse stabilization. Our data show that transient KAR activation leads to increased receptor surface expression. Thus, in young neurons, short bursts of glutamate could lead to raised levels of surface-expressed GluR6-containing KARs, mediating the stalling of growth cones and thereby facilitating the establishment/stabilization of novel synaptic structure. In summary, we envisage that the bidirectional regulatory mechanism we describe here controls the levels of plasma membrane-expressed KARs in response to changing environmental conditions. Further investigation will be required to determine which KAR interactors and/or posttranslational modifications are involved in these differential trafficking events. We thank C.

Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). The class I aaRSs contain two signature peptides, HIGH and KMSKS, located in the characteristic nucleotide binding fold (Rossmann fold) of the active site domain for ATP binding and amino acid activation. The catalytic domain is interrupted by two major inserts, which are designated as connective peptide 1 (CP1) and connective peptide 2 (CP2) (3Starzyk R.M. Webster T.A. Schimmel P. Science. 1987; 237: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) belongs to subclass Ia of the group of aaRSs with cysteinyl-, isoleucyl-, methionyl-, and valinyl-tRNA synthetases (CysRS, IleRS, MetRS, and ValRS, respectively) (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). These aaRSs in class Ia share a common α-helical anticodon-binding domain. LeuRS is responsible for Leu-tRNALeu synthesis and has an aminoacylation catalytic core defined by a Rossmann fold (4Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). LeuRS, IleRS, and ValRS (LIV-RSs) edit their mistakes via a hydrolytic site within the CP1 domain, which is inserted into the catalytic Rossmann fold (4Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Nureki O. Vassylyev D. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S.

The CP1 domain hydrolyzes mischarged aminoacyl-tRNAs (post-transfer editing) or misformed aa-AMPs (pre-transfer editing), which is deduced from the inability of LeuRS to effectively distinguish isosteric sets of amino acids that are structurally similar (i.e. Leu, Nov, Ile, and Met) (4Cusack S.

The isolated CP1 domains of Aquifex aeolicus LeuRS (AaLeuRS), Escherichia coli IleRS (EcIleRS), and Bacillus stearothermophilus ValRS (BsValRS) all have editing functions (8Lin L. Hale S.P.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the CP2 domain exists in all three of the above mentioned aaRSs (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The CP2 domain of prokaryotic and eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs consists of 32 and 36 amino acid residues, respectively (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The CP2 domain of Pyrococcus horikoshii LeuRS (PhLeuRS) is inserted between the second and third β-strands of the CP core and consists of a pair of antiparallel α-helices and a connecting β-strand with the overall shape of “U” (10Fukunaga R.

Tertiary structure of LeuRS-tRNALeu, IleRS-tRNAIle, and ValRS-tRNAVal complexes in the post-transfer editing conformation suggested that the CP2 domain is spatially close to the acceptor stem of tRNA (Fig. 2, A and B) (6Fukai S.

Giardia lamblia is a unicellular eukaryote, among the most ancient eukaryotes, and causes prevalent giardiasis. LeuRS from G. lamblia (GlLeuRS) consists of 1173 amino acid residues and has been obtained by gene expression in our laboratory. Its properties, the function of CP1, and the role of a unique 49-amino acid motif within CP1 have been studied. 3X.-L. Zhou, P. Yao, L.-L. Ruan, B. Zhu, J. Luo, L.-H. Qu, and E.-D. Wang, submitted for publication. Here, we studied the function of the CP2 domain in various LeuRSs from G. lamblia (eukaryote), E. coli (bacterium), and P. horikoshii (archaebacterium) (GlLeuRS, EcLeuRS, and PhLeuRS) by site-directed mutagenesis and performing leucine activation, aminoacylation, and post-transfer editing assays of these mutants. Materials—l-Leucine, dithiothreitol (DTT), NTP, 5′-GMP, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, inorganic pyrophosphate, ATP, Tris-HCl, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and activated charcoal were purchased from Sigma. [l-3H]Leucine, [l-3H]isoleucine, and tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (England). GF/C filters were purchased from Whatman (Germany). Pfu DNA polymerase, a DNA fragment rapid purification kit, and a plasmid extraction kit were purchased from the Biotech Co. T4 ligase and restriction endonucleases were obtained from MBI Fermentas. Ni2+-NTA Superflow was purchased from Qiagen. Pyrobest DNA polymerase and the dNTP mixture were obtained from Takara (Japan). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. The pET28a(+) and pUC19 vectors were acquired from Novagen. T7 RNA polymerase was purified from an overproduction strain in our laboratory (15Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 16: 355-358Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). E. coli tRNALeu was isolated from an E. coli overproduction strain in our laboratory (16Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were constructed in our laboratory. Deletion and single-point mutants within their CP2 domains were constructed according to the protocol provided by the KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis kit (TOYOBO, Japan). As for the construction of the genes encoding GlLeuRS-PhCP2 and GlLeuRS-EcCP2, four long oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows: for GlLeuRS-PhCP2: PhCP2-F(XapI), 5′-GATGAAAATTTTGCCAGAGACCAGGAGGGCTCAGTTTGAAGCTATAATAGATTGGCTTGACGAATGGGCTGCCTCTCGTTCTTTTGGTTTGGG-3′ and PhCP2-R(XapI), 5′-TGGCAAAATTTTCATCCTTTCAAGTGCTTTTCTTGCTTTTTCTTTCCACTCTGGATTTCCATAATCGAGGTACCACTGATCAGCTGCAGCAACG-3′; for GlLeuRS-EcCP2: EcCP2-F(XbaI), 5′-ACGATCTAGATAAACTGGATCACTGGCCAGACACCGTTAAAACCATGCAGCGTAACTGGATCGGTGAATGGGCTGCCTCTCGTTCTTTTGGTTTGGG-3′ and EcCP2-R(XbaI), 5′-AGTTTATCTAGATCGTTGAGCAGCTCGTCAGCGTAAGCAGTGATTTTATCGAGGTACCACTGATCAGCTGCAGCAACG-3′. GlLeuRS-PhCP2 was constructed as follows (Fig. 1). First, the 5′ DNA fragment encoding GlLeuRS-PhCP2 was obtained by using a primer combination of the forward primer, 3X.-L. Zhou, P. Yao, L.-L. Ruan, B. Zhu, J. Luo, L.-H. Qu, and E.-D. Wang, submitted for publication. PhCP2-F(XapI), and pET28a(+)-glleuS as the template. The 3′ DNA fragment encoding GlLeuRS-PhCP2 was obtained using the same method with the primer combination of PhCP2-R(XapI), and the reverse primer. 3X.-L. Zhou, P. Yao, L.-L. Ruan, B. Zhu, J. Luo, L.-H. Qu, and E.-D. Wang, submitted for publication. Second, the 5′ DNA fragment and the 3′ DNA fragment were cleaved by NcoI and XapI, and XapI and BamHI, respectively, and were simultaneously ligated into pET28a(+) cleaved by NcoI and BamHI. GlLeuRS-EcCP2 was constructed according to the same method except that different primers and restriction enzymes were used. All sequences of the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Various tRNALeus—G. lamblia tRNALeu(AAG) was obtained by T7 RNA polymerase transcription as described previously (17Li Y. Chen J.F. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci China (Ser C). 1999; 42: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seven complementary and overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the T7 promoter, the gene, and its complementary chain were chemically synthesized by Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, hybridized, and ligated by T4 DNA ligase into pUC19 between EcoRI and BamHI to produce pUC19-GltRNALeu. The in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription was carried out as described previously, and the accepting activity of GltRNALeu was 660 pmol/A260 (17Li Y. Chen J.F. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci China (Ser C). 1999; 42: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P. horikoshii tRNALeu (PhtRNALeu) gene was cloned by the same method, and PhtRNALeu was obtained by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription also with an accepting activity of 510 pmol/A260 (17Li Y. Chen J.F. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci China (Ser C). 1999; 42: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli tRNALeu (EctRNALeu) was obtained from an overproduction strain in vivo in our laboratory, and its accepting activity was over 1300 pmol/A260 (16Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci. China (Ser C). 1998; 41: 225-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of Proteins—E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the plasmids containing the genes encoding GlLeuRS, EcLeuRS, PhLeuRS and their CP2 deletion and single-point mutants to overproduce the above LeuRSs and their mutants, respectively. A single colony of transformants was chosen and cultured in 500 ml of 2×YT medium (8 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 2.5 g of NaCl in 500 ml of sterile water) at 37 °C. When the cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6), isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cultivation continued for 6 h at 22 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and washed twice with buffer A (10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0). The purification was carried out by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA Superflow according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Wet cells from 500 ml of culture were suspended in 10 ml of buffer A and sonicated on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 4.6 × 104 rpm for 1 h to remove the debris and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was gently mixed with 1.5 ml of Ni-NTA Superflow resin for 1 h. The mixture was loaded onto a minicolumn for gravity flow chromatography. The resin was then washed with 30 ml of buffer B (20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0) to remove nonspecific binding contaminants. Then the enzyme was eluted in sequence with 7 ml of buffer C (50 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0), and 8 ml of buffer D (250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0). The eluted fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated by an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore, 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff), gently mixed with an equal volume of glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. All deletion mutants are properly folded and display little change in the secondary structure compared with respective wild-type LeuRS by CD analysis (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The amount of active enzyme in the preparation was ∼90% by active site titration (19Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Preparation of Mischarged tRNALeus—[3H]Ile-tRNALeu from GltRNALeu was prepared by incubating a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm [3H]Ile, 10 μm GltRNALeu, and 4 μm editing-defective GlLeuRS-D444A at 45 °C for 30 min. 3X.-L. Zhou, P. Yao, L.-L. Ruan, B. Zhu, J. Luo, L.-H. Qu, and E.-D. Wang, submitted for publication. [3H]Ile-tRNALeu from PhtRNALeu was prepared by incubating a reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 40 μm [3H]Ile, 10 μm PhtRNALeu, and 2 μm editing-defective PhLeuRS-D332A at 65 °C for 30 min (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [3H]Ile-tRNALeu from EctRNALeu was prepared by incubating a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 μm EctRNALeu, 20 μm [3H]Ile, and 5 μm editing-defective EcLeuRS-T252E at 37 °C for 30 min (20Xu M.G. Li J. Du X. Wang E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mischarged tRNAs were purified by repeated phenol/chloroform extractions, followed by ethanol precipitation. Assay of ATP-PPi Exchange Reaction—The rate of the first reaction step of various LeuRSs, the formation of aa-AMP, was assayed by the ATP-PPi exchange reaction. The rates of the ATP-PPi exchange reactions catalyzed by GlLeuRS, EcLeuRS, and their mutants were carried out in 65 μl of reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2 or pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 1 mm Leu, 2 mm tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate, and 20 nm enzyme at 45 °C or 37 °C. Those by PhLeuRS and PhLeuRS-ΔCP2 were performed in 65 μl of reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 1 mm Leu, 2 mm tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate, and 50 nm enzymes at 65 °C. A 15-μl aliquot of reaction mixture was removed every 5 min and added to 200 μl of quenching solution containing 2% activated charcoal, 3.5% HClO4, and 50 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and then mixed by vortex for 20 s. The solution was filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter, followed by washing with 20 ml of 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate solution and 10 ml of 100% ethanol. The filters were dried and [32P]ATP was counted by a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Determination of Aminoacylation and Misaminoacylation—Leucylation of tRNALeu or isoleucylation of tRNALeu was carried out in 60 μl of reaction mixture containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm [3H]Leu or [3H]Ile, 40 μm tRNALeu, and 50 nm GlLeuRS or its editing-defective mutants at 45 °C. Aliquots of 11 μl of reaction solution were removed at specific time points, quenched on What-man filter pads, and equilibrated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The pads were washed three times for 15 min each with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and then three times for 10 min each with 100% ethanol. The pads were dried under a heat lamp. The radioactivities of the precipitates were quantified by a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Hydrolytic Editing Assay—The [3H]Ile-tRNALeu deacylation assays were carried out at 37 °C in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 μm [3H]Ile-tRNALeu (from Gl-, Ec-, and PhtRNALeu, respectively, as indicated), and 20 nm each LeuRS or mutant, separately. Aliquots of 11 μl of reaction solution were removed at specific time points, quenched on What-man filter pads, washed, and analyzed as described above. Determination of KD by Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching—Equilibrium titrations were performed at room temperature with 0.1 μm of enzyme or the mutant in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm. An emission wavelength of 338 nm was used to quantify binding after correction for dilution and for the inner filter effect. Control solutions of bovine serum albumin or tryptophan were performed to show that there was no fluorescence response to tRNA. The KD values were determined by fitting fluorescence intensity change data versus tRNA concentration using Originpro 7.5 software. Deletion of CP2 Domain Abolished Leucine Activation and Post-transfer Editing—G. lamblia contains a eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRS with 1173 amino acid residues. 3X.-L. Zhou, P. Yao, L.-L. Ruan, B. Zhu, J. Luo, L.-H. Qu, and E.-D. Wang, submitted for publication. The tertiary structures of PhLeuRS-tRNALeu and TtLeuRS-tRNALeu complexes show that the CP2 domains are very close to the acceptor stem of tRNALeu (Fig. 2, A and B). For example, The distance between PhLeuRS-CP2 main chain and tRNALeu acceptor stem phosphate backbone is ∼9 Å (7.64 and 9.84 Å marked in Fig. 2A); that of TtLeuRS-CP2 main chain and tRNALeu acceptor stem phosphate backbone is ∼7 Å (5.91 and 7.20 Å marked in Fig. 2B). By sequence alignment of various LeuRSs, GlLeuRS is 39.2% homologous to PhLeuRS and 25.4% homologous to TtLeuRS. The CP2 domain of GlLeuRS (GlLeuRS-CP2) contains 37 amino acid residues from Tyr-581 to Arg-617, and that of EcLeuRS (EcLeuRS-CP2) contains 32 residues from Lys-194 to Gly-225, according to the structures of PhLeuRS and TtLeuRS (Fig. 2C). To investigate the effect of GlLeuRS-CP2 on various activities, the mutant GlLeuRS-ΔCP2, which replaced GlLeuRS-CP2 with three Ala residues, was constructed. Based on the crystal structure of PhLeuRS (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), three Ala residues would function as a linker to maintain the approximate distance between the second and the third β-strands of the CP core. GlLeuRS-ΔCP2 with an N-terminal 6-His tag was stably produced in an E. coli strain containing its gene and purified to over 90% homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (data not shown). The activation, aminoacylation, and post-transfer editing activities of GlLeuRS-ΔCP2 were assayed. GlLeuRS-ΔCP2 did not activate cognate leucine at all in the ATP-PPi exchange assay (supplemental Fig. S1A), indicating that the CP2 domain plays an indispensable role in amino acid activation. The mutant could not leucylate tRNALeu, as expected (data not shown). Compared with the post-transfer editing ability of GlLeuRS, the mutant could not catalyze Ile-tRNALeu hydrolysis either, and its editing activity was absolutely lost (supplemental Fig. S1B). The CP2 Domain Contributed to LeuRS-tRNALeu Binding Affinity—Because of the inability of GlLeuRS-ΔCP2 to activate leucine, the contribution of GlLeuRS-CP2 to the binding of tRNALeu could not be measured by aminoacylation kinetics. Intrinsic tryptophan equilibrium fluorescence was carried out to test the role of GlLeuRS-CP2 in the binding affinity for tRNALeu. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 nm and 338 nm, respectively. Fluorescence quenching of the enzyme by tRNALeu titration was measured, and the KD values of GlLeuRS and its mutant with tRNALeu were calculated. For GlLeuRS and GlLeuRS-ΔCP2, the KD values were 0.19 μm (±0.02 μm) and 0.37 μm (±0.02 μm), respectively, indicating that the GlLeuRS-ΔCP2 has looser binding with tRNALeu and GlLeuRS-CP2 should contribute to optimal tRNALeu binding (Fig. 3). Important Residues of GlLeuRS-CP2 Were Identified by Alanine Scanning—Sequence alignment from several eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs showed that residues in GlLeuRS-CP2 are not strictly conserved (Fig. 2C). To find the crucial residues for the functions of GlLeuRS-CP2, some conserved and (or) semi-conserved amino acid residues (Tyr-581, Trp-586, Lys-587, Asp-588, Asp-603, Lys-606, and Phe-609) were selected and mutated to Ala (Fig. 2C). These single-point mutants were named as GlLeuRS-Y581A, GlLeuRS-W586A, GlLeuRS-K587A, GlLeuRS-D588A, GlLeuRS-D603A, GlLeuRS-K606A, and GlLeuRS-F609A, respectively. Their amino acid activation, aminoacylation, and post-transfer editing activities were assayed and are shown in Fig. 4. Compared with GlLeuRS, GlLeuRS-D603A had similar amino acid activation, aminoacylation, and post-transfer editing activities, indicating that Asp-603 is not a critical residue for the functions of the enzyme. These results were consistent with the fact that some other eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs have this aspartic acid replaced with glutamic acid or proline (Fig. 2C). GlLeuRS-K587A and GlLeuRS-D588A displayed lower amino acid activation and aminoacylation activities than GlLeuRS. In addition, GlLeuRS-K587A had a decreased post-transfer editing activity; however, GlLeuRS-D588A had a similar editing activity as GlLeuRS. The kinetic parameters of the ATP-PPi exchange reaction showed that GlLeuRS-K587A and GlLeuRS-D588A displayed similar Km values for both leucine and ATP, but the kcat was about half of that of GlLeuRS, so the relative catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was about half of that of GlLeuRS (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). These results suggest that these two residues are important but not indispensable for GlLeuRS-CP2 (Fig. 4, A-C). GlLeuRS-Y581A, GlLeuRS-W586A, and GlLeuRS-K606A lost their amino acid activation, aminoacylation, and post-transfer editing activities completely. GlLeuRS-F609A lost its synthetic activity, and its post-transfer editing activity decreased drastically (Fig. 4, A-C). These data indicated that Tyr-581, Trp-586, Lys-606, and Phe-609 are the crucial residues for both the synthetic and editing functions of GlLeuRS.TABLE 1Relative kcat/Km of various mutants from G/LeuRS in ATP-PPi exchange reactionSubstrateGlLeuRSK587AD588AD603AK606RK606EK606LK606Dkcat/KmATP10.430.570.910.980.900.850.86Leu10.420.370.940.990.990.980.83 Open table in a new tab Functional Analysis of Pivotal Residues Was Performed by Site-directed Mutagenesis—The effect of side chains of these crucial residues on the activities was analyzed by further site-directed mutagenesis studies. The side chain of Tyr-581 is composed of a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring. We mutated it into serine and phenylalanine to keep either the hydroxyl group or the benzene ring of the side chain, respectively. Tyr-581 was also mutated to glutamic acid to see the effect of a negative charge and to lysine to see the effect of a positive charge. GlLeuRS-Y581S, GlLeuRS-Y581E, and GlLeuRS-Y581K were all unable to activate leucine by the ATP-PPi exchange assay, and they all had no post-transfer editing activity. Although GlLeuRS-Y581F had some detectable but significantly reduced leucine activation activity, its post-transfer editing activity was similar to that of GlLeuRS (Fig. 5, A and B). Two hydrophobic and absolutely conserved residues, Trp-586 and Phe-609, in the CP2 domains of eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs were mutated to glutamic acid and lysine, respectively. All four mutants lost leucine activation activity (Fig. 5, C and G). Their post-transfer editing activities were either lost or were very weak (Fig. 5, D and H). These results indicate that both Trp-586 and Phe-609 play crucial roles in interacting with mischarged tRNA in the post-transfer editing complex formation. This role may be accompanied by a hydrophobic interaction; all of the mutants with glutamic acid, lysine, and alanine at these residues abolished or impaired editing activity (Figs. 4C, 5D, and 5H). Lys-606 is a semi-conserved residue and is replaced with arginine in other eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs (Fig. 2C). Its conservation might indicate that its positive charge is necessary for its function. The two mutants GlLeuRS-K606R and GlLeuRS-K606E, which replaced Lys-606 with positively charged arginine and negatively charged glutamic acid, had no difference in leucine activation and post-transfer editing activities compared with GlLeuRS (Fig. 5, E and F). In addition, the mutant GlLeuRS-K606L with a large side chain and the mutant GlLeuRS-K606D with a negative charge had similar leucine activation and post-transfer editing activities as GlLeuRS (Fig. 5, E and F). Likewise, their kcat and Km values for both ATP and leucine, and the relative kcat/Km in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction were similar to those of GlLeuRS (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). Because the mutant GlLeuRS-K606A with the smallest side chain was inactive, the above results suggest that a given size but not electric charge of the side chain of the residue at position 606 may be important for leucine activation and post-transfer editing activities. Role of CP2 Domain Was Conserved in LeuRSs from Different Species—The CP2 domain has a different insertion point in LeuRSs from prokaryotes (before the CP1 domain) and eukaryotes/archaea (after the CP1 domain) to adapt to different tRNA recognition modes (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Its sequence is more conserved in prokaryotic LeuRSs than in eukaryotic LeuRSs, albeit they show similar global structures (Fig. 2). Additionally, the CP2 domains from prokaryotic LeuRSs display significant sequence differences from those from eukaryotic LeuRSs (Fig. 2C). Whether the function of the CP2 domain is conserved despite its insertion point and sequence difference was studied. Based on the CP2 domain crystal structures of TtLeuRS and PhLeuRS (4Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), EcLeuRS-ΔCP2, which replaced the CP2 domain of EcLeuRS (prokaryotic) by five Ala residues, and PhLeuRS-ΔCP2, which substituted three Ala residues for the CP2 domain of PhLeuRS (archaeal), were constructed. The distance of the two ends of the CP2 domain of TtLeuRS is 16.22 Å, whereas that of PhLeuRS is 8.22 Å; we hypothesized that these Ala linker peptides would maintain the approximate distances between the two ends. These proteins were purified to over 90% homogeneity by affinity chromatography using an N-terminal 6-His tag. The leucine activation, aminoacylation, and hydrolysis of mischarged tRNALeu activities of the two native LeuRSs and the above deletion mutants were measured and are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. As compared with EcLeuRS and PhLeuRS, EcLeuRS-ΔCP2 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) and PhLeuRS-ΔCP2 (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D), like GlLeuRS-ΔCP2, lost their leucine activation, aminoacylation (data not shown), and post-transfer editing activities. The relatively lower post-transfer editing activity of PhLeuRS was assayed at 37 °C, which is not the optimal temperature for PhLeuRS (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results show that the role of the CP2 domain in amino acid activation and post-transfer editing is conserved among various LeuRSs from different species, although the CP2 domains are located at various positions and have different sequences among prokaryotic and eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs. The CP2 Domain from PhLeuRS but Not EcLeuRS Can Substitute That of GlLeuRS—To understand whether the role of the CP2 domain is dependent on its conserved conformation or divergent location in the primary sequence of different species of LeuRSs, the CP2 domain of GlLeuRS was substituted by the CP2 domains of PhLeuRS (from Tyr-469 to Asp-504) (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and EcLeuRS (from Lys-194 to Gly-225), and the chimeric mutants were named GlLeuRS-PhCP2 and GlLeuRS-EcCP2, respectively. Both proteins were overproduced stably and efficiently in E. coli transformants containing their genes and purified by N-terminal six-His affinity chromatography. The ATP-PPi exchange, aminoacylation, and hydrolysis of Ile-tRNALeu data showed that GlLeuRS-PhCP2 had these three activities (Fig. 6, A-C), although the three activities of the chimeric GlLeuRS with the CP2 domain of PhLeuRS decreased significantly as compared with those of GlLeuRS. However, GlLeuRS-EcCP2 lost amino acid activation, aminoacylation, and post-transfer editing activities (Fig. 6, A-C). These results suggest that Leu-AMP formation and enzyme-tRNA interaction are possibly very sensitive to the different position of the CP2 domain rather than its similar global domain structure. The different location of EcLeuRS-CP2 in the chimeric GlLeuRS-EcCP2 from its natural position in the EcLeuRS may account for the functional absence of GlLeuRS-EcCP2. The presence of CP2 domains in LIV-RSs with similar lengths and conformations indicates that the CP2 domain may have emerged before the divergence of these three related aaRSs. The CP2 domain is composed of two antiparallel α-helices and a connecting β-strand, but its sequence between bacteria and eukaryotic/archaeal LeuRSs is not conserved. Meanwhile, the CP2 domains of LeuRSs from different groups have different insertion points into the aminoacylation active site, which is derived from a distinct editing domain (the CP1 domain) insertion point and orientation patterns (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Until now, the function of the CP2 domain of class I aaRSs was only studied in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) (21Zúñiga R. Salazar J. Canales M. Orellana O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A deletion mutant in the CP2 domain of A. ferrooxidans TrpRS retained in vitro and in vivo activity and showed no effect on amino acid activation, suggesting that the conformation of the activation domain of TrpRS was not distorted. However, the CP2 domain deletion mutant of A. ferrooxidans TrpRS had a higher Km value for cognate tRNATrp, showing that the CP2 domain is involved in tRNA binding (21Zúñiga R. Salazar J. Canales M. Orellana O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the LIV-RSs system, although x-ray structures of T. thermophilus ValRS-tRNAVal (6Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), T. thermophilus LeuRS-tRNALeu (11Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and S. aureus IleRS-tRNAIle (12Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) complexes in the post-transfer editing conformation and P. horikoshii LeuRS-tRNALeu (22Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in the aminoacylation conformation all show that the CP2 domain and the tRNA acceptor stem are close to each other (a little less than 10 Å between the CP2 main chain and tRNA acceptor stem phosphate backbone in PhLeuRS-tRNALeu and TtLeuRS-tRNALeu complexes) (Fig. 2, A and B), the direct interaction between CP2 and the acceptor stem of tRNA was not indicated, and the specific role of CP2 has not been reported. Our results showed that the CP2 domain of GlLeuRS, PhLeuRS, or EcLeuRS significantly affects amino acid activation and post-transfer editing. This is consistent with the fact that this domain in LeuRSs is located close to the Rossmann fold, and its connecting β-strand forms a β-sheet with the other four β-strands in the Rossmann fold (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By analyzing the effect of alanine scanning and single-point mutations within CP2 on amino acid activation and post-transfer editing activities, the crucial residues were identified that played multiple roles during the entire precise tRNALeu-charging process. Based on the structure of the archaeal PhLeuRS (10Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the CP2 domain is at the opposite side of the two signature sequences of class I aaRSs, HIGH and KMSKS, in the Rossmann fold, which have been shown to be responsible for ATP binding and stabilization of the transition state during catalysis (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The crucial residues Tyr-581, Trp-586, Lys-606, and Phe-609 of GlLeuRS (Tyr-469, Trp-474, Arg-493, and Phe-496 in PhLeuRS) all penetrated into the catalytic core; however, it is a long distance from these residues to HIGH and KMSKS (for example, the side hydroxyl group of Tyr-469 of PhLeuRS is 21.58 and 27.68 Å from the NH group of the second histidine of “HVGH” and the ϵ-NH3 group of the first lysine of “KMSKS,” respectively) (Fig. 7). Thus, it is unlikely that these residues in the CP2 domain directly bind leucine and ATP during leucine activation. This is consistent with our kinetic data that the activity-retaining mutants on Lys-587, Asp-588, Asp-603, and Lys-606 displayed no difference in Km values for leucine and ATP from those of GlLeuRS (supplemental Table S1). Consistently, the crystal structure of TtLeuRS complexed with a Leu-adenylate analogue (Leu-AMS) also showed that the residues in the CP2 domain are not in direct contact with Leu-AMS (4Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that the CP2 domain plays its pivotal role in leucine activation by modulation of the exact conformation of the active site through indirect residue interaction between the CP2 domain and active site. Tyr-581 is of great importance for amino acid activation and post-transfer editing. When Tyr was changed to Phe, the mutant had significantly decreased amino acid activation activity but similar post-transfer editing activity compared with wild-type GlLeuRS. However, when Tyr was replaced with Ser, Glu, and Lys, the amino acid activation and editing activities of the mutants were abolished completely. Therefore, we suggest that the hydroxyl group of Tyr-581 is crucial for amino acid activation. The benzene ring may function as a linker to support the terminal hydroxyl group to reach into the catalytic core during amino acid activation; because the mutant GlLeuRS-Y581S, with the hydroxyl group and without the benzene ring, is unable to activate amino acid. Meanwhile, the benzene ring of Tyr-581 is of great importance for post-transfer editing. We speculate that the benzene ring might insert between two stacking base pairs of the acceptor stem or form hydrophobic interactions with bases of the acceptor stem, based on the proximity of the CP2 domain and the acceptor stem revealed by the cocrystal structure of TtValRS-tRNAVal (6Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), TtLeuRS-tRNALeu (11Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), SaIle-tRNAIle (12Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and PhLeuRS-tRNALeu (22Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Trp-586 and Phe-609 might function through hydrophobic interactions with other residues of the activation domain and mischarged tRNA. As for Lys-606, it was surprisingly found that it could be replaced by four amino acid residues with a large side chain of varying polarity (Leu, Glu, Arg, and Asp). However, when Lys-606 was substituted with Ala, the mutant lost its synthetic and editing activities completely. The size of the side chain of residue 606 may be important to its activities; however, the detailed chemical mechanism remains unclear. After removal of the CP2 domain, the dissociation constant of GlLeuRS-ΔCP2-tRNALeu was elevated 2-fold, indicating that the CP2 domain contributed to LeuRS-tRNALeu binding affinity. This is consistent with the CP2 domain of A. ferrooxidans TrpRS (21Zúñiga R. Salazar J. Canales M. Orellana O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant was also unable to hydrolyze mischarged tRNA. Combined with a series of co-crystal structures of TtLeuRS-tRNALeu, SaIleRS-tRNAIle, and TtValRS-tRNAVal in the post-transfer editing conformation (6Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J.

This role was linked to the binding of phosphatidate to a specific polybasic site within the kinase domain of Raf-1. Here we show that phosphatidate promotes ERK phosphorylation in intact cells but does not activate Raf in vitro. The kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) contains a sequence homologous to the phosphatidate binding site of Raf-1. Direct binding of phosphatidate to synthetic peptides derived from the sequences of the binding domains of Raf-1 and KSR was demonstrated by spectroscopic techniques. The specificity of these interactions was confirmed using synthetic lipids and mutated peptides in which the core of the phosphatidic acid binding domain was disrupted. Insulin and exogenous dioleoyl phosphatidate induced a rapid translocation of a mouse KSR1-EGFP construct to the plasma membrane of HIRcB cells. Mutation of two arginines located in the core of the putative phosphatidate binding site abolished dioleoyl phosphatidate- and insulin-induced translocation of KSR1. Overexpression of the mutant KSR1 in HIRcB cells inhibited insulin-dependent MEK and ERK phosphorylation. The addition of dioleoyl phosphatidate or insulin increased the co-localization of KSR1 and H-Ras and promoted the formation of plasma membrane patches enriched in both proteins and phosphatidic acid. These results, in conjunction with our previous work, suggest the formation of phosphatidate-enriched membrane microdomains that contain all components of the ERK cascade.

Keilhack H. Opitz F. Zschornig O. Bohmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11993-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have also been described. In general, these PA binding domains bear little sequence similarity to each other, except for the fact that they all contain at least one polybasic motif. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that PA binding is essential for the recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation (12Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C.

Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the findings that treatment with exogenous PA induced a rapid, transient translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane and that mutation of key basic residues located in the putative PA binding region (PABR) of Raf-1 prevented Raf-1 translocation and activation. We also showed that interference with PA production or expression of a PA scavenger peptide based on the Raf-1 PABR resulted in the inhibition of insulin-dependent ERK phosphorylation (13Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). More recent work has demonstrated a second PA target in the Ras/Raf/ERK cascade: the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, which binds PA via its pleckstrin homology domain (17Zhao C. Du G. Skowronek K. Frohman M.A. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, PA production appears to be an absolute requirement for the coupling of the ERK cascade in cell membranes. However, neither MEK1/2 nor ERK1/2 possess well defined membrane binding domains. Thus, the question of how the remaining components of the cascade assemble on lipid membranes remains an open question. The scaffolding proteins KSR1 and KSR2 (kinase suppressor of Ras 1 and 2) bear substantial structural similarities with the Raf family of protein kinases. KSR1 binds MEK1, ERK1/2, and perhaps Raf-1 (18Raabe T. Rapp U.R. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : PE28Google Scholar, 19Roy F. Laberge G. Douziech M. Ferland-McCollough D. Therrien M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5523-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of KSR1 is remarkably similar to the kinase domain of Raf-1 (21Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 22Sundaram M. Han M. Cell. 1995; 83: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). KSR1 has been shown to bind lipids via an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (23Zhou M. Horita D.A. Waugh D.S. Byrd R.A. Morrison D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, KSR1 contains a sequence homologous to the PABR of Raf-1. Thus, we hypothesized that PA modulates the scaffolding function of KSR proteins by promoting their association to PA-enriched regions that contain the remaining elements of the ERK cascade. In this paper, we compare the interactions of PA with the PABR of Raf-1 and KSR1. Our data demonstrate direct, specific binding of PA to the PABR of both proteins. Furthermore, we provide substantial evidence in support of the hypothesis that PA modulates the binding of KSR1 to membranes and that this binding is essential for the scaffolding role of KSR in the coupling of the ERK kinase cascade. Cells, cDNAs, and Lipids Used—HIRcB cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 10% fetal calf serum containing 100 nm metothrexate. NIH-3T3 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids encoding mKSR1 were kindly supplied by Dr. R. Kolesnick and Dr. K-L. Guan. KSR1 was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. HA-KSR1 was generated by subcloning into pCMV-HA between the NotI and BglII sites. R612A/R615A KSR1 (DM-KSR1) was made by the four-primer method. H-Ras was subcloned in dsRed2 as described (24Rizzo M.A. Kraft C.A. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34928-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 or Fugene 6 as per the instructions supplied by the manufacturers. All lipids were obtained from Avanti as chloroform solutions. Lipids were aliquoted appropriately, dried, and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline. Peptides—All peptides were synthesized at the Molecular Medicine Institute Peptide Synthesis Facility of the University of Pittsburgh. All peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and all sequences were verified by mass spectrometry analysis. The purity of the preparations used in this work was greater than 95%. The sequences of the peptides used are shown in Fig. 3A. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Tryptophan fluorescence data were acquired using a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with single grating excitation and emission mono-chromators. The peptides were dissolved at concentrations between 0.6 and 6 μm in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EGTA. Concentrated lipid stocks (5 mm) were prepared by dissolving dried lipid films in 18 mm CHAPS. These preparations were clear micelles. Lipid vesicles were prepared by dilution of the stock lipid solutions by at least 100-fold (final [CHAPS] < 200 μm), followed by sonication using a microtip sonicator. The critical micelle concentration of CHAPS is 6.2 mm in 100 mm NaCl (25Chattopadhyay A. Harikumar K.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of CHAPS in the diluted lipid samples was at least 50-fold lower than the critical micelle concentration of the detergent. Under these conditions, the solubilized lipids aggregate to form vesicular structures (26Almog S. Kushnir T. Nir S. Lichtenberg D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Samples were excited at 280 nm, and emission spectra were measured in the 300-400 nm range. Corrections were made using control solutions containing lipid only or peptide only as blanks. All titration data were collected at a single wavelength (325 nm). Each point represents a 5-s average. Titration data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Circular Dichroism—CD measurements were taken using peptide solutions ranging in concentration from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/ml, in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 25 °C, in the presence or absence of 50 μm lipid and 18 mm CHAPS. All samples were sonicated for 5 min just prior to analysis. Measurements were taken using an AVIV instrument built on a Varian Cary 60 platform using AVIV data acquisition and data processing software. The data reported reflect an average of at least 10 spectra/sample. CD data were exported to Excel and analyzed using CDSSTR, from DICHROWEB (available on the World Wide Web) using the built in data bases available on the server (reference set 4 for the range 190-240 nm; data truncated at 240 nm). These analyses were confirmed using CDFIT (available on the World Wide Web). Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal microscopy data were obtained with a Zeiss LSM5 confocal microscope. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy data were obtained using a home-designed instrument based on an Olympus TIRF platform. This instrument was equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera, two solid state lasers (491 and 561 nm), and an acoustic-optical tunable filter. The laser launch/acoustic-optical tunable filter module was manufactured by VisiTech International. The data acquisition system was controlled by SimplePCI (Hamamatsu, Inc). Most experiments were performed at room temperature. The cells used in these experiments were grown on coverslips or using 35 mm MatTek glass bottom dishes. The cells were transfected with fluorescent constructs 24-48 h prior to the experiment. All cells were serum-starved overnight. Fluorescence data were exported to ImageJ for processing and analysis. Co-localization data were analyzed using an image correlation plug-in for ImageJ. Detection of Phosphatidic Acid—Phosphatidic acid was detected using a biotinylated derivative of Raf-1-PABR. This derivative was used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. To detect PA, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium, 100 μm dioleoyl PA (DOPA), or 200 nm insulin for 2-5 min. The incubation was stopped by rapid chilling, followed by a rapid wash with Tris-buffered saline. The cells were then fixed with 3% buffered p-formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (1 h), and incubated with the biotinylated-PABR reagent for 4 h. Unbound biotinylated PABR was removed by three 5-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The bound peptide was detected with Cy5-conjugated streptavidin. Most experiments were performed with HIRcB cells pretransfected with KSR1-EGFP and dsRed2-H-Ras in order to investigate co-localization of all three components. Co-localization experiments were done using a Zeiss LSM5 confocal microscope. Detection of KSR1-EGFP and dsRed2-Ras was done, measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of the transfected proteins. Biotinylated PABR was detected using Cy5-tagged streptavidin. All confocal scans were done in the Sequential mode of the instrument in order to avoid bleed-through artifacts. Potential bleed through was examined using single-label preparations and found to be negligible under the conditions tested. ERK Phosphorylation—Live cell ERK phosphorylation experiments were performed using cells that had been serum-starved overnight. The DOPA suspensions used to treat intact cells were prepared from stock 1 mm suspensions prepared in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. These suspensions were sonicated for 12 min using a horn sonicator just before their use. ERK phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting with commercial specific anti-phospho-ERK antibodies, as described before (12Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C.

The Addition of Exogenous PA Promotes ERK Phosphorylation—We have previously reported that PA does not stimulate the phosphorylation of ERK (12Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C.

Those studies were performed using aqueous suspensions of dipalmitoyl-PA, DOPA, or palmitoleoyl-oleoyl phosphatidic acid. In all cases, the lipid was prepared as an aqueous suspension and used without further treatment. However, PA tends to form multilamellar vesicles, large structures in which a very small fraction of the lipid is contained in the outer monolayer (27Takahashi H. Matuoka S. Kato S. Ohki K. Hatta I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Panicker L. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2007; 311: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reexamined these results using sonicated DOPA vesicles. This procedure results in the formation of small unilamellar vesicles, in which roughly 50% of the lipid is exposed to the solvent (27Takahashi H. Matuoka S. Kato S. Ohki K. Hatta I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Panicker L. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2007; 311: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast with our previous results, the addition of unilamellar DOPA vesicles induced ERK phosphorylation responses in HIRcB, HEK-293, and NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1A). These effects were dose-dependent and strongly influenced by the cell type. As shown, in HIRcB cells, the effects at concentrations lower than 300 μm DOPA were small but detectable. In contrast, 100 μm DOPA had maximal effects in NIH-3T3 and HEK-293 cells. The effect of DOPA on ERK phosphorylation was rapid and sustained (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the addition of DOPA did not increase the in vitro activity of Raf assayed with recombinant v-Raf and MEK1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the effects of PA are not a consequence of a direct activation of Raf. However, because of the high concentrations of DOPA used in these studies, we cannot rule out potential indirect actions of exogenous PA. PA can be converted to diacylglycerol or lyso-PA by the actions of PA-phosphohydrolases (29Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3863-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and phospholipase A (30Aoki J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 477-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 31Aoki J. Inoue A. Okudaira S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), respectively. Both diacylglycerol and lyso-PA may activate the ERK cascade by independent signaling mechanisms, and these effects have not been ruled out in our studies. The PABRs of Raf and KSR1 Bind Phosphatidic Acid—Indcependently of the potential indirect effects of PA, previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that PA production is necessary for the recruitment of Raf-1 to the membrane and the subsequent activation of the ERK cascade (12Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Two additional potential targets of PA are the scaffolding proteins are KSR1 and KSR2, which also play a major role in the coupling of the ERK cascade (18Raabe T. Rapp U.R. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : PE28Google Scholar, 19Roy F. Laberge G. Douziech M. Ferland-McCollough D. Therrien M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences of the putative PABRs of KSR1, KSR2, Raf-1, B-Raf, and A-Raf is shown in Fig. 2. As shown, KSR and Raf proteins share a very high degree of homology within this region. An important characteristic of these sequences is the presence of a polybasic motif (highlighted in Fig. 2). Mutation of both arginine residues within this core renders Raf-1 inactive in the coupling of the ERK kinase cascade (13Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The binding of proteins and peptides to PA-containing phospholipid vesicles has been studied using fractionation procedures (17Zhao C. Du G. Skowronek K. Frohman M.A. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like techniques in which the lipid is bound to the solid matrix (10Ghosh S. Moore S. Bell R.M. Dush M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45690-45696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and plasmon resonance methods in which the lipid is immobilized to the solid matrix of lipophilic biosensor chips (32Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The problem with these techniques is that the lipid is always used in very large excess, such that the method measures partition coefficients rather than actual dissociation equilibrium constants. This hinders the direct comparison of quantitative data obtained by the different procedures. We decided, instead, to study the direct binding of the PABRs of Raf-1 and KSR1 using modified peptides in which one phenylalanine residue downstream of the polybasic motif was replaced with a tryptophan (see Fig. 3A). Tryptophan is a fluorescent amino acid that exhibits exquisite sensitivity to changes in the polarity of its environment (33Inouye K. Coon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Permyakov E.A. Shnyrov V.L. Biophys. Chem. 1983; 18: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Uemura A. Kimura S. Imanishi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 729: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 36Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of PA to Raf-1-PABR and KSR1-PABR can be measured directly following the fluorescence of the modified tryptophan using lipid and peptide concentrations that are of the order of magnitude of the PABR-PA Kd. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 3B; the addition of DOPA blue-shifted the fluorescence of the KSR1-PABR peptide. In comparison, the double arginine-to-alanine mutant (DM-KSR1-PABR) was insensitive to the addition of DOPA (up to 10 μm; Fig. 3B). It should be noted that DM-KSR1-PABR was blue-shifted in comparison with the wild type form. This is possibly a consequence of the increased hydrophobicity of the peptide after replacement of the two arginines of the polybasic core. These constructs were also used to determine the affinity and specificity of Raf-1-PABR and KSR1-PABR to various lipids. The binding curves of these peptides to DOPA are shown in Fig. 3C. As shown, Raf-1-PABR bound DOPA with a Kd of 78 nm, a figure comparable with the affinity of the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 for H-Ras (160 nm) (37Sydor J.R. Engelhard M. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Herrmann C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14292-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The binding of the PABR to PA is driven primarily by the electrostatic interactions of a polybasic motif embedded in the sequence (RKTRH). This is supported by the complete lack of DOPA binding of double mutants in which both Arg residues were replaced by Ala (Fig. 3C). The affinity of KSR1-PABR for DOPA was much lower (Kd = 1.2 μm). To demonstrate that the difference in affinities is primarily a consequence of the different electrostatic charge of the polybasic motifs of both PABRs (Raf-1, RKTRH; KSR1, RQTRH), we examined the binding of a mutated KSR1 peptide in which the glutamine had been replaced by a lysine (KSR-K PABR). As expected, this modified PABR bound DOPA with greater affinity. However, the affinity of the Raf-1-derived peptide was still higher, suggesting that other components may contribute to the affinity of the Raf-1 PABR for PA. Further analysis of the interactions of the PABR peptides with PA was done by circular dichroism. This spectroscopic technique is useful to determine the secondary structure of proteins and peptides. The ellipticity data shown in Fig. 4A were obtained using 0.5 mg/ml WT-Raf-1-PABR and lipid-detergent micelles containing 50 μm lipid in 18 mm CHAPS. Micellar lipid preparations were selected to minimize the interference of large lipid vesicles with the assay. In the absence of lipids, WT-Raf-1-PABR adopted a disorganized random coil structure. The addition of CHAPS or phosphatidylcholine-CHAPS micelles accentuated this unstructured conformation, as evidenced by the more pronounced minimum at 200 nm. However, the addition of DOPA-CHAPS micelles induced a dramatic structural change; the minimum at 200 nm disappeared, being replaced by a distinctive minimum at 220 nm, characteristic of a β-sheet secondary structure. Identical measurements were performed using the DM-Raf-1-PABR peptide. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mutant did not change conformation in the presence of DOPA. The behavior of the KSR1-PABR peptides was essentially identical to that of their Raf-1-derived counter-parts (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate convincingly that the PABR peptides interact directly with PA and that these interactions induce major conformational changes in the peptide. The Interactions of Raf-1-PABR and KSR1-PABR with Lipids Are Selective—The sequences of the Raf-1 and KSR1 PABRs contain a polybasic motif flanked by two hydrophobic regions. These studies clearly demonstrate that the polybasic motifs play a central role in the binding of PA. The data shown above also suggest a certain degree of specificity. CHAPS and phosphatidylcholine-CHAPS micelles do not induce significant conformational changes in WT-Raf-1-PABR, as demonstrated by the very minor effects that these lipid structures have on the CD spectrum of the peptide. Furthermore, these data also demonstrate that interactions of WT-Raf-1-PABR with DOPA are not limited by simple electrostatic interactions between the polybasic motif and the negatively charged head group, since the addition of CHAPS, an anionic detergent, failed to induce conformational changes similar to those observed with DOPA. To examine the specificity of the interactions of the PABR peptides with lipids, we determined the binding of several lipids using the tryptophan fluorescence method. The results are summarized in Table 1. Kd values reported with only a lower limit (such as Kd ≫ 10 μm) indicate experiments in which the lipids were used at the stated limit (i.e. 10 μm) either without evidence of binding or very far from saturation, thus not allowing for a reliab"

Among molecular recognitions, protein recognizes the interfacial surface of corresponding protein molecule so that they bind to each other with high affinity. Many structural analyses of protein complexes have shown that highly specific mutual recognition of protein molecules is due to multiple-point interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and the formation of salt bridges (7Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol.

In general, antibodies have high affinities for their target ligands and can be expected to be superior to low molecular mass peptides with relatively low affinities for their target surfaces. Previous studies have shown that the repetition of the sequence of an anti-material peptide can increase binding affinity (25Brown S. Nat.

In this study, we had an interest in antibody framework structure, and we obtained an antibody fragment with high affinity for gold surface materials by in vitro selection. One advantage of working with antibodies is the ability to use various fusion technologies. The construction of bivalent and bispecific antibodies with the selected anti-gold antibody with high affinity and specificity allowed us to functionalize gold nanoparticles and to permit highly ordered protein patterning and accumulation on a gold-patterned silicon substrate. We discuss the potential uses of naive antibody repertoire and the antibody engineering technique in nanobiotechnology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSelection of Antibody Fragments Specific for a Gold Surface—Human antibody fragments against gold surfaces were selected on the basis of the stabilization of the variable fragment (Fv) The on-line version of this article (available at http://www.jbc.org) contains supplemental Fig. S1-S3. 2The abbreviations used are:Fvfragment of immunoglobulin variable regionsCDRcomplementarity-determining regionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinescFvsingle-chain Fv fragmentSPRsurface plasmon resonanceVHheavy chain domain in FvVLlight chain domain in FvFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate in the presence of the target antigen (27Watanabe H.

Variable regions of VL and VH chains were displayed on the filamentous bacteriophage M13. Approximately 109 phages were mixed with 5 mg of gold particles (diameter, 3 μm; Sigma) in 1 ml of PBS and 0.5-1.0! Tween 20 detergent. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Residual phages on the gold surface were amplified by directly adding the gold particles into Escherichia coli medium after exclusion of unbound phage from the phage-gold solution. After five rounds of screening, the amino acid sequences of VL and VH displayed on the isolated phage were analyzed in 48 and 192 phage clones, respectively, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).Construction and Preparation of Fv and Single-chain Fv Dimers—The VH and VL genes were inserted into the secretory co-expression vector pRA2; the resulting plasmid was named pRA2FHL. In the plasmid, VL has a polyhistidine tag (HHHHHH) at the C terminus, and VH has a c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDLN) and a polyhistidine tag in this order at the C terminus. For single-chain Fv (scFv), expression vectors for scFv with a (Gly4-Ser) linker between the VH and VL chains were constructed as described previously (29Helfrich W. Kroesen B.J. Roovers R.C. Westers L. Molema G. Hoogenboom H.R. de Leij L. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The generated gene fragments, termed AH-AL (A14P-b2 VH-A14P-b2 VL), AH-10L (A14P-b2 VH-HyHEL10 VL), and 10H-AL (HyHEL10 VH-A14P-b2 VL), were separately introduced into the expression vector pRA. The A14P-b2 is the antibody fragment selected in this study that has affinity for gold surface (see “Results” and “Discussion”), and HyHEL10 is an anti-lysozyme antibody (30Tsumoto K. Ueda Y.

Each gene product of Fv and scFv was expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and then solubilized with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride to refold on the stepwise dialysis system as described previously (31Umetsu M.

After refinement by means of a metal-chelate chromatography column, the solubilized AH-AL was refolded to the bivalent scFv homodimer, and the AH-10L and 10H-AL scFvs were also refolded to the scFv heterodimer (bispecific diabody) (32Hayashi H.

The refolded solutions were fractionated by using a gel filtration chromatography column (Superdex 75 or 200), and the dimer fractions were obtained for experiments.ELISA—A 96-well microtiter polystyrene plate was coated with gold by ion vapor deposition. Antibody fragments from each clone were expressed in E. coli on a small scale, and then the supernatant after centrifugation of the sonicated harvest cells (in PBS containing 0.1! Tween 20) was applied to the wells. The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and after five washings with PBS-Tween solution, binding of antibody fragments was detected with Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Labsystems) by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-histidine tag and anti-c-Myc tag antibodies were applied for the detection of VL and VH, respectively.SPR Assay—SPR measurements were performed with BIAcore 2000 (Biacore AB), and BIAevaluation software (ver. 3.0) was used for analyzing and fitting the collected data. A Sensor Chip Au (Biacore AB) was soaked in piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2, 3:1, v/v) after ultrasonic cleaning in acetone and was then rinsed with double-distilled water. The running buffer used for the experiments was PBS with 0.1! Tween 20.Functionalization of Gold Nanoparticles—Gold colloid (diameter, 20 nm; Sigma) was dialyzed in 10 mm phosphate solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.1! Tween 20, using molecularporous membrane tubes with the molecular mass cut off of 6-8 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.). After dialysis, some proteins (Fv, scFv homodimer, bovine serum albumin) were added to the gold colloid solution (1 nm) at a final protein concentration of 260 nm. The sizes of gold particles were analyzed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS dynamic light scattering spectrophotometer (Malvern Inst. Ltd.), and the change in the absorption spectra was observed with a U-3000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). For aggregated gold particles, transmission electron microscopy images were obtained on a LEO 912 AB OMEGA electron microscope (Carl Zeiss) operating at 100 kV for aggregated gold nanoparticles.Specificity of the Anti-gold Antibody for Other Noble Metals—Gold, platinum, palladium, and silver plates were purchased from Nilaco. The metal plates, each attached to a polypropylene plate, were soaked for 30 min in PBS (0.1! Tween 20) with A14P-b2 Fv fused with a c-Myc tag and then washed four times with PBS-Tween solution. Binding of Fv to the metals was detected by anti-c-Myc antibody horseradish peroxidase.Fluorescence Microscopy—Hen egg white lysozyme was fluorescein-labeled by using a fluorescein labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. A gold-patterned silicon crystal plate was soaked first in PBS (0.1! Tween 20) containing the bispecific diabody made from AH-10L and 10H-AL scFvs at a concentration of 1 μm and then in an FITC-labeled lysozyme solution after several washings with PBS-Tween solution.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSelection of a Human Antibody Fragment for Binding to Gold Surfaces—To select a fragment of the variable region in an antibody (Fv) for binding to gold surfaces, we employed phage-displayed libraries of the variable regions of human antibody VL and VH chains (33Smith G.P.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phages displaying VL chains were first selected from the VL chain library by using gold particles, and then the VH chain phages were selected and assayed in the presence of the selected VL chain to stabilize the VH chain (28Ueda H. Tsumoto K. Kubota K. Suzuki E. Nagamune T. Nishimura H. Scueler P.A. Winter G. Kumagai I. Mohoney W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Unbound phages were removed by using a highly concentrated detergent solution (0.5-1.0! Tween 20) that was expected to prevent nonspecific adsorption of proteins, and the residual phages on the gold surface were amplified by directly adding the gold particles to E. coli medium, because some phages were not separated from the gold particles by treatment with an acidic solution (0.2 m glycine-HCl at pH 2.2).For the selection of VL chains, we measured ELISA for independent VL chains prepared from randomly 48 chosen clones with a gold-coated 96-well plate; consequently, the clone b2 was selected. The b2 VL chain showed weak binding to gold surface as shown in a SPR test (Fig. 1). For VH chains, we performed ELISA for randomly chosen VH chains in the presence of b2 VL chain. After we had selected the clones positive for ELISA, the selected VH chains were tested again by ELISA at various concentrations of Fv. The signals from three of the clones, 1B3, 2A8, and 2G9, depended strongly on the amount of Fv applied (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Concentration dependence of ELISA results for the selected VH in the presence of b2 VL. VH chains from selected clones were expressed in E. coli on a small scale, and then the supernatant after centrifugation of the sonicated harvest cells (in PBS containing 0.1! Tween 20) was applied to the wells in the presence of b2 VL. The concentration of Fv was adjusted by dilution with PBS solution (0.1! Tween 20) to an equal amount (1/1), one-tenth (1/10) and, one-hundredth (1/100). N.C. corresponds to the results for no addition of Fv, and RLU means relative luciferase unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the positive clones, SPR sensorgrams for purified Fv were measured against the gold surface (Fig. 3). In PBS solution with 0.1! Tween 20, the 2G9-b2 Fv fragment showed no substantial interaction with the gold surface, and the 2A8-b2 Fv fragment showed only a weak interaction. In contrast, the 1B3-b2 Fv fragment showed critical binding curves that could be fitted globally to a 1:1 interaction model with a mass transport term, yielding a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of 6.3 nm. Table 1 shows the sequences of the complementarity-determining region (CDR) in the 1B3-b2 Fv fragment. The usage of each amino acid in the CDRs showed no feature discriminative from those in general antibodies reported in the protein data bank, suggesting that 1B3-b2 Fv recognized the gold surface in the same manner as protein-protein interaction. When we compared the SPR sensorgrams between b2 VL chain and 1B3-b2 Fv, the binding affinity for gold surface was drastically increased by selecting VH chain. This suggests that the strong binding is mainly attributed to the interaction of VH chain with gold surface. The result from Fig. 3 that 2G9-b2 and 2A8-b2 Fv with the same VL as 1B3-b2 Fv have little affinity for gold surface supports little contribution of VL to the strong binding of 1B3-b2 Fv. The VL chain might only play the role in stabilizing the VH chain.FIGURE 3SPR sensorgrams for interaction of purified 1B3-b2 Fv (red solid lines), 2A8-b2 Fv (100 nm, dotted line;1 μm, dashed line), and 2G9-b2 Fv (dashed and dotted line) with gold surfaces. The concentrations of applied Fv were 38, 48, and 63 nm for 1B3-b2 Fv; 100 nm and 1 μm for 2A8-b2 Fv; and 1 μm for 2G9-b2 Fv.

Comparison of the framework sequences of the 1B3-b2 Fv fragment and the germline-encoded V segments of human antibodies showed that the proline residue at the 14 position was mutated to alanine in the 1B3 VH chain. When we constructed a variant of 1B3-b2 Fv in which the alanine was replaced with proline (A14P-b2), the A14P-b2 Fv fragments were also expressed as insoluble aggregates in E. coli., as well as 1B3-b2; however, A14P-b2 Fv was efficiently prepared by the refolding from the insoluble aggregates on stepwise dialysis system. Little insoluble aggregates were formed in the refolding process, and the size exclusion chromatography for the refolded solution showed that most of refolded A14P-b2 formed heterodimer (supplemental Fig. S1). The fractionated A14P-b2 Fv fragment remained unaggregated for more than a week, and it was stable enough for us to measure its thermodynamic properties.Binding Affinity and Specificity of the Anti-gold Antibody Fragment for a Gold Surface—We derived SPR sensorgrams for the interaction of the A14P-b2 Fv fragment with a gold surface (Fig. 4). The Fv fragments of anti-lysozyme antibody HyHEL10 (30Tsumoto K. Ueda Y. Maenaka K. Watanabe K. Ogasahara K. Yutani I. Kumagai I. J. Biol.

Bioconjugate Chem. 2007; 18: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed no significant interaction with the gold surface. In contrast, A14P-b2 Fv showed critical binding curves that could be globally fitted to a 1:1 interaction model with a mass transport term, yielding a KD value of 1.7 nm. This value indicates that the affinity of A14P-b2 Fv for the gold surface was about four times that of 1B3-b2 Fv. Considering that the human PH7-3d3 Fv belongs to the VH1 subfamily with similar sequence similar to that of A14P-b2 (93! sequence homology in their frameworks), the high affinity of A14P-b2 Fv for gold surface is attributed to the CDR area but not to the framework area.FIGURE 4SPR sensorgrams for interaction of A14P-b2 Fv (red solid lines), HyHEL10 Fv (dotted line), 3G8 Fv (dashed line), and PH7-3d3 Fv (dashed and dotted line) with gold surfaces. The concentrations of applied Fv were 10, 30, 40, and 50 nm for A14P-b2 Fv and 50 nm for HyHEL10 Fv, 3G8 Fv, and PH7-3d3 Fv. The black solid lines show the binding curves fitted globally to a 1:1 interaction model with a mass transport term.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also estimated the thermodynamic properties of A14P-b2 Fv from van't Hoff plots: ΔH = -49.1 kJ/mol and ΔS = 3 × 10-3 kJ/mol/K. Interestingly, the entropy change was so small that only the enthalpy change made a dominant contribution to the binding of A14P-b2 Fv to the gold surface. This thermodynamical result suggests that the conformation of A14P-b2 Fv is little changed by interaction with the gold surface or that few water molecules on the gold surface are dispersed by the binding of Fv.Recently, various material-binding peptides with micromolar KD values have been found by in vitro selection (26Tamerler C. Oren E.E. Duman M. Venkatasubramanian E. Sarikaya M. Langmuir. 2006; 22: 7712-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38Sano K. Sasaki H. Shiba K. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 3090-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and repetition of the material-binding peptides can increase their binding affinity for materials (25Brown S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Recently, Tamerler et al. (26Tamerler C. Oren E.E. Duman M. Venkatasubramanian E. Sarikaya M. Langmuir. 2006; 22: 7712-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) estimated the KD value for a polypeptide with three repeats of a gold-binding peptide to be 89 nm. The result that we selected the antibodies with high affinity for gold surface from a human antibody library indicates the potential use of the antibody framework for fabricating the biomolecules that strongly bind to bulk material surfaces.To date, Barbas et al. (22Barbas C.F. Rosenblum J.S. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To estimate the specificity of A14P-b2 Fv for the gold surface, we soaked plates of gold, platinum, palladium, and silver in solutions containing A14P-b2 Fv fused with a c-Myc tag. Residual fragments were then detected by the chemiluminescence from c-Myc antibody horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 5). A14P-b2 showed strong binding only on the gold plate and showed no affinity for the other noble metals (Fig. 5b). We also applied A14P-b2 Fv to silicon, aluminum, and tungsten and confirmed that the fragment did not bind to these materials (data not shown). In contrast, no significant responses were observed for the human antibody PH7-3d3 (Fig. 5c). Therefore, A14P-b2 Fv has both high affinity and specificity for gold surfaces, which are attributed to the binding of the CDR area on the gold surface.FIGURE 5Specificity of A14P-b2 Fv for material surfaces. a, untreated gold, platinum, palladium, and silver plates. b, plates after they were soaked in solutions containing A14P-b2 Fv. c, plates after they were soaked in solutions containing PH7-3d3 Fv.

The gold nanoparticles (1 nm) can be dispersed in 10 mm phosphate solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.1! Tween 20, but even small changes of ionic strength resulted in agglomeration of the nanoparticles (Fig. 6b, panel 1); in contrast, the gold nanoparticle suspension containing A14P-b2 Fv at a Fv concentration of 260 nm showed no color change at a high salt concentration of 2 m NaCl (Fig. 6b, panels 2 and 3). Bovine serum albumin can stabilize gold nanoparticles; however, gold nanoparticles with the same concentration of bovine serum albumin as A14P-b2 Fv were aggregated at 80 mm NaCl (Fig. 6b, panels 4 and 5). We observed stabilization with other proteins (lysozyme, green fluorescent protein, and PH7-3d3 Fv), but none could stabilize the gold nanoparticles over the same wide range of salt concentrations as A14P-b2 Fv (data not shown). The particle size estimated from dynamic light scattering measurement was about 8 nm greater than bare nanoparticles (Fig. 6c), demonstrating that the binding of A14P-b2 Fv stabilized the gold nanoparticles.FIGURE 6Stabilization of gold nanoparticles"
https://openalex.org/W2045899095,"Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.

Detection of pheromones in animals involves specialized chemosensory organs of two distinct types. Volatile pheromones are detected, often at great distances from the source, by highly sensitive olfactory organs (1Wyatt T.D. Pheromones and Animal Behaviour: Communication by Smell and Taste.in: Oxford University Press, Oxford2003Crossref Google Scholar). However, many pheromones that trigger specific sexual behaviors are poorly volatile and act through direct contact with chemosensory organs (2Wicker-Thomas C. J. Insect Physiol. 2007; 53: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Zufall F. Leinders-Zufall T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, pheromones modulate multiple aspects of mating behavior (4Ferveur J.F. Behav. Genet. 2005; 35: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 5Vosshall L.B. Neuron. 2008; 59: 685-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The past few years have brought remarkable progress in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pheromone perception by the olfactory system. In particular, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), 4The abbreviations used are: cVA, cis-vaccenyl acetate; CheB, chemosensory B; CheBr, CheB-related; AP, activator protein; Gr, gustatory receptors; ML, MD-like; MD, myeloid differentiation protein; NPC2, Niemann-Pick gene 2 protein; PBP, pheromone-binding protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a volatile pheromone produced in the male ejaculatory bulb, is detected by one or perhaps two olfactory receptor proteins expressed in specific subsets of olfactory hairs on the antennae of both sexes (6Ha T.S.

Despite the apparently identical responses it engenders in the peripheral olfactory organs of males and females (8van der Goes van Naters W. Carlson J.R. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 606-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), cVA inhibits male courtship behavior, but accelerates female mating (7Kurtovic A. Widmer A. Dickson B.J. Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Another olfactory receptor is tuned to male-specific odors distinct from cVA, and two others respond indistinguishably to male and female odors (8van der Goes van Naters W. Carlson J.R. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 606-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Less is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in detecting a number of pheromones that have very low volatility, which also play critical roles in modulating Drosophila mating behavior (2Wicker-Thomas C. J. Insect Physiol. 2007; 53: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Ferveur J.F. Behav. Genet. 2005; 35: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These long-chain hydrocarbons (C23-C27) are produced by specialized epidermal cells in the abdomen. In particular, female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons are required for normal stimulation of male courtship behavior (9Marcillac F. Ferveur J.F. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Savarit F. Sureau G. Cobb M. Ferveur J.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, whereas these compounds have very low volatility and are only effective over a radius of less than 1 cm (12Gailey D.A. Lacaillade R.C. Hall J.C. Behav.

Although there have been recent breakthroughs in the characterization of the olfactory perception of these cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones (8van der Goes van Naters W. Carlson J.R. Curr.

Differences in the number and innervation patterns of taste sensilla between the sexes (19Nayak S.V. Singh R.N. Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1983; 12: 273-291Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Possidente D.R. Murphey R.K. Dev.

Plenum Press, New York1989: 377-385Crossref Google Scholar), provided early evidence that taste sensilla on male forelegs are involved in detection of pheromones. We and others therefore identified genes that are specifically expressed in subsets of gustatory sensilla on male front legs, at least two of which are required for normal male courtship response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons (16Bray S. Amrein H. Neuron. 2003; 39: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 17Park S.K. Mann K.J. Lin H. Starostina E. Kolski-Andreaco A. Pikielny C.W. Curr.

Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CheA29a and CheB42a, two genes expressed specifically in subsets of gustatory sensilla on male front legs, defined two novel and unrelated families of small secreted proteins (23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that CheB42a is expressed in the same taste hairs as Gr68a (17Park S.K. Mann K.J. Lin H. Starostina E. Kolski-Andreaco A. Pikielny C.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1154-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a putative gustatory pheromone receptor (16Bray S. Amrein H. Neuron. 2003; 39: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss of CheB42a results in a remarkably specific effect on the elaborate courtship behavior that males direct at females (17Park S.K. Mann K.J. Lin H. Starostina E. Kolski-Andreaco A. Pikielny C.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1154-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although unaffected in several other behaviors, including the early steps in the courtship sequence, CheB42a mutant males attempt to copulate earlier and more frequently than controls with other individuals of the same species, whether male or female, as long as they express female-specific hydrocarbons. These results indicate that CheB42a functions in gustatory perception of female cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones that modulate male courtship. By what mechanism does CheB42a modulate pheromone perception? What is the function of the other 11 CheBs encoded by the D. melanogaster genome? Based on the evidence in this report, we propose that CheB42a and other CheBs are gustatory-specific pheromone-binding proteins that modulate detection of specific contact pheromones. Analysis of the Expression of Drosophila CheB Genes—RNA preparation, Northern blots, semi-quantitative PCR, and in situ hybridization were described previously (23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, RNA was extracted from appendages (antennae, legs, and wings), or heads (without antennae) separated in bulk by sieving (24Pikielny C.W. Hasan G. Rouyer F. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 35-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To allow for a rough comparison of the expression levels from different genes, all probes were of ∼500 nucleotides, labeled at similar specific activities with [32P]dCTP, and hybridized to identical filters that were exposed for the same amount of time (except for the exposure of the rp49 filter for 1/10th the time) to x-ray film. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, body parts of each type were hand-dissected from male or females, total nucleic acids were extracted, and cDNA generated using oligo(dT) primers. Amplification primers were designed to flank an intron so that the ratio of the short product resulting from amplification of the cDNA, to the long product resulting from amplification of genomic DNA, provides a relative measure of the mRNA levels in different samples (25Diviacco S. Norio P. Zentilin L. Menzo S. Clementi M. Biamonti G. Riva S. Falaschi A. Giacca M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Expression of CheB38c was further analyzed by generating a CheB38c-Gal4 fusion, in which 5.2 kb of genomic DNA upstream of the CheB38c initiation codon were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and inserted 5′ of the hsp70 TATA box in the pGATB vector (26Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic flies were generated using standard methods (27Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar) and GFP expression was analyzed for several independent insertions in crosses to UAS-GFP lines obtained from the Drosophila stock center (Bloomington, IN). For quantitative real-time PCR, RNA was extracted from whole flies with TRIzol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen), and further purified on RNeasy/QIAamp columns (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)20 and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time PCR were performed in 96-well thin-wall plates (Applied Biosystems) using an Applied Biosystems 7300/7500 Real Time PCR System according to the manufacturer’s suggested procedure, with the following modifications. One primer in each pair was designed to span an exon-exon junction, resulting in specific amplification of cDNA as confirmed in pilot experiments (data not shown). For every sample, specificity of amplifications was further confirmed by analysis of the dissociation curve. In every experiment, the relative concentration of each mRNA was obtained by comparison to a standard curve generated by amplification of serial dilutions of the corresponding cDNA product. To account for possible differences in total RNA concentration between samples, all values were normalized to the relative concentration of a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein mRNA (rp49). Independent replications of these measurements were performed at least once for seven of the 12 CheB genes, in four cases with different primers, with similar results (not shown).

The sequences of over 100 ML domain proteins were obtained from the SMART server (30Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (31Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) at the European Bioinformatics Institute server, and alignments edited and displayed using BOXSHADE. PSI-BLAST significance scores depend on a number of parameters, including the number of sequences in the data base at the time of the search, but in all cases discussed here, p < 1 × 10-10. Several PSI-BLAST searches using one of the CheBs as query indicate significant similarities with CheBrs and vice versa, and searches with either type of insect protein indicate significant similarities with human GM2-AP and related proteins from other organisms. In the same searches, similarities with NPC2, Der f2, and many other ML proteins are either not detected, or associated with much poorer significance scores than GM2-APs. In addition, PSI-BLAST searches using human GM2-AP as query yield significant scores with CheBrs but not with NPC2, Der f2, or many other MLs. An identical search restricted to arthropod sequences also identifies significant similarities with D. melanogaster CheBs but not to Drosophila NPC2 (32Huang X. Warren J.T. Buchanan J. Gilbert L.I.

Briefly, front legs of Canton S males were dissected by hand and fixed overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After three rinses in PBS solution, the legs were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (25, 50, 75, and 90% and three times at 100%), and embedded in Paraplast Plus (Fisher Scientific) tissue embedding media at 60 °C. Samples were sectioned on a microtome (Olympus Cut 4060), collected on Superfrost plus microslides (Fisher Scientific), and dried at 39 °C overnight. The slides were then dewaxed in xylenes, rehydrated in 100, 75, 50, and 25% ethanol, rinsed in PBS, and blocked in PBT (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% normal goat serum (Roche) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with guinea pig anti-CheB42a antibody (23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) at a 1:200 dilution, and when applicable, rat anti-PBPRP2 (34Park S.K. Shanbhag S.R. Wang Q. Hasan G. Steinbrecht R.A. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 300: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at a 1:300 dilution for 4 h at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBT. The sections were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti-guinea pig antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), and when appropriate, with goat anti-rat antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes), at dilutions of 1:200. After three washes in PBT, the stained sections were mounted in Vectashield and analyzed under a Leica TCS confocal microscope. Genes of the Drosophila CheB Family Are Expressed in a Variety of Sexually Dimorphic, Gustatory-specific Patterns in Adult Flies—We have previously shown that, in addition to CheB42a, the mRNAs for three other D. melanogaster CheB genes are enriched and present at sexually dimorphic levels in a preparation of mixed fly appendages with chemosensory function (legs, wings, and third antennal segments) (23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The same mRNAs are not detected in heads lacking the olfactory third antennal segment. We have now confirmed and extended this observation using Northern blots to analyze the distribution of all 12 CheB mRNAs (Fig. 1A). The mRNAs for 8 CheB genes (CheB38a, -38b,-42a,-53a,-53b,-74a,-93a, and -93b) are detected only in male appendages, whereas CheB98a mRNA is found at higher levels in the appendages of males than those of females. In the above experiments, RNA was extracted from a pool of appendages with different chemosensory functions: legs and wings carry large numbers of gustatory sensilla, whereas the third antennal segment is the main olfactory organ of the fly (35Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We therefore further analyzed expression of all 12 CheB genes in specific appendages (Fig. 1B) using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method that allows comparison of relative concentrations of an mRNA among small samples of different tissues (23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Diviacco S. Norio P. Zentilin L. Menzo S. Clementi M. Biamonti G. Riva S. Falaschi A. Giacca M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed on total nucleic acids extracted from distinct body parts dissected from either males or females: front legs, second and third pairs of legs (pooled), wings, third antennal segment, heads (without third antennal segment, but retaining many taste hairs on the labelum as well as inside the pharynx), and bodies (decapitated and with no legs or wings). As primers were designed to hybridize to either side of an intron, the relative concentrations of the short product resulting from amplification of the cDNA, and the long product, resulting from amplification of genomic DNA, provides a measure of the relative levels of mRNA in different samples (Fig. 1B). This analysis confirms that expression of all 12 CheB genes is specific to appendages and undetectable in heads and bodies. Furthermore, expression of all 12 CheB genes is found almost exclusively in the legs and wings, the two gustatory appendages. Only CheB42b and CheB93a are expressed detectably, albeit at levels lower than in wings and legs, in an olfactory appendage: the third antennal segment. The coincidence of the expression of CheB family genes with gustatory function is further reinforced by their preferential expression in the front legs relative to the other two pairs of legs, mirroring the higher concentrations of taste sensilla found on the front legs (19Nayak S.V. Singh R.N. Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1983; 12: 273-291Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Possidente D.R. Murphey R.K. Dev. Biol. 1989; 132: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The only exceptions to this rule are CheB98a, which is not detectably expressed in the legs of animals of either gender, and the remarkable absence of CheB38c expression in the front legs of males, see below. Although expression of the 12 CheBs is almost exclusively gustatory-specific, it occurs in a variety of patterns. CheBs can be assigned to one of two groups based on their expression (Table 1). CheB42a and seven other CheBs in Group I are expressed exclusively or at highest levels in the front legs of males. As expression of CheB42a is restricted to a subset of hairs on the front legs of males (17Park S.K. Mann K.J. Lin H. Starostina E. Kolski-Andreaco A. Pikielny C.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1154-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we compared it to that of CheB93a, another Group I gene, by double label in situ hybridization (Fig. 2). As previously reported for CheB42a (17Park S.K. Mann K.J. Lin H. Starostina E. Kolski-Andreaco A. Pikielny C.W. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1154-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Xu A. Park S.K. D'Mello S. Kim E. Wang Q. Pikielny C.W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), both genes are expressed in punctate patterns that correspond to cells or groups of cells associated with gustatory sensilla. However, the mRNAs for CheB93a and CheB42a are never found in the same cell, or even in association with the same sensillum. Therefore, expression of CheB42a and CheB93a is associated with two distinct subsets of taste hairs on the front legs of males.TABLE 1D. melanogaster CheBs can be classified into two groups based on their expression patternsGroup I: specific expression in male front legsGroup II: specific or preferential expression on wings of either sexCheB38a, CheB38b, CheB42a, CheB53a, CheB53b, CheB74a, and CheB93b are only expressed in male front legsCheB38c is also expressed in legs, except male front legsCheB93a is expressed in a distinct subset of hairs from CheB42a and, at lower levels, in the third antennal segmentCheB42b is also expressed in the third antennal segment of males, and front legs of both males and femalesCheB42c is also expressed in the front legs of both males and femalesCheB98a is wing-specific, higher in males Open table in a new tab In contrast to Group I genes, all four CheB genes in Group II are expressed in both males and females. Furthermore, whereas three Group II genes are detectably expressed in legs, all are also expressed at high levels in the wings, another appendage with large numbers of gustatory sensilla. We therefore investigated in more detail the expression pattern of the Group II gene CheB38c by generating a transgenic construct in which 5.2 kb of sequences upstream of the CheB38c gene are fused to the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 (26Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In the presence of a UAS-GFP reporter construct, this transgene results in specific, punctate production of GFP on the legs and wings of males and females but, conspicuously, not on the front legs of males (Fig. 3A). This pattern is consistent with the distribution of CheB38c mRNA (Fig. 1B), suggesting that it faithfully replicates expression of the endogenous CheB38c gene. Higher resolution imaging shows that all GFP-expressing cells or groups of cells on the wings and legs are associated specifically with gustatory sensilla (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Therefore, the three CheB genes whose expression we have analyzed at the cellular level, CheB42a, CheB93a, and CheB38c, are expressed specifically in three non-overlapping subsets of taste hairs. Intriguingly, the combined expression of the 12 CheB genes is also restricted to a subset of all taste hairs of Drosophila, and is almost completely excluded from sensilla involved in detection of food stimuli. In particular, we have not detected any CheB expression in the many gustatory hairs of the head. Those include a high concentration of taste hairs on the surface of the labelum, many of which have been shown to function in gustatory detection of food components, as well as a number of taste hairs located inside the pharynx where they may allow the last sampling of any food before it is transferred to the digestive organs (35Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas almost all sensilla on the front legs of males and females express CheB42a, CheB93a, or CheB38c, none of these genes is expressed in the two terminal sensilla that respond to sugars and salts (36Meunier N. Ferveur J.F. Marion-Poll F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1583-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C and data not shown). In addition, expression of CheB42a, CheB93a, or CheB38c is also undetectable in the four shorter sensilla on segments 4 and 5 that respond to bitter compounds (37Meunier N. Marion-Poll F. Rospars J.P. Tanimura T. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The only food-tasting sensilla in which we have found CheB expression are four sugar-sensing sensilla on the second and third tarsal segments of female legs (36Meunier N. Ferveur J.F. Marion-Poll F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1583-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Gustatory-specific expression of the 12 CheB genes therefore occurs largely in taste hairs that are unresponsive to food components such as sugars, salts, and bitter compounds. In addition to displaying a variety of gustatory-specific patterns of expression, at least 11 of the 12 CheB genes are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner. Expression of the 8 genes in Group I is detected only in males (Table 1). Although all four genes in Group II are expressed in both males and females, expression in the two sexes is either qualitatively or quantitatively different in at least three cases. In a pattern strikingly complementary to that of Group I genes, CheB38c is expressed in all legs and wings of both sexes, with the exception of the front legs of males (Figs. 1 and 3). CheB42b mRNA, whereas present at comparable levels in the legs and wings of both sexes, is expressed in the third antennal segments of males but not females (Fig. 1). Finally, whereas CheB98a expression is only detected in the wings, it is higher in males than females (Fig. 1). CheB42c is the only member of t"
https://openalex.org/W2056560532,"Background Polyketides are a diverse group of biotechnologically important secondary metabolites that are produced by multi domain enzymes called polyketide synthases (PKS). Methodology/Principal Findings We have estimated frequencies of type I PKS (PKS I) – a PKS subgroup – in natural environments by using Hidden-Markov-Models of eight domains to screen predicted proteins from six metagenomic shotgun data sets. As the complex PKS I have similarities to other multi-domain enzymes (like those for the fatty acid biosynthesis) we increased the reliability and resolution of the dataset by maximum-likelihood trees. The combined information of these trees was then used to discriminate true PKS I domains from evolutionary related but functionally different ones. We were able to identify numerous novel PKS I proteins, the highest density of which was found in Minnesota farm soil with 136 proteins out of 183,536 predicted genes. We also applied the protocol to UniRef database to improve the annotation of proteins with so far unknown function and identified some new instances of horizontal gene transfer. Conclusions/Significance The screening approach proved powerful in identifying PKS I sequences in large sequence data sets and is applicable to many other protein families."

First, heme O synthase catalyzes the conversion of heme B to heme O via the farnesylation of a vinyl group at position C-2 (5Puustinen A. Wikstrom M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Second, heme A synthase converts heme O to heme A by oxidizing the C-8 methyl substituent on heme O to an aldehyde group (1Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A.

Heme A has no known physiological function other than as a cofactor in the terminal heme-copper oxidases. COX10 and COX15, encoding eukaryotic HOS and HAS, respectively, are functionally conserved from yeast to humans (6Murakami T. Reiter L.T. Lupski J.R.

Mutations in either COX10 or COX15 in humans lead to metabolic diseases associated with isolated CcO deficiency, including Leigh syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (9Antonicka H. Mattman A.

Recently, a deficiency in heme A biosynthesis was suggested to be involved in age-related decline of CcO in patients with Alzheimer disease (11Atamna H. Ageing Res. Rev. 2004; 3: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Assembly of the multisubunit CcO complex is a complicated and sequential process (12Williams S.L. Valnot I. Rustin P. Taanman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that requires more than two dozen nuclear-encoded accessory proteins (13Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene. 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of bovine heart CcO reveals that the two heme A molecules are deeply buried in the hydrophobic pocket of CcO (14Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawaitoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), implying that the insertion of heme A probably occurs early during the CcO assembly process. The identification of a heme a-Cox1 intermediate and the lack of Cox1-Cox4-Cox5 subassembly complex in COX10-deficient human cells further support the notion that heme A insertion occurs at an early step during CcO assembly (12Williams S.L.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a deletion of Surf1 results in a 50% loss of heme a3, indicating that Surf1 might be involved in heme a3 maturation (17Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17652-17656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the availability of heme A is a key determinant in the assembly of CcO, the reactions catalyzed by HOS and HAS are likely targets for regulation. Because of its high reduction potential (18Zhuang J.Y. Reddi A.R. Wang Z.H. Khodaverdian B. Hegg E.L. Gibney B.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12530-12538Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), free heme A is potentially even more toxic than free heme B. Therefore, cells presumably must have a controlled mechanism to regulate the synthesis, transport, and insertion of heme A to ensure that there is sufficient but not excess heme A available in cells. Although the presence of heme A is strongly connected to copper availability under most circumstances, neither the transcription, translation, stability, nor the activity of either HOS or HAS is affected by intracellular copper levels (19Morrison M.S. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12554-12563Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our previous data support a model whereby bacterial HOS and HAS interact to form a complex in which heme O is channeled directly from HOS to HAS (20Brown B.M. Wang Z.H. Brown K.R. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13541-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because either the conversion of heme O to heme A or the release of the heme A product appears to be rate-limiting, we hypothesize that in bacteria this HAS-HOS complex might partially regulate the flux of hemes through the heme A biosynthetic pathway. Our hypothesis is consistent with the studies of Barros and Tzagoloff in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggesting that the activity of HOS is down-regulated either by HAS or the product of HAS (21Barros M.H. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They also hypothesized that the activity of HAS is positively regulated by a downstream CcO assembly intermediate or subunit of CcO, because most cox mutants have significantly decreased levels of heme A (21Barros M.H. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances, the detailed regulatory mechanism of heme A biosynthesis is still far from clear. Large scale genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches seem to suggest that O2 concentrations, fermentable versus non-fermentable carbon sources, rich versus minimal medium, and respiratory competence have no dramatic effect on the transcription of either HOS or HAS (22Kwast K.E. Lai L.C. Menda N. James 3rd, D.T. Aref S. Burke P.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O.

Although these results might initially seem surprising because of the key role that heme A plays in respiration, the fact that no significant signals were detected in the large scale screening is perhaps to be expected given the low mRNA levels of COX10 and COX15. Therefore, individual analysis is required to determine the regulation of these two genes. In this study, we examine the regulatory mechanism of Cox15 (HAS) and Cox10 (HOS) in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the two physiological partners do not share the same regulatory mechanism, perhaps suggesting an additional function for HAS and/or HOS. Interestingly, the stoichiometry between Cox15 and Cox10 is ∼8:1, not 1:1 as it has generally been assumed.

Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) via PCR, and homologous recombination was used to attach the 13Myc epitope tag to the C terminus of genomic Cox15 and Cox10. The primers used for Cox15 were described previously (19Morrison M.S. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12554-12563Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The primers for Cox10 were 5′-GATTGGTATTATCCTGGTGAAGCAAAGCGACCACAGGAACGATTTCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′ and 5′-GACTGCCCTTTAAGCGTTGTCTCTTTATCTCATTGTAACTAATGGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′. To knock out HEM1 via homologous recombination, the URA3 marker was amplified from plasmid pBS1539. The primers utilized for this deletion were 5′-ATGCAACGCTCCATTTTTGCGAGGTTCGGTAACTCCTCTGCCGCTGTTTCTGAAGCTTGATATCGAAT-3′ and 5′-TTACTGCTTGATACCACTAGAAACCTCTAGTTGTTTAACGATGGGGTCTCTACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′. Homologous recombination was performed with the method of high lithium transformation as previously described (19Morrison M.S. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12554-12563Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were cultured at 30 °C either in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) or in synthetic defined (SD) medium with any necessary auxotrophic requirements, both supplemented with either 2% dextrose, 2% galactose, or 2% ethanol-3% glycerol as a carbon source. In this report, 2% dextrose was used as the carbon source unless specifically noted otherwise. When appropriate, media was supplemented with various amounts of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), hemin (chloride salt of ferric heme B), or TEM (0.5% Tween 80, 12 μg/ml ergosterol, and 55.6 μg/ml methionine) (27Crisp R.J.

Hemin was dissolved in a 0.1% NaOH aqueous solution to obtain a 15 mg/ml 1000× stock solution. Plasmids—We cloned the upstream 1000-bp promoter region of COX10 and COX15 from genomic DNA, and then subcloned the fragments singly into the yeast plasmid YEp354 (28Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27636-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene without a promoter. The COX10 and COX15 promoter regions were amplified from genomic yeast DNA using the following primers: 5′-CCCGGGTCGACCCGACGAATACGGCGGAAC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGAAGCTTCATCTAAAGAGGAAAAAAGGA-3′ (COX10); 5′-CGCGCCCGGGTTATTATTGTCAATAACTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCCGGGAGCATGACGTACAGTAGTAGTTAC-3′ (COX15). The lacZ reporter plasmid containing the COX10 promoter sequence is named pCOX10/lacZ, and the lacZ reporter plasmid containing COX15 promoter sequence is named pCOX15/lacZ. Plasmid pMCOX15/lacZ was derived from pCOX15/lacZ by mutating the putative Hap1 binding site on the COX15 promoter region. Mutation of the potential Hap1 binding site was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche). The primers were 5′-GATCCGCATTTAAAAAGGCTTACGGCTTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAAGCCGTAAGCCTTTTTAAATGCGGATC-3′. E. coli DH5α was used as the host for plasmid construction and amplification, and unmutated template DNA was cleaved with DpnI (NEB). β-Galactosidase Activity Assay—Transformants carrying the reporter plasmid (derived from YEp354, which contains a URA3 marker) were selected for URA3 prototrophy. The β-galactosidase activity assay was performed using a modified literature procedure (29Silverman S.J. Rose M. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Activity units = (1000 × A420)/(volume of culture assayed × time of reaction × A600). Total RNA Extraction—The RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen was used to purify total RNA from yeast strains grown under various conditions. Usually ∼5 × 107 yeast cells were processed via mechanical disruption to obtain ∼50 μg of RNA, and an on-column DNase digestion was performed to remove any residual DNA contamination. The purity of RNA was analyzed via the A260/A280 ratio. Reverse Transcriptase (RT) Real-Time PCR—cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA by SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase and Oligo (dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 7500 Real Time PCR system and the SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix from Applied Biosystems were then utilized to quantify the amount of cDNA generated from the previous reverse transcription reaction. ACT1 was used as the endogenous control. Primers were designed by Primer Expression Software (Applied Biosystems). The forward primers were 5′-AGAAGGCCGTAATTCCAAGGA-3′ (COX15), 5′-AAAAATGCCGGATACGTTATGAC-3′ (COX10), and 5′-TCGTTCCAATTTACGCTGGTT-3′ (ACT1), and the reversed primers were 5′-AACGACGCCCATCATAACATG-3′ (COX15), 5′-GACACACGGGCGTTTAGGA-3′ (COX10), and 5′-CGGCCAAATCGATTCTCAA-3′ (ACT1). The data were analyzed using the relative standard curve method, using COX15 from a plasmid to generate the standard curve according to the manufacturer's instructions. After normalization to the endogenous control (ACT1), the relative amounts of COX15 mRNA and COX10 mRNA from different strains were compared. The PCR volume for each well was 25 μl, containing 1–100 ng of cDNA and 400 μm primers. The validation experiment showed that the PCR efficiency of COX10, COX15, and ACT1 are approximately equal. Two independent experiments were performed to quantify the relative amounts of COX15 mRNA and COX10 mRNA in MHY100 and MHY200 strains, and for all experiments, each sample was replicated four times. The S.D. is less than 0.3. Mitochondria Isolation and Western Analysis—S. cerevisiae cells containing either Cox10 or Cox15 genomically tagged with a C-terminal 13Myc epitope tag were grown for 24 h to exponential phase. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (19Morrison M.S. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12554-12563Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE using a 12% gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope tag (Invitrogen). Mitochondrial porin was also probed as the loading control. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Pierce). The nitrocellulose membrane was then treated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce), and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of the bands were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH). Anaerobic Growths—Yeast cells were grown in SD medium at room temperature (22–25 °C) for 24 h with spinning in an anaerobic Coy chamber ([O2] = 1 ppm). Media was supplemented with either TEM (27Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or hemin (0.5 μg/ml or 15 μg/ml) to support growth under the rigorously anaerobic conditions. Analogous experiments were performed in the air for comparison. In all cases, the media contained 3% glucose to ensure glucose repression of oxidative metabolism, thereby allowing direct comparison of COX15 expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Quantification of COX15 transcription was monitored via β-galactosidase activity, and Cox15 protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. COX15 Is a Heme B-regulated Gene—To define the regulatory mechanism of COX15 transcription, we initially utilized an in vivo transcription assay in which the COX15 promoter was fused to a lacZ reporter gene, thus allowing us to screen a number of different growth conditions. Quantification of COX15/lacZ transcription was monitored via the activity of β-galactosidase, which is encoded by the lacZ gene. The plasmid pCOX15/lacZ was transformed into wild-type strain W303a and several yeast mutant strains (hem1Δ, coq9Δ, qcr7Δ, mss51Δ, and cox10Δ). The strains carrying pCOX15/lacZ were grown in SD medium supplemented with either glucose, galactose, or ethanol/glycerol as the carbon source. HEM1 encodes 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALA synthase), which catalyzes the first step in the heme B biosynthetic pathway (30Urban-Grimal D. Volland C. Garnier T. Dehoux P. Labbe-Bois R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Coq9 is involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q, which competes with heme A biosynthesis for the farnesyl moiety (31Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar, 32Johnson A. Gin P. Marbois B.N. Hsieh E.J. Wu M. Barros M.H. Clarke C.F. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31397-31404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Qcr7 encodes subunit 7 of the ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase complex, one component of the respiratory chain (33Lee S.Y. Raha S. Nagar B. Robinson B.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Mss51 is a translational activator of the mitochondrial genome-encoded Cox1 and is also required for the elongation of Cox1 (34Barrientos A. Zambrano A. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Both mss51Δ and cox10Δ are respiratory incompetent due to the deficiency of CcO, while coq9Δ and qcr7Δ are respiratory incompetent due to the deficiency of the ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase complex. The results show that neither carbon source, nor the presence/absence of Cox10, Mss51, Qcr7, or Coq9 has any effect on the expression of the COX15/lacZ gene fusion (data not shown); conversely, the data indicate that Hem1 might play some role in COX15 regulation. To probe more fully the role of Hem1 on COX15 regulation, hem1Δ cells (DY5113, hem1::URA3) carrying pCOX15/lacZ were grown in SD medium containing various concentrations of ALA (0, 0.04, 0.2, 0.28, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mm). In the absence of HEM1, cells can't synthesize heme B and require exogenous heme B, δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), or a source of unsaturated fatty acids, sterols, and methionine (TEM) (27Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The intracellular heme B concentration can be manipulated by supplementing the growth medium with different amounts of ALA. It has been demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 μg/ml ALA (4 μm) allows for minimal growth, and that the addition of 50 μg/ml ALA (0.4 mm) leads to normal growth (35Kennedy M.A. Barbuch R. Bard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the heme B-depleted condition (neither ALA nor hemin was added to the medium), we supplemented the medium with TEM to obtain viable cells (27Crisp R.J. Pollington A. Galea C. Jaron S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45499-45506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The effect of ALA concentration on β-galactosidase activity is shown in Fig. 1A. The β-galactosidase activity increased as the ALA concentration increased, demonstrating that the transcription of the COX15/lacZ gene fusion is positively regulated either by heme B or a heme precursor. To clarify whether heme B or a heme precursor regulates the COX15 gene, hem1Δ cells carrying pCOX15/lacZ were grown in SD medium supplemented with either 15 μg/ml hemin (ferric heme B chloride) or TEM, and the β-galactosidase activity of the cells grown under the two different growth conditions was compared. (Adding hemin instead of ALA to the medium bypasses the entire heme B synthetic pathway.) Fig. 1B illustrates the dramatic difference in β-galactosidase activity between cells grown in the absence of heme B (TEM supplemented) and cells grown in the presence of heme B, which clearly demonstrates that it is intracellular heme B, not a heme precursor, which positively regulates the transcription of the COX15 gene. To identify whether this phenomenon is strain-dependent or more general to other yeast strains, the same experiment was performed on another hem1Δ strain, MHY100 (BWG1-7a background). Consistent with previous data shown in Fig. 1A, the β-galactosidase activity increased when the intracellular heme B concentration increased (Fig. 2), indicating that heme B-dependent transcription of HAS is probably a general phenomenon in S. cerevisiae. As expected, the β-galactosidase activity from cells carrying YEp354 alone was close to zero because the lacZ gene lacks a promoter in the plasmid (Fig. 2). COX15 Is a Hap1-regulated Gene—To understand how heme B positively regulates the transcription of COX15, we examined the role of Hap1 in COX15 regulation. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, there are two identified heme-regulated transcription factors, Hap1 and the Hap2/3/4/5 complex (36Mense S.M. Zhang L. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 37McNabb D.S. Pinto I. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hap1 activation is strictly and precisely regulated by heme concentration (36Mense S.M. Zhang L. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the connection between the Hap2/3/4/5 complex and heme is not clear. The Hap2/3/4/5 complex activates the genes required for respiratory metabolism when yeast cells are switching from fermentation to respiration (37McNabb D.S. Pinto I. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 1829-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been identified that this complex is repressed by glucose, and is de-repressed by galactose and non-fermentable carbon sources. Considering the fact that the transcription of COX15 is regulated by intercellular heme, we hypothesized that the COX15 gene might be transcriptionally regulated by Hap1. To determine if Hap1 plays a role in the regulation of COX15 transcription, we transformed a strain carrying a deletion in both hem1 and hap1, MHY200 (MHY100, hap1::LEU2), with pCOX15/lacZ. The transformed cells were incubated with various concentrations of ALA (0.04, 0.12, 0.20, 0.28, 0.4 mm) in the growth medium. Because MHY200 does not grow well in the absence of heme, 0.00 mm ALA with TEM media was not utilized in this experiment. As shown in Fig. 2, the β-galactosidase activity was constant in the MHY200 (MHY100, hap1::LEU2) strain regardless of the level of ALA in the growth medium, suggesting that transcription is now independent of intracellular heme levels and that the heme B-dependent transcription observed previously must be related to Hap1. Furthermore, compared with MHY100 (hem1Δ), MHY200 cells (hap1Δ and hem1Δ double mutants) have lower β-galactosidase activity in the presence of ALA. Together, these data indicate that COX15/lacZ is positively regulated by Hap1. The Consensus Recognition Sequence for Hap1 in the COX15 Promoter Region—While the previous results demonstrated that Hap1 is required for the maximal expression of COX15, they did not ascertain whether Hap1 affects COX15 transcription directly or indirectly through another factor. Further evidence is required to support that Hap1 is the transcription activator of COX15. Previous studies revealed that Hap1 recognizes at least two related DNA sequences, CGGNNNTANCGG and CGCNNNTANCGC (38Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 248-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Ter Linde J.J. Steensma H.Y.

Inspection of the COX15 promoter region identified one potential Hap1-binding sequence CGCATTTATCGC located –214 to –203 (relative to the A at the +1 of the ATG start condon) (Fig. 3A), which is highly homologous to the UAS of the CYC7 promoter (CGCTATTATCGC), another well-defined Hap1-regulated gene. Because not all potential Hap1 binding sites that are homologous to the consensus sites are functional (39Ter Linde J.J. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2002; 19: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), further analysis was required to verify that this is a true Hap1 binding site. To accomplish this, we mutated the potential Hap1 binding site on plasmid pCOX15/lacZ and inferred the relative expression level by quantifying the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. Previous studies showed that the two CGC triplets are critical for Hap1 binding (38Hach A. Hon T. Zh"

In response to various extracellular stimuli that persistently elevate IP3 levels, IP3 receptors are also ubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome. Here, for endogenous type 1 IP3 receptor (IP3R1) activated by endogenous signaling pathways and processed by endogenous enzymes, we sought to determine the sites of ubiquitination and the composition of attached ubiquitin conjugates. Our findings are (i) that at least 11 of the 167 lysines in IP3R1 can be ubiquitinated and that these are clustered in the regulatory domain and are found in surface regions, (ii) that at least ∼40! of the IP3R1-associated ubiquitin is monoubiquitin, (iii) that both Lys48 and Lys63 linkages are abundant in attached ubiquitin chains, and (iv) that Lys63 linkages accumulate most rapidly. Additionally, we find that not all IP3R1 subunits in a tetramer are ubiquitinated and that nontetrameric IP3R1 complexes form as degradation proceeds, suggesting that ubiquitinated subunits may be selectively extracted and degraded.

There are three homologous mammalian IP3R types (termed IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3) that can form either homo- or heterotetrameric channels. Each can be divided into an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a large central regulatory domain that contains several modulatory sites, and a C-terminal channel domain that contains six membrane-spanning helices and the channel pore (see Fig. 1D).

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is used by cells to maintain homeostasis by degrading both key proteins involved in important cellular processes (e.g. those that govern transcription and cell cycle transitions) and by allowing for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a mechanism that accounts for the disposal of aberrant or unrequired ER proteins (e.g. misfolded proteins or unassembled subunits of multimeric protein complexes) (10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). ERAD is currently being intensely studied and appears to rely on several key proteins, including Ubc7 and Hrd1 (10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat.

Ubiquitination refers to the process of conjugating ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid protein, to a target protein through the concerted action of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes (16Fang S. Weissman A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme first activates ubiquitin by forming a thiolester bond with the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. The activated ubiquitin moiety is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2 or Ubc), again through a thiolester bond. A ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) then recognizes the target protein and recruits a charged cognate E2 to its vicinity. Ubiquitin is then conjugated to the target protein via a covalent linkage between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and an ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue. Remarkably, ubiquitin contains seven lysines (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63), which can also be selected for ubiquitination, allowing for the formation of ubiquitin chains. Thus, targeted proteins can be tagged with either monoubiquitin or ubiquitin chains. Although our knowledge of the abundance and role of the various possible chain linkages is far from complete, it is clear that ubiquitin chains formed through Lys48 linkages signal for recognition and degradation by the proteasome, whereas Lys63-linked chains appear to be involved in diverse cellular processes, such as DNA damage response pathways, signal transduction through the NF-κB pathway, and protein trafficking (17Ikeda F. Dikic I. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 18Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is removed from targeted proteins by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which serve to reverse the consequences of ubiquitination and/or to recycle ubiquitin (19Love K. Catic A. Schlieker C. Ploegh H.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Little is known about how IP3Rs are processed by ERAD, including which of the 167 lysines in IP3R1 are targeted for ubiquitin conjugation. Unlike most other post-translational modifications, there is no consensus sequence for ubiquitination, and it remains unclear how lysines are selected (21Catic A. Collins C. Church G.M. Ploegh H.L. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3302-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Passmore L.A. Barford D. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Further, although it is clear that IP3Rs shift to much higher Mr values upon stimulation and thus are modified by many ubiquitin moieties (6Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is not known whether IP3Rs are multiply monoubiquitinated or modified by ubiquitin chains, and if so, through what linkages. Recent advances in mass spectrometry now allow for the determination of both of the lysines occupied by ubiquitin (23Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) and the composition and quantity of ubiquitin chains associated with substrates (24Kirkpatrick D.S. Denison C. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 750-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The latter relies on a novel technique termed absolute quantification (AQUA) (25Kirkpatrick D.S. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Methods. 2005; 35: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) that uses isotopically labeled internal standard peptides to quantitate peptides generated by tryptic digestion. To date, several ubiquitin-AQUA studies have been performed on ubiquitinated substrates and have yielded some interesting results; e.g. that ∼40! of the ubiquitin associated with overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor contains Lys63 linkages (26Huang F. Kirkpatrick D. Jiang X. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and that purified cyclin B1 is first multiply monoubiquitinated and then chains are added at those ubiquitin moieties via Lys48, Lys63, and Lys11 linkages (27Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, a caveat with these studies is that the substrates analyzed were either overexpressed or ubiquitinated in vitro and may not accurately reflect the situation in vivo. Nevertheless, these mass spectrometric techniques provide a powerful tool for identifying sites of ubiquitin conjugation and ubiquitin chain linkages. In the present study, we sought to define the molecular details of IP3R1 ubiquitination by first determining the sites at which IP3R1 is ubiquitinated and then the composition of attached conjugates. For this work, we focused on αT3-1 mouse pituitary gonadotropes, in which gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) induces a robust stimulation of endogenous IP3R1 ubiquitination and degradation (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and on Rat-1 fibroblasts, in which endothelin-1 has a similar effect (14Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34530-34537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis of ubiquitinated IP3R1 identified 11 lysines that can be ubiquitinated and revealed that IP3R1 is conjugated with both monoubiquitin and Lys48- and Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. We also show that not all IP3R1 subunits in a tetramer are ubiquitinated and provide evidence that individual subunits in a tetramer can be selectively degraded. Taken together, this indicates that IP3R1 ubiquitination and degradation are highly complex events. Materials—αT3-1 cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts were obtained and maintained as previously described (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol.

The antibodies used were: anti-IP3R1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 2731–2749 of IP3R1 (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol.

GnRH, endothelin-1, and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma. Bortezomib was a kind gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. Reagents for immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were obtained as previously described (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation for Mass Spectrometric Analysis—αT3-1 and Rat-1 cells were grown to confluence in 15-cm-diameter dishes, and 24 h prior to harvest, Rat-1 cells were cultured in serum-free medium. After stimulation, the cells were harvested by adding 3–6 ml/dish of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1! Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 8.0). The lysates were then incubated with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 min to inhibit DUBs, quenched by adding 5 mm dithiothreitol, incubated at 4°C for 30 min with occasional mixing, and cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C). Supernatants were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads and anti-IP3R1. Immune complexes were then isolated by centrifugation (1000 × g for 1 min at 4°C), washed three to five times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in gel loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and either Coomassie Blue-stained (10! acetic acid, 45! ethanol, 2.5 g/liter Brilliant Blue R) followed by destaining (10! acetic acid, 45! ethanol) or transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted and analyzed as previously described (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin Site Identification and AQUA Analysis—Regions corresponding to unmodified and/or ubiquitinated IP3R1 were excised from gels, destained (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50! acetonitrile), and then incubated overnight at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml trypsin (Promega) diluted in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.005! n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Following digestion, ubiquitin and/or IP3R1 isotope-labeled internal standard AQUA peptides were added to samples, and then peptides were extracted from the gel regions twice using 50! acetonitrile, 5! formic acid and dried in a Speedvac. Ubiquitin-AQUA peptides include diglycine signature peptides corresponding to the seven ubiquitin chain linkages, as well as a battery of unbranched tryptic peptides from ubiquitin as previously described (27Kirkpatrick D.S.

The IP3R1-AQUA peptides LEELGDQR (amino acids 538–545) and LQDIVSALEDR (amino acids 1603–1613) were generated by Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). Extracted peptides were desalted with Stage-Tip as described (29Rappsilber J. Mann M. Ishihama Y. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 1896-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar), dried, resuspended with 5! formic acid, 0.01! H2O2, and injected onto a 100-μm-internal diameter fused silica column pulled to a tip and packed with Magic C18 material (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Peptides injected onto the column were separated using a linear gradient of buffer B (acetonitrile, 0.125! formic acid) in buffer A (3! acetonitrile, 0.125! formic acid), and eluting peptides were analyzed using either an LTQ-FT or LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo, San Jose, CA) operating in data-dependent MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) mode. During each duty cycle, the mass spectrometer collected a high resolution precursor ion scan, followed by MS/MS on the 10 most abundant precursor ions. For IP3R1 ubiquitination site identification, MS/MS spectra were searched using Sequest with a variable mass addition of 114.0429 Da on lysines to match the diglycine signature, and spectral matches corresponding to IP3R1 ubiquitination sites were validated based on the mass accuracy of the precursor ion and manual inspection of the MS/MS spectra. For AQUA analysis, the ion-extracted chromatogram was drawn with 10 ppm mass accuracy, and cell-derived IP3R1 and ubiquitin peptides were quantified from the ratio of the area under the curve for these peptides versus that for ubiquitin- or IP3R1-derived AQUA peptides. Throughout the AQUA analysis, conditions were optimized to avoid differences in the reference peptide recovery as described (25Kirkpatrick D.S. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Methods. 2005; 35: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 27Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This allowed for a <50! coefficient of variation for quantitation of total ubiquitin amount using the four ubiquitin-AQUA peptides, and a <20! coefficient of variation for quantitation of IP3R1 amount using the two IP3R1-AQUA peptides. Immunoprecipitation from Microsomal Preparations—For immunoprecipitations involving anti-ubiquitin, we first prepared microsomes to remove free ubiquitin. Control or stimulated cells in 15-cm-diameter dishes were rinsed with ice-cold 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, were detached with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4), and were processed in a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes in the presence of 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and two additional strokes after the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol), and the microsomes were isolated by centrifugation (38,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C). They were then solubilized by incubation in 5 ml of lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C), and supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-IP3R1 or anti-ubiquitin and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Immune complexes were then processed for immunoblotting as previously described (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Blue Native PAGE—All of the reagents for blue native PAGE were obtained from Invitrogen, and the methods used are described in the Invitrogen NativePAGE™ Novex® Bis-Tris gel system user manual. Briefly, αT3-1 cells in six-well Falcon plates were harvested with 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer and after 30 min at 4 °C were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min). 75 μl of supernatants were mixed with 25 μl of 4 × sample buffer and 5 μl of 5! G-250 sample additive, and 20 μg of protein for each sample was loaded into wells of a 3–12! NativePAGE™ Novex® Bis-Tris gel and electrophoresed for 1 h at 150 V in dark cathode buffer and then for 45 min at 250 V in light cathode buffer. The gel was then washed for 10 min in blotting buffer (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was activated by washing in methanol. After transfer, the membrane was washed in 40! methanol, 10! acetic acid for 15 min, rinsed in water, and processed for immunoblotting as previously described (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Duplicate aliquots of supernatants were also subjected to regular SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting as described (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At Least 11 of the 167 Lysines in IP3R1 Can Be Ubiquitinated—We have previously demonstrated that exposure of αT3-1 cells to GnRH results in the ubiquitination and degradation of IP3R1 (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which quantitative immunoblotting (8Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) reveals, represents ∼99! of the IP3R complement in these cells (data not shown). To further our understanding of the mechanisms of IP3R ubiquitination, we initially sought to identify the sites of ubiquitin conjugation by subjecting ubiquitinated IP3R1 to mass spectrometry. Samples were prepared from αT3-1 cells treated with 100 nm GnRH for 7 min, which causes maximal IP3R1 ubiquitination (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the absence of GnRH, immunopurified IP3R1 migrates as a single band at ∼260 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and does not exhibit ubiquitin immunoreactivity (lane 2). In contrast, after exposure to GnRH, immunopurified IP3R1 is now strongly recognized by anti-ubiquitin, with immunoreactivity beginning at ∼270 kDa and extending upward (lane 4), consistent with the addition of multiple ubiquitin moieties; the reason that IP3R1 immunoreactivity is only partially shifted upward (lane 3) is that only ∼10! of IP3R1 is ubiquitinated under these conditions (7Wojcikiewicz R. J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry, immunopurified IP3R1s were excised from analogous Coomassie Blue-stained gels (lane 5) and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, which cleaves ubiquitin between Arg74 and Gly75 and leaves diglycine motifs (Gly75-Gly76) covalently attached to modified lysines (Fig. 1B) (23Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). This and missed cleavages that result from the modification of lysines generates signature peptides that allows for identification of lysines as ubiquitin conjugation sites. Using this method, 11 lysines were identified as sites of ubiquitination: Lys916, Lys962, Lys1571, Lys1771, Lys1884, Lys1885, Lys1886, Lys1901, Lys1924, Lys2118, and Lys2257 (Fig. 1C). In the eight independent analyses performed, peptides were detected that covered ∼64! of the IP3R1 sequence and included 128 of the 167 lysines in IP3R1 (supplemental Fig. S1). These detectable lysines were distributed randomly throughout IP3R1, indicating that there was no bias for or against observing ubiquitination of lysines in a particular region. Clearly, however, given that 39 lysines were not covered, it remains a possibility that there are ubiquitination sites additional to the 11 described in Fig. 1C. As a control, we also analyzed IP3R1 immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells, and as expected, almost no ubiquitination sites were identified (Lys962 only was identified in two of four experiments; data not shown). How the 11 ubiquitination sites are located within the IP3R1 primary sequence is depicted in Fig. 1D; as yet, high resolution structural data for full-length IP3R1 have not been defined (3Taylor C. da Fonseca P.A. Morris E.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), so these sites cannot yet be mapped in three dimensions. However, all of the ubiquitination sites are located within the regulatory domain and are within or adjacent to binding sites for modifiers (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D. O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) or regions predicted to be surface-exposed loops on the basis of their susceptibility to mild trypsinization (Fig. 1D) (30Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smet P. Sienaert I. Waelkens E. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Specifically, four sites, Lys916, Lys962, Lys1571, and Lys1924 are located near these trypsin cleavage sites, Lys1884–1886 and Lys1901 flank a caspase-3 cleavage site (Asp1891), and Lys1771 is located between a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (position 1755) and an ATP-binding site (positions 1773–1775) and is in a glycine-rich region thought to form a flexible connection between the N-terminal cytosolic region of IP3R1 and the region encompassing the channel domain (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D. O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 3Taylor C. da Fonseca P.A. Morris E.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, Lys1571 is adjacent to a phosphorylation site (position 1588) and within a calmodulin-binding site (positions 1565–1586), and Lys2118 and Lys2257 are near a critical Ca2+-binding site, Glu2100 (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D. O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Overall, these data show that the ubiquitination sites in IP3R1 are clustered in the regulatory domain and are found at sites likely to be surface-exposed. Monoubiquitin and Lys48- and Lys63-linked Ubiquitin Chains Are the Predominant Modifications on IP3R1—To quantitate and characterize the attached ubiquitin conjugates, we used ubiquitin-AQUA (23Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 25Kirkpatrick D.S. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Methods. 2005; 35: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This method relies on the fact that digestion of unmodified ubiquitin, either a single ubiquitin residue attached to the substrate (monoubiquitin) or the last ubiquitin of a chain (end cap ubiquitin), produces a series of peptides with unmodified lysine residues, whereas digestion of a ubiquitinated ubiquitin (i.e. that found in a chain) generates peptides containing the characteristic diglycine motif associated with the modified lysine (Fig. 1B)."
https://openalex.org/W1996664803,"Despite numerous in vivo evidences that Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 4 (TRAF4) plays a key biological function, how it works at the cellular and molecular level remains elusive.In the present study, we show using immunofluorescence and immuohistochemistry that TRAF4 is a novel player at the tight junctions (TJs). TRAF4 is connected to assembled TJs in confluent epithelial cells, but accumulates in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus when TJs are open in isolated cells or EGTA-treated confluent cells. In vivo, TRAF4 is consistently found at TJs in normal human mammary epithelia as well as in well-differentiated in situ carcinomas. In contrast, TRAF4 is never localized at the plasma membrane of poorly-differentiated invasive carcinomas devoid of correct TJs, but is observed in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of the cancer cells. Moreover, TRAF4 TJ subcellular localization is remarkably dynamic. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments show that TRAF4 is highly mobile and shuttles between TJs and the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that intracellular TRAF4 potentiates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in proliferating HeLa cells, an epithelial cell line known to be devoid of TJs.Collectively, our data strongly support the new concept of TJs as a dynamic structure. Moreover, our results implicate TRAF4 in one of the emerging TJ-dependent signaling pathways that responds to cell polarity by regulating the cell proliferation/differentiation balance, and subsequently epithelium homeostasis. Drastic phenotypes or lethality in TRAF4-deficient mice and drosophila strongly argue in favor of such a function."
https://openalex.org/W2024336674,"Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7; matrilysin) induces homotypic adhesion of colon cancer cells by cleaving cell surface protein(s) and enhances their metastatic potential. Our previous study (Yamamoto, K., Higashi, S., Kioi, M., Tsunezumi, J., Honke, K., and Miyazaki, K. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 9170–9180) demonstrated that binding of MMP-7 to cell surface cholesterol sulfate (CS) is essential for the cell membrane-associated proteolytic action of the protease. To determine the region of MMP-7 essential for binding to CS, we constructed chimeric proteases consisting of various parts of MMP-7 and those of the catalytic domain of MMP-2; the latter protease does not have an affinity for CS. Studies of these chimeric proteases and other mutants of MMP-7 revealed that Ile29, Arg33, Arg51, and Trp55, in the internal sequence, and the C-terminal three residues corresponding to residues 171–173 of MMP-7 are essential for binding to CS. An MMP-7 mutant, which had the internal 4 residues at positions 29, 33, 51, and 55 of MMP-7 replaced with the corresponding residues of MMP-2 and the C-terminal 3 residues deleted, had essentially no affinity for CS. This mutant and wild-type MMP-7 showed similar proteolytic activity toward fibronectin, whereas the mutant lacked the ability to induce the colon cancer cell aggregation. In the three-dimensional structure of MMP-7, the residues essential for binding to CS are located on the molecular surface in the opposite side of the catalytic cleft of the protease. Therefore, it is assumed that the active site of MMP-7 bound to cell surface is directed outside. We speculate that the direction of the cell-bound MMP-7 makes it feasible for the protease to cleave its substrates on cell surface. Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7; matrilysin) induces homotypic adhesion of colon cancer cells by cleaving cell surface protein(s) and enhances their metastatic potential. Our previous study (Yamamoto, K., Higashi, S., Kioi, M., Tsunezumi, J., Honke, K., and Miyazaki, K. (2006) J. Biol.

To determine the region of MMP-7 essential for binding to CS, we constructed chimeric proteases consisting of various parts of MMP-7 and those of the catalytic domain of MMP-2; the latter protease does not have an affinity for CS. Studies of these chimeric proteases and other mutants of MMP-7 revealed that Ile29, Arg33, Arg51, and Trp55, in the internal sequence, and the C-terminal three residues corresponding to residues 171–173 of MMP-7 are essential for binding to CS. An MMP-7 mutant, which had the internal 4 residues at positions 29, 33, 51, and 55 of MMP-7 replaced with the corresponding residues of MMP-2 and the C-terminal 3 residues deleted, had essentially no affinity for CS. This mutant and wild-type MMP-7 showed similar proteolytic activity toward fibronectin, whereas the mutant lacked the ability to induce the colon cancer cell aggregation. In the three-dimensional structure of MMP-7, the residues essential for binding to CS are located on the molecular surface in the opposite side of the catalytic cleft of the protease. Therefore, it is assumed that the active site of MMP-7 bound to cell surface is directed outside. We speculate that the direction of the cell-bound MMP-7 makes it feasible for the protease to cleave its substrates on cell surface. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2The abbreviations used are:MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseECMextracellular matrixCScholesterol sulfateCLcholesterolDNPdinitrophenyl groupDNP-RPLALWRSdinitrophenyl-Arg-Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu-Trp-Arg-Ser-OH3163v(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg amide 2The abbreviations used are:MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseECMextracellular matrixCScholesterol sulfateCLcholesterolDNPdinitrophenyl groupDNP-RPLALWRSdinitrophenyl-Arg-Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu-Trp-Arg-Ser-OH3163v(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg amide comprise a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and are believed to play pivotal roles in tissue remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor invasion (1Murphy G.

Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5089) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been suggested that several MMPs proteolytically modulate the biological functions of various cell surface proteins, including growth factor precursors, growth factor receptors, or cell adhesion molecules (4Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5089) Google Scholar); such regulation as well as MMP-catalyzed degradation of ECM is important for tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and progression. A typical MMP consists of an N-terminal propeptide of about 80 amino acids, a catalytic domain of about 170 amino acids, and a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain of about 200 amino acids. Membrane type MMPs further have a transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor on the C-terminal side of the hemopexin-like domain and are thus localized on the cell surface. It has been reported that membrane type 1 MMP cleaves several cell surface proteins, such as syndecan-1 (5Endo K. Takino T. Miyamori H. Kinsen H. Yoshizaki T. Furukawa M. Sato H. J. Biol.

Although various MMPs are overexpressed both in stromal and tumor cells in cancer tissues, MMP-7 has been detected specifically in tumor cells but not in stromal cells (11Nagashima Y. Hasegawa S. Koshikawa N. Taki A. Ichikawa Y. Kitamura H. Misugi K. Kihira Y. Matuo Y. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Expression of MMP-7 is correlated well with malignancy and metastasis of cancers, especially in liver metastasis of colon cancer (12Ishikawa T. Ichikawa Y. Mitsuhashi M. Momiyama N. Chishima T. Tanaka K. Yamaoka H. Miyazaki K. Nagashima Y. Akitaya T. Shimada H. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although MMP-7 has neither transmembrane domain nor glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, this protease processes several cell surface proteins, such as Fas-ligand (13Mitsiades N. Yu W.H. Poulaki V. Tsokos M. Stamenkovic I. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 577-581PubMed Google Scholar), protumor necrosis factor-α (14Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin.

Matrisian L.M. Mareel M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 111-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies further suggest that MMP-7-catalyzed cleavage of Notch on the cell surface leads to dedifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells by activating the Notch signaling pathway (17Sawey E.T. Johnson J.A. Crawford H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19327-19332Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We previously reported that active MMP-7 efficiently binds to the surface of human colon cancer cells and induces E-cadherin-mediated cell aggregation by processing a cell membrane protein(s). The aggregated cells showed dramatically enhanced metastatic potential in the nude mouse model (18Kioi M. Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Koshikawa N. Fujita K. Miyazaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8662-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently, we identified cholesterol sulfate (CS) as a major cell surface substance to which active MMP-7 binds (19Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Kioi M. Tsunezumi J. Honke K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9170-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that binding of MMP-7 to CS is essential for its membrane-associated proteolytic action and induction of the cell aggregation. Although mode of interaction between MMP-7 and liposome consisting of anionic or cationic lipids has been suggested (20Ganguly B. Banerjee J. Elegbede A.I. Klocke D.J. Mallik S. Srivastava D.K. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5723-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), detailed amino acid residues of the protease contributing to its interaction with CS have not been identified. In this study, we constructed various mutants of MMP-7 and identified residues of the protease essential for binding to CS. Clarification of the interaction between MMP-7 and CS provides the potential to develop MMP-7-targeted novel anti-cancer drugs that specifically block the membrane-associated proteolytic action of this MMP. Materials—The sources of materials used are as follows: l-arginine, cholesterol (CL), CS, and pFLAG-CTC vector from Sigma; cDNA of human proMMP-2 cloned into pCMV6 vector from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD); p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate from Tokyo Kasei (Tokyo, Japan); human recombinant MMP-7 from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); the synthetic substrate for MMPs, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-Ala-Arg amide (3163v) from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan); dinitrophenyl-Arg-Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu-Trp-Arg-Ser-OH (DNP-RPLALWRS) from Merck Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). cDNA of human proMMP-7 cloned into the pλPR vector was provided by Dr. T. Tanaka, (Nagahama Institute of Oriental Yeast Co., Shiga, Japan). The anti-human MMP-7 monoclonal antibody 11B4G was a gift from Dr. Y. Matsuo (Oriental Yeast). All custom oligo-DNA primers were provided by Rikaken Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. Construction of Expression Vector for MMP Mutants—Gene constructions carried out in this study are described in the supplemental material. Expression and Purification of MMP Mutants—The expression vectors of various MMP mutants were transfected separately into the Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The transformants were cultured in 2× YT medium (0.08! (w/v) tryptone, 0.5! (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.25! (w/v) NaCl) at 37 °C, and recombinant proteins were induced by the addition of 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 5-h induction, E. coli cells were broken in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA with a sonicator, and the resultant inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 100 mm dithiothreitol with gentle stirring for 2 h at 25 °C. The solubilized sample was first clarified by centrifugation and then applied to a Cosmosyl 5C4 column (4.6 × 100 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80! acetonitrile containing 0.1! trifluoroacetic acid for 70 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored at 280 nm. The recombinant proteins eluted at about 56–62! acetonitrile were collected. One mg each of the collected proteins was freeze-dried and dissolved again with 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 100 mm dithiothreitol. The dissolved samples were then refolded by the rapid dilution method using a refolding buffer containing 1.0 m arginine, as described previously (21Oneda H. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The refolded proteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm sodium HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2, and concentrated using a Centriprep YM-10 ultrafiltration device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by Bradford's dye method with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Assay of Effect of CS on Peptidolytic Activities of MMP-7 and Its Variants—Pro-forms of the MMP mutants (1 μm) were activated by incubation with 1 mm p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate at 37 °C for 2 h, as described previously (22Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10068-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As described in the supplemental material, we also constructed MMP-7 mutants that have a spacer sequence between the first methionine residue and N terminus of the catalytic domain instead of the propeptide sequence. This spacer sequence is designed to contain the C-terminal 9 residues of the propeptide of MMP-7 and a peptide bond susceptible to autocatalytic cleavage (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal spacer region of each mutant was removed autocatalytically during the preparation described above. Active forms of the MMP mutants were first measured for their activities toward a synthetic substrate 3163v, as described previously (22Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10068-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The peptidolytic activities of the representative mutants are listed in supplemental Table S2. MMP-7 (2.0 nm) and the mutants, of which concentrations were adjusted to give the activity equivalent to that of 2.0 nm MMP-7, were each incubated with various concentrations of CS or an equimolar mixture of CS and CL (CS/CL) in 190 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01! bovine serum albumin at 25 °C for 15 min. Then 10 μl of 1 mm 3163v was added to the mixture, and the incubation was further continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0). The amounts of the synthetic substrate hydrolyzed by proteases were measured fluorometrically with excitation at 326 nm and emission at 400 nm. The amount of the substrate hydrolyzed without enzyme was subtracted from the total amount of the hydrolyzed substrate. Separation of Free and CS-bound Forms of MMP-7 or Its Mutant—MMP-7 and its mutant were each incubated with various concentrations of CS in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05! polyethylene glycol 4000 at 25 °C for 15 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. The resultant precipitate containing the CS-bound form of proteases was resuspended in the assay buffer. The peptidolytic activities in the supernatant and the resuspended precipitate were measured as described above. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human colon cancer cell line Colo201 was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resources Bank. This cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum. Assay of MMP-7 Variant Binding to Cell Surface—Assay of the binding of MMP-7 variants to the surface of Colo201 cells was carried out as described previously (19Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Kioi M. Tsunezumi J. Honke K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9170-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The MMP-7 variants bound to the cell surface were detected by Western blotting analysis using the anti-MMP-7 antibody 11B4G (19Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Kioi M. Tsunezumi J. Honke K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9170-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cell Aggregation Assay—The cell aggregation assay was carried out as described previously (18Kioi M. Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Koshikawa N. Fujita K. Miyazaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8662-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The degree of cell aggregation was quantified by the following equation: cell aggregation (!) = (1 - Nt/Nc) × 100, where Nt (test) and Nc (control) represent the number of single cells in the presence or absence of a test sample, respectively. Measurement of Kinetic Parameters—MMP-7 and its mutants or these enzymes plus CS, concentrations of which are indicated in the legend of Fig. 8A, were incubated, separately, with various concentrations of DNP-RPLALWRS in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05! polyethylene glycol 4000 at 37 °C for 30 min. The total volume was 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0). Each sample was then diluted with the reaction buffer supplemented with 0.1 m EDTA, so that total concentration of the DNP-bearing peptides was adjusted to be 20 μm, based on the concentration of original peptide substrate. The amounts of the substrate hydrolyzed by proteases were measured fluorometrically with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 360 nm. The amount of the substrate hydrolyzed without enzyme was subtracted from the total amount of the hydrolyzed substrate. The steady-state kinetic parameters for peptide hydrolysis were obtained by double-reciprocal plot analysis. Effect of Deletion of C-terminal Residues of MMP-7 on Its Affinity for CS—It has been reported that MMP-7 has an affinity for CS, whereas MMP-2 and MMP-3 have no affinity with this acidic lipid (19Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Kioi M. Tsunezumi J. Honke K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9170-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction between MMP-7 and CS affects the activity of MMP-7, we measured the peptidolytic activity of MMP-7 in the presence of various concentrations of CS. As shown in Fig. 1C, the activity of MMP-7 was reduced with increasing concentrations of CS and reached constant in the presence of 6.3 μm or higher concentrations of CS. The activity of MMP-7 in the presence of saturating concentrations of CS was about 20! of that in the absence of CS. The IC50 value, which is defined in this study to be a concentration of CS giving half-maximal reduction of the MMP-7 activity, was 0.65 μm. CS did not affect the peptidolytic activity of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 (Fig. 1C), probably reflecting the inability of this protease to bind to CS. The mechanism of the CS-mediated reduction of the peptidolytic activity of MMP-7 is discussed below. To evaluate the CS binding affinities of MMP-7 and its variants, we compared the IC50 values for the CS-mediated reduction of their peptidolytic activities in the following studies. We previously constructed a FLAG-tagged MMP-7 (22Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10068-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which has an 8-residue FLAG epitope peptide on the C-terminal side of MMP-7. When the FLAG-tagged MMP-7 and wild-type MMP-7 were compared for their affinities for CS, the FLAG-tagged MMP-7 showed a slightly lower affinity for CS (data not shown). Therefore, the CS-binding site of MMP-7 may locate near the C terminus of the protease. To examine whether the C-terminal residues of MMP-7 contribute to the interaction with CS, we constructed MMP-7 mutants, named MMP-7ΔC3 and MMP-7ΔC8, that had the C-terminal 3 and 8 residues of MMP-7 deleted, respectively (Fig. 1A), and the effects of CS on the activities of these mutants were compared. As shown in Fig. 1C, the peptidolytic activities of MMP-7ΔC3 (IC50 = 3.1 μm) and MMP-7ΔC8 (IC50 = 4.0 μm) were reduced by CS with similar IC50 values. These IC50 values are about 5-fold higher than the value for the CS-mediated reduction of MMP-7 activity (0.65 μm), suggesting that the C-terminal 3 residues of MMP-7 partially contribute to its interaction with CS. Because the artificially added FLAG tag may obstruct the interaction between MMP-7 and CS, we constructed MMP-7 and its variants without adding the FLAG tag (Fig. 1, A and B). Since we could not use an anti-FLAG antibody to purify the variants of MMP-7, we purified them before the refolding, using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Effect of CS on Peptidolytic Activities of Chimeric MMP Mutants Consisting of Various Parts of MMP-7 and Those of MMP-2 Catalytic Domain—The data shown in Fig. 1C suggest that some regions of MMP-7 other than its C terminus also contribute to the high affinity interaction between the protease and CS, because the C-terminally deleted mutants of MMP-7 still had affinities for CS. To explore the regions of MMP-7 contributing to the affinity for CS, we constructed chimeric MMP mutants that consist of various N-terminal parts of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 and remaining C-terminal parts of MMP-7 (Fig. 2A), and effects of CS on their activities were compared. To facilitate understanding, we use active MMP-7 numbering for the amino acid residue numbers of the catalytic domain of MMPs (Fig. 2D) and the chimeric mutants. As shown in Fig. 2B, the activity of a mutant, named M2n-11-M7c, which consists of residues 1–10 of MMP-2 and residues 11–173 of MMP-7 was reduced by CS with a low IC50 value (0.49 μm). Because this IC50 value is close to the value for CS-mediated reduction of the MMP-7 activity (0.65 μm), the N-terminal part corresponding to residues 1–10 of MMP-7 is unlikely to be important for its binding to CS. As compared with M2n-11-M7c, M2n-37-M7c (IC50 = 3.9 μm) and M2n-56-M7c (IC50 = 7.2 μm) showed 8- and 15-fold lower affinity for CS, respectively, suggesting that the region corresponding to residues 11–55 of MMP-7 contributes partially to the interaction with CS. On the other hand, M2n-56-M7c, M2n-83-M7c, and M2n-156-M7c showed almost the same affinity for CS (IC50 = 7.2 μm), therefore suggesting that the region corresponding to residues 56–156 of MMP-7 is also unlikely to be important for its binding to CS. Similar to the case of MMP-7, the activity of M2n-11-M7c in the presence of saturating concentrations of CS was about 20! of that in the absence of CS, whereas the activities of M2n-37-M7c, M2n-56-M7c, M2n-83-M7c, and M2n-156-M7c reached less than 10! (Fig. 2B). The region corresponding to residues 11–37 of MMP-7 may correlate with the level of activity of MMP-7 upon its complex formation with CS. To verify that the observed activities of MMP-7 and its mutants in the presence of saturating concentrations of CS are those of enzyme-CS complexes but are not caused by a partial dissociation of the complexes, MMP-7 and M2n-37-M7c were first incubated with various concentrations of CS, and then free and CS-bound forms of the enzymes were separated by centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2C, the activity of MMP-7 in the supernatant disappeared as the concentration of CS was increased to 7.0 μm or higher. The activity of MMP-7 in the precipitate was increased with the increasing concentrations of CS and reached constant together with the disappearance of the activity in the supernatant. The activity that reached constant was about 20! of that in the absence of CS. When M2n-37-M7c was incubated with the saturating concentrations of CS, the activity of the mutant in the supernatant also disappeared, and its activity in the precipitate reached 3! of that in the absence of CS. These data suggest that CS-bound forms of MMP-7 and M2n-56-M7c have the peptidolytic activities, although their activities are much smaller than those of their free forms. CL Enhances CS Binding Affinities of MMP-7 and Its Variants—We previously reported that CS is localized in rafts or caveolae on the cancer cell surface (19Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Kioi M. Tsunezumi J. Honke K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9170-9180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since these microdomains are rich in CL, CS may form a complex with CL on the cell surface. To examine whether CL affects the affinity between MMP-7 and CS, we tested the effect of an equimolar mixture of CS and CL on the peptidolytic activity of MMP-7. As shown Fig. 3A, the activity of MMP-7 was reduced with increasing concentrations of the CS/CL mixture and reached constant in the presence of 1.6 μm or higher concentrations of the mixture. The activity of MMP-7 in the presence of saturating concentrations of the CS/CL mixture was about 10! of that in the absence of the mixture. The IC50 value for the CS/CL-mediated reduction of MMP-7 activity was 0.12 μm, indicating that MMP-7 has about 5-fold higher affinity for CS/CL as compared with its affinity for CS. Because CL alone did not affect the peptidolytic activity of MMP-7 (data not shown), it is likely that CL enhances the affinity between MMP-7 and CS. We also examined the effect of the CS/CL mixture on the peptidolytic activities of the chimeric MMP mutants, of which constructions are shown in Fig. 2A. The 1/IC50 values for the CS- or the CS/CL-mediated reduction of the activities of these mutants are compared in Fig. 3B. We found that CL enhanced about 5-fold each the CS binding affinities of wild-type MMP-7, M2n-11-M7c, and M2n-37-M7c, whereas it did not enhance the affinities of M2n-56-M7c, M2n-83-M7c, and M2n-156-M7c, suggesting that the region corresponding to residues 37–55 of MMP-7 correlates with the CL-enhanced CS binding affinity of this protease. We also found that the regions corresponding to residues 11–36 and 37–55 of MMP-7 contribute, respectively, to its high affinity interaction with CS/CL (Fig. 3B). As compared with the CS binding affinity of MMP-7, its affinity for CS/CL was reduced more prominently upon the replacement of residue 11–56. We further analyzed the CL-enhanced CS binding affinities of other variants of MMP-7 in the following studies, because the analysis was thought to be a benefit in detecting sensitively the contributions of individual amino acid residues. Contributions of Amino Acid Residues Located in a Region Corresponding to Residues 11–55 of MMP-7 to Its Interaction with CS—The data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 strongly suggest that the region corresponding to residues 11–55 of MMP-7 contains amino acid residues contributing to the affinity for CS. To explore the residues, we first divided the region of MMP-7 into five sections, and the residues in the each section were replaced with the corresponding residues of MMP-2 as schematically represented in Fig. 4. We found that the replacements of residues 24–31, 32–36, and 49–55 of MMP-7 led to 5.8-, 3.1-, and 4.6-fold reductions of the affinity for CS/CL, respectively (Fig. 4), whereas that of residues 13–23 and 37–48 did not affect the affinity significantly. When all of the residues 24–36 and 49–55 of MMP-7 were replaced with the corresponding residues of MMP-2, the resultant mutant, named MMP-7(24–36,49–55/M2), showed 420-fold reduced affinity for CS/CL as compared with MMP-7. In the regions corresponding to the residues 24–36 and 49–55 of MMP-7, 13 residues are different between MMP-7 and MMP-2 (Fig. 5). To examine which residues contribute the affinity for CS/CL, we next replaced individual residues in these regions of MMP-7 with the corresponding residues of MMP-2, as shown in Fig. 5. We found that the replacements of the pair Ile29 and Arg33 and the pair Arg51 and Trp55 of MMP-7 each led to a 10-fold reduction of the affinity for CS/CL. Other replacements, including that of Arg51 or Trp55, also reduced the affinity for CS/CL, whereas the replacements of Arg24, Pro27, His28, Leu34, and Val35 of MMP-7 did not affect the affinity. When all of the Ile29, Arg33, Arg51, and Trp55 of MMP-7 were replaced with the corresponding residues of MMP-2, the resultant mutant, named MMP-7(29,33,51,55/M2), showed 420-fold reduced affinity for CS/CL as compared with MMP-7 (Fig. 5). Since MMP-7(29,33,51,55/M2) and MMP-7(24–36,49–55/M2) had almost the same affinities for CS/CL, it is likely that in the regions of MMP-7 and MMP-2, corresponding to the residues"
https://openalex.org/W2125216362,"In all organisms the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), binds to signal sequences of proteins destined for secretion or membrane insertion as they emerge from translating ribosomes. In Archaea and Eucarya, the conserved ribonucleoproteic core is composed of two proteins, the accessory protein SRP19, the essential GTPase SRP54, and an evolutionarily conserved and essential SRP RNA. Through the GTP-dependent interaction between the SRP and its cognate receptor SR, ribosomes harboring nascent polypeptidic chains destined for secretion are dynamically transferred to the protein translocation apparatus at the membrane. We present here high-resolution X-ray structures of SRP54 and SRP19, the two RNA binding components forming the core of the signal recognition particle from the hyper-thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu). The 2.5 A resolution structure of free Pfu-SRP54 is the first showing the complete domain organization of a GDP bound full-length SRP54 subunit. In its ras-like GTPase domain, GDP is found tightly associated with the protein. The flexible linker that separates the GTPase core from the hydrophobic signal sequence binding M domain, adopts a purely alpha-helical structure and acts as an articulated arm allowing the M domain to explore multiple regions as it scans for signal peptides as they emerge from the ribosomal tunnel. This linker is structurally coupled to the GTPase catalytic site and likely to propagate conformational changes occurring in the M domain through the SRP RNA upon signal sequence binding. Two different 1.8 A resolution crystal structures of free Pfu-SRP19 reveal a compact, rigid and well-folded protein even in absence of its obligate SRP RNA partner. Comparison with other SRP19*SRP RNA structures suggests the rearrangement of a disordered loop upon binding with the RNA through a reciprocal induced-fit mechanism and supports the idea that SRP19 acts as a molecular scaffold and a chaperone, assisting the SRP RNA in adopting the conformation required for its optimal interaction with the essential subunit SRP54, and proper assembly of a functional SRP."
https://openalex.org/W2106243198,"Proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that have been linked to an array of cellular processes, including inflammation, migration, and proliferation. Although signal transduction downstream of PARs has been actively investigated, little is known about the mechanisms that lead to changes in transcriptional programs. Here we show that the CUX1 homeodomain protein is a downstream effector of PAR2. Treatment of epithelial and fibroblastic cells with trypsin or the PAR2-activating peptide (PAR2-AP) caused a rapid increase in CUX1 DNA binding activity. The stimulation of CUX1 was specific to PAR2 because no effect was observed with thrombin or the PAR1-AP. Using a panel of recombinant CUX1 proteins, the regulation was found to involve the cut repeat 3 (CR3) and the cut homeodomain, two DNA binding domains that are present in all CUX1 isoforms. Expression analysis in cux1–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts led to the identification of three genes that are regulated downstream of both PAR2 and CUX1 as follows: interleukin-1α, matrix metalloproteinase-10, and cyclo-oxygenase-2. p110 CUX1 was able to activate each of these genes, both in reporter assays and following the infection of cells. Moreover, the treatment of Hs578T breast tumor cells with trypsin led to a rapid recruitment of p110 CUX1 to the promoter of these genes and to a concomitant increase in their mRNA steady-state levels. Altogether, these results suggest a model whereby activation of PAR2 triggers a signaling cascade that culminates with the stimulation of p110 CUX1 DNA binding and the transcriptional activation of target genes."
https://openalex.org/W1968494743,"The dopamine D2S receptor (short isoform) couples to inhibitory Gαi/o proteins to inhibit thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in GH4ZR7 rat pituitary cells, consistent with its actions to inhibit prolactin gene transcription and cell proliferation. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. To identify novel Gαi effectors, yeast two-hybrid screening of a GH4ZR7 cDNA library was done using constitutively active Gαi3-Q204L, and multiple clones of the RasGAP cDNA GAP1IP4BP/RASA3 were identified. In yeast mating assay, RASA3 preferentially interacted with activated forms of Gαi/o/z proteins, but not with Gαs. A direct interaction was indicated by in vitro pull-down assay, in which S-His-RASA3 preferentially bound guanosine 5‘-O-(γ-thio)triphosphate-activated Gαi3 and Gαi2 compared with guanosine 5‘-O-(β-thio)diphosphate-inactivated proteins. Similarly, in co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK-293 cells, FLAG-tagged RASA3 preferentially interacted with activated mutants of Gαi3 and Gαi2 compared with wild type proteins. In GH4ZR7 cells, co-immunoprecipitation studies of endogenous proteins demonstrated a Gαi3-RASA3 complex that was induced upon TRH/D2S receptor co-activation. To address RASA3 function in dopamine D2S receptor-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 activity, endogenous RASA3 protein expression was suppressed (70! knockdown) in GH4ZR7 cells stably transfected with full-length antisense cDNA of RASA3. The selected antisense clones had similar levels of dopamine D2S receptor binding and D2S-induced inhibition of cAMP formation compared with parental GH4ZR7 cells. In these clones, D2S-mediated inhibition of TRH-induced phospho-ERK1/2 was reversed by 70-80! compared with parental GH4ZR7 cells. Our results provide a novel mechanism for dopamine D2S-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 and indicate that RASA3 links Gαi proteins to inhibit Gq-induced Ras/ERK1/2 activation. The dopamine D2S receptor (short isoform) couples to inhibitory Gαi/o proteins to inhibit thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in GH4ZR7 rat pituitary cells, consistent with its actions to inhibit prolactin gene transcription and cell proliferation.

Five dopamine receptor genes are known, and the dopamine-D2 receptor is among the most studied because of its involvement in mental and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, addiction, and Parkinson disease. In addition, the dopamine-D2 receptor mediates inhibitory regulation of endocrine function, with a primary role in the pituitary to regulate prolactin synthesis, secretion, and lactotroph cell proliferation. For example, in homozygous mice deficient in the gene encoding the D2 receptor or lacking dopamine, pituitary adenoma and hyperprolactinemia occur with age (1Asa S.L. Kelly M.A. Grandy D.K. Low M.J.

Conversely, mice lacking the gene encoding the dopamine transporter show dopamine hypersecretion that leads to pituitary hypotrophy (5Bosse R. Fumagalli F. Jaber M. Giros B. Gainetdinov R.R.

The dopamine D2 receptor gene contains an alternately spliced exon encoding 29 amino acids in the putative third intracellular loop to generate short (D2S) and long (D2L) forms of the receptor (10Civelli O. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 281-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Dopamine D2S receptors have been shown to have anti-proliferative actions in pituitary lactotrophs, whereas the D2L receptor did not appear to be anti-proliferative (11Iaccarino C. Samad T.A.

However, the specific signaling mechanisms underlying dopamine D2S actions in pituitary cells remain to be fully elucidated. GH4ZR7 cells are GH4C1 lactotroph cells stably transfected with the dopamine D2S receptor cDNA. These cells provide a useful model to study the signaling of the dopamine-D2S receptor in pituitary cells that retain differentiated properties of lactotrophs. These include expression of receptors that stimulate (thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) 3The abbreviations used are:TRHthyrotropin-releasing hormonePRLprolactinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGAPGTPase activating proteinIP4inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphatePHpleckstrin homologyBTKBruton's kinasePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(γ-thio)triphosphateGDPβSguanosine 5′-O-(β-thio)-diphosphateMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidRIPAradioimmune precipitation assay receptors) or inhibit (somatostatin and muscarinic receptors) the synthesis and secretion of growth hormone and prolactin (PRL) (12Albert P.R.

In GH4ZR7 cells, dopamine inhibits cAMP formation, PRL synthesis and secretion, and cell proliferation. Previously, a novel D2S receptor-mediated inhibition of TRH-induced ERK1/2 activation was identified in these cells (13Banihashemi B. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Liu J.C. Baker R.E. Sun C. Sundmark V.C. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol.

Activation of ERK1/2 is implicated in TRH induced prolactin transcription (16Wang Y.H. Maurer R.A. Mol.

Using a rescue strategy employing transfection of pertussis toxin-resistant Gαi/o proteins, we previously found that Gαi3 is implicated in dopamine D2S receptor-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 activation by TRH in GH4ZR7 pituitary cells (13Banihashemi B. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, blockade of Gβγ signaling did not affect D2S-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 activation, indicating that Gαi3, but not Gβγ subunits, are required. We further found that the D2S receptor inhibited TRH-induced activation of MEK and c-Raf, suggesting that Gαi couples to inhibit this pathway upstream of c-Raf, possibly by inactivation of Ras. We hypothesized that a critical downstream effector may directly interact with Gαi3 to mediate dopamine D2S receptor inhibition of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling. To address this hypothesis we have used two-hybrid screening with a constitutively active mutant of Gαi3 as bait to probe a cDNA library from GH4 pituitary cells. In this screen we identified RASA3 as a novel Gαi-interacting protein and have validated the Gαi3-RASA3 interaction in pituitary cells. Importantly we also demonstrate the requirement of RASA3 for D2S receptor signaling to inhibit ERK1/2 activation, indicating that RASA3 links Gαi proteins to inhibition of the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway.

Bacterial Expression and Protein Purification—RASA3 was subcloned into pET30a(+) (Novagen) bacterial vector, which contains an S-tag and His-tag at the N terminus. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed by pET30a(+)-RASA3. Bacteria were grown in LB medium containing kanamycin at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm or 0.6. Then they were induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h in LB medium and finally centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) and protease inhibitor, and after sonication (6 × 10 s) and centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was added to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). After washing three times in wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), the protein was eluted using elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole) according to Qiagen protocol. Antibody Purification and Concentration—Steriflip-GP filters 0.22-μm and PROSEP-G medium plugs (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used to purify serum antibody against full-length RASA3. The antibody was prefiltered through Steriflip-GP filter device to remove any debris immediately before loading the sample. Next, antibody was added to PROSEP-G media plugs (immobilized recombinant protein G), washed with binding buffer (1.5 m glycine/NaOH, 3 m NaCl, pH 9.0), and then eluted from the resin by adding elution buffer (0.2 m glycine/HCl, pH 2.5) and brief centrifugation. The antibody was brought to neutral pH by using neutralization buffer (1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0). Finally, it was concentrated by an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library from GH4ZR7 poly(A+) RNA was constructed in yeast vector pGADT7 (Clontech), and over 80! of clones contained inserts with average sizes of 900-bp. The library was screened with constitutively active human Gαi3 Q204L from UMR cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO) as bait. The yeast cells were grown at 30 °C for 5-7 days. Transformants (106) were selected on SD- Leu- Trp- His- Ade- plates and screened by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Wisent, Canada) overlay assay. DNA from positive clones was extracted and sequenced. Yeast Mating/β-Galactosidase Assay—Gαi subunits and RASA3 constructs were subcloned in pAS2-1 and pACT2 vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Y187 and AH109 yeast strains were transformed with individual Gα subunits and full-length RASA3, and selected for positive transformants on SD-Trp- and SD-Leu- plates, respectively. The resultant colonies were mated and selected on SD-Leu- Trp- His- for 3-5 days at 30 °C. A quantitative β-galactosidase assay using 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate was performed. In Vitro Pull-down Assay and Western Blotting—Bacterially expressed S-His6-RASA3 (pET, Novagen) and GST-tagged Gαi3 or Gαi2 (pGEX; Amersham Biosciences) proteins were used as bait and prey, respectively. BL21 (DE3)-competent cells were transformed by either pET or pGEX vectors containing RASA3 or Gαi2/3, respectively. They were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h, harvested, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), sonicated (6 × 10 s) and finally centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Gαi2 and Gαi3 supernatants were incubated with 100 μm GTPγS or GDPβS (to activate or inactivate, respectively) and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min on shaker. The reactions were terminated by transferring the samples on ice. Meanwhile, the RASA3 supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) on shaker for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with washing buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. Then Gαi2 or Gαi3 supernatants were added and incubated with the resin on shaker for 1 h at 4 °C. The washing steps were repeated. The resin was incubated with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole) for 15 min on shaker at 4 °C and finally eluted. The proteins were resolved on an SDS-10! polyacrylamide gel that was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked at 22 °C for 1 h in 5! skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline buffer. The membrane was blotted with anti-S antigen (Novagen) or anti-GST (Upstate) antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and then horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody was added to detect anti-GST antibody. The membrane was incubated with chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Applied Science) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—The pcDNA3-FLAG-RASA3 construct was transiently co-transfected with wild type or constitutively active form of either Gαi3 or Gαi2 in pcDNA3 vector into HEK-293 cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were scraped in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1!(w/v) SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1! (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5! (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2PPi), left at 4 °C on shaker for 3 h, and lysed further by passing through 25-gauge needle. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with ∼40 μl of protein G-Sepharose, Fast Flow (Sigma) at 4 °C for an hour in a preclear phase. They were centrifuged again, and the supernatants were incubated with ∼40 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) on a shaker at 4 °C overnight. The gel was washed three times with RIPA lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS-loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min to elute the proteins. The eluted supernatants were resolved on an SDS-10! polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous RASA3 and Gαi3, GH4ZR7 cells were treated with apomorphine and/or TRH for 15 min. The cells were scraped in RIPA lysis buffer and lysed as mentioned above. After preclear phase, the supernatants were incubated with 4 μl of anti-Gαi3 antibody at 4 °C overnight. The next day, ∼40 μl of protein G-Sepharose, Fast Flow (Sigma) was added to each tube and incubated at 4 °C for an hour. Washing and elution were as described above. Stable Transfection—GH4ZR7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids for antisense RASA3 (5 μg) and pGK-puro (0.5 μg)/10-mm dish using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) (1.5×, w/v). The transfected cells were cultured in Ham's F-10 + 8! fetal bovine serum containing puromycin (20 μg/ml) for 3-4 weeks. Antibiotic-resistant clones were picked (34 clones) and tested for expression of the corresponding RASA3 protein by Western blot analysis. Ligand Binding—Dopamine-D2 receptor density was measured by specific binding of the antagonist [3H]spiperone. The cell membranes were prepared from 15-cm dishes by replacing the medium with hypotonic buffer (15 mmol/liter Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/liter EDTA). The cells were scraped from the plate and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in cold TME buffer (75 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter EDTA). The cells were lysed further by passing gently through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in TME. For binding assay, aliquots of 100 μg/tube membrane preparation were added to triplicate tubes containing 0.2 ml of TME + 0.1! ascorbic acid with 9000 cpm of [3H]spiperone ± 10-6 m apomorphine. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The samples were filtered through GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The filters were then combined with 3 ml of scintillation fluid (InterSciences Inc., Markham, ON), and radioactivity was detected using the Packard TRI-CARB 2100TR scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The receptor density was normalized to protein concentration determined by Bradford assay. Measurement of Phospho-ERK1/2 in GH4ZR7 Cells—Equal numbers of cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were plated in six-well plates. At 80! confluence, the cells were placed in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium (1 h, 37 °C). The cells were treated with the indicated drugs at 37 °C, and after the indicated time the plates were transferred on ice and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing equal volumes of 2.5× SDS loading and RIPA buffers, stored on ice, sonicated for 6 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (30 μl) was heated (100 °C, 5 min) and rapidly cooled on ice. The samples were centrifuged 30 s and were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation was detected using (1:1000) anti-phospho-p42/44 ERK1/2 (ERK1/2). The corresponding bands for ERK1 and ERK2 were digitally quantified using Adobe Photoshop. The results were normalized to the β-actin control. RASA3, a Novel Gαi-interacting Protein—To identify novel Gαi3 effectors involved in Gαi-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 activation in pituitary cells, we constructed an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library from GH4ZR7 pituitary cell poly(A+) RNA for yeast two-hybrid screening with constitutively active Gαi3 Q204L as bait. In two sets of screening we identified six of six positive/106 and four of four positive/106 clones that encoded 834-amino acid rat RASA3 cDNA (AB020479), also known as Ras p21 protein activator 3, GTPase-activating protein III (GAPIII), and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate-binding protein (GAP1(IP4BP); Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis revealed that this protein is highly conserved in human, rat, and mouse species (Fig. 1B). However, differences were observed between the verified sequence of our clones and the GenBank™ and Ensembl genome sequences for rat RASA3, which also differed between each other (supplemental Fig. S1). It is possible that these differences may represent polymorphisms because of rat strain differences. RASA3 is a member of the Ras GTPase-activating proteins (RasGAPs), which inactivate Ras or related small G proteins by enhancing their weak intrinsic GTPase activity. RASA3 is a member of GAP1 subfamily, which includes GAP1m, CAPRI (Ca2+-promoted Ras inactivator) and RASAL (Ras-GTPase-activating-like protein). RASA3 has a modular structure (Fig. 1C) with two C2 domains, a conserved 330-amino acid RasGAP domain, and pleckstrin homology (PH) and Bruton's kinase (BTK) domains (18Kupzig S. Bouyoucef D.

RASA3 is associated with the plasma membrane via PH domain-PIP2 interaction and activated by inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) binding to the BTK domain (21Cozier G.E. Lockyer P.J.

As a RasGAP protein, RASA3 could directly couple Gαi proteins to inhibition of Ras activation, and hence its role was examined. RASA3 Expression in GH4ZR7 cells—Because commercially available anti-peptide antibodies against RASA3 lacked the sensitivity or specificity to detect endogenous RASA3 (data not shown), a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against full-length recombinant rat RASA3, named D40. By Western blot analysis, the D40 antibody detected purified recombinant RASA3 (data not shown) and endogenous RASA3 (96 kDa) in GH4ZR7 cell extracts, whereas preimmune serum failed to detect RASA3, although some nonspecific products were present (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, in GH4ZR7 cells depleted of RASA3 using antisense construct (RASA3-AS30 clone, see below), a reduced level of RASA3 was detected by the purified D40 antibody, whereas in Balb-D2S fibroblast cells (BDYII) stably transfected with sense RASA3 (BDYII-21), the antibody detected an increase in RASA3 protein (Fig. 2B). These experiments validated the specificity of the D40 antibody for the detection of endogenous rat RASA3 in GH4ZR7 cells. Gαi/RASA3 Interactions—RASA3-Gαi interactions were quantified using the yeast mating/β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 3). Both wild type and constitutively active Gαi proteins (Gαi1, Gαi2,Gαi3,Gαo, and Gαz) interacted with RASA3. By contrast, Gαs and Gαcone failed to interact with RASA3 (i.e. no colonies were obtained), suggesting that RASA3 preferentially interacts with Gαi family proteins. The preferential interaction of RASA3 with activated Gαi family proteins suggests a role for RASA3 in Gαi signaling. To verify the RASA3-Gαi interaction, in vitro pull-down assays using bacterially expressed S-His6-RASA3 and GST-tagged Gαi2 or Gαi3 proteins were done. Ni-NTA-agarose bound to S-His6-RASA3 with no contaminating GST-tagged proteins. On the other hand, in the presence of S-His6-RASA3, both GDPβS-inactivated and GTPγS-activated Gαi3 and Gαi2 bound to RASA3 (Fig. 4), consistent with interactions observed in yeast mating assays. The interaction with RASA3 was stronger for activated than nonactivated G proteins. The RASA3-Gαi interaction was further tested by co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged RASA3 and wild type or constitutively active Gαi2 and Gαi3 proteins in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 5). Transfected FLAG-RASA3 was successfully immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel, with no FLAG-RASA3 detected in nontransfected cells. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-RASA3 co-immunoprecipitated both wild type or constitutively active forms of Gαi2 and Gαi3, with no Gαi protein present in immunoprecipitate from nontransfected cells. Interestingly, much more of the constitutively active forms of Gαi (Gαi2-QL and Gαi3-QL) were bound to RASA3, consistent with an increased association of active Gαi with RASA3. Because Gαi3 is implicated in D2S signaling to ERK1/2, the interaction between endogenous Gαi3 and RASA3 was assessed in GH4ZR7 cells. GH4ZR7 cells were untreated or treated with apomorphine (1 μm) to activate dopamine D2S receptor signaling, and cell lysates were prepared. The Gαi3 proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Gαi3 antibody, and endogenous proteins were detected using anti-Gαi3 and the D40 anti-RASA3 antibody (Fig. 6). When cell extracts were run on columns without anti-Gαi3 antibody, no Gαi3 or RASA3 was detected. By contrast when Gαi3 was immunoprecipitated, both endogenous Gαi3 and RASA3 were present in immunoprecipitates from untreated and treated GH4ZR7 cells. These results show that a weak interaction is present between Gαi3 and RASA3 in unstimulated, as well as D2S-stimulated cells. No detectable difference in RASA3-Gαi3 interaction upon D2S receptor stimulation raised the possibility of a synergistic effect of TRH and D2S pathways on RASA3-Gαi3 interaction. The cells were treated with TRH alone or TRH with apomorphine, and the co-immunoprecipitation was repeated as described above (Fig. 7). TRH with apomorphine induced a robust increase in RASA3-Gαi3 complex, whereas TRH alone, like apomorphine alone (Fig. 6), failed to increase the basal binding level (arrow). The slight shift in migration of RASA3 in the TRH/apomorphine-treated sample may reflect a post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation.FIGURE 7Preferential interaction between endogenous RASA3 and Gαi3 in GH4ZR7 cells in the presence of both TRH and apomorphine. For assay, the cells were starved with serum-free medium for 1 h and then incubated or not with apomorphine (1 μm) and/or TRH (1 μm) for 10 min followed by cell lysis. The cell lysate was incubated with anti-Gαi3 antibody and protein G-Sepharose, eluted, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The membranes were blotted with either D40 anti-RASA3 antibody (1/1000) or anti-Gαi3 antibody (1/1000). The arrow indicates immunoprecipitated RASA3.

Using a combination of receptor mutagenesis, peptide mapping, and N-terminal sequencing, we identified His117 within the first transmembrane domain (TM1) of CRFR1 as the cross-linking site for Bpa17 of 125I-[Tyr0, Gln1, Bpa17]SVG. These data indicate that, within the SVG-CRFR1 complex, residue 17 of the ligand lies withina9Å distance from residue 117 of the TM1 of CRFR1.

The cells were then rinsed (three times) with binding buffer and lysed with 1 n NaOH (0.25 ml × 3). The cell lysates were collected, and the radioactivity was counted in an automated γ-counter (Micromedic Systems, Horsham, PA). Photo-cross-linking of 125I-YQB-SVG to CRFR1 and CRFR1 Mutants—Cells expressing wild type or mutant receptors were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to reach 90–95! confluency. The cells were then rinsed with PBS. 125I-YQB-SVG (1,000,000 cpm/well) was added for 2–4 h at room temperature. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and placed on an ice and exposed to UV light source (Blak Ray long-wave lamp, 366 nm, 7 milliwatts/cm2; UV Products, San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of ∼5 cm for 15 min while being covered with ice-cold PBS. The covering buffer was drained, and the cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed on a 5–20! SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and autoradiographed using x-ray films or phosphorimaging screen. cAMP Stimulation Assay—COS-7 cells were plated in 24-well plates and were allowed to reach 90–95! confluency. The cells were chilled on ice and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then challenged with YQLS at different concentrations in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthene, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 15 min. The media were then removed, and the cells were rapidly frozen on dry ice. Intracellular cAMP was extracted by thawing the cells in 1 ml of 50 mm HCl, and cAMP was then measured using a specific radioimmunoassay (34Abou-Samra A.B. Harwood J.P. Manganiello V.C. Catt K.J. Aguilera G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CNBr Peptide Cleavage—After autoradiography, the radioactive protein bands were cut, and the proteins were electro-eluted in 1× SDS running buffer (25 mm of Tris base, 192 mm of glycine, and 0.1! of SDS). The eluate was concentrated using a Centricon 30 unit (Millipore). CNBr (100 mm) was added to the sample and dissolved in 70! formic acid at room temperature for 24 h. CNBr and formic acid were removed by lyophilization (three times). The proteins were analyzed on a 5–20! gradient SDS gel or a Tricine/SDS-PAGE (12! acrylamide) and autoradiographed using x-ray films or a phosphorimaging screen as previously described (27Assil-Kishawi I. Abou-Samra A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32558-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the CNBr-cleaved 125I-YQB-SVG Cross-linked Receptor Fragments—To determine the cross-linking site, we developed a radiosequencing method using Edman degradation of the CNBr-cleaved 125I-labeled photo-cross-linked receptor fragments as described previously (35Tawfeek H.A. Qian F. Abou-Samra A.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To facilitate N-terminal sequencing of the CNBr-cleaved receptor fragments, we used a receptor mutant bearing Met substitution at position 114; this places the potential cross-linking sites, determined from receptor mutagenesis and peptide mapping, closer to the N terminus of the cleaved fragment. Because the sequencing cycles release N-terminal residues from both the receptor fragments and the ligand, we synthesized 125I-[Gln1, Bpa17, Tyr23]SVG (125I-QBY-SVG), in which the 125I-Tyr is C-terminal to Bpa17. The radioactivity of the 125I-QBY-SVG remains covalently attached to the cross-linked fragment during Edman degradation. The Met114 mutant was expressed in 70–90! confluent COS-7 cells in a 10-cm tissue culture dish and incubated with ∼2,000,000 cpm of the ligand; binding and photo-cross-linking was performed as above. As predicted, CNBr cleavage of the 125I-QBY-SVG cross-linked Met114 mutant resulted in a sharp labeled band of ∼16 kDa on the Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The 125I-labeled receptor fragment was identified by autoradiography of the wet gel for 1 h and was then cut from the gel. The 125I-labeled CNBr-cleaved peptide was eluted from the gel fragment (typically ∼10,000–20,000 cpm are recovered), desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 50 μl of double distilled H2O. The sample (equivalent to ∼10,000 cpm) was sequenced on a pulsed liquid-gas phase sequencer (model 477A; PE Applied Biosystems) in the peptide core facility of the Endocrine Unit (Ashok Khatri, Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital). In brief, the purified CNBr fragment was covalently coupled to an aryl-amine-derived polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was placed in the sequencer. After each sequencing cycle, the membrane was rinsed with methanol, followed by heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v), to ensure full recovery of the 125I-labeled residues from the membrane. At each cycle, the released radioactivity was collected and counted in an automated γ-counter (Micromedic Systems, Horsham, PA). Approximately 60! of total radioactivity submitted for sequencing was recovered during 10 sequencing cycles. Molecular Modeling—The structure of sauvagine was generated based on homology with the structures of urocortin-1 recently determined by NMR methods (36Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. Cantle J.P. Vale W.W. Rivier J.E. Riek R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 16102-16114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The C terminus of sauvagine was then superimposed onto the structure of the C terminus of astressin while bound to the N terminus of the CRFR2 (37Grace C.R. Perrin M.H. Gulyas J. Digruccio M.R. Cantle J.P. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4858-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The high sequence identify of both the ligands (astressin, sauvagine) and receptors (CRFR1 and CRFR2) generates favorable interacts as noted in the NMR analysis. The N terminus of sauvagine was modeled into the central portion of the TM-helical bundle of the receptor, with the far N terminus interacting with the third extracellular loop, based on multiple contact points generated by photoaffinity cross-linking for similar receptor systems including those for parathyroid hormone (PTH) (25Gensure R.C.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1872-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and secretin (39Dong M. Lam P.C. Pinon D.I. Sexton P.M. Abagyan R. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We first examined ligand binding properties and cAMP stimulation potency of [Tyr0, Gln1, Bpa17]SVG (YQB-SVG) in LLCPK1 cells stably expressing CRFR1 (∼200,000 receptor copies/cell). The apparent Kd for YQB-SVG binding to LLCPK1 cell membranes stably expressing CRFR1 was 8 ± 2 nm, whereas that for the parent peptide, YQL-SVG, was 3 ± 1 nm (Fig. 1A). YQB-SVG and YQL-SVG increased cAMP accumulation with a similar EC50 of 3 nm to a similar maximum level (Fig. 1A). We then examined the cross-linking specificity of 125I-YQB-SVG to cell membranes prepared from LLCPK1 cells stably expressing CRFR1 (Fig. 1B). The cross-linked receptor has an apparent molecular mass above the highest standard used in this gel (Fig. 1B); this was previously characterized to be ∼80 kDa (27Assil-Kishawi I. Abou-Samra A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32558-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of the membranes with 100 nm of unlabeled YQL-SVG completely inhibited the binding 125I-YQB-SVG and the intensity of the cross-linked band (Fig. 1B). To identify the site of molecular cross-linking between the ligand and the receptor, we introduced Met substitution at different locations on the backbone of c-myc-tagged mCRFR1 and used CNBr cleavage to characterize the cross-linked receptor fragment. The hydrophobic residues were systematically replaced at desired locations with Met. Each receptor mutant was expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed for expression level, apparent ligand binding Kd, and stimulation of cAMP accumulation; only functional receptor mutants were used for mapping of the cross-linking site (Table 1). The different receptor mutants, which were functional in binding and signaling assays, were then photo-cross-linked to 125I-YQB-SVG; the receptor-ligand complexes were cleaved by CNBr, and the receptor fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.TABLE 1Expression, ligand binding and cAMP stimulation in the wild type and Met mutants of mCRFR1 expressed in COS-7 cells The cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid construct encoding the wild type or the Met-substituted mCRFR1 mutants using the DEAE-dextran transfection method. Three days after transfection, cell surface expression of the receptor mutants was assessed using the specific monoclonal antibody directed against the c-myc epitope in the extracellular domain of the backbone of CRFR1 followed by 125I-labeled second antibody. The ligand binding properties, apparent Kd, and number of binding sites were derived from Scatchard analysis on radio-receptor assays performed on cell membranes prepared from COS-7 cells expressing the different receptor mutants using 125I-YQL-SVG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stimulation of cAMP accumulation by YQL-SVG was performed in 24-well plates incubated with increasing concentrations of agonists (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nm) in serum-free culture medium containing 0.1! bovine serum albumin and 2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthene at 37 °C for 20 min; intracellular cAMP was extracted with 0.5 m HCl and assayed for cAMP with a specific radioimmunoassay. All of the assays were performed in triplicate, and the means are shown in the table. Expression data were normalized to their respective values in the wild type receptor. Apparent binding Kd and ligand concentrations that caused half-maximal cAMP stimulation (EC50) are reported in nm. Maximal cAMP stimulation was normalized to the maximal stimulation caused by 1 μm forskolin (Fsk) on mock transfected cells. The data are means of triplicates.CRFR1 constructExpressionKdEC50cAMP! of wild typenmnm! of FskWild type100.33.41.5112.0Met42/50165.31.14.0119.1Met95126.81.51.3125.4Met114100.81.014.0136.3Met11587.51.04.065.7Met117115.84.46.8135.5Met119142.52.51.5147.3Met120101.85.72.399.1Met123108.01.32.068.2Met125173.21.10.286.3Met42/114147.91.94.0141.7Met114/117127.77.51.174.1Met114/120116.29.32.093.8Met116/117114.47.21.0125.8 Open table in a new tab The 125I-YQB-SVG-cross-linked CNBr-cleaved CRFR1 fragment migrates as a broad band on Tricine SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of >60 Kd (Fig. 2B, lane 5); this band corresponds to a glycosylated receptor fragment extending from residue 24 of the mature CRFR1 protein (40Hofmann B.A. Sydow S.

The predicted MM of this fragment is ∼70 kDa (Table 2), which is equal to the MM of its backbone peptide (∼20 kDa), the MM of the cross-linked ligand (4.7 kDa), and the MM of five polysaccharide chains attached at Asn38, Asn45, Asn78, Asn90, and Asn98 (Fig. 2A); each contributes to the apparent MM by ∼10 kDa (17Assil I.Q. Abou-Samra A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E1015-E1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of Met residues at positions 42/50 or 95 produced smaller CNBr-cleaved labeled fragments with apparent MM of ∼48 and ∼28 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). CNBr cleavage of 125I-YQB-SVG-cross-linked M42/M50 receptor mutant is predicted to generate an 125I-YQB-SVG-cross-linked fragment with an apparent MM of 18 kDa plus the MM of three polysaccharide chains attached at Asn78, Asn90, and Asn98 (Fig. 2A and Table 2) with a predicted MM of ∼48 kDa, which is similar to that seen in lane 2 of Fig. 2B. CNBr cleavage of 125I-YQB-SVG-cross-linked M95 mutant is predicted to have a backbone peptide with an apparent MM of 18 kDa and one polysaccharide chain at Asn90 (Fig. 2A and Table 2); this results in a cross-linked fragment of a predicted size of ∼28 kDa, as seen in lane 3 of Fig. 2B.TABLE 2Predicted molecular masses of the CNBr-cleaved pr"
https://openalex.org/W2134959429,"Previously, a candidate gene linkage approach on brother pairs affected with prostate cancer identified a locus of prostate cancer susceptibility at D3S1234 within the fragile histidine triad gene (FHIT), a tumor suppressor that induces apoptosis. Subsequent association tests on 16 SNPs spanning approximately 381 kb surrounding D3S1234 in Americans of European descent revealed significant evidence of association for a single SNP within intron 5 of FHIT. In the current study, re-sequencing and genotyping within a 28.5 kb region surrounding this SNP further delineated the association with prostate cancer risk to a 15 kb region. Multiple SNPs in sequences under evolutionary constraint within intron 5 of FHIT defined several related haplotypes with an increased risk of prostate cancer in European-Americans. Strong associations were detected for a risk haplotype defined by SNPs 138543, 142413, and 152494 in all cases (Pearson's chi(2) = 12.34, df 1, P = 0.00045) and for the homozygous risk haplotype defined by SNPs 144716, 142413, and 148444 in cases that shared 2 alleles identical by descent with their affected brothers (Pearson's chi(2) = 11.50, df 1, P = 0.00070). In addition to highly conserved sequences encompassing SNPs 148444 and 152413, population studies revealed strong signatures of natural selection for a 1 kb window covering the SNP 144716 in two human populations, the European American (pi = 0.0072, Tajima's D = 3.31, 14 SNPs) and the Japanese (pi = 0.0049, Fay & Wu's H = 8.05, 14 SNPs), as well as in chimpanzees (Fay & Wu's H = 8.62, 12 SNPs). These results strongly support the involvement of the FHIT intronic region in an increased risk of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2059328142,"Background Previous work by our group has shown that the scaling of reach trajectories to target size is independent of obligatory awareness of that target property and that “action without awareness” can persist for up to 2000 ms of visual delay. In the present investigation we sought to determine if the ability to scale reaching trajectories to target size following a delay is related to the pre-computing of movement parameters during initial stimulus presentation or the maintenance of a sensory (i.e., visual) representation for on-demand response parameterization. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants completed immediate or delayed (i.e., 2000 ms) perceptual reports and reaching responses to different sized targets under non-masked and masked target conditions. For the reaching task, the limb associated with a trial (i.e., left or right) was not specified until the time of response cuing: a manipulation that prevented participants from pre-computing the effector-related parameters of their response. In terms of the immediate and delayed perceptual tasks, target size was accurately reported during non-masked trials; however, for masked trials only a chance level of accuracy was observed. For the immediate and delayed reaching tasks, movement time as well as other temporal kinematic measures (e.g., times to peak acceleration, velocity and deceleration) increased in relation to decreasing target size across non-masked and masked trials. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that speed-accuracy relations were observed regardless of whether participants were aware (i.e., non-masked trials) or unaware (i.e., masked trials) of target size. Moreover, the equivalent scaling of immediate and delayed reaches during masked trials indicates that a persistent sensory-based representation supports the unconscious and metrical scaling of memory-guided reaching."
