https://openalex.org/W2042725731,"IN 1965, Jacobs et al. published their preliminary findings of a chromosome survey conducted at a maximum security hospital, The State Hospital, Lanarkshire, Scotland1. The most remarkable finding in the completed survey was the discovery among 315 men of nine patients with an XYY sex chromosome constitution. Their behaviour, together with their pattern of crime, has now been closely studied. The full clinical details of this investigation will be published elsewhere by us, and this communication directs attention to the ways in which the XYY males differ from males with an XY sex chromosome complement at the same hospital."

When, however, the same habit is almost forgotten its memory is enhanced by treatment with the same drug2. Here we show that when a habit is only partially learned its recall is enhanced by injection of the anticholinesterase DFP, and further that the better the original learning of the habit the worse the recall of the habit after treatment with the drug."

https://openalex.org/W2061709724,"EXISTING immuno- and bio-assays are incapable of readily distinguishing human luteinizing hormone (LH) from human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). A procedure capable of making this distinction should make it possible to solve a variety of problems, including whether the high levels of luteinizing activity associated with seminoma are due to HCG or LH, whether the blood of newborn infants contains HCG or LH, and whether or not moderately high levels of “LH” found by radioimmunoassay in patients thought to be cured of choriocarcinoma represent a recurrence of the neoplasm. The present communication describes a means for making this distinction. Advantage was taken of the different gel filtration properties of these two hormones to effect their separation, and the resulting elution peaks were then located by radioimmunoassay."

https://openalex.org/W2005298169,"PLASTIC material inserted under the skin of mice and certain other laboratory animals frequently leads to the formation of sarcomatous transplantable tumours1,2. This finding deserves consideration in view of the use of plastics in human surgery. It also attracts theoretical interest as an example of “physical” carcinogenesis. (The role of chemical cofactors is still under dispute although evidence is mounting against it3.)"

https://openalex.org/W1992044109,"Singh and Koppelman have subjected to mathematical analysis1,2 some of the experiments carried out by my colleagues and myself on the relationship between nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA3,4. I have already demonstrated the inadequacy of the model presented by Singh and Koppelman in their first communication1 by showing that a relationship defined by them as a constant (λ in my report) was in fact not a constant5. In their second communication2, Singh and Koppelman accept this point and present a modified version of the same exercise. As before, they seek to give the impression that they have taken the results of some of our experiments and shown that these results fit the particular mathematical model which they propose. Once again this is not so. In neither of the graphs produced by Singh and Koppelman have our results been accurately transcribed. In both instances, several points given in our original curves have been omitted from the graphs, and the curves have been truncated by deletion of early and late experimental points. This is well illustrated in the data for cytoplasmic RNA adenine shown in Fig. 1 of their communication. In our original report this curve is unequivocally sigmoid, but it appears in their communication as a straight line, an approximation which involves the omission of several of our experimental points, the insertion of points which do not correspond to our experimental points and the deletion of the end of the curve. In order that readers may assess the extent of the transformation, I have reproduced in Fig. 1 the original experimental curve and in Fig. 2 the same curve as re-plotted by Singh and Koppelman."

https://openalex.org/W1974149643,"PERMIT me to bring to the notice of Professor Britton Chance and Leena Mela an obvious omission from the references to their paper1 on proton movement in mitochondrial membranes. Is it possible that they can discuss the release of hydrogen ions at interfaces, associated with redox processes, without mentioning Conway's redox pump theory2 for the active secretion of hydrogen ions by the cells of the gastric mucosa? Conway's theory, which predates other redox theories mentioned, specifically suggests electron transfer from flavoproteins to cytochromes as being particularly favourable for the active release of hydrogen ions from the cells of the gastric mucosa. He has also presented evidence3 for a similar mechanism in fermenting yeast."
