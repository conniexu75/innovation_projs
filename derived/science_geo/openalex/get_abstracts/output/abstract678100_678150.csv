https://openalex.org/W3183161080,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccines 1–3 mediate protection from severe disease as early as ten days after prime vaccination 3 , when neutralizing antibodies are hardly detectable 4–6 . Vaccine-induced CD8 + T cells may therefore be the main mediators of protection at this early stage 7,8 . The details of their induction, comparison to natural infection, and association with other arms of vaccine-induced immunity remain, however, incompletely understood. Here we show on a single-epitope level that a stable and fully functional CD8 + T cell response is vigorously mobilized one week after prime vaccination with bnt162b2, when circulating CD4 + T cells and neutralizing antibodies are still weakly detectable. Boost vaccination induced a robust expansion that generated highly differentiated effector CD8 + T cells; however, neither the functional capacity nor the memory precursor T cell pool was affected. Compared with natural infection, vaccine-induced early memory T cells exhibited similar functional capacities but a different subset distribution. Our results indicate that CD8 + T cells are important effector cells, are expanded in the early protection window after prime vaccination, precede maturation of other effector arms of vaccine-induced immunity and are stably maintained after boost vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3184208286,"The mammalian brain develops through a complex interplay of spatial cues generated by diffusible morphogens, cell–cell interactions and intrinsic genetic programs that result in probably more than a thousand distinct cell types. A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1–8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system. A comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the mouse brain between gastrulation and birth identifies hundreds of cellular states and reveals the spatiotemporal organization of brain development."

https://openalex.org/W3184657756,"Protein ubiquitination at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by RNF168 recruits BRCA1 and 53BP11,2, which are mediators of the homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining DSB repair pathways, respectively3. Non-homologous end joining relies on 53BP1 binding directly to ubiquitinated lysine 15 on H2A-type histones (H2AK15ub)4,5 (which is an RNF168-dependent modification6), but how RNF168 promotes BRCA1 recruitment and function remains unclear. Here we identify a tandem BRCT-domain-associated ubiquitin-dependent recruitment motif (BUDR) in BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1) (the obligate partner protein of BRCA1) that, by engaging H2AK15ub, recruits BRCA1 to DSBs. Disruption of the BUDR of BARD1 compromises homologous recombination and renders cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibition and cisplatin. We further show that BARD1 binds nucleosomes through multivalent interactions: coordinated binding of H2AK15ub and unmethylated H4 lysine 20 by its adjacent BUDR and ankyrin repeat domains, respectively, provides high-affinity recognition of DNA lesions in replicated chromatin and promotes the homologous recombination activities of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex. Finally, our genetic epistasis experiments confirm that the need for BARD1 chromatin-binding activities can be entirely relieved upon deletion of RNF168 or 53BP1. Thus, our results demonstrate that by sensing DNA-damage-dependent and post-replication histone post-translation modification states, BRCA1-BARD1 complexes coordinate the antagonization of the 53BP1 pathway with promotion of homologous recombination, establishing a simple paradigm for the governance of the choice of DSB repair pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3184907113,"Known for nearly a century but through mechanisms that remain elusive, cells retain a memory of inflammation that equips them to react quickly and broadly to diverse secondary stimuli. Using murine epidermal stem cells as a model, we elucidate how cells establish, maintain, and recall inflammatory memory. Specifically, we landscape and functionally interrogate temporal, dynamic changes to chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding that occur during inflammation, post-resolution, and in memory recall following injury. We unearth an essential, unifying role for the general stress-responsive transcription factor FOS, which partners with JUN and cooperates with stimulus-specific STAT3 to establish memory; JUN then remains with other homeostatic factors on memory domains, facilitating rapid FOS re-recruitment and gene re-activation upon diverse secondary challenges. Extending our findings, we offer a comprehensive, potentially universal mechanism behind inflammatory memory and less discriminate recall phenomena with profound implications for tissue fitness in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W3186939347,"The BRCA1–BARD1 tumour suppressor is an E3 ubiquitin ligase necessary for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination1–10. The BRCA1–BARD1 complex localizes to damaged chromatin after DNA replication and catalyses the ubiquitylation of histone H2A and other cellular targets11–14. The molecular bases for the recruitment to double-strand breaks and target recognition of BRCA1–BARD1 remain unknown. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to show that the ankyrin repeat and tandem BRCT domains in BARD1 adopt a compact fold and bind to nucleosomal histones, DNA and monoubiquitin attached to H2A amino-terminal K13 or K15, two signals known to be specific for double-strand breaks15,16. We further show that RING domains17 in BRCA1–BARD1 orient an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme atop the nucleosome in a dynamic conformation, primed for ubiquitin transfer to the flexible carboxy-terminal tails of H2A and variant H2AX. Our work reveals a regulatory crosstalk in which recognition of monoubiquitin by BRCA1–BARD1 at the N terminus of H2A blocks the formation of polyubiquitin chains and cooperatively promotes ubiquitylation at the C terminus of H2A. These findings elucidate the mechanisms of BRCA1–BARD1 chromatin recruitment and ubiquitylation specificity, highlight key functions of BARD1 in both processes and explain how BRCA1–BARD1 promotes homologous recombination by opposing the DNA repair protein 53BP1 in post-replicative chromatin18–22. These data provide a structural framework to evaluate BARD1 variants and help to identify mutations that drive the development of cancer. The authors elucidate the mechanisms for the ubiquitylation specificity and recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase complex BRCA1–BARD1 to damaged DNA within chromatin to facilitate homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W3183534816,"A variety of 'strange metals' exhibit resistivity that decreases linearly with temperature as the temperature decreases to zero1-3, in contrast to conventional metals where resistivity decreases quadratically with temperature. This linear-in-temperature resistivity has been attributed to charge carriers scattering at a rate given by ħ/τ = αkBT, where α is a constant of order unity, ħ is the Planck constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant. This simple relationship between the scattering rate and temperature is observed across a wide variety of materials, suggesting a fundamental upper limit on scattering-the 'Planckian limit'4,5-but little is known about the underlying origins of this limit. Here we report a measurement of the angle-dependent magnetoresistance of La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4-a hole-doped cuprate that shows linear-in-temperature resistivity down to the lowest measured temperatures6. The angle-dependent magnetoresistance shows a well defined Fermi surface that agrees quantitatively with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements7 and reveals a linear-in-temperature scattering rate that saturates at the Planckian limit, namely α = 1.2 ± 0.4. Remarkably, we find that this Planckian scattering rate is isotropic, that is, it is independent of direction, in contrast to expectations from 'hotspot' models8,9. Our findings suggest that linear-in-temperature resistivity in strange metals emerges from a momentum-independent inelastic scattering rate that reaches the Planckian limit."
https://openalex.org/W3186338187,"So far, gene therapies have relied on complex constructs that cannot be finely controlled1,2. Here we report a universal switch element that enables precise control of gene replacement or gene editing after exposure to a small molecule. The small-molecule inducers are currently in human use, are orally bioavailable when given to animals or humans and can reach both peripheral tissues and the brain. Moreover, the switch system, which we denote Xon, does not require the co-expression of any regulatory proteins. Using Xon, the translation of the desired elements for controlled gene replacement or gene editing machinery occurs after a single oral dose of the inducer, and the robustness of expression can be controlled by the drug dose, protein stability and redosing. The ability of Xon to provide temporal control of protein expression can be adapted for cell-biology applications and animal studies. Additionally, owing to the oral bioavailability and safety of the drugs used, the Xon switch system provides an unprecedented opportunity to refine and tailor the application of gene therapies in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3177433194,"Strange metals possess highly unconventional transport characteristics, such as a linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity, an inverse Hall angle that varies as $T^2$ and a linear-in-field ($H$) magnetoresistance. Identifying the origin of these collective anomalies has proved profoundly challenging, even in materials such as the hole-doped cuprates that possess a simple band structure. The prevailing dogma is that strange metallicity in the cuprates is tied to a quantum critical point at a doping $p*$ inside the superconducting dome. Here, we study the high-field in-plane magnetoresistance of two superconducting cuprate families at doping levels beyond $p*$. At all dopings, the magnetoresistance exhibits quadrature scaling and becomes linear at high $H/T$ ratios. Moreover, its magnitude is found to be much larger than predicted by conventional theory and insensitive to both impurity scattering and magnetic field orientation. These observations, coupled with analysis of the zero-field and Hall resistivities, suggest that despite having a single band, the cuprate strange metal phase hosts two charge sectors, one containing coherent quasiparticles, the other scale-invariant `Planckian' dissipators."
https://openalex.org/W3186503871,"Ageing is driven by a loss of cellular integrity1. Given the major role of ubiquitin modifications in cell function2, here we assess the link between ubiquitination and ageing by quantifying whole-proteome ubiquitin signatures in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find a remodelling of the ubiquitinated proteome during ageing, which is ameliorated by longevity paradigms such as dietary restriction and reduced insulin signalling. Notably, ageing causes a global loss of ubiquitination that is triggered by increased deubiquitinase activity. Because ubiquitination can tag proteins for recognition by the proteasome3, a fundamental question is whether deficits in targeted degradation influence longevity. By integrating data from worms with a defective proteasome, we identify proteasomal targets that accumulate with age owing to decreased ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Lowering the levels of age-dysregulated proteasome targets prolongs longevity, whereas preventing their degradation shortens lifespan. Among the proteasomal targets, we find the IFB-2 intermediate filament4 and the EPS-8 modulator of RAC signalling5. While increased levels of IFB-2 promote the loss of intestinal integrity and bacterial colonization, upregulation of EPS-8 hyperactivates RAC in muscle and neurons, and leads to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and protein kinase JNK. In summary, age-related changes in targeted degradation of structural and regulatory proteins across tissues determine longevity."
https://openalex.org/W3184087999,"Despite the existence of good catalogues of cancer genes1,2, identifying the specific mutations of those genes that drive tumorigenesis across tumour types is still a largely unsolved problem. As a result, most mutations identified in cancer genes across tumours are of unknown significance to tumorigenesis3. We propose that the mutations observed in thousands of tumours—natural experiments testing their oncogenic potential replicated across individuals and tissues—can be exploited to solve this problem. From these mutations, features that describe the mechanism of tumorigenesis of each cancer gene and tissue may be computed and used to build machine learning models that encapsulate these mechanisms. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this solution by building and validating 185 gene–tissue-specific machine learning models that outperform experimental saturation mutagenesis in the identification of driver and passenger mutations. The models and their assessment of each mutation are designed to be interpretable, thus avoiding a black-box prediction device. Using these models, we outline the blueprints of potential driver mutations in cancer genes, and demonstrate the role of mutation probability in shaping the landscape of observed driver mutations. These blueprints will support the interpretation of newly sequenced tumours in patients and the study of the mechanisms of tumorigenesis of cancer genes across tissues. A new computational approach to in silico mutagenesis screening allow comprehensive mapping of cancer driver mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3186137292,"In neutrophils, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generated via the pentose phosphate pathway fuels NADPH oxidase NOX2 to produce reactive oxygen species for killing invading pathogens. However, excessive NOX2 activity can exacerbate inflammation, as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we use two unbiased chemical proteomic strategies to show that small-molecule LDC7559, or a more potent designed analog NA-11, inhibits the NOX2-dependent oxidative burst in neutrophils by activating the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 liver type (PFKL) and dampening flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. Accordingly, neutrophils treated with NA-11 had reduced NOX2-dependent outputs, including neutrophil cell death (NETosis) and tissue damage. A high-resolution structure of PFKL confirmed binding of NA-11 to the AMP/ADP allosteric activation site and explained why NA-11 failed to agonize phosphofructokinase-1 platelet type (PFKP) or muscle type (PFKM). Thus, NA-11 represents a tool for selective activation of PFKL, the main phosphofructokinase-1 isoform expressed in immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W3170698767,"MeCP2 binds hydroxymethylated CA repeats Despites of decades of research on the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2, its function remains unclear. Ibrahim et al. show that MeCP2 is a hydroxymethylated cytosine-adenosine (CA) repeat-binding protein that modulates chromatin architecture at a distance from the transcription start site (see the Perspective by Zhou and Zoghbi). MeCP2 accumulates and spreads around modified CA repeats and competes for nucleosome occupancy. Loss of MeCP2 results in a widespread increase in nucleosome density inside lamina-associated domains and transcriptional dysregulation of genes enriched in CA repeats. These results shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism of Rett syndrome, a severe disease associated with mutations in MeCP2.

https://openalex.org/W3183301735,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to exert important roles in tumors, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). PVT1 is an important oncogenic lncRNA which has critical effects on onset and development of various cancers, however, the underlying mechanism of PVT1 functioning in ccRCC remains largely unknown. VHL deficiency-induced HIF2α accumulation is one of the major factors for ccRCC. Here, we identified the potential molecular mechanism of PVT1 in promoting ccRCC development by stabilizing HIF2α. PVT1 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tissues and high PVT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of ccRCC patients. Both gain-of-function and loss-of function experiments revealed that PVT1 enhanced ccRCC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PVT1 interacted with HIF2α protein and enhanced its stability by protecting it from ubiquitination-dependent degradation, thereby exerting its biological significance. Meanwhile, HIF2α bound to the enhancer of PVT1 to transactivate its expression. Furthermore, HIF2α specific inhibitor could repress PVT1 expression and its oncogenic functions. Therefore, our study demonstrates that the PVT1/ HIF2α positive feedback loop involves in tumorigenesis and progression of ccRCC, which may be exploited for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3183875135,"Handling missing values is a crucial step in preprocessing data in Machine Learning. Most available algorithms for analyzing datasets in the feature selection process and classification or estimation process analyze complete datasets. Consequently, in many cases, the strategy for dealing with missing values is to use only instances with full data or to replace missing values with a mean, mode, median, or a constant value. Usually, discarding missing samples or replacing missing values by means of fundamental techniques causes bias in subsequent analyzes on datasets.Demonstrate the positive impact of multivariate imputation in the feature selection process on datasets with missing values.We compared the effects of the feature selection process using complete datasets, incomplete datasets with missingness rates between 5 and 50%, and imputed datasets by basic techniques and multivariate imputation. The feature selection algorithms used are well-known methods. The results showed that the datasets imputed by multivariate imputation obtained the best results in feature selection compared to datasets imputed by basic techniques or non-imputed incomplete datasets.Considering the results obtained in the evaluation, applying multivariate imputation by MICE reduces bias in the feature selection process."
https://openalex.org/W3186468128,"The innermost regions of accretion disks around black holes are strongly irradiated by X-rays that are emitted from a highly variable, compact corona, in the immediate vicinity of the black hole1–3. The X-rays that are seen reflected from the disk4, and the time delays, as variations in the X-ray emission echo or ‘reverberate’ off the disk5,6, provide a view of the environment just outside the event horizon. I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) is a nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy7,8. Previous studies of the reverberation of X-rays from its accretion disk revealed that the corona is composed of two components: an extended, slowly varying component extending over the surface of the inner accretion disk, and a collimated core, with luminosity fluctuations propagating upwards from its base, which dominates the more rapid variability9,10. Here we report observations of X-ray flares emitted from around the supermassive black hole in I Zw 1. X-ray reflection from the accretion disk is detected through a relativistically broadened iron K line and Compton hump in the X-ray emission spectrum. Analysis of the X-ray flares reveals short flashes of photons consistent with the re-emergence of emission from behind the black hole. The energy shifts of these photons identify their origins from different parts of the disk11,12. These are photons that reverberate off the far side of the disk, and are bent around the black hole and magnified by the strong gravitational field. Observing photons bent around the black hole confirms a key prediction of general relativity. One of the key predictions of general relativity, the bending of light around massive, compact objects, is observed for a supermassive black hole in the galaxy I Zwicky 1."

https://openalex.org/W3184719124,"The specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator maresin 1 (MaR1) is involved in the resolution phase of tissue inflammation. It was hypothesized that exogenous administration of MaR1 would attenuate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth in a cytokine-dependent manner via LGR6 receptor signaling and macrophage-dependent efferocytosis of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). AAAs were induced in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice and smooth muscle cell specific TGF-β2 receptor knockout (SMC-TGFβr2-/- ) mice using a topical elastase AAA model. MaR1 treatment significantly attenuated AAA growth as well as increased aortic SMC α-actin and TGF-β2 expressions in WT mice, but not SMC-TGFβr2-/- mice, compared to vehicle-treated mice. In vivo inhibition of LGR6 receptors obliterated MaR1-dependent protection in AAA formation and SMC α-actin expression. Furthermore, MaR1 upregulated macrophage-dependent efferocytosis of apoptotic SMCs in murine aortic tissue during AAA formation. In vitro studies demonstrate that MaR1-LGR6 interaction upregulates TGF-β2 expression and decreases MMP2 activity during crosstalk of macrophage-apoptotic SMCs. In summary, these results demonstrate that MaR1 activates LGR6 receptors to upregulate macrophage-dependent efferocytosis, increases TGF-β expression, preserves aortic wall remodeling and attenuate AAA formation. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of MaR1-LGR6-mediated mitigation of vascular remodeling through increased efferocytosis of apoptotic SMCs via TGF-β2 to attenuate AAA formation."
https://openalex.org/W3185482716,"In pancreatic cancer, autocrine insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and paracrine insulin stimulate both IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor (IR) to increase tumor growth and glycolysis. In pancreatic cancer patients, cancer-induced glycolysis increases hepatic gluconeogenesis, skeletal muscle proteolysis, and fat lipolysis and, thereby, causes cancer cachexia. As a protein coexisting with IGF1R and IR, caveolin-1 (cav-1) may be involved in pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia. We undertook the present study to test this hypothesis. Out of wild-type MiaPaCa2 and AsPC1 human pancreatic cancer cell lines, we created their stable sub-lines whose cav-1 expression was diminished with RNA interference or increased with transgene expression. When these cells were studied in vitro, we found that cav-1 regulated IGF1R/IR expression and activation and also regulated cellular glycolysis. We transplanted the different types of MiaPaCa2 cells in growing athymic mice for 8 weeks, using intact athymic mice as tumor-free controls. We found that cav-1 levels in tumor grafts were correlated with expression levels of the enzymes that regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis, skeletal muscle proteolysis, and fat lipolysis in the respective tissues. When the tumors had original or increased cav-1, their carriers’ body weight gain was less than the tumor-free reference. When cav-1 was diminished in tumors, the tumor carriers’ body weight gain was not changed significantly, compared to the tumor-free reference. In conclusion, cav-1 in pancreatic cancer cells stimulated IGF1R/IR and glycolysis in the cancer cells and triggered cachectic states in the tumor carrier."
https://openalex.org/W3186752126,"Insulating materials can in principle be made metallic by applying pressure. In the case of pure water, this is estimated1 to require a pressure of 48 megabar, which is beyond current experimental capabilities and may only exist in the interior of large planets or stars2–4. Indeed, recent estimates and experiments indicate that water at pressures accessible in the laboratory will at best be superionic with high protonic conductivity5, but not metallic with conductive electrons1. Here we show that a metallic water solution can be prepared by massive doping with electrons upon reacting water with alkali metals. Although analogous metallic solutions of liquid ammonia with high concentrations of solvated electrons have long been known and characterized6–9, the explosive interaction between alkali metals and water10,11 has so far only permitted the preparation of aqueous solutions with low, submetallic electron concentrations12–14. We found that the explosive behaviour of the water–alkali metal reaction can be suppressed by adsorbing water vapour at a low pressure of about 10−4 millibar onto liquid sodium–potassium alloy drops ejected into a vacuum chamber. This set-up leads to the formation of a transient gold-coloured layer of a metallic water solution covering the metal alloy drops. The metallic character of this layer, doped with around 5 × 1021 electrons per cubic centimetre, is confirmed using optical reflection and synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Spectroscopic measurements confirm that when water is adsorbed on drops of an alkali alloy at low pressure a gold-coloured metallic layer forms as electrons rapidly move from the drop into the water."
https://openalex.org/W3184688772,"Chemical neurotransmission typically occurs through synapses. Previous ultrastructural examinations of monoamine neuron axon terminals often failed to identify a pre- and postsynaptic coupling, leading to the concept of “volume” transmission. Whether this results from intrinsic properties of these neurons remains undefined. We find that dopaminergic neurons in vitro establish a distinctive axonal arbor compared to glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons in both size and propensity of terminals to avoid direct contact with target neurons. While most dopaminergic varicosities are active and contain exocytosis proteins like synaptotagmin 1, only ~20% of these are synaptic. The active zone protein bassoon was found to be enriched in dopaminergic terminals that are in proximity to a target cell. Finally, we found that the proteins neurexin-1αSS4− and neuroligin-1A+B play a critical role in the formation of synapses by dopamine (DA) neurons. Our findings suggest that DA neurons are endowed with a distinctive developmental connectivity program."

Emotions relate closely to students' well-being, learning quality, productivity, and interaction. Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has been widely recognized to be effective in enhancing learning experiences and increasing student motivation. The field of emotions in DGBL has become an active research field with accumulated literature available, which calls for a comprehensive understanding of the up-to-date literature concerning emotions in virtual DGBL among students at all educational levels. Based on 393 research articles collected from the Web of Science, this study, for the first time, explores the current advances and topics in this field. Specifically, thematic evolution analysis is conducted to explore the evolution of topics that are categorized into four different groups (i.e., games, emotions, applications, and analytical technologies) in the corpus. Social network analysis explores the co-occurrences between topics to identify their relationships. Interesting results are obtained. For example, with the integration of diverse applications (e.g., mobiles) and analytical technologies (e.g., learning analytics and affective computing), increasing types of affective states, socio-emotional factors, and digital games are investigated. Additionally, implications for future research include 1) children's anxiety/attitude and engagement in collaborative gameplay, 2) individual personalities and characteristics for personalized support, 3) emotion dynamics, 4) multimodal data use, 5) game customization, 6) balance between learners' skill levels and game challenge as well as rewards and learning anxiety."

Here, we examined how gender is associated with the diversity, transmission, and structure of TEK. We tested whether women and men differ in terms of plant knowledge (species richness, α-diversity), knowledge heterogeneity (β-diversity), and in the structure of social-ecological networks they form. The study was carried out in a suburban community in the city of Ouro Preto, Southeastern, Brazil. Using the snow-ball technique, semi-structured interviews, guided tours, and participant observation, we gathered information from 33 women and 33 men in the community. We collected information about their culture, social-economic profiles, and plant knowledge from which we identified 291 plant species in 10 use categories. Overall, our results indicated that the cognition and sharing of ethnobotanical knowledge are structured by gender. Women rated better in their plant knowledge repertory (greater α-diversity), while plant knowledge among men was more heterogeneous (greater β-diversity), suggesting less information sharing among them. We observed that the network among women is more connected, exhibited greater information sharing, with a greater number of central individuals, who likely provide the cohesion and maintenance of TEK in the community. Our findings indicate how social-ecological networks can provide insights and information to unveil social patterns of knowledge transmission. Understanding how TEK is fostered and shared among community members will favor better planning of ethnobotanical studies, as well as inform decision-makers about strategies for the conservation of plant TEK."
https://openalex.org/W3184462297,"Protein secondary structure prediction (SSP) has a variety of applications; however, there has been relatively limited improvement in accuracy for years. With a vision of moving forward all related fields, we aimed to make a fundamental advance in SSP. There have been many admirable efforts made to improve the machine learning algorithm for SSP. This work thus took a step back by manipulating the input features. A secondary structure element-based position-specific scoring matrix (SSE-PSSM) is proposed, based on which a new set of machine learning features can be established. The feasibility of this new PSSM was evaluated by rigid independent tests with training and testing datasets sharing <25% sequence identities. In all experiments, the proposed PSSM outperformed the traditional amino acid PSSM. This new PSSM can be easily combined with the amino acid PSSM, and the improvement in accuracy was remarkable. Preliminary tests made by combining the SSE-PSSM and well-known SSP methods showed 2.0% and 5.2% average improvements in three- and eight-state SSP accuracies, respectively. If this PSSM can be integrated into state-of-the-art SSP methods, the overall accuracy of SSP may break the current restriction and eventually bring benefit to all research and applications where secondary structure prediction plays a vital role during development. To facilitate the application and integration of the SSE-PSSM with modern SSP methods, we have established a web server and standalone programs for generating SSE-PSSM available at http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/SSE-PSSM."
https://openalex.org/W3185167440,"Polycystin-1 (PC1) is a transmembrane protein found in different cell types, including cardiomyocytes. Alterations in PC1 expression have been linked to mitochondrial damage in renal tubule cells and in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. However, to date, the regulatory role of PC1 in cardiomyocyte mitochondria is not well understood. The analysis of mitochondrial morphology from cardiomyocytes of heterozygous PC1 mice (PDK1+/- ) using transmission electron microscopy showed that cardiomyocyte mitochondria were smaller with increased mitochondria density and circularity. These parameters were consistent with mitochondrial fission. We knocked-down PC1 in cultured rat cardiomyocytes and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes to evaluate mitochondrial function and morphology. The results showed that downregulation of PC1 expression results in reduced protein levels of sub-units of the OXPHOS complexes and less functional mitochondria (reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP production). This mitochondrial dysfunction activates the elimination of defective mitochondria by mitophagy, assessed by an increase of autophagosome adapter protein LC3B and the recruitment of the Parkin protein to the mitochondria. siRNA-mediated PC1 knockdown leads to a loss of the connectivity of the mitochondrial network and a greater number of mitochondria per cell, but of smaller sizes, which characterizes mitochondrial fission. PC1 silencing also deregulates the AKT-FoxO1 signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial morphology, and processes that are part of cell quality control, such as mitophagy. Together, these data provide new insights about the controls that PC1 exerts on mitochondrial morphology and function in cultured cardiomyocytes dependent on the AKT-FoxO1 signaling pathway."

They also display an increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity, accompanied by significant neurotransmission transcriptional networks changes. These results suggest that systemic depletion of histone macroH2A1.1 supports an epigenetic control necessary for hippocampal function and social behavior."

Surfactant replacement has greatly improved the short and long term prognosis of RDS but its administration criteria remain uncertain. Lung ultrasound has been recently shown as a non-invasive, repeatable, bedside tool to estimate parenchymal aeration using a semiquantitative score (LUS). The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the accuracy of LUS, assessed on the first day of life, to predict surfactant replacement. Methods will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and the protocol has been registered in PROSPERO database (registration number: CRD42021247888). Primary outcome: in a population of preterm infants, LUS will be compared in neonates who received surfactant replacement versus those who did not. Secondary outcome will be the accuracy of lung ultrasound score to predict the need for ≥ 2 doses of surfactant."
https://openalex.org/W3185688480,"We identified fermitin family member 2 (FERMT2, also known as kindlin-2) as a potential target in A375 cell line by siRNA library screening. Drugs that target mutant BRAF kinase lack durable efficacy in the treatment of melanoma because of acquired resistance, thus the identification of novel therapeutic targets is needed. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify kindlin-2 expression in melanoma samples. The interaction between kindlin-2 and Rac1 or p-Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6 (α-Pix) was investigated. Finally, the tumor suppressive role of kindlin-2 was validated in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of clinical samples and Oncomine data showed that higher levels of kindlin-2 predicted a more advanced T stage and M stage and facilitated metastasis and recurrence. Kindlin-2 knockdown significantly inhibited melanoma growth and migration, whereas kindlin-2 overexpression had the inverse effects. Further study showed that kindlin-2 could specifically bind to p-α-Pix(S13) and Rac1 to induce a switch from the inactive Rac1-GDP conformation to the active Rac1-GTP conformation and then stimulate the downstream MAPK pathway. Moreover, we revealed that a Rac1 inhibitor suppressed melanoma growth and metastasis and the combination of the Rac1 inhibitor and vemurafenib resulted in a better therapeutic outcome than monotherapy in melanoma with high kindlin-2 expression and BRAF mutation. Our results demonstrated that kindlin-2 promoted melanoma progression, which was attributed to specific binding to p-α-Pix(S13) and Rac1 to stimulate the downstream MAPK pathway. Thus, kindlin-2 could be a potential therapeutic target for treating melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3186306000,"Early rehabilitation, return to daily life activities and function are the ultimate goals of perioperative care. It is unclear which pain-related patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) mirror treatment effects or are related with early and late functional outcomes.We examined associations between two approaches of pain management (scheduled vs 'on demand') and PROMs on post-operative days one and five (POD1, 5) with function on POD5 and 3 months after surgery in patients undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) in a single centre. The scheduled pain management consisted of pain assessment and routine administration of non-opioid drugs, and a weak opioid based on severity of pain reported by patients. The 'on demand' group received non-opioids and/or a weak opioid only when asking 'on demand' for analgesics.On POD1, patients in the scheduled treatment group reported reduced severity of worst pain, less interference of pain with activities in-bed and sleep, and a higher proportion got out of bed. On POD5, these patients reported as well significantly less worst pain, spent significantly less time in severe pain, experienced less interference of pain with activities in bed, and felt less helpless. Furthermore, tests of function, extension and flexion ranges, Barthel index and 6 minutes walking test on POD5, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 3 months later were significantly better in the scheduled treatment group compared to the 'on demand' treatment group. Pain related PROMs assessed at POD1 and especially at POD5 are associated with better knee range of motion, better performance in activities of daily living, and faster gait speed, as well as less pain, better performance in activities of daily living, as well as higher knee-related quality of life 3 months postoperatively.Our study demonstrates that severe postoperative pain after TKA might have long lasting consequences, and even small improvements in treatment, although being far from optimal, are accompanied by improved outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3186472216,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus strains are well recognized as posing substantial problems in treating ocular infections. S. aureus has a vast array of virulence factors, including superantigens and enterotoxins. Their interactions and ability to signal antibiotics resistance have not been explored.To predict the relationship between superantigens and methicillin and multidrug resistance among S. aureus ocular isolates.We used a DNA microarray to characterize the enterotoxin and superantigen gene profiles of 98 S. aureus isolates collected from common ocular sources. The outcomes contained phenotypic and genotypic expressions of MRSA. We also included the MDR status as an outcome, categorized as resistance to three or more drugs, including oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. We identified gene profiles that predicted each outcome through a classification analysis utilizing Random Forest machine learning techniques.Our machine learning models predicted the outcomes accurately utilizing 67 enterotoxin and superantigen genes. Strong correlates predicting the genotypic expression of MRSA were enterotoxins A, D, J and R and superantigen-like proteins 1, 3, 7 and 10. Among these virulence factors, enterotoxin D and superantigen-like proteins 1, 5 and 10 were also significantly informative for predicting both MDR and MRSA in terms of phenotypic expression. Strong interactions were identified including enterotoxins A (entA) interacting with superantigen-like protein 1 (set6-var1_11), and enterotoxin D (entD) interacting with superantigen-like protein 5 (ssl05/set3_probe 1): MRSA and MDR S. aureus are associated with the presence of both entA and set6-var1_11, or both entD and ssl05/set3_probe 1, while the absence of these genes in pairs indicates non-multidrug-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus.MRSA and MDR S. aureus show a different spectrum of ocular pathology than their non-resistant counterparts. When assessing the role of enterotoxins in predicting antibiotics resistance, it is critical to consider both main effects and interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3183734731,"The entire world has suffered a lot since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2019, so simulation models of COVID-19 dynamics are urgently needed to understand and control the pandemic better. Meanwhile, emotional contagion, the spread of vigilance or panic, serves as a negative feedback to the epidemic, but few existing models take it into consideration. In this study, we proposed an innovative multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach to simulate disease transmission and emotional contagion together. In each layer, we used a hybrid simulation method combining agent-based modelling (ABM) with system dynamics modelling (SDM), keeping spatial heterogeneity while reducing computation costs. We designed a new emotion dynamics model IWAN (indifferent, worried, afraid and numb) to simulate emotional contagion inside a community during an epidemic. Our model was well fit to the data of China, the UK and the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there weren’t emotional contagion, our experiments showed that the confirmed cases would increase rapidly, for instance, the total confirmed cases during simulation in Guangzhou, China would grow from 334 to 2096, which increased by 528%. We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK. Due to the experiment results, the proposed multi-layer network model with hybrid simulation is valid and can be applied to the quantitative analysis of the epidemic trends and the suppression effect of emotional contagion in different countries. Our model can be modified for further research to study other social factors and intervention policies in the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W3183817872,"Water safety planning is an approach to ensure safe drinking-water access through comprehensive risk assessment and water supply management from catchment to consumer. However, its uptake remains low in rural areas. Participatory mapping, the process of map creation for resource management by local communities, has yet to be used for rural water safety planning. In this mixed methods study, to evaluate the validity of participatory mapping outputs for rural water safety planning and assess community understanding of water safety, 140 community members in Siaya County, Kenya, attended ten village-level participatory mapping sessions. They mapped drinking-water sources, ranked their safety and mapped potential contamination hazards. Findings were triangulated against a questionnaire survey of 234 households, conducted in parallel. In contrast to source type ranking for international monitoring, workshop participants ranked rainwater's safety above piped water and identified source types such as broken pipes not explicitly recorded in water source typologies often used for formal monitoring. Participatory mapping also highlighted the overlap between livestock grazing areas and household water sources. These findings were corroborated by the household survey and subsequent participatory meetings. However, comparison with household survey data suggested participatory mapping outputs omitted some water sources and landscape-scale contamination hazards, such as open defecation areas or flood-prone areas. In follow-up visits, participant groups ranked remediation of rainwater harvesting systems as the most acceptable intervention to address hazards. We conclude that participatory mapping can complement other established approaches to rural water safety planning by capturing informally managed source use and facilitating community engagement."

Pre- and post-pregnancy APFT results as well as demographic, pregnancy, and postpartum data were collected. Changes in APFT raw scores, body composition measures, and failure rates across the 6-week and 12-week convalescent cohorts were assessed. Multivariable regressions were utilized to associate risk factors with failure.Four hundred sixty women met inclusion criteria; N = 358 in the 6 week cohort and N = 102 in the 12 week cohort. Demographic variables were similar between the cohorts. APFT failure rates across pregnancy increased more than 3-fold in both groups, but no significant differences were found between groups in the decrement of performance or weight gain. With the combined cohort, multivariable regression analysis showed failure on the postpartum APFT to be independently associated with failure on the pre-pregnancy APFT (OR = 16.92, 95% CI 4.96-57.77), failure on pre-pregnancy BMI (OR = 8.44, 95% CI 2.23-31.92), elevated BMI at 6-8 weeks postpartum (OR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.42-11.35) and not breastfeeding at 2 months (OR = 3.23, 95% CI 1.48-7.02). Within 36 months of delivery date, 75% of women had achieved pre-pregnancy levels of fitness.An additional 6 weeks of convalescence did not adversely affect physical performance or BMI measures in AD Army women following pregnancy. Modifiable factors such as pre- and post-pregnancy conditioning and weight, weight gain in pregnancy and always breastfeeding were found to be significant in recovery of physical fitness postpartum."
https://openalex.org/W3184478340,"Corynespora cassiicola, a fungal plant pathogen with a large host range, causes important damages in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), in Asia and Africa. A small secreted protein named cassiicolin was previously identified as a necrotrophic effector required for the virulence of C. cassiicola in specific rubber tree clones. The objective of this study was to decipher the cassiicolin-mediated molecular mechanisms involved in this compatible interaction. We comparatively analyzed the RNA-Seq transcriptomic profiles of leaves treated or not with the purified cassiicolin Cas1, in two rubber clones: PB260 (susceptible) and RRIM600 (tolerant). The reads were mapped against a synthetic transcriptome composed of all available transcriptomic references from the two clones. Genes differentially expressed in response to cassiicolin Cas1 were identified, in each clone, at two different time-points. After de novo annotation of the synthetic transcriptome, we analyzed GO enrichment of the differentially expressed genes in order to elucidate the main functional pathways impacted by cassiicolin. Cassiicolin induced qualitatively similar transcriptional modifications in both the susceptible and the tolerant clones, with a strong negative impact on photosynthesis, and the activation of defense responses via redox signaling, production of pathogenesis-related protein, or activation of the secondary metabolism. In the tolerant clone, transcriptional reprogramming occurred earlier but remained moderate. By contrast, the susceptible clone displayed a late but huge transcriptional burst, characterized by massive induction of phosphorylation events and all the features of a hypersensitive response. These results confirm that cassiicolin Cas1 is a necrotrophic effector triggering a hypersensitive response in susceptible rubber clones, in agreement with the necrotrophic-effector-triggered susceptibility model."
https://openalex.org/W3186180169,"Blood group systems were the first phenotypic markers used in anthropology to decipher the origin of populations, their migratory movements, and their admixture. The recent emergence of new technologies based on the decoding of nucleic acids from an individual’s entire genome has relegated them to their primary application, blood transfusion. Thus, despite the finer mapping of the modern human genome in relation to Neanderthal and Denisova populations, little is known about red cell blood groups in these archaic populations. Here we analyze the available high-quality sequences of three Neanderthals and one Denisovan individuals for 7 blood group systems that are used today in transfusion (ABO including H/Se, Rh (Rhesus), Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS, Diego). We show that Neanderthal and Denisova were polymorphic for ABO and shared blood group alleles recurrent in modern Sub-Saharan populations. Furthermore, we found ABO-related alleles currently preventing from viral gut infection and Neanderthal RHD and RHCE alleles nowadays associated with a high risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Such a common blood group pattern across time and space is coherent with a Neanderthal population of low genetic diversity exposed to low reproductive success and with their inevitable demise. Lastly, we connect a Neanderthal RHD allele to two present-day Aboriginal Australian and Papuan, suggesting that a segment of archaic genome was introgressed in this gene in non-Eurasian populations. While contributing to both the origin and late evolutionary history of Neanderthal and Denisova, our results further illustrate that blood group systems are a relevant piece of the puzzle helping to decipher it."
https://openalex.org/W3186269564,"Safe and effective regimens are still needed given the risk of radiation toxicity from iatrogenic irradiation. The gut microbiota plays an important role in radiation damage. Diet has emerged as a key determinant of the intestinal microbiome signature and function. In this report, we investigated whether a 30% caloric restriction (CR) diet may ameliorate radiation enteritis and hematopoietic toxicity. Experimental mice were either fed ad libitum (AL) or subjected to CR preconditioning for 10 days and then exposed to total body irradiation (TBI) or total abdominal irradiation (TAI). Gross examinations showed that short-term CR pretreatment restored hematogenic organs and improved the intestinal architecture in both male and female mice. Intriguingly, CR preconditioning mitigated radiation-induced systemic and enteric inflammation in female mice, while gut barrier function improved in irradiated males. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the frequency of pro-inflammatory microbes, including Helicobacter and Desulfovibrionaceae, was reduced in female mice after 10 days of CR preconditioning, while an enrichment of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibaculum, Clostridiales, and Lactobacillus, was observed in males. Using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or antibiotic administration to alter the gut microbiota counteracted the short-term CR-elicited radiation tolerance of both male and female mice, further indicating that the radioprotection of a 30% CR diet depends on altering the gut microbiota. Together, our findings provide new insights into CR in clinical applications and indicate that a short-term CR diet prior to radiation modulates sex-specific gut microbiota configurations, protecting male and female mice against the side effects caused by radiation challenge."

HIV-positive participants had HIV RNA suppression on antiretroviral therapy and were categorized as either INR (N = 36) or Clinical Responders (""CR""; CD4>350/mm3; N = 47). 18 HIV-negative comparator individuals were included. Cellular markers were assessed by flow cytometry, with soluble markers assessed by ELISA and LC/MS-MS. Multivariable linear regression models estimated the association between INR phenotype and markers, adjusting for age, sex, duration of ART, and recent infection/vaccination.INR participants demonstrated a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio (p<0.001), 35% more CD8 activation (p = 0.02), 36% greater α4β7+ CD4 T cells (p<0.01), 54% more HLA-DR+ CD4 T cells (p<0.001), and 20% higher plasma VCAM (p<0.01) compared to CRs. The INR phenotype was not associated with levels of Kyn/Trp, CRP, TNF, IFNγ, IL-8, IL-6, sCD14, D-Dimer, I-FABP, MCP-1, ICAM or CD8%HLA-DR+.Peripheral CD4 non-recovery during long-term treated HIV infection is characterized by elevated CD8 activation and CD4 gut homing. Gut-focused interventions may be warranted in the INR context, and CD8 activation may serve as a surrogate endpoint for clinical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3184014361,"Both voluntary in-hospital reporting and mandatory national-level reporting systems for patient safety issues need to work well to develop a patient safety learning system that is effective in preventing the recurrence of adverse events. Some of the hospital systems and activities may increase voluntary in-hospital reporting and mandatory national-level reporting. This study aimed to identify the hospital systems and activities that increase voluntary in-hospital reporting and mandatory national-level reporting for patient safety issues. An anonymous mail survey of hospitals in Japan was conducted in 2017. The hospitals were selected by stratified random sampling according to number of beds. The survey examined the annual number of reported events in the voluntary in-hospital reporting system for patient safety and experience of reporting unexpected patient deaths possibly due to medical interventions to the mandatory national-level reporting system in the last 2 years. The relationship of the answer to the questions with the patient safety management systems and activities at each hospital was analyzed. The response rate was 18.8% (603/3,215). The number of in-hospital reports per bed was positively related to identifying events by referring complaints or questions of patients or family members, using root cause analysis for analyzing reported events, and developing manuals or case studies based on reported events, and negatively related to the unification and standardization of medical devices and equipment. The experience with mandatory national-level reporting of serious adverse events was positively related to identifying problematic cases by a person in charge of patient safety management from the in-hospital reporting system of complications and accidental symptoms. Enhanced feedback for reporters may promote voluntary in-hospital reporting of minor cases with low litigation risks. Developing an in-hospital mechanism that examines all serious complications and accidental symptoms may promote mandatory national-level reporting of serious adverse events with high litigation risks."

A lot of factors influence children's educational achievement. Studies in developed countries well established the relation of school achievement with its associated variables. But information is lack on what factors play important role for school achievement at early age in low resource settings like Bangladesh. We aimed to find factors associated with school achievement in rural Bangladesh.The data were acquired from a long-term follow up study, conducted in 8-10 years old children (n = 372). We used a locally developed school achievement tool based on Wide Range Achievement Test-4 to measure reading, spelling and math computation, Wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence to measure intelligence Quotient (IQ), Digit span forward and backward for short term memory, and locally available Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire to measure behaviour. Socioeconomic and anthropometric information of the mothers and children were also collected. Multicollinearity of the data was checked. Unadjusted and adjusted multiple linear regression analysis was performed.Years of schooling and short-term memory were positively related to reading, spelling and math computation. For years of schooling it was-reading B = 8.09 (CI 5.84, 10.31), spelling 4.43 (4.33, 8.53) and math computation 5.23 (3.60, 6.87) and for short term memory- reading 3.56 (2.01,5.05), spelling 4.01 (2.56, 5.46) and math computation 2.49 (1.37, 3.62). Older children had lower scores of reading -0.48 (-0.94, -0.02), spelling -0.41 (-0.88, -0.02) and math computation -0.47 (-0.80, -0.14). Children's IQ predicted reading 0.48 (0.14, 0.81) and spelling 0.50 (0.18, 0.82) skills. Mother and father's education predicted Spelling 0.82 (0.16, 1.48) and reading 0.68 (0.06, 1.30) capacity respectively. Children enrolled in private schools had higher reading 10.28 (5.05, 15.51) and spelling 6.22 (1.31, 11.13) than those in the government schools. Children with more difficult behaviour tended to have lower scores in reading -0.51 (-0.96, -0.05).Children's school achievement is influenced by their IQ, years of schooling, type of school and parents' education. Therefore, intervention should be made to focus specifically on these variables and establish the effect of this intervention through robust research design."

Participants were assessed using the PD Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2).For the whole PD patient cohort, the PDSS-2 sleep disturbance domain score and the scores for item 1 assessing sleep quality and item 8 assessing nocturia were positively correlated with daily total dosage of antiparkinsonian drugs and dosage of L-dopa, but not with the dosage of DAs. Sub-analysis according to DA treatment revealed that DA dosage was not correlated with item 1 or 8 score in any of the subgroups. The LED ratio of rotigotine to the total dosage of antiparkinsonian drugs was inversely correlated with the item 1 score.These data suggest that antiparkinsonian drugs, in particular L-dopa, adversely affect nocturnal sleep in PD patients, especially in terms of sleep quality and nocturia. Thus, adjusting both the total dosage of antiparkinsonian drugs and the dose-ratio of L-dopa might be key actions for alleviating poor sleep quality in patients with PD. Among DAs, we found a clear positive correlation between the dose-ratio of rotigotine and sleep quality. Thus, partial L-dopa replacement with rotigotine could improve sleep quality in patients with PD."
https://openalex.org/W3186886411,"Ovarian cancer (OC), the eighth-leading cause of cancer-related death among females worldwide, is mainly represented by epithelial OC (EOC) that can be further subdivided into four subtypes: serous (75%), endometrioid (10%), clear cell (10%), and mucinous (3%). Major reasons for high mortality are the poor biological understanding of the OC mechanisms and a lack of reliable markers defining each EOC subtype. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression primarily by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Their aberrant expression patterns have been associated with cancer development, including OC. However, the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis is still to be determined, mainly due to the lack of consensus regarding optimal methodologies for identification and validation of miRNAs and their targets. Several tools for computational target prediction exist, but false interpretations remain a problem. The experimental validation of every potential miRNA-mRNA pair is not feasible, as it is laborious and expensive. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between global miRNA and mRNA expression patterns derived from microarray profiling of 197 EOC patients to identify the signatures of miRNA-mRNA interactions associated with overall survival (OS). The aim was to investigate whether these miRNA-mRNA signatures might have a prognostic value for OS in different subtypes of EOC. The content of our cohort (162 serous carcinomas, 15 endometrioid carcinomas, 11 mucinous carcinomas, and 9 clear cell carcinomas) reflects a real-world scenario of EOC. Several interaction pairs between 6 miRNAs (hsa-miR-126-3p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-23a-5p, hsa-miR-27a-5p, hsa-miR-486-5p, and hsa-miR-506-3p) and 8 mRNAs ( ATF3 , CH25H , EMP1 , HBB , HBEGF , NAMPT , POSTN , and PROCR ) were identified and the findings appear to be well supported by the literature. This indicates that our study has a potential to reveal miRNA-mRNA signatures relevant for EOC. Thus, the evaluation on independent cohorts will further evaluate the performance of such findings."
https://openalex.org/W3186941431,"The present work addresses the thermal remodelling of flexible plant viruses with a helical structure and virus-like particles (VLPs). Here, for the first time, the possibility of filamentous Alternanthera mosaic virus (AltMV) virions' thermal transition into structurally modified spherical particles (SP) has been demonstrated. The work has established differences in formation conditions of SP from virions (SPV) and VLPs (SPVLP) that are in accordance with structural data (on AltMV virions and VLPs). SP originate from AltMV virions through an intermediate stage. However, the same intermediate stage was not detected during AltMV VLPs' structural remodelling. According to the biochemical analysis, AltMV SPV consist of protein and do not include RNA. The structural characterisation of AltMV SPV/VLP by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and thioflavin T fluorescence assay has been performed. AltMV SPV/VLP adsorption properties and the availability of chemically reactive surface amino acids have been analysed. The revealed characteristics of AltMV SPV/VLP indicate that they could be applied as protein platforms for target molecules presentation and for the design of functionally active complexes."
https://openalex.org/W3185071274,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is significantly associated with neurological deficits and age-related neurological diseases. While mitochondria are dynamically regulated and properly maintained during neurogenesis, the manner in which mitochondrial activities are controlled and contribute to these processes is not fully understood. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) contributes to mitochondrial function by maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). To clarify how mitochondrial dysfunction affects neurogenesis, we induced mitochondrial dysfunction specifically in murine neural stem cells (NSCs) by inactivating Tfam. Tfam inactivation in NSCs resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing respiratory chain activities and causing a severe deficit in neural differentiation and maturation both in vivo and in vitro. Brain tissue from Tfam-deficient mice exhibited neuronal cell death primarily at layer V and microglia were activated prior to cell death. Cultured Tfam-deficient NSCs showed a reduction in reactive oxygen species produced by the mitochondria. Tfam inactivation during neurogenesis resulted in the accumulation of ATF4 and activation of target gene expression. Therefore, we propose that the integrated stress response (ISR) induced by mitochondrial dysfunction in neurogenesis is activated to protect the progression of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3165588788,"The different ways students deal with mistakes is an integral part of mindset theory. While previous error-monitoring studies found supporting neural evidence for mindset-related differences, they may have been confounded by overlapping stimulus processing. We therefore investigated the relationship between mindset and event-related potentials (ERPs) of error-monitoring (response-locked Ne, Pe), with and without overlap correction. In addition, besides behavioral measures of remedial action after errors (post-error slowing and accuracy), we investigated their neural correlates (stimulus-locked N2). Results indicated comparable Ne, but larger Pe amplitudes in fixed-minded students; however, after overlap correction, the Pe results were rendered non-significant. A likely explanation for this overlap was a near-significant effect of mindset on the preceding stimulus P3. Finally, although N2 was larger for trials following errors, mindset was unrelated. The current study shows that the relationship between error-monitoring and mindset is more complex and should be reconsidered. Future studies are advised to explore stimulus processing as well, and if needed, to correct for stimulus overlap. In addition, contextual influences on and individual variation in error-monitoring need more scrutiny, which may contribute to refining mindset theory."

However, little research had been carried out in Chinese samples, and the effect of interpretation training on other processes such as attentional bias also remained unclear. This study examined the effect of interpretation bias modification program (IMP) on interpretation bias, social anxiety and attentional bias, and the possible mediation effects. 51 healthy adults were randomly assigned to either a 5-session IMP training that guided them to endorse benign interpretation in ambiguous scenarios or an interpretation control condition (ICC). Self-reported measures of social anxiety symptoms, attentional bias and interpretation bias were evaluated before and after training. Results showed that compared to control group, IMP group generated more positive interpretations and less negative interpretations after training (F(1,49) = 7.65, p<0.01, ηp2 = 0.14; F(1,49) = 14.60, p<0.01, ηp2 = 0.23respectively). IMP yielded greater interpretation bias reduction (F(1,49) = 12.84, p<0.01, ηp2 = 0.21) and social anxiety reduction (F(1,49) = 21.39, p<0.01, ηp2 = 0.30) than ICC, but change in attentional bias was not significant between IMP and the control group. Change in interpretation bias did not show a significant mediation effect in the relationship between training condition and social anxiety reduction. This study provided preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the Chinese version of IMP training. Possible methodological issues and interpretations underlying the findings were discussed. This study was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chitr.org.cn), a WHO approved registry.

The predictive ability of the DCI-CRPC was compared in univariable models to that of the original DCI, derived from men in the general population, and to that of the Charlson Comorbidity Index.In 1,885 men with CRPC the median overall survival ranged from 3.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8 to 3.4) in the first tertile of the DCI-CRPC, to 1.0 year (95% CI 0.9 to 1.1) in the third tertile of the DCI-CRPC. The index had higher discriminative ability (C-index 0.667) than the Charlson Comorbidity Index (C-index 0.508). The discriminative ability of the DCI-CRPC was highest in the subgroup with least aggressive cancer (C-index 0.651) and lowest in men with most aggressive cancer (C-index 0.618). The performance of the DCI-CRPC was comparable to that of the original DCI.Our newly created comorbidity index using filled prescriptions predicted death in men with CRPC better than the Charlson Comorbidity Index."

Insofar bequests are given without the prospect of future personal benefits in mind, they are presumably intrinsically motivated. Hence, estate divisions provide a rare opportunity to study intrinsically motivated prosocial behavior in the field. The empirical analysis is based on data from digitized estate reports for all individuals in Sweden who passed away in 2002 and 2003. The data show in detail how the decedents distributed their bequests. We find that family members, both genetic (offspring) and non-genetic (partner), receive the lion's share of the estates. Other relatives, friends and strangers (represented by charities) receive only very small shares of the total estate wealth. The results suggest that intrinsically motivated altruism is primarily directed towards close family members."
https://openalex.org/W3186582786,"Fabry disease results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme ⍺-Galactosidase-A (⍺-Gal A) and is estimated to occur in approximately 1:4100 live births. Characteristic of the disease is the accumulation of α-Gal-A substrates, primarily the glycosphingolipids (GSLs) globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine. Thrombotic events are a significant concern for Fabry patients, with strokes contributing to a significant decrease in overall lifespan. Currently, the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of thrombotic events experienced by Fabry patients are incompletely defined. Using a rat model of Fabry disease, we provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms linking GSL accumulation to thrombotic risk. We found that ⍺-Gal A-deficient rats accumulate myeloid-derived leukocytes at sites of GSL accumulation, including in the bone marrow and circulation, and that myeloid-derived leukocyte and megakaryocyte populations were prominent among cell types that accumulated GSLs. In the circulation, ⍺-Gal A-deficient rats had increases in cytokine-producing cell types and a corresponding elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, circulating platelets from ⍺-Gal A-deficient rats accumulated a similar set of ⍺-Galactosidase-A substrates as was observed in megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, and exhibited increased platelet binding to fibrinogen in microfluidic and flow cytometric assays."
