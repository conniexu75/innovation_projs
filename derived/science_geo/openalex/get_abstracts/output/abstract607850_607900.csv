https://openalex.org/W2795185600,"The controllable incorporation of multiple immiscible elements into a single nanoparticle merits untold scientific and technological potential, yet remains a challenge using conventional synthetic techniques. We present a general route for alloying up to eight dissimilar elements into single-phase solid-solution nanoparticles, referred to as high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs), by thermally shocking precursor metal salt mixtures loaded onto carbon supports [temperature ~2000 kelvin (K), 55-millisecond duration, rate of ~105 K per second]. We synthesized a wide range of multicomponent nanoparticles with a desired chemistry (composition), size, and phase (solid solution, phase-separated) by controlling the carbothermal shock (CTS) parameters (substrate, temperature, shock duration, and heating/cooling rate). To prove utility, we synthesized quinary HEA-NPs as ammonia oxidation catalysts with ~100% conversion and >99% nitrogen oxide selectivity over prolonged operations."

https://openalex.org/W2795313425,"Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the dendrite problem is exacerbated at high current densities. Here, we report a regime for dendrite evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping current density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface diffusion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal surface. We show that repeated doses of high-current-density healing treatment enables the safe cycling of Li-sulfur batteries with high coulombic efficiency."

Chameleon skin can change color when the animal goes from a relaxed to an excited state. Although these properties can be captured individually in synthetic materials, the combination of different dynamic responses can be hard to control. Vatankhah-Varnosfaderani et al. created triblock copolymers of the ABA variety, where the A blocks have a linear structure and the B blocks are like bottlebrushes. When strained, these polymers stiffened like human skin and changed color, thus giving the materials a range of adaptive properties. Science , this issue p. 1509"

But tumors often disguise themselves by shedding these proteins, which prevents specialized natural killer (NK) cells from recognizing and destroying the cancer. Ferrari de Andrade et al. engineered antibodies directed against the site responsible for the proteolytic shedding of MICA and MICB (see the Perspective by Cerwenka and Lanier). The approach effectively locked MICA and MICB onto tumors so that NK cells could spot them for elimination. The antibodies exhibited preclinical efficacy in multiple tumor models, including humanized melanoma. Furthermore, the strategy reduced lung cancer metastasis after NK cell–mediated tumor lysis.

If a coating could be developed that showed dynamic tuning of the effective temperature, it might be possible to hide objects from infrared sensing. Xu et al. started with a basic Bragg reflector made up of multiple layers of alternating materials with varying refractive index. The authors designed structures that were wavy to begin with so that they could be flattened out by electrical activation. This changed the infrared reflectivity and, thus, the effective temperature of the object observed in its infrared profile. Science , this issue p. 1495"
https://openalex.org/W2794637900,"Sulfur steps aside for nitrogen Enzymatic conversion of molecular nitrogen to ammonia requires a dance of electrons and protons. The stage for that dance is the nitrogenase cofactor, a carefully constructed cluster of iron, sulfur, and carbon with homocitrate and, in some cases, bicarbonate appendages, as well as a secondary metal ion that defines the class of enzyme. The question of how this cofactor binds nitrogen has been vexingly difficult to answer. Sippel et al. report a high-resolution structure of the vanadium nitrogenase with a light atom, interpreted as nitrogen, bound to the FeV cofactor. A sulfur atom is displaced from the cofactor in this structure and is observed resting in a holding site formed by rearrangement of a glutamine residue. The putative bridging nitrogen atom suggests that diatomic nitrogen may bind to the cluster in a head-on manner, with the glutamine side chain stabilizing protonated intermediates as they are reduced.

Central to biofilm formation is a very tight interaction between microbial surface proteins called adhesins and components of the extracellular matrix of the host. Milles et al. used atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy combined with steered molecular dynamics to explore how the bond between staphylococcal adhesin SdrG and its target fibrinogen peptide can withstand forces greater than 2 nanonewtons (see the Perspective by Herman-Bausier and Dufrêne). The peptide is confined in a coiled geometry in a deep and rigid pocket through hydrogen bonds between SdrG and the peptide backbone. If pulled, the load is distributed over all hydrogen bonds so that all bonds must be broken at once to break the interaction. Science , this issue p. 1527 ; see also p. 1464"

The advent of chiral phosphoric acid derivatives has been useful for biasing these reactions toward just one of two mirror-image products. For the most part, though, these chiral catalysts have interacted with basic sites such as carbonyl groups. Tsuji et al. now extend asymmetric acid catalysis to simple carbon-carbon double bonds. Their custom imidodiphosphate forms a pocket that orients olefins to achieve mainly intramolecular alkoxylation on just one face after protonation. Science , this issue p. 1501"

The disease is caused by the organism Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and was first identified in the late 1990s. Voyles et al. revisited protected areas in Panama where catastrophic amphibian losses were recorded a decade ago (see the Perspective by Collins). Although disease theory predicts that epidemics should result in reduced pathogenicity, they found no evidence for such a reduction. Despite this, the amphibian community is displaying signs of recovery—including some species presumed extinct after the outbreak. Increased host resistance may be responsible for this recovery.

https://openalex.org/W2794725954,"Mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, or both have been implicated in insulin resistance. However, disentangling the individual roles of these processes in insulin resistance has been difficult because they often occur in tandem, and tools that selectively increase oxidant production without impairing mitochondrial respiration have been lacking. Using the dimer/monomer status of peroxiredoxin isoforms as an indicator of compartmental hydrogen peroxide burden, we provide evidence that oxidative stress is localized to mitochondria in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissue from mice. To dissociate oxidative stress from impaired oxidative phosphorylation and study whether mitochondrial oxidative stress per se can cause insulin resistance, we used mitochondria-targeted paraquat (MitoPQ) to generate superoxide within mitochondria without directly disrupting the respiratory chain. At ≤10 μm, MitoPQ specifically increased mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide without altering mitochondrial respiration in intact cells. Under these conditions, MitoPQ impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane in both adipocytes and myotubes. MitoPQ recapitulated many features of insulin resistance found in other experimental models, including increased oxidants in mitochondria but not cytosol; a more profound effect on glucose transport than on other insulin-regulated processes, such as protein synthesis and lipolysis; an absence of overt defects in insulin signaling; and defective insulin- but not AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-regulated GLUT4 translocation. We conclude that elevated mitochondrial oxidants rapidly impair insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation and significantly contribute to insulin resistance and that MitoPQ is an ideal tool for studying the link between mitochondrial oxidative stress and regulated GLUT4 trafficking.

We conclude that elevated mitochondrial oxidants rapidly impair insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation and significantly contribute to insulin resistance and that MitoPQ is an ideal tool for studying the link between mitochondrial oxidative stress and regulated GLUT4 trafficking. Insulin lowers blood glucose, in part, by stimulating glucose uptake into adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Insulin achieves this by increasing cell-surface levels of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) via activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. This process is defective in insulin resistance, a pathophysiological state that is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Insulin resistance in adipocytes and muscle has been reported to be caused by a number of systemic insults, including increased caloric intake, sedentary behavior, hyperinsulinemia, glucocorticoids, and inflammation. Although the relationship between these stresses remains unclear, many involve altered mitochondrial function, including incomplete fatty acid oxidation leading to the accumulation of lipid intermediates like acylcarnitines (1Koves T.R.

Whereas these studies imply that mitochondrial O2−/H2O2 are intimately involved in the development of insulin resistance, it remains unclear whether scavenging such oxidants also affected mitochondrial function.

Thus, there is a pressing need to show a direct link between mitochondrial oxidants and insulin resistance independently of mitochondrial function.

Gawel J.M. Aksentijević D. Cochemé H.M. Stewart T.S. Shchepinova M.M. Qiang H. Prime T.A. Bright T.P. James A.M. Shattock M.J. Senn H.M. Hartley R.C. Murphy M.P.

We found that MitoPQ induced mitochondrial O2− and H2O2 without impairing whole-cell oxygen consumption. MitoPQ acutely impaired insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in both adipocytes and muscle cells. This occurred without impairment in proximal insulin signaling to Akt or TBC1D4. MitoPQ caused a specific defect in insulin regulation of GLUT4 trafficking, and other actions of insulin remained intact, as has been observed in other models of insulin resistance (23Tan S.X. Fisher-Wellman K.H. Fazakerley D.J. Ng Y. Pant H. Li J. Meoli C.C. Coster A.C. Stöckli J. James D.E. Selective insulin resistance in adipocytes.J. Biol.

Thus, treatment with MitoPQ enabled us to recapitulate previously observed features of insulin resistance. This demonstrates for the first time that an acute increase in mitochondrial oxidants, independent of mitochondrial dysfunction, is sufficient to induce insulin resistance. Our data in in vitro and in vivo models of insulin resistance indicate that oxidative stress in insulin-resistant adipocytes appears specific to mitochondria, and we propose that these mitochondrial oxidants induce a retrograde signaling pathway to impair insulin-regulated delivery of GLUT4 to the PM. We have previously reported that multiple in vitro models of insulin resistance in cultured adipocytes and myotubes are associated with increased mitochondrial O2−, as assessed by hydroethidine-derived fluorescence (4Hoehn K.L.

However, these studies did not exclude the possibility that there were also increased oxidants in other cellular compartments, such as the cytosol. To assess whether insulin resistance is associated with increased oxidants specifically in mitochondria, we studied the cytosolic and mitochondrial hydroperoxide burden in two in vitro models and one in vivo model of adipocyte insulin resistance. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 10 nm insulin for 24 h to mimic hyperinsulinemia or with 2 ng/ml TNFα for 96 h to mimic chronic pro-inflammatory signaling impaired insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose (2DOG) uptake (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, 14-day high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) feeding, which is sufficient to induce maximal adipose tissue insulin resistance (24Turner N. Kowalski G.M. Leslie S.J. Risis S. Yang C.

We assessed mitochondrial and cytosolic relative H2O2 exposure using the dimeric state of location-specific peroxiredoxins as a surrogate. 2-Cys PRDXs form disulfide-linked homodimers upon oxidation by hydroperoxides, such as H2O2, and are slowly reduced to their monomer by thioredoxin. Therefore, the PRDX dimer/monomer ratio acts as a surrogate for H2O2 content (26Bayer S.B. Maghzal G. Stocker R. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Neutrophil-mediated oxidation of erythrocyte peroxiredoxin 2 as a potential marker of oxidative stress in inflammation.FASEB J. 2013; 27 (23603832): 3315-332210.1096/fj.13-227298Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although changes in thioredoxin activity and hydroperoxides other than H2O2 will also contribute. PRDX2 and PRDX3 are localized in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, so the dimer/monomer ratio of these isoforms is indicative of H2O2 content at these specific locations. The PRDX2 dimer/monomer ratio was unchanged in all insulin resistance models (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that cytosolic peroxide levels were unchanged. In contrast, the PRDX3 dimer/monomer ratio was increased by 1.8–2.8-fold in in vitro models (Fig. 1D) and by 2.3-fold in in vivo models (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that insulin resistance is characterized by an oxidative burden specifically in mitochondria. Mitochondrial oxidants appear to play a causal role in insulin resistance because pharmacological (4Hoehn K.L. Salmon A.B. Hohnen-Behrens C. Turner N. Hoy A.J. Maghzal G.J. Stocker R. Van Remmen H.

However, even in these examples, it is challenging to disentangle mitochondrial oxidative stress from mitochondrial dysfunction, as it is not clear how scavenging of these oxidants influences mitochondrial function. To test whether mitochondrial oxidants are sufficient to cause insulin resistance, we endeavored to establish a system where we could acutely increase mitochondrial oxidant production independently of other changes, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. To this end, here we describe the use of MitoPQ (Fig. 2A) (22Robb E.L. Gawel J.M. Aksentijević D. Cochemé H.M. Stewart T.S. Shchepinova M.M. Qiang H. Prime T.A. Bright T.P. James A.M. Shattock M.J.

MitoPQ has previously been reported to increase oxidants in isolated mitochondria and in mitochondria of C2C12 myoblasts (22Robb E.L. Gawel J.M. Aksentijević D. Cochemé H.M. Stewart T.S.

We tested whether incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with MitoPQ increased mitochondrial O2− using LC-MS/MS to quantify the conversion of mito-hydroethidine to mito-2-hydroxyethidium (27Zielonka J. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Detection of 2-hydroxyethidium in cellular systems: a unique marker product of superoxide and hydroethidine.Nat.

MitoPQ increased mito-2-hydroxyethidium concentrations compared with cells treated with a vehicle control (Fig. 2B), as did a high dose of paraquat, which was included as a positive control (Fig. 2B). We next tested whether increased mitochondrial O2− was due to the active paraquat moiety, and not a by-product of, for example, the triphenylphosphonium lipophilic cation, which mediates localization to the mitochondria. We tested this by using an inactive MitoPQ analogue (MitoPQ-control (MitoPQ-Ctrl); Fig. 2A), which is localized to mitochondria but does not generate O2− because the pyridine rings of the viologen component are not coplanar and thus cannot stabilize a radical cation effectively (28Andersson S.

These Plasmodium species invade the iron-rich environment of red blood cells. Zhang et al. found that the iron transporter ferroportin persists on the surface of mature mammalian red blood cells. Red blood cells are at risk of oxidative damage if their hemoglobin releases its iron; ferroportin is thus important to expel this iron. The authors also found that the transporter can deprive malaria parasites of the iron they need for proliferation. The Q248H mutation in the human ferroportin gene enhances ferroportin expression during development and seems to provide protection against malaria.

A more comprehensive understanding of the effect of the variant on myeloid cell function in general, especially in the absence of additional genetic perturbations that are used to generate neurodegenerative disease models, may help clarify some of the contradictory data pertaining to the role of the protein in progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. We describe below an R47H transgenic model and comprehensively characterize the loss-of-myeloid cell function conferred by the R47H variant. We also demonstrate that antibodies that activate proximal TREM2 signaling rescue some of these cumulative defects and even boost WT TREM2 activity.

To address some of these fundamental questions linked to TREM2 biology and the effect of the R47H variant on TREM2 functioning, we have generated Trem2−/− and Trem2R47H knockin mice. The TREM gene locus in humans and mice includes multiple TREM and TREM-like genes with both ITAM- and ITIM-associated functions (18.Allcock R.J. Barrow A.D. Forbes S. Beck S. Trowsdale J. The human TREM gene cluster at 6p21.1 encodes both activating and inhibitory single IgV domain receptors and includes NKp44.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33 (12645956): 567-57710.1002/immu.200310033Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1A). Regulatory elements located within the TREM2 gene can impact the expression of other TREM genes. To specifically target the TREM2 gene without perturbing additional regulatory elements, we used a gene editing–based approach to generate Trem2−/− or Trem2R47H mice. The Trem2−/− strain was generated by engineering a deletion in exon 1 of the Trem2 gene, and the Trem2R47H strain was generated by engineering a point mutation at residue 47 in the mouse Trem2 gene (Fig. S1, B and C), analogous to the human variant. Detailed qPCR analyses of brain homogenates from the gene-edited Trem2−/−, Trem2R47H, and commercial NIH KOMP mice confirmed a comparable loss of the gene in the knockouts and Trem2 expression comparable with WT age-matched controls for the Trem2R47H mice (Fig. 1, A–C). We further confirmed that upon LPS stimulation, R47H Trem2 was down-regulated in mouse brains comparable with age-matched WT controls, whereas no detectable levels of Trem2 mRNA were observed in the Trem2−/− animals under any of the conditions tested (Fig. 1, A–C). Similar and expected trends in expression patterns were observed in WT, gene-edited Trem2−/−, and Trem2R47H mice with respect to other Trem genes in the locus, including Trem1 (Fig. 1, D and E), Treml1 (Fig. 1, G and H), and Treml2 (Fig. 1, J and K) under basal and LPS-stimulated conditions. Of note, we and others (19.Kang S.S. Kurti A. Baker K.E. Liu C.C. Colonna M. Ulrich J.D. Holtzman D.M. Bu G. Fryer J.D. Behavioral and transcriptomic analysis of Trem2-null mice: not all knockout mice are created equal.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2018; 27 (29040522): 211-22310.1093/hmg/ddx366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have observed unexpected changes in other Trem genes in the Trem locus under basal and LPS-stimulated conditions in the Trem2KOMP−/− mice; this includes a less significant Trem1 response compared with age-matched WT littermates (Fig. 1F, LPS stimulation, 4- and 24-h time points), a highly significant increase in Treml1 (Fig. 1I, steady state and LPS), and a significant decrease in Treml2 (Fig. 1L, steady state and LPS). Next, we compared the phenotypes of Trem2R47H, Trem2−/−, and WT bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) and microglia. We noted reduced proliferation and survival of the gene-edited Trem2R47H and Trem2−/− BMDMs (Fig. 2, A and B) and microglia (Fig. 2, C and D) under limiting conditions of CSF-1, consistent with previously published data on knockout alone (9.Atagi Y.

Immunol. 2009; 10 (19503107): 734-74310.1038/ni.1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As well, we noted gene dosage–dependent effects on proliferation and survival of both Trem2R47H (Fig. S2A) and Trem2−/− (Fig. S2B) myeloid cells. A more detailed analysis reveals that the variant macrophages have a primarily apoptotic and negligible necrotic response (Fig. 2, E and F) compared with the knockout macrophages, which have significant increases in both apoptotic and necrotic events (Fig. 2, G and H). Also, a breakdown of the apoptotic and necrotic events by gene dosage revealed clearly that in the case of the variant, the effects are only apparent in the homozygous R47H macrophages and not in the heterozygous macrophages, again supportive of the more subtle nature of the mutation. In the case of the heterozygous knockouts, whereas the necrotic events did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.08), they consistently demonstrated an increasing trend compared with WT. To determine whether the parallels and differences between the variant and knockout macrophages can be explained at the molecular level, we performed RNA-Seq analyses comparing WT, Trem2−/−, and Trem2R47H macrophages. At day 7 under limiting conditions of CSF-1, consistent with the gradation in severity of phenotypes observed, we observed the greatest differential transcript expression in the Trem2−/− macrophages with an intermediate effect in Trem2R47H macrophages (heat map in Fig. 3A). Pathway analyses point to a role for TREM2 in cell cycle/proliferation and survival, immune response and migration, and lipid and cholesterol homeostasis (Fig. 3B). Whereas the total number of genes involved in proliferation, necrosis, and apoptosis was higher in the knockout group, the R47H group had a larger number of apoptotic genes. Overall, the total number of genes that were differentially expressed was higher in the knockout group compared with the R47H variant group. We confirmed differences in several genes in each of the modules, including genes linked to the proliferation/survival module as well as some known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer's like ApoE (Fig. 3, C and D), pro-inflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated in AD like Il-1α (Fig. 3, E and F), and complement genes C1qa (Fig. 3, G and H) and C3 (Fig. 3, I and J). A temporal component is associated with the changes observed in some of the genes with an increase in gene expression followed by a decline, as in the case of C1qa and C3 (Fig. 3, G–J). We also noted changes in a host of chemokines/chemokine receptors in both the R47H and knockout groups, including a down-regulation of genes like Cx3cr1 (Fig. 4, A and B), Ccr2 (Fig. 4C), and Ccl2 (Fig. 4D). In a few instances, we also noted up-regulation of genes, including Ccl5 and Ccl22 (Fig. S3, A–D). The effect on Cx3cr1 was the most profound, with a significant gene dosage–dependent effect at multiple time points that was observed in both genotypes. The effects on Ccr2 and Ccl2 were more subtle and noted only at specific time points. For the first time, we noted a reduction in Flt1 in the TREM2 knockouts but no obvious effect in the variants (Fig. S3, E and F). Overall, in the majority of genes, the differential effect was significantly more pronounced in the knockouts compared with the R47H cells. The modulation of multiple migratory chemokines/chemokine receptors translated to a net reduction in migration/motility of R47H and knockout macrophages (Fig. 4E and Fig. S3G) and to a lesser extent Arg-47 microglia (Fig. 4F, trend but not statistically significant).Figure 4RNA-Seq analysis also reveals dysregulation of multiple chemokines/chemokine receptors and accompanying migration defects in variant macrophages and microglia. A and B, Cx3cr1 was significantly down-regulated in R47H macrophages (A) and knockout macrophages (B) with a clear gene dosage effect observed at different time points. C and D, Ccr2 (C) and Ccl2 (D) were also confirmed as down-regulated in both R47H and knockout macrophages (trend for Ccl2) at different time points. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. (error bars) and are from a representative experiment. The experiment was conducted twice independently. E, migration defects were observed for the R47H macrophages in a plug area assay. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. and are from a representative experiment. The experiment was conducted three times independently. F, a trend of migration defects was also noted for R47H microglia in a transwell assay with C5a as the chemoattractant (data from three animals). *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001; data represented as mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined the effect of an acute in vivo challenge on variant and knockout microglia. Animals were administered LPS (5.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)), and CD11b+ microglia cells were isolated following overnight treatment according to the manufacturer's protocols. No significant differences were observed in the total number of microglial cells isolated under homeostatic and challenge conditions (data not shown). Contrary to our expectation of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS challenge in the variant microglia based on the proposed functional role for TREM2, we observed statistically significant decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including Il-1β, Il-6, and Tnf-α (Fig. 5, A–C). In vitro Aβ(1–42) (Anaspec AggreSureTM) challenge of macrophages revealed a similar trend, with statistically significant decreases in CCL2, CXCL10, and CCL5 protein levels (Fig. 5, D–F) in R47H macrophages compared with WT. A decreasing trend in CCL3 and CCL4 was also noted over and above what was observed with control scrambled Aβ(1–42) peptide (data not shown). Similar but less significant trends were observed when microglia were treated with Aβ(1–42), with the most significant changes observed for CCL3 and CCL4 (Fig. S4, A and B). In these instances where we measured protein levels in the conditioned media, an equal number of cells were plated at the start of the experiment, and the cells were grown in complete medium, where similar proliferation curves have been observed for WT and R47H microglia. Hence, it is unlikely that the differences observed can be attributed solely to reduced cell numbers. Further, in at least a few instances, we observed opposite trends for chemokines/cytokines, depending on the challenge administered, supportive of a generally dysregulated inflammatory state conferred by the variant/knockout that manifests differently based on the challenge. Of note, Ccl2 was one of the only chemokines tested that maintained a similar trend with most challenges. Ccl2 was reduced in Trem2−/− and Trem2R47H day 5 BMDM cultures compared with WT, although only the R47H data reached statistical significance (Fig. 4D). A small reduction of CCL2 was also noted in lavage fluid of the peritoneal cavity of knockout mice treated with zymosan (Fig. S4C) and to a lower extent (p > 0.05) in the brains of LPS-treated knockout mice (Fig. S4D). Whereas the Trem2R47H macrophages phenocopy (albeit to a more subtle degree) the Trem2−/− macrophages, the phenotypes cannot be explained simply by a reduction in cell-surface expression of R47H TREM2. WT and Trem2R47H BMDMs appeared to have comparable levels of surface TREM2 expression (Fig. S5, A and C). However, we and others have shown that the R47H variant has impaired ligand sensing/signaling (8.Wang Y. Cella M. Mallinson K. Ulrich J.D. Young K.L. Robinette M.L. Gilfillan S. Krishnan G.M.

To determine whether the defects in proximal signaling and myeloid cell function can be rescued by a pharmacologic agent, we tested commercial and internally generated mouse antibodies in pSyk activation assays and on more distal myeloid cell functioning. We first confirmed the specificity of a commercially available TREM2 antibody (henceforth denoted by antibody 1) by demonstrating a lack of FACS shift compared with isotype control on Trem2−/− BMDMs (Fig. S5B). Next, we demonstrated that the antibody increased pSyk levels in both R47H and WT BMDMs, with the effect being more pronounced in the WT BMDMs (Fig. 6A). The antibody had no effect on the Trem2−/− macrophages, further supportive of specific activation of TREM2 (Fig. 6B). We then determined that the antibody improved survival of Trem2R47H microglia and macrophages (Fig. 6, C and D, green), whereas an equivalent rescue in cell survival was not observed when treated with isotype control antibodies (Fig. 6, C and D, blue). The effect was equally robust when we treated macrophages from aged animals (Fig. 6E). In fact, the antibody was also able to boost the function of WT macrophages and microglia (Fig. S6, A and B) but had no effect on knockout macrophage survival (Fig. S6C). Additionally, the antibody increased migration of microglia toward recombinant C5a (a classic microglial chemoattractant) both with and without aggregated Aβ(1–42) (a putative endogenous ligand) (Fig. 6, F and G). Aβ(1–42) alone did not serve as a chemoattractant in the transwell migration assay (data not shown). It should be noted that the boost in migration reached statistical significance for the R47H microglia only in the presence of Aβ (Fig. 6G, blue bars), whereas the WT microglia showed significantly increased migration under both treatment paradigms (Fig. 6, F and G, black bars). It is also noteworthy that CCL2, a myeloid chemoattractant and the one chemokine whose level was reduced in different treatment conditions, actually increased upon antibody treatment in the Trem2R47H macrophages (Fig. S7, A and B). Additionally, antibody 1 also significantly modified expression levels of genes in module 1 (i.e. the proliferation and survival module) (>50 based on their annotation in the Gene Ontology network) in macrophages. Representative data are shown for Melk, Nek2, and Mmp14 (Fig. S7, C–E). The modulated gene signature is consistent with the antibody suppressing cell death events and promoting proliferation. To determine whether the ability to modulate different aspects of myeloid cell function was unique to antibody 1, we tested another internally generated mouse TREM2 antibody (henceforth referred to as antibody 2) that did not compete with antibody 1 for TREM2 binding and also activated Syk signaling. In this instance, antibody 2 recognized only mouse TREM2. We confirmed by FACS (Fig. S5, C and D) and immunoblotting (Fig. S5E) that antibody 2 did not have any signal in the knockout BMDMs but was able to recognize TREM2 in WT and R47H BMDMs. Antibody 2 was also able to boost survival of both R47H macrophages and microglia (Fig. 7, A and B). Further, as in the case of antibody 1, antibody 2 was also able to boost survival of WT cells (Fig. S6, D and E) but did not impact the survival or rescue survival defects observed in Trem2−/− cells (Fig. S6F). Also, the antibody did not affect migration in any of the genotypes (Fig. 7, C and D). Thus, even a comparison of just two antibodies with putatively different TREM2-binding regions and different properties resulted in different myeloid cell function modulation profiles. In summary, we have generated powerful and specific TREM2 animal models to elucidate the effect of the R47H variant on myeloid cell function and show that pharmacologic agents like antibodies can rescue the loss of function conferred by the variant and even boost WT function. We demonstrate that targeting the Trem2 gene using gene editing allows for specific perturbation of the gene without disrupting other genes in the locus. Both TREM1 and TREM2 signal via DAP12 with probably opposing effects with respect to modulating inflammatory response (pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory) (22.Bouchon A. Dietrich J. Colonna M. Cutting edge: inflammatory responses can be triggered by TREM-1, a novel receptor expressed on neutrophils and monocytes.J.

Hence, we expect that perturbation of multiple genes in the Trem locus as in the Trem2KOMP−/− mice can confound some of the results from mice generated by crossing these knockouts with disease models. Our TREM models will probably not suffer from these complications."

It is unknown if the presence of proprioception deficits is negatively associated with the motor and functional ability of the affected upper extremity and daily living at the chronic stage post-stroke. Aims 1) To describe proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke, 2) to correlate the severity of proprioception deficits with the motor and functional ability of the upper extremity, and 3) to compare independence in basic and instrumental activities in daily living (BADL, IADL), upper extremity motor and functional abilities between individuals with and without proprioception deficits. Methods 102 adults aged 29–85 years with chronic stroke participated in this cross sectional study. The upper extremity was assessed for proprioception (Thumb localization Test), motor [Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA)] and functional ability [Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT)], grip strength and daily use [Motor Activity Log (MAL)]. Independence in BADL and IADL was also assessed. Results 71 participants had intact proprioception, 31 participants had mild-moderate proprioception deficits. Negative significant (p<.001) correlations were found between the severity of proprioception deficits to the motor ability (FMA) (r = -.41), functional ability (ARAT) (r = -.48), dexterity (BBT) (r = -.43), grip strength (r = -.41) and daily-use (MAL amount and quality) (r = -.55 and r = -.54, respectively) of the affected upper extremity. Significant between-group differences were found for BADL, IADL and upper extremity measures. Conclusion Proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke are negatively associated with upper extremity motor and functional abilities and independence in daily living. Therefore, proprioception should be assessed at the chronic stage post-stroke."

Petrie et al. show how the evolution of variable folding conformations of isogenic proteins, which do not differ in their genetic sequences, contributed to λ's ability to exploit an additional host receptor for infection. Because the protein can take on two shapes, this genotype can have two phenotypes.

Data on carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children <5 years and adults >65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults."

These patterns can be analyzed in terms of pairwise combinations between all species comprising a community. Here, we construct a co-occurrence network for abundant microbial species encompassing the three dominant phyla found in human gut. This was followed by an in vitro evaluation of the predicted microbe-microbe co-occurrences, where we chose species pairs Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, as well as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia inulinivorans as model organisms for our study. We then delineate the outcome of the co-cultures when equal distributions of resources were provided. The growth behavior of the co-culture was found to be dependent on the types of microbial species present, their specific metabolic activities, and resulting changes in the culture environment. Through this reductionist approach and using novel in vitro combinations of microbial species under anaerobic conditions, the results of this work will aid in the understanding and design of synthetic community formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2794905676,"The 5' RNA cap structure (m7GpppRNA) is a key feature of eukaryotic mRNAs with important roles in stability, splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA export, and translation. Higher eukaryotes can further modify this minimal cap structure with the addition of a methyl group on the ribose 2'-O position of the first transcribed nucleotide (m7GpppNmpRNA) and sometimes on the adjoining nucleotide (m7GpppNmpNmpRNA). In higher eukaryotes, the DXO protein was previously shown to be responsible for both decapping and degradation of RNA transcripts harboring aberrant 5’ ends such as pRNA, pppRNA, GpppRNA, and surprisingly, m7GpppRNA. It was proposed that the interaction of the cap binding complex with the methylated cap would prevent degradation of m7GpppRNAs by DXO. However, the critical role of the 2’-O-methylation found in higher eukaryotic cap structures was not previously addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that DXO possesses both decapping and exoribonuclease activities toward incompletely capped RNAs, only sparing RNAs with a 2’-O-methylated cap structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy assays also revealed that the presence of the 2’-O-methylation on the cap structure drastically reduces the affinity of DXO for RNA. Moreover, immunofluorescence and structure-function assays also revealed that a nuclear localisation signal is located in the amino-terminus region of DXO. Overall, these results are consistent with a quality control mechanism in which DXO degrades incompletely capped RNAs."

We investigated the association of the MHO phenotype with ischemic stroke.A total of 354,083 adults (age 45.8 ± 14.2 years) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort enrolled in 2004-2008 were followed-up for incident ischemic stroke until 2013. Subjects meeting none of the metabolic syndrome criteria were classified as 'metabolically healthy'. The cohort was categorized into four groups according to obesity and metabolic status: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 4,884 (1.4%) individuals during a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 1.5 years. Stroke incidence rates for the MHNW, MUNW, MHO, and MUO groups were 0.56, 2.61, 0.61, and 2.76 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. While risk for stroke increased significantly in metabolically unhealthy groups, it was not increased in MHO compared to the MHNW group on multivariate analysis. In metabolically healthy individuals, obesity did not increase the risk for ischemic stroke, regardless of the severity of obesity. Meanwhile, in metabolically unhealthy individuals, being obese was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke.MHO individuals were not at increased risk for ischemic stroke. However, obesity increased risk for ischemic stroke in persons with metabolic risk factors; therefore, maintaining normal weight may be more important for this population. Also, metabolic unhealthiness showed greater association than obesity with stroke."

The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the Hypericum genus. Among them, the 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2'-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Polymerase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active compounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the RNase H active site. Furthermore, phloroglucinols compounds, included the newly identified compound, were able to inhibit the HIV-1 replication in cell based assays."
https://openalex.org/W2794457599,"Modulating immune responses to sepsis and trauma remain one of the most difficult challenges in modern medicine. Large burn injuries (LBI) are a severe form of trauma associated with sepsis, immune impairment, and mortality. Immune dysfunction after LBI is complex, involving both enhanced and impaired immune activation. The release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), such as HMGB1, and cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) creates an environment of immune dysfunction often leading to end organ failure and death. Both HMGB1 and IL-1β have been found to play critical roles in sepsis and post-burn immune dysfunction. HMGB1 and IL-1β have been shown previously to form potent complexes in vitro. We recently identified the presence of HMGB1/IL-1β heterocomplexes in human tissue. We now find HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in human and mouse plasma, and identify a synergistic role of HMGB1/IL-1β complexes in post-burn immune dysfunction. In both humans and mice, we found that HMGB1 was enriched in plasma microvesicles (MVs) after LBI. HMGB1 was found form complexes with IL-1β. Using flow cytometry of mouse plasma MVs, we identified an increase in an HMGB1+/IL-1β+ MVs. Using co-IP, HMGB1 was found to bind the pro-form of IL-1β in mouse and human plasma. Pro-IL-1β, which is traditionally considered inactive, became active when complexed with HMGB1. Human THP-1 monocytes treated with HMGB1-pro-IL-1β complexes showed increased transcription of LBI associated cytokines IL-6 and IFNβ along with suppression of iNOS, mimicking findings associated with LBI. These findings identify that HMGB1/IL-1β complexes released after burn injuries can modulate immune responses, and microvesicles are identified as a novel reservoir for these immune mediators. These complexes might serve as novel immune targets for the treatment of systemic immune responses due to LBI or other causes of sepsis."

However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells' treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5. This increase in p-MLC is suppressed by a Rho-kinase (ROCK)-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, the levels of the cytokine correlate with those of LPS in the circulation in three different categories of HIV infected patients (HAART-naïve and HAART-treated HIV-infected individuals, and Elite controls) as well as in healthy controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIV-induced IL-18 plays a role in increased intestinal permeability and microbial translocation observed in HIV-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2795101261,"The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) delivers effectors into eukaryotic host cells or toxins into bacterial competitor for survival and fitness. The T6SS is positively regulated by the threonine phosphorylation pathway (TPP) and negatively by the T6SS-accessory protein TagF. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying TagF-mediated T6SS repression in two distinct bacterial pathogens, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that in A. tumefaciens, T6SS toxin secretion and T6SS-dependent antibacterial activity are suppressed by a two-domain chimeric protein consisting of TagF and PppA, a putative phosphatase. Remarkably, this TagF domain is sufficient to post-translationally repress the T6SS, and this inhibition is independent of TPP. This repression requires interaction with a cytoplasmic protein, Fha, critical for activating T6SS assembly. In P. aeruginosa, PppA and TagF are two distinct proteins that repress T6SS in TPP-dependent and -independent pathways, respectively. P. aeruginosa TagF interacts with Fha1, suggesting that formation of this complex represents a conserved TagF-mediated regulatory mechanism. Using TagF variants with substitutions of conserved amino acid residues at predicted protein–protein interaction interfaces, we uncovered evidence that the TagF–Fha interaction is critical for TagF-mediated T6SS repression in both bacteria. TagF inhibits T6SS without affecting T6SS protein abundance in A. tumefaciens, but TagF overexpression reduces the protein levels of all analyzed T6SS components in P. aeruginosa. Our results indicate that TagF interacts with Fha, which in turn could impact different stages of T6SS assembly in different bacteria, possibly reflecting an evolutionary divergence in T6SS control.

The major targets of T6SS antibacterial effectors include the membrane, cell wall, or nucleic acid; some of these are shared by eukaryote-targeting effectors (e.g. membranes), whereas the latter may have additional targets (e.g. actin cytoskeleton). The delivery and activity of these T6SS toxins and effectors have a clear impact in interbacterial competition and/or pathogenesis during eukaryotic host infection (1Hachani A. Wood T.E. Filloux A.

Three T6SS effectors, including one peptidoglycan amidase (Tae) and two DNases (Tde1 and Tde2), conferring antibacterial activity, have been identified in this bacterium (29Ma L.S. Hachani A.

Autointoxication is prevented through the production of cognate immunity proteins. In A. tumefaciens, TagF and PppA are encoded as a fusion protein named TagF-PppA, the overexpression of which abolishes Hcp secretion (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H. Hsu P.H. Ma L.S. Pang Y.Y. Tsai M.D. Lai E.M. Fha interaction with phosphothreonine of TssL activates type VI secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24626341): e100399110.1371/journal.ppat.1003991Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the TagF-PppA suppression mechanism and how this affects T6SS-dependent secretion and antibacterial activity in A. tumefaciens. Our data indicate that the TagF domain alone is sufficient to post-translationally repress the T6SS independently of TPP. By performing protein–protein interaction studies, we identified that the cytoplasmic T6SS core component Fha is the binding target for TagF. Using structural modeling, we identified conserved TagF amino acid residues and demonstrated their importance in Fha interaction and TagF-mediated repression of T6SS activity. Remarkably, these conserved residues are also required for P. aeruginosa TagF in repressing the H1-T6SS activity and interaction with Fha1. TagF may have evolved while keeping the Fha protein as a target for controlling and preventing T6SS assembly. TPP regulation of T6SS has been demonstrated in only a few bacteria, including A. tumefaciens strain C58 (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H. Hsu P.H. Ma L.S. Pang Y.Y. Tsai M.D. Lai E.M.

Atu4331 is a fusion protein, which contains N- and C-terminal domains homologous to TagF (DUF2094) (aa 11–219) and PppA (aa 244–470), respectively (thus named TagF-PppA) (Fig. 1B) (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H.

We previously reported that TagF-PppA plays a negative role in regulating Hcp secretion when TagF-PppA is overexpressed in A. tumefaciens (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H. Hsu P.H. Ma L.S. Pang Y.Y.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is unknown. Thus, we first investigated the impact and respective role of individual domain from the TagF-PppA chimera on the TagF-PppA–mediated repression activity on T6SS activity. In A. tumefaciens strain C58, we separately produced the TagF domain located at the N terminus (aa 1–230) and the C-terminal region (aa 231–471) encompassing the PppA domain (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of TagF-PppA, TagF, and tagged TagF-Strep in C58 completely abolished type VI secretion (Hcp, Tae, and Tde1) (Fig. 2A). The T6SS antibacterial activity is also shut down, as shown by counting surviving Escherichia coli target cells. The number of survivors is indeed similar to that when the attacker is an A. tumefaciens T6SS mutant, ΔtssL (Fig. 2B). We also performed an in planta interbacterial competition assay with an A. tumefaciens prey strain lacking the three T6SS toxins (Tae, Tde1, and Tde2) and cognate immunity proteins, Δ3Tis (29Ma L.S.

Similarly, here, the survival of Δ3TIs was lower after co-infection with WT C58 harboring the vector pTrc200 (V). This was not seen when co-infecting with a T6SS inactive mutant ΔtssL-carrying pTrc200 (V) or C58 overexpressing the T6SS repressor TagF (i.e. TagF-PppA, TagF, or TagF-Strep) (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, overexpression of PppA alone reduced but did not abolish Hcp secretion (Fig. 2A). The antibacterial activity of the PppA overexpression strain was also not completely abolished, whereas modest antibacterial activity was detected with our in planta interbacterial competition assay (Fig. 2C). In addition, the protein levels of all analyzed T6SS components encoded within the imp (including TssM, TssL, TssK, Fha, TssC41, TssB, and TssA) and hcp (including ClpV and VgrG1) operons remained the same in all backgrounds tested, including overexpression of TagF-PppA, TagF, TagF-Strep, or PppA (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data show that in A. tumefaciens, both TagF and PppA domains contribute the repressor function of TagF-PppA on T6SS effector secretion and antibacterial activity via a post-translational regulatory control.Figure 2Both TagF and PppA domains can repress type VI secretion and antibacterial activity at post-translational levels in A. tumefaciens.

TagF-PppA, TagF, TagF-Strep, and PppA were overexpressed in the ΔtssL mutant also expressing His-tagged TssL (TssL-His). This TssL variant is functional and mediates Hcp, Tae, and Tde1 secretion (Fig. S1, A and B) (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H. Hsu P.H. Ma L.S. Pang Y.Y. Tsai M.D. Lai E.M. Fha interaction with phosphothreonine of TssL activates type VI secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24626341): e100399110.1371/journal.ppat.1003991Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The TssL-His protein was purified by using Ni-NTA resins, and various A. tumefaciens strains were analyzed. The Phos-tag SDS-PAGE approach was used, which can detect two TssL-His protein bands, the lower band representing the unphosphorylated TssL-His and the upper band representing the phosphorylated TssL-His (p-TssL-His in Fig. 3A) (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H. Hsu P.H. Ma L.S. Pang Y.Y. Tsai M.D. Lai E.M. Fha interaction with phosphothreonine of TssL activates type VI secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24626341): e100399110.1371/journal.ppat.1003991Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In all cases, the TssL-His protein displayed a similar phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 3A), which suggests that neither the full-length TagF-PppA nor any domain of TagF-PppA represses T6SS activity by controlling TssL phosphorylation. To determine whether the phosphorylation level detected from an overexpressed TssL-His is representative of an endogenous situation, we generated an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated TssL (pTssL) (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylated TssL protein was detected as a single protein band and found with the same abundance when comparing WT C58 and strains overexpressing TagF-PppA, TagF, TagF-Strep, and PppA. However, the pTssL protein band was not detected in ΔtssL and ΔppkA mutant strains (Fig. 3C). We concluded that TagF-PppA represses T6SS activity independently of TssL phosphorylation in A. tumefaciens. It is intriguing that overexpression of the PppA domain had no impact on TssL phosphorylation, which is mediated by PpkA, but still could repress T6SS activity. To confirm that the TPP-independent repression of both TagF and PppA domains is not caused by a secondary effect linked to overexpression, we also examined the T6SS secretion and antibacterial activity in a strain lacking the entire TPP (i.e. both ppkA and tagF-pppA). We generated a ΔppkAΔtagF-pppA strain and separately overexpressed the TagF or PppA domain in this mutant background. Interestingly, unlike ΔppkA, resulting in decreased type VI secretion (22Lin J.S. Wu H.H. Hsu P.H. Ma L.S. Pang Y.Y. Tsai M.D. Lai E.M. Fha interaction with phosphothreonine of TssL activates type VI secretion in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24626341): e100399110.1371/journal.ppat.1003991Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the ΔppkAΔtagF-pppA mutant retained type VI secretion activity comparable with that of the WT C58 (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of each of TagF or PppA domain in ΔppkAΔtagF-pppA abolished or greatly reduced the type VI secretion (Fig. 4B), suggesting that both TagF and PppA domains can inhibit type VI secretion in the absence of PpkA. As expected, the antibacterial activity was also abolished when the TagF or PppA domain was overexpressed in ΔppkAΔtagF-pppA, as shown by counting E. coli survivors and comparison with what is observed when the attacker is a T6SS mutant, ΔtssL (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, whereas the Hcp and effector (Tde1 and Tae) secretion levels in ΔppkAΔtagF-pppA were comparable with those of WT C58 (Fig. 4A), only partial antibacterial activity was observed (Fig. 4C). This phenotype is consistent with a previous observation in P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens, with ΔpppA showing reduced antibacterial activity despite elevated type VI secretion (20F"
https://openalex.org/W2952781716,"Phytophthora cinnamomi is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a P. cinnamomi infected heathland of Erica umbellata used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing P. cinnamomi foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2794482074,"Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability. Despite the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the discovery of its genetic aberrations, the exact pathogenesis of the DS phenotype has remained largely unexplained. It was recently hypothesized that the DS pathogenesis involves complex (epi)genetic, molecular and cellular determinants. To date, many reports have addressed epigenetic aberrations associated with DS at different developmental stages/ages and tissue types, but to our best knowledge not in DS newborns. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide methylation patterns in DS newborns compared to non-trisomic newborns.We analyzed blood samples obtained from ten newborns with DS and five age-matched non-trisomic newborns. Epigenetic profiles were obtained from extracted DNA using the Illumina Infinium 450K array. Since aberrant blood cell distribution is known to be present in DS, we applied two distinct models: with and without correction for estimated blood cell distribution.Differentially methylated position (DMP) analysis of the uncorrected model detected 19525 significant hits (51,2% hypomethylated). In the corrected model, we found 121953 significant DMPs (49,8% hypomethylated). Independent of the used model we observed a chromosome 21 dosage effect. Moreover, we detected 46 and 145 differentially methylated regions in the uncorrected and corrected model respectively, both showing hypomethylation overrepresentation. Replication analyses of DMPs and DMRs found by Bacalini et al. (2015) showed a large overlap.In this study, we found methylation profile differences between DS newborns and controls reflecting a systematically affected epigenetic profile. The observed chromosome 21 dosage effect suggests the involvement of affected essential regulatory factors/regions or altered expression of chromatin modeling enzymes located on chromosome 21. Additional research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses."

We and others have demonstrated that ERAP1 processes peptides bound to MHC I, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. To this end, we utilized single-chain trimers (SCT) of the ovalbumin-derived epitope SIINFEKL (SL8) tethered to the H2-Kb MHC I determinant from mouse and introduced three substitutions, E63A, K66A, and W167A, at the A-pocket of the peptide-binding groove in the MHC I heavy chain, which interact with the N termini of peptides. These variants significantly decreased SL8-presenting SCT at the cell surface in the presence of ERAP1, but did not affect overall SCT expression, indicating that ERAP1 trims the SL8 N terminus. Comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of WT and three variant SCTs revealed only minor perturbations of the peptide-binding domain in the variants. However, molecular dynamics simulations suggested that SL8 can dissociate partially within a sub-microsecond timescale, exposing its N terminus to the solvent. We also found that the C terminus of MHC I-bound SL8 remains deeply buried in the F-pocket of MHC I. Furthermore, free-energy calculations revealed that the three SCT variants exhibit lower free-energy barriers of N terminus dissociation than the WT Kb Taken together, our results are consistent with a previously observed model in which the partial dissociation of bound peptides from MHC I exposes their N terminus to trimming by ERAP1, whereas their C terminus is anchored at the F-pocket."

MCs store immunoregulatory compounds in their large cytoplasmic granules and, upon stimulation, secrete them via regulated exocytosis. Exocytosis in many cells requires the participation of Munc18 proteins (also known as syntaxin-binding proteins), and we found that mature MCs express all three mammalian isoforms: Munc18-1, -2, and -3. To study their functions in MC effector responses and test the role of MC degranulation in anaphylaxis, we used conditional knockout (cKO) mice in which each Munc18 protein was deleted exclusively in MCs. Using recordings of plasma membrane capacitance for high-resolution analysis of exocytosis in individual MCs, we observed an almost complete absence of exocytosis in Munc18-2–deficient MCs but intact exocytosis in MCs lacking Munc18-1 or Munc18-3. Stereological analysis of EM images of stimulated MCs revealed that the deletion of Munc18-2 also abolishes the homotypic membrane fusion required for compound exocytosis. We confirmed the severe defect in regulated exocytosis in the absence of Munc18-2 by measuring the secretion of mediators stored in MC granules. Munc18-2 cKO mice had normal morphology, development, and distribution of their MCs, indicating that Munc18-2 is not essential for the migration, retention, and maturation of MC-committed progenitors. Despite that, we found that Munc18-2 cKO mice were significantly protected from anaphylaxis.

To accomplish this, MCs release a variety of mediators through several mechanisms, including regulated exocytosis. During exocytosis, the membrane of a secretory vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing its cargo into the extracellular space and translocating proteins associated with or integral to its membrane to the plasma membrane. Regulated exocytosis in MCs (MC degranulation) is characterized by the almost immediate release of mediators that are premade and stored in large secretory vesicles (MC granules), such as histamine, MC proteases, and other enzymes. This requires MC activation by stimuli that usually employ Ca2+ and diacylglycerol as second messengers (3Berridge M.J. Inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol: two interacting second messengers.Annu. Rev.

Degranulation in MCs uses both single-vesicle and compound exocytosis (5Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez J.M. Compound versus multigranular exocytosis in peritoneal mast cells.J. Gen.

In single-vesicle exocytosis, the membrane of a single MC granule fuses with the plasma membrane. In multivesicular compound exocytosis, granules fuse with each other before fusing with the plasma membrane.

Most membrane fusion events in eukaryotes are mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) proteins. The exocytic SNARE proteins include isoforms of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), Syntaxin (Stx), and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), proteins that form a highly stable coiled-coil structure (trans-SNARE complex) that pulls apposing membranes tightly together (8Lin R.C.

The formation and function of the SNARE complex requires the intervention of the Sec1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretory mutant 1)/Munc18 (mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans uncoordinated gene 18) (SM) family of proteins (9Südhof T.C.

Among the seven mammalian SM proteins, Munc18-1, -2, and -3 (encoded by the Stx-binding protein/Stxbp1, Stxbp2, and Stxbp3 genes) participate in several steps of exocytosis. Munc18 locks Stx into a “closed” conformation preventing the formation of productive trans-SNARE complexes (10Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

We conditionally deleted all three isoforms in MCs and observed a failure in regulated exocytosis only in Munc18-2–deficient MCs. The defect was severe—no exocytosis, single or compound, could be detected in mutant MCs—but it did not affect MC differentiation, number, distribution, or granule biogenesis. Finally, these abnormal MC responses had prominent effects on the reactions of mutant mice to systemic anaphylaxis. Using RT-qPCR, we detected expression of the three Munc18 isoforms in mature peritoneal MCs from C57BL/6J mice. Munc18-2 was the predominant isoform (Fig. 1A). To study the function of these three proteins in MC exocytosis, we deleted them selectively in MCs using the Cre-loxP system. We obtained Munc18-1 and Munc18-2 cKO mouse lines and created a Munc18-3 cKO line. We flanked exon 1 of the mouse Stxbp3 gene with two loxP sites (F allele). Removal of this exon by Cre recombinase eliminated the start codon and expression of the protein (Fig. 1B). We crossed Munc18-1F/F, Munc18-2F/F, and Munc18-3F/F mice with B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J mice to generate germ-line deletants (− allele) and with Tg(Cma1-cre)ARoer mice (45Scholten J. Hartmann K.

Our Munc18-3−/− mice were also not viable: multiple crosses among Munc18-3+/− mice produced 171 mice; 35% were Munc18-3+/+, 65% were Munc18-3+/−, and none was Munc18-3−/−. Munc18-3+/−, Munc18-3F/F, and Munc18-3Δ/Δ mice were fertile, had no gross anatomical abnormalities, and had a normal life span in a barrier facility. We used heterozygotes for the three genes to test for haploinsufficiency. RT-qPCR from freshly isolated peritoneal MCs from Munc18-2 and -3 mutant mice showed comparable expression between F/F and +/+ animals and complete deletion in Δ/Δ mice. Also, deletion of these two paralogs did not interfere with the expression of the other Munc18 isoforms (Fig. S1). Immunoblots from peritoneal cell-derived MCs (PCMCs) showed that introduction of the loxP sequences did not alter expression of any Munc18 protein in the three F/F lines compared with +/+ controls (Fig. 1, D–F). Also, all three Δ/Δ mouse lines lacked expression of the targeted Munc18 gene only in MCs, but in other tissues its expression was comparable with that of the corresponding F/F littermates. The disappearance of the immunoblot bands in Δ/Δ MCs proved the specificity of the three antibodies. The fact that MCs express the three Munc18 isoforms provided the opportunity to test their functions simultaneously in one system and to determine whether their roles are unique or redundant.

There were no differences among all genotypes in these two values. We used the gain of Cm over time (Fig. 2, A–C) to calculate the total gain in Cm over baseline (ΔCm) as a measure of the total amount of exocytosis (Fig. 2G). We normalized the curves (Fig. 2, D–F) and derived the rate of gain between 40 and 60% of total ΔCm (Fig. 2H), which corresponds to the maximum speed of exocytosis. We also recorded the time between cell access and the beginning of the rise in Cm to test whether there was any delay between stimulus and response (Fig. 2, I and J). Capacitance measurements can also identify individual fusion events, which register as almost instantaneous steps in ΔCm, with the size of each step proportional to the surface area and thus the volume of each secretory vesicle (5Alvarez de Toledo G.

We have previously shown that ezrin, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A–anchoring protein (AKAP), is up-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis. Phosphorylation of ezrin at Thr-567 activates ezrin and plays an important role in CRC cell survival associated with XIAP and survivin up-regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that in FET and GEO colon cancer cells, knockdown of ezrin expression or inhibition of ezrin phosphorylation at Thr-567 increases apoptosis through protein kinase A (PKA) activation in a cAMP-independent manner. Transforming growth factor (TGF) β signaling inhibits ezrin phosphorylation in a Smad3-dependent and Smad2-independent manner and regulates pro-apoptotic function through ezrin-mediated PKA activation. On the other hand, ezrin phosphorylation at Thr-567 by insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling leads to cAMP-dependent PKA activation and enhances cell survival. Further studies indicate that phosphorylated ezrin forms a complex with PKA RII, and dephosphorylated ezrin dissociates from the complex and facilitates the association of PKA RII with AKAP149, both of which activate PKA yet lead to either cell survival or apoptosis. Thus, our studies reveal a novel mechanism of differential PKA activation mediated by TGFβ and IGF1R signaling through regulation of ezrin phosphorylation in CRC, resulting in different cell fates. This is of significance because TGFβ and IGF1R signaling pathways are well-characterized tumor suppressor and oncogenic pathways, respectively, with important roles in CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our studies indicate that they cross-talk and antagonize each other's function through regulation of ezrin activation. Therefore, ezrin may be a potential therapeutic target in CRC.

We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. ""SUCCESS"" (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1-8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release.

Both arms showed improved viral load suppression.There was a trend towards increased retention for PLWH released from jail after SUCCESS, compared to usual services.

https://openalex.org/W2795286392,"Influenza vaccination can prevent influenza and potentially serious influenza-related complications. Although the single best way to prevent influenza is annual vaccination, everyday preventive actions, including good hygiene, health, dietary, and social habits, might help, too. Several preventive measures are recommended, including: avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick; covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing your hands often; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and practicing other good health habits like cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, getting plenty of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Understanding public acceptance and current usage of these preventive behaviors can be useful for planning both seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention campaigns. This study estimated the percentage of adults in the United States who reported practicing preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza, and explored associations of reported behaviors with sociodemographic factors.We analyzed data from 2015 National Internet Flu Survey, a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population ≥18 years. The self-reported behaviors used to avoid catching or spreading influenza were grouped into four and three non-mutually exclusive subgroups, respectively. Weighted proportions were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts."

Further results showed that the activation of primordial follicles induced by CRS was involved in the increasing expression level of Kit ligand and its receptor Kit and the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide released due to stress, which plays an important role in regulating follicle development. A high level of serum CRH was detected in the CRS mouse model, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the mRNA level of its main receptor CRHR1increased in the ovaries of the CRS mouse group. Moreover, 100nM CRH significantly improved the activation of primordial follicles in newborn mouse ovaries in vitro. These results demonstrated that CRS could induce immoderate activation of primordial follicles accompanied by the activation of Kit-PI3K signaling, in which CRH might be an important endocrine factor."
https://openalex.org/W2795184788,"A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2795205220,"Epidemiological studies have revealed that noise exposure was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the exact nature of that association remains to be elucidated. The present study is designed to examine the effects of chronic noise exposure on the development of T2DM in combination with a high-fat-diet (HFD) in mice. Here we show that chronic noise exposure at 85 dB SPL (4 h /day, below the safety limit for occupational noise exposure) exaggerated multiple metabolic abnormalities induced by HFD in C57BL/6J male mice, including worsened glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, noise exposure exhibited a paradoxical impact on fat accumulation and circulating levels of free fatty acid, indicating a potential stimulating effect of noise on lipolysis. These results provide first in vivo supporting evidence for the causative role of noise exposure in diabetogenesis and pinpoint a noise-associated increase in blood free fatty acid levels as a possible mediator accelerating the effect of noise on the development of insulin resistance and T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2795320703,"The biomechanical properties of extracellular matrices (ECMs) are critical to many biological processes, including cell-cell communication and cell migration and function. The correct balance between stiffness and elasticity is essential to the function of numerous tissues, including blood vessels and the lymphatic system, and depends on ECM constituents (the matrisome) and on their level of interconnection. However, despite its physiological relevance, the matrisome composition and organization remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that the ADAMTS-like protein Lonely heart (Loh) is critical for recruiting the type IV collagen-like protein Pericardin to the cardiac ECM. Here, we utilized Drosophila as a simple and genetically amenable invertebrate model for studying Loh-mediated recruitment of tissue-specific ECM components such as Pericardin to the ECM. We focused on the functional relevance of distinct Loh domains to protein localization and Pericardin recruitment. Analysis of Loh deletion constructs revealed that one thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1-1), which has an embedded WXXW motif, is critical for anchoring Loh to the ECM. Two other thrombospondin repeats, TSR1-2 and TSR1-4, the latter containing a CXXTCXXG motif, appeared to be dispensable for tethering Loh to the ECM but were crucial for proper interaction with and recruitment of Pericardin. Moreover, our results also suggested that Pericardin in the cardiac ECM primarily ensures the structural integrity of the heart, rather than increasing tissue flexibility. In conclusion, our work provides new insights into the roles of thrombospondin type 1 repeats and advances our understanding of cardiac ECM assembly and function."
https://openalex.org/W2794600378,"Control and synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems have attracted wide attention due to their numerous potential applications. To get suitable control method and parameters for fractional-order chaotic systems, the stability analysis of time-varying fractional-order systems should be discussed in the first place. Therefore, this paper analyzes the stability of the time-varying fractional-order systems and presents a stability theorem for the system with the order 0<α<1. This theorem is a sufficient condition which can discriminate the stability of time-varying systems conveniently. Feedback controllers are designed for control and synchronization of the fractional-order Lü chaotic system. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theorem."
https://openalex.org/W2794648334,"The copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A contains eight transmembrane domains and is required for normal human copper homeostasis. Mutations in the ATP7A gene may lead to infantile-onset cerebral degeneration (Menkes disease); occipital horn syndrome (OHS), a related but much milder illness; or an adult-onset isolated distal motor neuropathy. The ATP7A missense mutation T994I is located in the sixth transmembrane domain of ATP7A, represents one of the variants associated with the latter phenotype, and is associated with an abnormal interaction with p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), a hexameric AAA ATPase (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) with multiple biological functions. In this study, we further characterized this interaction and discovered a concealed UBX domain in the third lumenal loop of ATP7A, between its fifth and sixth transmembrane domains. We show that the T994I substitution results in conformational exposure of the UBX domain, which then binds the N-terminal domain of p97/VCP. We also show that this abnormal interaction occurs at or near the cell plasma membrane. The UBX domain has a conserved hydrophobic FP (Phe-Pro) motif, and substitution with di-alanine abrogated the interaction and restored the proper intracellular localization of ATP7A in the trans-Golgi network. Using protein MS, we identified potential coordinating components of the ATP7AT994I–p97 complex, including NSFL1 cofactor (NSF1C or p47) that may be relevant to the pathophysiology and clinical effects associated with ATP7AT994I. Our study represents the first report of p97/VCP binding to a UBX domain that is not normally exposed, resulting in an aberrant protein–protein interaction leading to motor neuron degeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2794581573,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects besides muscle also the brain, resulting in memory and behavioral problems. The consequences of dystrophinopathy on gross macroscopic alterations are unclear. To elucidate the effect of full-length dystrophin expression on brain morphology, we used high-resolution post-mortem MRI in mouse models that either express 0% (mdx), 100% (BL10) or a low amount of full-length dystrophin (mdx-XistΔhs). While absence or low amounts of full-length dystrophin did not significantly affect whole brain volume and skull morphology, we found differences in volume of individual brain structures. The results are in line with observations in humans, where whole brain volume was found to be reduced only in patients lacking both full-length dystrophin and the shorter isoform Dp140."
https://openalex.org/W2794889614,"Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years."
https://openalex.org/W2795295983,"Commercial hunting for the international trade in animal hides in the 20th century decimated many populations of aquatic wildlife in Amazonia. However, impacts varied significantly between different species and regions, depending upon hunting intensity, accessibility of habitat, and the inherent resilience of various species and their habitats. We investigated the differential responses of two Amazonian Mustelid species, the neotropical otter and giant otter, to commercial hunting pressure along the upper Rio Negro in Brazil, and examined historical factors that influenced spatial and temporal variation in commercial exploitation. We analyzed previously unanalyzed data from historical records of hide shipments to track changes in hide sales and prices for the two species in the late 20th century. We also gathered oral histories from older Baniwa people who had witnessed or participated in commercial otter hunting. These complimentary data sources reveal how intrinsic biological and social characteristics of the two otter species interacted with market forces and regional history. Whereas giant otter populations were driven to local or regional extinction during the late 20th century by commercial hunting, neotropical otters persisted. In recent decades, giant otter populations have returned to some parts of the upper Rio Negro, a development which local people welcome as part of a generalized recovery of the ecosystems in their territory as a result of the banning of animal pelt exports and indigenous land demarcation. This paper expands the scope of the field historical ecology and reflects on the role of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2794590378,"Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells' physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2795229888,"Background The burden of medically-attended acute gastro-enteritis (MA-AGE) that can be attributed to norovirus is not well established in Japan. Using a nationwide database of medical care insurance claims, we estimated the incidence of medically-attended norovirus-attributable gastroenteritis (MA-NGE) in Japan. Methods The incidences of MA-NGE outpatient consultations or hospitalization in Japan were modelled on seasonal patterns of MA-AGE for unspecified causes derived from the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) database for the period July 2007 to June 2015. Results Mean age-adjusted annual incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years) of MA-NGE associated with outpatient care or hospitalization were 389 (95% CI 269–558) and 13 (95% CI 9–20), respectively. Highest rates were in children under 5 years of age: 1,569 (95% CI 1,325–1,792) for outpatient consultations and 48 (95% CI 39–56) for hospitalizations. Of all gastroenteritis episodes associated with outpatient care or hospitalization, 29% and 31% were attributed to norovirus, respectively. Norovirus was estimated to be responsible for 4,964,000 outpatient visits (95% CI 3,435,000–7,123,000) and 171,000 hospitalizations (95% CI 110,000–251,000) per year across Japan. Conclusions Incidence rates of MA-AGE are high in Japan, and norovirus-attributable disease is at least as high as in some other developed countries."
https://openalex.org/W2794531841,"CD34+/CD133+- cells are a bone marrow derived stem cell population, which presumably contain vascular progenitor cells and are associated with improved vascular repair. In this study, we investigated whether the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular adhesion molecule-1), E-selectin und L-selectin, which are involved in homing of vascular stem cells, are upregulated by CD34+/CD133+-stem cells from septic patients and would be associated with improved clinical outcome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with (n = 30) and without sepsis (n = 10), and healthy volunteers (n = 15) were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and L-selectin was detected on CD34+/CD133+-stem cells by flow cytometry. The severity of disease was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II. Serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 were determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and L-selectin by CD34+/CD133+-stem cells was significantly upregulated in septic patients, and correlated with sepsis severity. Furthermore, high expression of VCAM-1 by CD34+/CD133+-stem cells revealed a positive association with mortalitiy (p<0.05). Furthermore, significantly higher serum concentrations of VEGF and Ang-2 were found in septic patients, however none showed a strong association with survival. Our data suggest, that VCAM-1 upregulation on CD34+/CD133+-stem cells could play a crucial role in their homing in the course of sepsis. An increase in sepsis severity resulted in both and increase in CD34+/CD133+-stem cells and VCAM-1-expression by those cells, which might reflect an increase in need for vascular repair."
https://openalex.org/W2794753797,"Background With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status. Methods We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition. We first adopted a logistic regression approach to screen for a composite neonatal morbidity, low and high body fat (BF%) infants. We then developed linear regression models for the estimation of neonatal fat mass as an assessment of body composition and nutritional status. Results We fitted logistic regression models combining up to four anthropometric variables to predict composite morbidity and low and high BF% neonates. The greatest area under receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for identifying composite morbidity was 0.740 (0.63, 0.85), resulting from the combination of birthweight, length, chest and mid-thigh circumferences. The AUCs (95% CI) for identifying low and high BF% were 0.827 (0.78, 0.88) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88), respectively. For identifying composite morbidity, BF% as measured via air displacement plethysmography showed strong predictive ability (AUC 0.786 (0.70, 0.88)), while birthweight percentiles had a lower AUC (0.695 (0.57, 0.82)). Birthweight percentiles could also identify low and high BF% neonates with AUCs of 0.792 (0.74, 0.85) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88). We applied a sex-specific approach to anthropometric estimation of neonatal fat mass, demonstrating the influence of the testing sample size on the final model performance. Conclusions These models display potential for further development and evaluation in LMICs to detect infants in need of further nutritional management, especially where traditional methods of risk management such as birthweight for gestational age percentiles may be variable or non-existent, or unable to detect appropriately grown, low fat newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2795018875,"Dromedaries are capable of digesting plant cell wall with high content of lignocellulose of poor digestibility. Consequently, their intestinal microbiota can be a source of novel carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To the best of our knowledge, no data are available describing the biochemical analysis of enzymes in dromedary intestinal microbiota. To investigate new hydrolytic enzymes from the dromedary gut, a fosmid library was constructed using metagenomic DNA from feces of non-domestic adult dromedary camels living in the Tunisian desert. High-throughput functional screening of 13756 clones resulted in 47 hit clones active on a panel of various chromogenic and non-chromogenic glycan substrates. Two of them, harboring multiple activities, were retained for further analysis. Clone 26H3 displayed activity on AZO-CM-cellulose, AZCL Carob galactomannan and Tween 20, while clone 36A23 was active on AZCL carob galactomannan and AZCL barley β-glucan. The functional annotation of their sequences highlighted original metagenomic loci originating from bacteria of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, involved in the metabolization of mannosides and β-glucans thanks to a complete battery of endo- and exo-acting glycoside hydrolases, esterases, phosphorylases and transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2794584441,"Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal hunchback (hb) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal bicoid (bcd) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of bcd in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of bcd mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of bcd mRNA in testes."
