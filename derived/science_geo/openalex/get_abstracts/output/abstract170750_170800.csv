https://openalex.org/W2055063491,"Proapoptotic proteins such as Bax, undergo translocation to the mitochondria during apoptosis, where they mediate the release of intermembrane space proteins including cytochromec. Bax binds to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). VDAC is a β-barrel protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In planar lipid bilayers, Bax and VDAC form a channel through which cytochrome c can pass. Hexokinase II (HXK II) also binds to VDAC. HXK II catalyzes the first step of glycolysis and is highly expressed in transformed cells, where over 70% of it is bound to the mitochondria. The present study demonstrates that HXK II interferes with the ability of Bax to bind to mitochondria and release cytochrome c. Detachment of HXK II from the mitochondria-enriched fraction isolated from HeLa cells promoted the binding of recombinant Bax-Δ19 and subsequent cytochromec release. Similarly, the addition of recombinant HXK II to the mitochondria-enriched fraction isolated from hepatocytes, cells that do not express HXK II endogenously, prevented the ability of recombinant Bax-Δ19 to bind to the mitochondria and promote cytochrome c release. Similar results were found in intact cells, in which the detachment of mitochondrial bound HXK II or its overexpression potentiated and inhibited, respectively, Bax-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.

The major emphasis of apoptosis research was initially focused on the nucleus. This is understandable, given that the nucleus exhibits some of the most striking features of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and oligonucleosomal fragmentation of DNA. Recently, however, the involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis has come under close scrutiny. Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell, providing the bulk of ATP production for cellular metabolism.

Subsequently, a plethora of other proteins that are located in the mitochondrial IMS and are part of the apoptotic machinery have been discovered, including apoptosis-inducing factor, SMAC/DIABLO, caspases 9 and 8, and endonuclease G (6Krajewski S.

Disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane is one obvious mechanism. Due to the greater surface area of the inner mitochondrial membrane compared with the outer mitochondrial membrane, excessive swelling of the mitochondrial matrix results in rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of intermembrane space proteins. Indeed, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with subsequent mitochondrial depolarization and outer mitochondrial membrane rupture does occur in some forms of apoptosis (9Wilson M.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The permeability transition pore is a large proteinaceous pore that spans both mitochondrial membranes (10Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In some instances, inhibition of pore opening prevents many of the typical manifestations of apoptosis and preserves cell viability (11Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Decaudin D.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, in many cases of apoptosis, mitochondrial depolarization and swelling occur as late events, well after the release of cytochrome c and other IMS proteins has occurred (14Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 15Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In such cases, the release of IMS proteins appears to be more selective and not due to a wholesale disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, in both instances, the Bcl-2 family of proteins appears to play a key role in the control of outer membrane permeability. The penultimate family member, Bcl-2, was discovered to be overexpressed in a B-cell lymphoma due to a t(11;14)(q23;32) chromosomal translocation (16Akao Y. Seto M. Takahashi T. Kubonishi I. Miyoshi I. Nakazawa S. Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Ueda R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1574-1576PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there are 14 known human homologs of Bcl-2 family proteins that have been localized to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (17Reed J.C. Miyashita T. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Sato T. Krajewski S. Aime-Sempe C. Bodrug S. Kitada S. Hanada M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). At the mitochondria, Bcl-2 proteins can either inhibit or induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are the best studied members of the family that inhibit cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The proteins share considerable homologies in four consensus regions known as BH 1–4. Bcl-XL has been demonstrated to interact through its BH 4 domain with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (18Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). VDAC (porin) is a β-barrel protein that spans the outer mitochondrial membrane (19Colombini M. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 169-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Mannella C.A. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). VDAC mediates ATP and ADP translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) mediating transport across the inner membrane. Like Bcl-XL, Bax has been demonstrated to interact with VDAC (21Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Bcl-XL, Bax induces cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Bax translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria following an apoptotic stimulus (22Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 23Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A., Xi, X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Like Bcl-XL, Bax possesses BH 1–3 regions. However, unlike Bcl-XL, reconstitution experiments demonstrated that Bax forms a high conductance channel with VDAC in planar lipid bilayers, which allow the passage of cytochromec. For over 70 years, it has been known that tumor cells exhibit a high rate of glycolysis. The high glycolytic rate is now known to be due in part to the greatly increased expression of hexokinase II (HXK II) in transformed cells (24Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In an ATP-dependent process, HXK II mediates the first step of glycolysis, phosphorylating glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. In transformed cells, up to 70% of the HXK II is bound to the mitochondria through an interaction with VDAC (25Forte M. Adelsberger-Mangan D. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Nakashima R.A. Mangan P.S. Colombini M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this localization, HXK II gains preferential access to mitochondria-produced ATP (28Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The availability of mitochondria-generated ATP to VDAC-bound HXK II enables the cells to maintain a much greater rate of glycolysis (29Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This state of cellular metabolism has been termed aerobic glycolysis. Because both Bax and HXK II bind to mitochondria through an interaction with VDAC, we wanted to determine whether the high levels of mitochondrial bound HXK II found in transformed cells had any effect on the ability of Bax to induce apoptosis. In the present studies, we determined that the binding of HXK II to mitochondria prevents recombinant Bax-Δ19-induced cytochromec release and induction of apoptosis. In particular, we demonstrate that dissociation of mitochondrial bound HXK II increases the binding of Bax-Δ19 to the mitochondria-enriched fraction and promotes cytochrome c release. Furthermore, recombinant HXK II was found to inhibit Bax-Δ19 induced cytochrome crelease in the mitochondria-enriched fraction isolated from hepatocytes, a cell that does not express endogenous HXK II. In addition, we show that in intact cells, detachment of mitochondrial bound HXK II results in a potentiation of apoptosis by an agent that induces Bax translocation to the mitochondria and that overexpression of HXK II protects against the induction of Bax-dependent apoptosis. HeLa cells (ATCC-CC-1; American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 25-cm2 flasks (Corning Costar Corp., Oneonta, NY) with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, all incubated under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were utilized for transient transfection studies. Transfections were performed using Trans-IT transfection reagent (PanVera) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies of 50–60% were routinely obtained as assessed by β-galactosidase staining. For experiments, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCDNA-LacZ in combination with pCDNA-Bax and/or pCDNA-HXK II (kindly provided by Dr. John E. Wilson, Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University). In all cases, the plasmid concentrations were kept to a total of 1.5 μg. HeLa cells were incubated in 500 μl of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 1.88 cm2 wells of a 24 well plate at a final cell density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well. Prior to treatment, HeLa cells were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), after which 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum was added to the wells. Cell viability was determined by the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue. 10 μl of a 0.5% solution of trypan blue was added to the wells. Both viable and nonviable cells were counted for each data point in a total of eight microscopic fields. Cell viability was also measured using the plasma membrane impermeable, dimeric cyanine dye, YOYO-1 (30Becker B. Clapper J. Harkins K.R. Olson J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). YOYO-1 fluoresces brightly only when bound to nucleic acids. Cells are incubated with YOYO-1 before and after the addition of digitonin. Fluorescence before digitonin addition originates from dying cells that have lost plasma membrane integrity and take up YOYO-1. HeLa cells were exposed to various conditions in 24-well plates as described in the legend to Fig. 5. YOYO-1 was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. At various time points, the fluorescence of the wells was measured on a Molecular Probes microplate reader at 485-nm excitation and 538-nm emission. At the end of the experiments, digitonin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, which permeabilized 100% of the cells as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Viability was calculated as V = 100 − (100 × (F b −F o)/(F a −F o)), where V is the percentage of viable cells in the well, F a is the fluorescence after the addition of digitonin, F b is the fluorescence before digitonin, and F o is the fluorescence of YOYO-1 in media alone. The YOYO-1 fluorescence measurement of cell viability gave results similar to that of trypan blue dye exclusion. Please note that both of these assays only measure cell viability and are not intended to differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 15 amino acids of hexokinase II were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA) utilizing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (MIASHLLAYFFTELN-amide, hexokinase II VDAC binding domain peptide; HXK2VBD). Another batch of the peptide was synthesized that contained the N-terminal 15 amino acids fused to the internalization sequence of antennapedia, thus allowing internalization of the peptide into intact cells (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKMIASHLLAYFFTELN-amide) termed cell-permeable HXK2VBD (31Holinger E.P. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13298-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Both peptides were biotin-labeled to monitor cellular uptake. Cells were plated at a density of 54,000 cells/cm2 in either 24-well plates used for the determination of cell viability or 25-cm2 flasks used for isolating the mitochondria-enriched fraction and analyzing DNA fragmentation. HeLa cells were washed once with PBS and placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then either left alone or pretreated for 30 min with clotrimazole (20 μm; Sigma) or 100 μm of cell-permeable HXK2VBD. Following preincubation, the cells were then either left alone or treated with 50 μm indomethacin (Sigma) for the time periods indicated in the figures. For this assay, cells in 24-well plates at a final density of 1.0 × 105cells/well were used. The assay is based on the ability of the active enzyme to cleave the chromophore p-nitroanilide from the enzyme substrate Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide. Following treatment, the medium was removed and spun down to harvest any detached and dying cells. The remaining cells were scraped and combined with detached cells. Cell extracts were prepared and diluted 1:1 with 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance measurements were made in a 96-well plate reader at 405 nm. Treated and untreated cells in 25-cm2 flasks were collected in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and washed once with 1 ml of 0.02% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+ or Mg2+. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g, and then 40 μl of TE lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm sodium-EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 was added along with 5 μl of an RNase A solution (20 mg/ml) (Sigma). The mixture was suspended by gentle vortex mixing and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Then 5 μl of a proteinase K solution (20 mg/ml) (Sigma) was added to the sample and incubated an additional 20 min or until the solution cleared. A 6× loading buffer (5 μl of 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF, 30% glycerol) was added to 25 μl of the sample. The sample was then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose minigel in TE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 1–4 h at 36 V. Ethidium bromide-stained DNA was visualized by transillumination with UV light (300 nm) and photographed (5Martinou I. Desagher S. Eskes R. Antonsson B. Andre E. Fakan S. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks and used at a final density of 1.35 × 106 cells/flask. Following treatment, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once in PBS and then resuspended in 3 volumes of isolation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin) in 250 mm sucrose. After chilling on ice for 3 min, the cells were disrupted by 40 strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 1500 ×g at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondria-enriched fraction (heavy membrane fraction) was then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The endoplasmic reticulum containing the top fluffy layer was removed from the high speed pellet. In addition, mitochondrial integrity was determined by the respiratory control ratio as oxygen consumption in states 3 and 4 of respiration using a Clark oxygen electrode with glutamate and malate as respiratory substrates. The supernatant was removed and filtered through 0.2-μm and then 0.1-μm Ultrafree MC filters (Millipore Corp.) to give cytosolic protein. For determination of cytochrome c release and Bax binding in intact cells, mitochondria-enriched fractions and cytosolic fractions were normalized for protein content (25 μg/lane) and run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with antibodies to cytochrome oxidase (1:500; Molecular Probes) and α-tubulin (1:500; Transduction Laboratories) to evaluate equal loading. Hepatocytes were isolated from rat liver. For hepatocytes, the mitochondria-enriched fraction was isolated following the same protocol used for isolation of the HeLa cell mitochondria-enriched fraction. HeLa cells were transfected using Trans-IT transfection reagent with a 1 μm concentration of the antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, 5′-tgctccccggacccgtccat-3′, targeted against the first 20 nucleotides of the coding region of the RNA sequence 1–20 of human Bax. As a control, a 1 μmconcentration of the corresponding sense oligonucleotides was transfected. The mitochondria-enriched fraction, at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in a volume of 250 μl, was incubated in a KCl-based medium, respiratory buffer (150 mm KCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Glutamate and malate (1 mm; Sigma) were added as respiratory substrates. To induce detachment of the mitochondrial bound HXK II, the mitochondria-enriched fraction was preincubated in media that contained either clotrimazole (20 μm), glucose 6-phosphate (1 mm) or a 100 μm concentration of a peptide corresponding to the 15 N-terminal amino acids of hexokinase II (HX2VBD). Following a 30-min preincubation, the mitochondria-enriched fraction was either left untreated or treated with Bax-Δ19 at a final concentration of 1 μm. For the determination of cytochrome c release, the mitochondria-enriched fraction was first pelleted at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0.2-μm and then through a 0.1-μm Ultrafree MC filter and concentrated in a Microcon concentrator (molecular mass cut-off, 30 kDa) to 100 μl. (Millipore). Mitochondrial pellets were normalized for protein content (25 μg/lane) and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Afterward, the gels were stripped and reprobed with an antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to the integral inner membrane protein cytochrome oxidase. 20 μl of the supernatant fraction was combined with SDS loading buffer and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Cytochrome c was detected by a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome c (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Bax-Δ19 binding was detected with a monoclonal antibody to Bax that binds to the N terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As a control, the pore-forming peptide alamethacin (final concentration of 60 μg/ml) was added to mitochondria to permeabilize the outer membrane and cause maximal release of cytochrome c. Hepatocytes express no hexokinase II. Therefore, the mitochondria-enriched fraction that was isolated from hepatocytes was utilized in experiments to determine the effect of adding recombinant hexokinase II (HXK II) and truncated hexokinase II (tHXK II) on Bax-Δ19 induced cytochrome c release. As above for HeLa cells, the hepatocyte mitochondria-enriched fraction was placed in a KCl-based medium with glutamate and malate as respiratory substrates. The hepatocyte mitochondria-enriched fraction (0.5 mg/ml final concentration) was then incubated with either HXK II or tHXK II in 250 μl of respiratory buffer. HXK II and tHXK II were added at a final concentration of 250 milliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein. The specific activity of HXK II and tHXK II used is 63 milliunits/μg of protein and 58 milliunits/μg of protein, respectively. After 30 min, the hepatocyte mitochondria were either left untreated or treated with a final concentration of 1 μm Bax-Δ19. The mitochondria-enriched fraction was pelleted, and the mitochondrial and supernatant fractions were treated as above with HeLa cell mitochondria for determination of cytochrome c release and Bax-Δ19 binding. Binding studies for HXK II and Bax-Δ19 were conducted as outlined above using varying concentrations of HXK II and a fixed concentration of Bax-Δ19(1 μm). HXK II binding was quantitated enzymatically (a milliunit being the amount of enzyme that will convert 1 nmol of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate in 1 min), and Bax-Δ19 binding was assessed by densitometry of Western blots. Recombinant Bax was isolated and purified as described previously (32Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Rothman R.J. Marcineviciute A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31734-31739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Full-length Bax is insoluble; therefore, PCR was used to generate a human Bax cDNA that lacked the coding region for the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids. The resulting cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in frame with GST. The plasmid (pGEXBaxΔ19) was used to transform the protease-deficient strain ofE. coli, BL21. An overnight culture of bacteria was used to inoculate (1:10) 2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C. When theA 600 was between 0.7 and 1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the bacteria were incubated for an additional 3 h. The cells were lysed with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was then sonicated briefly on ice and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 8 h. The resin was washed with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The resin containing the bound GST-BaxΔ19 was incubated with 10 units of thrombin in PBS overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The released Bax was then purified on a MonoQ column using a linear gradient of 0.5 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate with protease inhibitors, pH 5.0, and the detergent was removed using Extracti-Gel D detergent removal gel (Pierce). The resulting eluate was concentrated in a Micron concentrator (molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa) (Millipore). The cDNA of HXK II was fused to GST for expression and purification using methods similar to that described above for Bax expression and purification. Truncated HXK II (tHXK II), lacking the N-terminal 15 amino acids, was generated by using PCR to eliminate the first 45 nucleotides in the cDNA of full-length HXK II. The resulting construct was sequenced to verify the changes made. As a mock control, GST-LacZ was subjected to the same purification protocol as GST-BaxΔ19. The purified LacZ had no effect on the mitochondrial preparation, a result indicating that the action of Bax-Δ19 was not due to a contaminant of the purification process. The mitochondria-enriched fraction was isolated from HeLa cells and found to possess significant amounts of mitochondrial bound HXK II (Fig.1 A, lane 1). Clotrimazole (CTZ), an imidazole-based compound, has been shown to release mitochondrial bound HXK II in B16 melanoma cells (33Penso J. Beitner R. Eur. J.

As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A, lane 2, the addition of 20 μm of CTZ to the mitochondrial fraction isolated from HeLa cells caused an almost complete release of HXK II from the mitochondrial fraction to the supernatant. The product of HXK II, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), causes its dissociation from mitochondria (34Ardehali H. Printz R.L. Whitesell R.R. May J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

As expected, treatment of the HeLa cell mitochondria-enriched fraction with 1 mm of G6P also caused the release of mitochondrial bound HXK II (Fig.1 A, lane 3). The N-terminal 15 amino acids of HXK II are necessary and sufficient for it to bind to VDAC. Therefore, we synthesized a peptide comprising the N-terminal 15 amino acids of HXK II (hexokinase II VDAC binding domain; HXK2VBD). HXK2VBD was able to release mitochondrial bound HXK II. As demonstrated in Fig.1 A, lane 4, incubation with 100 μm of HXK2VBD resulted in an almost complete release of HXK II from the HeLa cell mitochondria. We next wanted to determine whether detachment of HXK II from mitochondria modified their interaction with Bax. Recombinant Bax-Δ19 was added to the isolated HeLa cell mitochondria-enriched fraction. The mitochondrial fraction was then pelleted and washed. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 B, lane 1, the addition of Bax-Δ19 at a final concentration of 1 μm resulted in little binding of Bax-Δ19 to the HeLa cell mitochondria-enriched fraction, with most of it remaining in the supernatant. Conversely, when the mitochondria-enriched fraction was pretreated with CTZ, G6P, or HXK2VBD, agents that release mitochondrial bound HXK II, significant binding of Bax-Δ19 to the HeLa cell mitochondria-en"

The adaptor protein Tollip was identified initially as an intermediate in interleukin (IL)-1 signaling. Here we report that Tollip also associates directly with TLR2 and TLR4 and plays an inhibitory role in TLR-mediated cell activation. Inhibition by Tollip is mediated through its ability to potently suppress the activity of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) after TLR activation. In addition, we show for the first time that Tollip is a bona fidesubstrate for IRAK and is phosphorylated by IRAK upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or IL-1. Negative regulation of TLR signaling by Tollip may therefore serve to limit the production of proinflammatory mediators during inflammation and infection.

In addition to playing a critical role in the dorso-ventral axis formation in insects, TLRs are also involved in innate immunity and disease resistance (2Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin.

Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). In mammals, 10 members of the TLR family have been identified which are expressed by host immune cells most likely to come into direct contact with pathogens from the environment, such as dendritic cells, peripheral phagocytes, and mucosal epithelia (5Muzio M. Polentarutti N. Bosisio D. Prahladan M.K. Mantovani A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that a striking feature of TLRs is their ability to discriminate among different classes of pathogens (3Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 4Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). For example, TLR4 detects lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, whereas TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoproteins, and zymosan from Gram-positive bacteria and yeast. TLRs alone or in combination are believed to mediate host immune responses to a large array of pathogens (6Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). In addition to detecting exogenous stimuli, TLRs are also able to trigger cell activation in response to endogenous signals, such as heat shock protein 60 (7), fibronectin (8Okamura Y. Watari M.

Activation of TLRs by endogenous ligands presumably provides immune surveillance at sites of inflammation, but sustained activation may lead to development of chronic inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases.

Because TIR domains of TLRs, IL-1R, and IL-18R are highly homologous, it is believed that these receptors activate similar signaling pathways when stimulated with their cognate ligands (1O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the downstream signaling components, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) are all utilized by these three groups of receptors to activate both nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades (12Burns K.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). MyD88 functions as a crucial adaptor that links the receptors to IRAK after activation. IRAK in turn is phosphorylated, dissociates from the receptor, and associates with TRAF6 to signal activation of either NF-κB or mitogen-activated protein kinases. However, genetic studies revealed that neither MyD88 (17Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), IRAK (18Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) is absolutely essential for cell activation in response to stimulation with LPS, implying the existence of alternative signaling pathways. The recent description of TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) (20Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), also known as Mal (MyD88 adaptor-like) (21Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), probably explains the residual signaling observed in the absence of MyD88. Interestingly TIRAP/Mal also appears to be involved in signaling through TLR4 but not IL-1, thereby demonstrating a unique specificity in the adaptor molecules that participate in signaling. In addition to MyD88, another adaptor protein named Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) was recently found to associate with the cytoplasmic TIR domain of IL-1Rs after IL-1 stimulation (22Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Tollip forms a complex with IRAK in resting cells and inhibits IL-1-induced signaling by blocking IRAK phosphorylation. Because of the significant homology in the intracellular portion of TLRs, IL-1R, and IL-18R, we hypothesized that Tollip might also inhibit TLR-mediated signaling by interacting with TLRs through the TIR domain. Here we report that Tollip associates directly with TLR2 and TLR4 and inhibits TLR-mediated cellular responses by suppressing phosphorylation and kinase activity of IRAK. Furthermore, we find that Tollip is phosphorylated by activated IRAK, making it the first direct substrate for IRAK to be characterized. Human embryonic kidney epithelial 293 cells stably expressing the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter pBIIX-Luc (293-Luc) were developed as described previously (23Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Carothers J. Xiao C. Douglas I. Janeway C.A. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2059-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both cell lines were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4, PGN fromStaphylococcus aureus, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and M2 agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. Purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against IRAK and hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein A-Sepharose and glutathione-conjugated agarose beads were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Mammalian expression vectors containing N-terminal FLAG-tagged human TLR2 and TLR4 that were made by inserting PCR-generated cDNA fragments lacking the signal sequence into pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma) were kindly provided by R. Medzhitov (Yale Medical School). The intracellular domains of TLR2 and TLR4 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmids for human CD14, FLAG-tagged human Tollip, HA-tagged Tollip, and its deletion mutants were constructed in-frame by inserting PCR-generated cDNA fragments into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). FLAG-IRAK and HA-IRAK were generated by inserting cDNA into pCDNA3.1. Kinase-inactive FLAG-IRAK (K239A) and HA-IRAK (K239A) were made using the Quick site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All FLAG and HA epitope tags were generated by incorporating tag sequences into primers at the N terminus of respective cDNA fragments. Correct inserts were confirmed by direct sequencing. The expression vector pEFBOS containing human MD-2 was kindly provided by K. Miyake (Saga Medical School, Japan). 293-Luc cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes and transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 5 μg of pFLAG-TLR2 or pFLAG-TLR4 together with 0.5 μg of a plasmid encoding CD14 containing a hygromycin resistance gene. Cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Individual colonies were picked, expanded, and confirmed for the surface expression of TLRs by flow cytometry and immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M2. Stable cell lines were propagated and maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for regular 293-Luc cells. RAW264.7 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected in triplicate using FuGene 6 with 0.2 μg of pBIIX-Luc or pAP-1-Luc and the indicated amounts of HA-Tollip plasmid. The total amount of transfected plasmids was equalized by supplementing with the empty vector pCDNA3.1. After 24 h, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 10 μg/ml PGN for 6 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega, Madison, WI). The data were normalized to total protein concentrations of each sample measured using a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. For coimmunoprecipitation of transfected proteins, 7 × 105 293, 293/TLR2, or 293/TLR4 cells were plated into six-well plates and transfected the following day with the indicated plasmids using FuGene 6. 24–36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of TNT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A portion of the lysates (50 μl) was saved for immunoblotting, and FLAG-tagged proteins were precipitated from the remainder for 2–4 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry of anti-FLAG M2 beads. After extensive washing with TNT buffer, the beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blotted with the indicated antibodies. The reactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST-Tollip and its N-terminal (1–52), central (53–178), and C-terminal (179–273) truncation mutants were made by cloning respective human Tollip cDNA fragments in-frame into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST fusion proteins were induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–6 h at 37 °C and incubated with glutathione beads. Purified GST proteins were obtained by elution from the beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione followed by dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated with TNT-T7 Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as described previously (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of 35S-labeled lysates was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of purified GST or GST-Tollip and 20 μl of glutathione beads in 1 ml of TNT buffer. The beads were washed three times with TNT buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For the detection of endogenous IRAK activity, 3 × 106 293/TLR2 or 293/TLR4 cells were plated into 10-cm dishes and transfected the following day with 5 μg of HA-Tollip and/or 5 μg of MD-2 plasmid using FuGene 6. 24 h after transfection, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 10 or 30 min and lysed in 1.2 ml of TNT buffer containing 2 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were precipitated at 4 °C for 4 h with 1 μg of anti-IRAK antibody and 20 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads. IRAK autophosphorylation was measured essentially as described previously using protocols developed for detecting IKK autophosphorylation (24May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). After washing twice with TNT buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP), the beads were suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The beads were boiled, 20-μl reaction aliquots were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. For measuring phosphorylation of Tollip by IRAK, IRAK was first precipitated, and immune complexes were washed with TNT and kinase buffers, then incubated in 25 μl of kinase buffer with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of purified GST, GST-Tollip, or its truncation mutants. Phosphorylated proteins were precipitated further with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. To determine whether Tollip interacts with TLRs via the TIR domain, we developed two cell lines (293/TLR2 and 293/TLR4) that stably express human CD14, as well as FLAG-tagged human TLR2 or TLR4. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting revealed significant amounts of TLR expression on the cell surface (data not shown). Furthermore, expression of the TLRs rendered the 293 cells highly responsive to various bacterial products, which do not otherwise activate these cells (data not shown). Interactions between Tollip and TLRs were examined by transfecting these cell lines with plasmids expressing HA-Tollip and/or MD-2, which is a secreted molecule that binds to TLR4 and is required for signaling (25Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged TLRs were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. HA-Tollip coprecipitated efficiently with TLR2 (Fig.1 A, lane 3 of thetop panel). Association between Tollip and TLR4 was also detectable but was enhanced significantly in the presence of MD-2 (Fig.1 A, lanes 5 and 6 of the top panel), suggesting that conformational changes in the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4 induced by MD-2 may be necessary for efficient binding to Tollip. To determine whether Tollip directly interacts with the TIR domain of TLRs, in vitro GST pull-down assays were performed. [35S]Methionine-labeled intracellular portions of TLR2 and TLR4 were produced by in vitro translation and incubated with either GST or GST-Tollip. As shown in Fig.1 B, both TLR2 and TLR4 bound to GST-Tollip, but not GST alone, demonstrating that Tollip associates directly with the TIR domain of TLRs. To map the region of Tollip responsible for association with the TLRs, we analyzed the interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with truncation mutants of Tollip as indicated in Fig.2 A. TLR4 bound efficiently to either full-length Tollip (1–273) or mutants with an intact C-terminal sequence, Tollip (Δ53–178) and Tollip (53–273) (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1, 4 and 5 of the top panel). Also, whereas Tollip (1–229) could interact with TLR4, no association was found between TLR4 and Tollip (1–178) or Tollip (53–178), indicating that the interaction domain lies in the C-terminal region of Tollip between residues 179 and 229 (Fig.2 B, lanes 2, 3 and 6 of thetop panel). Similar results were observed with TLR2 (data not shown). Interestingly, binding of Tollip to IL-1R is also mediated through a similar C-terminal region (22Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L.

B, suppression of LPS-induced kinase activity of IRAK by Tollip. 293/FLAG-TLR2 and 293/FLAG-TLR4 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and transfected with the plasmids indicated (5 μg of each). 24 h after transfection, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 10 or 30 min. Proteins in cell lysates were precipitated using anti-IRAK antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed, and an aliquot of the immunoprecipitate was saved for immunoblotting to confirm equal loading. The remainder of the precipitated proteins was incubated in kinase buffer at 30 °C for 20 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated IRAK was visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Tollip is phosphorylated by activated IRAK.

Cell lysates were precipitated with anti-IRAK antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads, and kinase assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 5 B. The lysates (20 μl) were also blotted with anti-IRAK and anti-HA antibodies to monitor the expression of transfected Tollip and phosphorylation of endogenous IRAK upon stimulation.

Cells were then left untreated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 10–30 min, and lysates were precipitated with anti-IRAK antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. Kinase assays were performed in the presence of 2 μg of purified GST or GST-Tollip. Phosphorylated proteins were precipitated further with glutathione beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Approximately equal amounts of GST protein input are shown on the bottom panel.

The bottom panel shows approximately equal amounts of GST proteins used in the kinase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TLRs, IL-1R, and IL-18R are all known to form either homo- or heterodimers upon stimulation with their cognate ligands. Therefore, it is possible that downstream proteins might also oligomerize to allow signals to be transduced efficiently. To test whether Tollip forms homo-oligomers, wein vitro translated full-length 35S-labeled Tollip (1–273) and used it in GST pull-down assays. We found that Tollip bound to GST-Tollip but not to GST alone (Fig.3 A), suggesting that Tollip is capable of self-association. To identify further the domains involved in Tollip homo-oligomerization, 293-Luc cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged full-length Tollip and the HA-tagged Tollip deletion mutants described in Fig. 2 A, and the interaction between the proteins was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig.3 B). All Tollip mutants associated efficiently with full-length Tollip except for the construct containing only the C2 domain (53–178) (Figs. 3 B and 2 A). Therefore, self-association of Tollip is mediated by both the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein and may result in formation of a stable protein complex. Although both Tollip and MyD88 function as adaptors to link IL-1R or TLRs to downstream molecules, neither in vitro GST pull-down nor in vivo mammalian coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed a stable complex between these two molecules (data not shown). These results suggested that MyD88 and Tollip exist in distinct protein complexes, which is consistent with previous findings that both molecules are recruited independently to the IL-1R after stimulation (22Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To assess the functional role of Tollip in TLR-mediated signaling, we transfected mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells with increasing amounts of Tollip together with either NF-κB or AP-1 luciferase reporter vectors. Luciferase activity was measured after stimulation of the transfected cells with various bacterial products. Both NF-κB and AP-1 were activated readily in response to LPS (Fig.4) and PGN (data not shown), and both were inhibited dose-dependently by Tollip, suggesting that Tollip is a negative regulator of TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Overexpression of Tollip also impaired NF-κB activation in 293/TLR2 and 293/TLR4 cells after stimulation with LPS or PGN (data not shown). To understand better the molecular mechanism by which Tollip inhibits TLR-mediated signaling, we analyzed its effect on the recruitment of IRAK to the TLR complex. 293/FLAG-TLR2 and 293/FLAG-TLR4 cells were transfected with Tollip together with either wild type or kinase-inactive (K239A) IRAK. Consistent with previous findings, transfection of wild type IRAK resulted in significant autophosphorylation of IRAK; however, the level of phosphorylation was diminished dramatically in the presence of Tollip (Ref. 22Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar and Fig.5 A, lanes 7 and9 versus 8 and 10 of thesecond panel from the bottom). Immunoprecipitation of TLR4 with anti-FLAG antibody revealed that Tollip did not appear to influence the amount of IRAK (K239A) recruited to the TLR4 receptor complex in the presence or absence of MD-2 (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 4 versus 5 and 6 of the top panel). In contrast, recruitment of phosphorylated IRAK was completely abolished by Tollip regardless of MD-2 expression (Fig. 5 A,lanes 7 and 9 versus 8 and10 of the top panel). Similar results were observed in 293/FLAG-TLR2 cells (data not shown). In vitro kinase assays were also performed to confirm that suppression of IRAK autophosphorylation by Tollip was the result of decreased IRAK kinase activity. 293/FLAG-TLR2 and 293/FLAG-TLR4 cells were transfected with Tollip and/or MD-2, stimulated with LPS, and then IRAK was immunoprecipitated and assayed for its kinase activity. As expected, IRAK was heavily phosphorylated after LPS stimulation (Fig.5B, lanes 2 and 8 of the top panel), but this autophosphorylation was decreased dramatically in the presence of Tollip (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4, 5,10, and 11 of the top panel). These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which Tollip might impair TLR signaling, namely by blocking the autophosphorylation of IRAK, which is necessary for the dissociation of IRAK from the receptor complex (26Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,27Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). IRAK is a serine/threonine kinase with a centrally located catalytic domain (13Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with either IL-1 or bacterial products, IRAK is activated and heavily phosphorylated (Ref. 13Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar and Fig.6 A, lanes 2 and3 of both top and bottom panels). However, the identity of potential IRAK substrate(s) has remained unknown. In addition, recent studies have suggested that the kinase activity of IRAK is dispensable for its role as an intermediate in IL-1 signaling (28Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, we were surprised to find that after LPS stimulation, activation of IRAK is accompanied by a concomitant phosphorylation of Tollip in 293/FLAG-TLR4 (Fig. 6 A,lanes 5 and 6 of the top panel) and 293/FLAG-TLR2 cells (data not shown). Phosphorylation of Tollip did not occur in resting cells without activated IRAK (Fig. 6 A,lane 4 of the top panel). To confirm this observation, the 293/FLAG-TLR2 and 293/FLAG-TLR4 cells were either left untreated or stimulated with LPS. IRAK was immunoprecipitated from these cells and incubated with purified GST-Tollip in in vitro kinase assays. We found that upon stimulation with LPS, concordant with the phosphorylation of IRAK, GST-Tollip (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–6 of the top panel), but not GST alone (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–3 of the top panel), was heavily phosphorylated. Similar results were also observed in 293-Luc cells stimulated with IL-1 (data not shown). Therefore these experiments strongly suggest that in addition to undergoing autophosphorylation, IRAK also phosphorylates Tollip. Phosphorylation of Tollip by activated IRAK may facilitate the dissociation of IRAK from Tollip, thereby allowing IRAK to escape the inhibitory effect of Tollip and subsequently modify downstream signaling components. To determine further the domain of Tollip which is phosphorylated by IRAK, we produced N-terminal (1–52), central (53–178), and C-terminal (179–273) truncation mutants of Tollip fused with GST. However, the central region of Tollip, which encompasses only the C2 domain, is completely insoluble when expressed in bacteria. Therefore, kinase assays were performed with purified N- and C-terminal Tollip domains together with wild type GST-Tollip. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the C-terminal (179–273) but not N-terminal (1–52) region of Tollip is phosphorylated by IRAK. Interestingly, the same region is also responsible for the interactions of Tollip with TLRs and IRAK (Fig. 2and Ref. 22Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the central C2 domain of Tollip might also be phosphorylated by IRAK upon activation because the intensity of phosphorylation at the C terminus is considerably weaker than that for wild type Tollip (Fig.6 C, lane 3 versus 4 of the top panel). In this paper we demonstrate that the adaptor protein Tollip can negatively regulate TLR signaling pathways. Described initially as a protein involved in IL-1 signaling, we now show that Tollip can associate with TLR2 and TLR4 and play an inhibitory role in TLR-mediated cell activation. Consistent with our findings, during the preparation of the manuscript, Bulut et al. (31Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) reported independently that Tollip coprecipitates with TLR2 and TLR4, and overexpression of Tollip inhibits TLR2- and TLR4-induced NF-κB activation in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells. One striking feature of Tollip is its ability to suppress the kinase activity of IRAK. Several lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism by which Tollip inhibits TLR signaling is by preassociating with IRAK, thus preventing it from being phosphorylated and activated on the TLR receptor complex. In fact, studies using IRAK-deficient cells demonstrated that phosphorylation of IRAK is required for it to dissociate from the receptor and transduce signals to downstream molecules leading to NF-κB activation (26Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Li X. Commane M. Jiang Z. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The ability of Tollip to interact directly with both the death (1–208) and kinase (181–545) domains of IRAK may explain the inhibitory role of Tollip (22, and data not shown). Upon activation, IRAK undergoes rapid autophosphorylation and dissociates from the receptor. Our studies reveal that after stimulation IRAK also phosphorylates Tollip. The physiological significance of this phosphorylation is still unclear, although it is possible that phosphorylation of Tollip may facilitate its dissociation from IRAK and subsequent degradation by ubiquitination. This is consistent with the fact that Tollip contains a highly conserved UBA (ubiquitin-associated) or CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradation) domain at the C terminus (230–270). Similar domains in other proteins have been shown to recruit ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, leading to proteosome-dependent degradation (32Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region around the UBA domain of Tollip binds to unphosphorylated IRAK under resting conditions and also associates transiently with the TLRs and IL-R upon stimulation (22Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The same region of Tollip can also be phosphorylated by IRAK (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, once activated on the receptor, IRAK phosphorylates Tollip, which may lead to the dissociation of Tollip from IRAK and the receptor complex. Unmasking the UBA domain on Tollip may lead to its subsequent degradation by a ubiquitination-dependent process. The removal of Tollip would allow signaling to continue by freeing activated IRAK to bind to downstream TRAF6. Because IRAK also undergoes rapid ubiquitination and degradation after activation (13Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 34Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylated Tollip facilitates the ubiquitination of IRAK by recruiting ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Further studies will be needed to explore fully the biological ramifications of Tollip phosphorylation by IRAK. Although a more complete understanding of biological functions of Tollip awaits the generation and analysis of mice lacking Tollip, it is possible that the primary role of Tollip-mediated pathway may be to maintain immune cells in a quiescent state in the absence of infection and facilitate the termination of TLR-induced cell signaling during inflammation and infection. It is conceivable that this evolutionarily conserved inhibitory system benefits the host by limiting the production of proinflammatory mediators and subsequent tissue damage under infectious conditions. Therefore, strategies to up-regulate Tollip expression may prove effective in treating both chronic and acute inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and septic shock.

Rather than causing immediate dissociation of the cytoplasmic GR heterocomplex, binding of hormone-induced substitution of one immunophilin (FKBP51) for another (FKBP52), and concomitant recruitment of the transport protein dynein while leaving Hsp90 unchanged. Immunofluorescence and fractionation revealed hormone-induced translocation of the hormone-generated GR·Hsp90·FKBP52·dynein complex from cytoplasm to nucleus, a step that precedes dissociation of the complex within the nucleus and conversion of GR to the DNA-binding form.

Upon binding of IL-6 to its receptor, a homodimer of gp130 is formed that results in activation of Janus kinases (JAKs) (14Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A.

Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Monomers of STAT3 protein exist in the cytoplasm of non-stimulated cells, and when activated by tyrosine phosphorylation by JAK in response to IL-6 they dimerize through SH2-phosphotyrosyl interactions that lead to nuclear translocation and DNA binding to initiate transcription (18Shuai K.

The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-mediated transcription factor that belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors (21Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors have similar structures that are composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD) that is involved in transcriptional activation, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a ligand-binding domain. After the ligand binds to AR, the ligand-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus and binds specific androgen-response elements (AREs) on the chromosome (22Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Mulder E. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The AR has been suggested to regulate the expression of at least 60 genes in the rat prostate (29Wang Z. Tufts R. Haleem R. Cai X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12999-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An example of expression of a human gene that is up-regulated by androgens in the prostate is prostate-specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a member of the serine protease family and is expressed in the epithelium of “normal” prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer specimens, and the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line (30Purnell D.M. Heatfield B.M. Trump B.F. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the PSA gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by androgen through several well characterized AREs (31Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A. Kmetec L.A. Miller J.D. Lamparski H.G. Henderson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of androgens, PSA has been shown to become elevated in prostate cancer cells maintained in monolayer andin vivo (for a review see Ref. 32Sadar M.D. Hussain M. Bruchovsky N. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 1999; 6: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate the gene expression of PSA in the absence of androgen are still unclear. Based upon these findings, we examined previously suspected growth factors for their ability to induce PSA gene expression prior to delineating a possible underlying mechanism.

All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate wells and repeated no less than 4 times using at least 2 sets of plasmids that were prepared separately. LNCaP cells (5 × 105) were plated in 60-mm plates in RPMI containing 5% FBS. Immediately prior to experiments, the media were changed to RPMI containing 5% dextran-charcoal-stripped serum for 48 h. The cells were treated with IL-6 in RPMI containing 5% dextran-charcoal-stripped serum for 16 h. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and fractionated by electrophoresis before blotting onto Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Biosciences). The 1.4-kb EcoRI fragments and 1-kbBamHI GAPDH fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Random Primers DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen). Hybridizations were performed according to the method described previously (33Sato N. Sadar M.D. Bruchovsky N. Saatcioglu F. Rennie P.S. Sato S. Lange P.H. Gleave M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17485-17494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The mRNA bands were quantified with the STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (38Lin D.L. Whitney M.C. Yao Z. Keller E.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1773-1781PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. PSA and GAPDH primers were as follows: PSA 418/21 sense 5′-GGCAGGTGCTTGTAGCCTCTC-3′; PSA 939/21 antisense, 5′-CACCCGAGCAGGTGCTTTTGC-3′; GAPDH, sense, 5′-CCGAGCCACATCGCTCAGAENDASH-3′ and GAPDH antisense, 5′-CCCAGCCTTCTCCTGGTG-3′. For quantitation 5 μm PSA primers (1 μl) were mixed with 2.5 μm GAPDH primers (1 μl) and then resolved on 1.3% agarose gel, and the bands were analyzed with ImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The PSA fragments were normalized to GAPDH. LNCaP cells (1 × 104) were plated in 96-well plates in RPMI containing FBS (0.5%) in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The next day the cells were treated with R1881, forskolin, IL-6, or mixtures of the compounds. After 3 days in culture, cell proliferation was assessed by adding 50 μl of MTT dye (1 mg/ml) in serum-free media to the cells. After 4 h of incubation, the cells were solubilized in Me2SO (150 μl per well) prior to reading the absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies). LNCaP cells (2 × 106) were plated on dishes (10 cm diameter) in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. Twenty four hours later, the medium was removed and replaced with RPMI 1640 (e.g. serum-free media) for 24 h prior to the addition of IL-6, forskolin, or inhibitors. After incubation with these compounds, whole-cell lysates were prepared as described previously (39Antras J. Lasnier F. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1157-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) from each sample were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8 or 10%) followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. Immunoblots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in TBST containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were incubated overnight with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (1:500), anti-phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705) antibody (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), or anti-phospho-STAT3 (Ser-727) antibody (1:1000) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), washed with TBST three times, and incubated for 1 h with the second antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies were diluted with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The protein bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Cell Signaling Technology or Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analyses of protein bands from scanned x-ray films were performed using the Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). LNCaP cells (2 × 106) were plated on 10-cm dishes in RPMI containing 5% FBS for 24 h before transfecting with expression vectors encoding STAT3 (2 μg/dish) and either His-tagged AR-(1–558), AR-(1–233), AR-(234–391), or AR-(392–558) using LIPOFECTIN® reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h the cells were treated with IL-6 (50 ng/ml) or vehicle for 6 h before harvesting. Harvested cells were lysed in Soft RIPA buffer (PBS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 50 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were passed several times through a 30½-gauge needle to disrupt the nuclei. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-His antibody conjugated to agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay with anti-STAT3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). EGF, KGF, IGF-I, IGF-II, and IL-6 have been suspected to play a role in the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence, which is clinically determined by elevating levels of PSA. Therefore, these compounds were screened using expression of PSA as an end point in the well differentiated LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line to identify whether any of these growth factors may be used as a model to delineate a possible mechanism of action. LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with the PSA (−630/+12)-luciferase reporter plasmid. This region of the PSA promoter has been partially characterized and contains several AREs that are required for androgen induction (31Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A. Kmetec L.A. Miller J.D.

Maximum induction (6-fold) of PSA-luciferase reporter activity by the synthetic androgen, R1881, was obtained at 1 nm and remained elevated at 10 nm. These results are consistent with previous reports (28Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 33Sato N.

All studies measuring activities of the PSA promoter were performed in parallel with saturating concentrations of R1881 (10 nm), which was included as a positive control. Exposure of transiently transfected LNCaP cells to IL-6 (50 ng/ml) resulted in a 12-fold increase in PSA-reporter activity relative to the control (Fig.1). EGF, KGF, IGF-I, and IGF-II yielded negligible to no effect on PSA-luciferase activities. Our results with EGF are consistent with the report showing that this growth factor has no effect in the absence of androgen on the secretion of PSA in LNCaP cells (41Henttu P. Vihko P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that IL-6 causes androgen-independent increases in PSA-luciferase activity, whereas other previously suspected growth factors did not affect the activity of this reporter in LNCaP cells. Because IL-6 caused an increased in PSA reporter activity, we next examined whether PSA mRNA levels were increased in LNCaP cells exposed to IL-6. Northern blot analysis showed that IL-6 caused a 2-fold increase in PSA mRNA levels compared with control values (Fig.2 A, compare 2nd and3rd lanes). R1881 was used as a positive control and as expected caused a robust increase in PSA mRNA levels (1st lane). Increased levels of PSA mRNA were also detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR using RNA isolated from LNCaP cells exposed to two different concentrations of IL-6 (1 and 10 ng/ml) (Fig.2 B). IL-6 (10 ng/ml) caused a greater than 2-fold increase in PSA mRNA levels in LNCaP cells. These results are consistent with two previous reports (24Hobisch A. Eder I.E. Putz T. Horninger W. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Culig Z. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4640-4645PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lin D.L. Whitney M.C. Yao Z. Keller E.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1773-1781PubMed Google Scholar) using semiquantitative PCR to detect a 2-fold increase in levels of PSA mRNA in LNCaP cells exposed to IL-6. The effect of IL-6 on the proliferation of LNCaP cells is controversial with reports of increases (5Okamoto M. Lee C. Oyasu R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 141-146PubMed Google Scholar, 42Giri D. Ozen M.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2375-2381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To place our results in context with other reports, we examined the effects of IL-6 on the proliferation of LNCaP cells in comparison to androgen (R1881) and forskolin. IL-6, forskolin, and R1881 increased proliferation of LNCaP cells as compared with control levels after 3 days (Fig.3). IL-6 and forskolin were comparable in promoting proliferation at the concentrations and conditions used in this experiment. A mixture of IL-6 with R1881 did not promote further increases in proliferation over that observed with R1881 alone. A mixture of IL-6 and forskolin also did not increase the proliferation of LNCaP cells over that obtained with each of the individual compounds. To determine whether the induction of PSA by IL-6 is through a similar mechanism as R1881, LNCaP cells were treated with a saturating concentration of R1881 to examine whether any further increases in PSA could be induced in the presence of the two compounds. The induction of PSA-luciferase activity by IL-6 was dose-dependent both in the absence or presence of R1881 (Fig. 4 A). Maximum induction of PSA reporter activity by IL-6 was obtained at the concentration of 100 ng/ml. Combined treatments with IL-6 and R1881 resulted in synergistic increases in the activation of the PSA reporter construct over that achieved solely with a saturating concentration of R1881. Recently, we reported that activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway using forskolin resulted in androgen-independent increases in the expression of the PSA gene (28Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The optimal concentration of forskolin required to achieve maximum induction of the PSA-luciferase reporter was 50 μm (28Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To provide insight into the mechanism of androgen-independent induction of PSA by IL-6, the effects of both IL-6 and forskolin treatments on the activity of the PSA-luciferase reporter were examined. At the optimal concentration of forskolin (50 μm), PSA-luciferase activity was increased 53-fold (Fig. 4 B). Combined treatment of LNCaP cells with an increasing concentration of IL-6 (1–100 ng/ml) and a constant concentration of forskolin (50 μm) resulted in synergic increases in PSA-luciferase activities that were dependent upon the concentration of IL-6. The PSA (6.1 kb)-reporter gene construct that contains both the enhancer and promoter regions has been reported to be highly inducible by androgens when compared with the reporter containing only the promoter region (46Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van der Korput H.A.G.M. van Eekelen C.C.E.M. van Rooij H.C.J. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We used this longer PSA (6.1 kb) reporter to determine whether IL-6 would also have a greater effect on this reporter. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the PSA (6.1 kb)-luciferase reporter was induced 70-fold by R1881, 8-fold by IL-6, and 113-fold by a mixture of R1881 and IL-6. These results suggest that the induction of PSA by IL-6 is mediated primarily through the −630 to +12 region of the PSA promoter and does not encompass DNA elements upstream in the enhancer region. To determine whether other androgen-responsive reporter constructs that contain AREs could be induced by IL-6, two additional reporters were evaluated in LNCaP cells. The first of these constructs was the probasin (PB)-promoter (−286/+28) which is a naturally occurring androgen-regulated promoter from the rat that contains ARE1 and ARE2 (35Snoek R. Bruchovsky N. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Gleave M. Sato N. Mawji N.R. Rennie P.S. Prostate. 1998; 36: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the PB-luciferase reporter construct was induced 146-fold by R1881, 8-fold by IL-6, and 218-fold by a mixture of R1881 and IL-6. These results show that IL-6 induces androgen-independent increases of PB-luciferase activity when used solely, and synergistic increases when used in combination with R1881. These results are consistent with those obtained using the PSA-luciferase reporters. The second of these reporters was the ARR3-thymidine kinase (tk)-luciferase, which is an artificial reporter construct that contains three tandem repeats of the rat PB ARE1 and ARE2 regions upstream of a luciferase reporter (36Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The effect of IL-6 on the ARR3-tk-reporter construct was unique compared with those obtained with PSA and PB. Although R1881 induced ARR3-tk-luciferase activity by 627-fold, IL-6 proved to be a very poor inducer of this construct (less than 2-fold) (Fig.5 C). However, a synergistic induction of the ARR3-tk-luciferase reporter was observed in the presence of both IL-6 and R1881, consistent with the results obtained with PSA and PB reporters. The differences in the induction of these three reporter constructs between R1881 and IL-6 demonstrate promoter-specific responses. AREs are present in all four of the above reporters that respond to IL-6 either in the presence or absence of androgen, suggesting a role for the AR in the underlying mechanism.

We have usedSaccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to study this critical component of triglyceride synthesis. Recent studies of an oleaginous fungus, Mortierella ramanniana, identified a new family of enzymes with in vitroacyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity. We show here that DGA1, the sole member of this gene family in yeast, has a physiological role in triglyceride synthesis. Metabolic labeling of DGA1 deletion strains with triglyceride precursors detected significant reductions in triglyceride synthesis. Triglyceride synthesis was virtually abolished in four different growth conditions when DGA1 was deleted in concert with LRO1, an enzyme that esterifies diacylglycerol from a phospholipid acyl donor. The relative contributions of the two enzymes depended on growth conditions. The residual synthesis was lost when ARE2, encoding an acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase, was deleted.In vitro microsomal assays verified that DGA1and ARE2 mediate acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase reactions. Three enzymes can thus account for diacylglycerol esterification in yeast. Yeast strains deficient in both diacylglycerol and sterol esterification showed only a slight growth defect indicating that neutral lipid synthesis is dispensable under common laboratory conditions.

Rather, a novel reaction for TG synthesis mediates the esterification of diacylglycerol (DG) using phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine as the acyl donor. Lro1p, the yeast protein that catalyzes this phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) reaction, bears striking sequence similarity to mammalian lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (21Oelkers P.

This reaction has also been identified in plant cells as a likely contributor to TG synthesis (22Dahlqvist A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Deletion of LRO1 results in a significant reduction of TG synthesis. The TG biosynthesis that persists in the absence ofLRO1 is predominately acyl-CoA-dependent and did not diminish in the absence of ARE1 and ARE2(21Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D.

DGA1, the yeast member of the DGAT2 gene family, is therefore a good candidate for mediating LRO1-independent TG synthesis in yeast. The studies described here demonstrate that DGA1has a genuine physiological role in TG synthesis and that its relative contribution varies with growth conditions. In all conditions assayed, the combined deletion of DGA1 and LRO1 resulted in virtual loss (≥97% reduction) of TG synthesis. The residual TG synthesis was completely lost when ARE2 was deleted in conjunction with DGA1 and LRO1. Thus, the enzymes that esterify DG to form triglyceride in S. cerevisiae are now identified in full. Molecular biology and yeast genetic procedures were performed according to conventional protocols (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Transformation of yeast was performed with lithium acetate followed by prototrophic selection (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains with single or multiple deletions (SCY060, SCY061, SCY059, SCY1397) in the ARE or LRO1 genes have been described previously (19Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J.

DGA1 deletion transformants were confirmed by PCR and subsequently crossed with SCY1397 (MATα, lro1::LEU2) or SCY344 (MATα, lro1Δ::URA3 are1Δ::HIS3 are2ΔLEU2), and the resulting diploids sporulated and micromanipulated. Haploid strains bearing the individual or multiple gene deletions were identified by growth on differential media and diagnostic PCRs. Conventional inter-strain crosses were used to generate multiple diploid strains (SCY2061-SCY2072) with one of the following four genotypes: normal,dga1Δ::URA3/dga1Δ::URA3, lro1Δ::LEU2/lro1Δ::LEU2anddga1Δ::URA3/dga1Δ::URA3 lro1Δ::LEU2/lro1Δ::LEU2. The growth of three independent strains of each genotype in liquid YPD media, was monitored over time by absorbance at 660 nm. A PCR product including the yeast DGA1 open reading frame, 468 bp of 5′-flanking sequence and 98 bp of 3′-flanking sequence was generated using the primers 245–2, CAAGACGGAAAGATTGAAAGAGTAG, 245–3, CGAGAACTCCAGTATTCCTGTAAG, and W303-1B genomic DNA. The 1.8-kb PCR product was treated with T4-DNA polymerase and ligated intoSmaI-digested pRS413 to create pRS413-DGA1. [3H]Oleate pulse-labeling in exponential phase was performed as described (21Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). [3H]Oleate pulse-labeling in the stationary phase was performed similarly with the exception that 2 ml of YPD cultures grown to stationary phase (OD660, 3.5–4.2) were labeled with 0.625 μCi of [3H]oleate for 30 min. To determine the steady state accumulation of TG in response to oleate loading, strains were grown in YPD to early log phase (OD660, 0.2–0.4), washed twice in sterile dH2O, resuspended in YPRTO with [3H]glycerol (40 μCi) and [14C]oleate (0.2 μCi), and grown for 18 h at 30 °C. Assessment of the steady-state accumulation of TG in sporulation media was determined after a dilute inoculation (∼1/1000 of a saturated culture) of diploid strains into YP+2% potassium acetate (w/v) and growth for ∼24 h. Cells were then washed twice with dH2O, resuspended in sporulation media with [3H]glycerol (10 μCi/ml) and [14C]oleate (0.05 μCi/ml), and grown for 24 h at 30 °C. Cells were washed, and the lipids extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described previously (21Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Assays were performed on a minimum of two independent strains of each genotype on two different days. To normalize for variability in uptake and extraction efficiency, the data are normalized (as %) to total dpm per lane of the TLC plate. Statistical analysis was performed using t tests. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (21Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in a final volume of 200 μl for 10 min at 23 °C following a 15-min preincubation as described (33Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Christiansen E.N. Drevon C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1417-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained 175 mmTris, pH 7.8, bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml), 160 μm DG (in ethanol), 8 mm MgCl2, 50 μm[1-14C]oleoyl-CoA (20,000 dpm/nmol), and 80 μg of microsomal protein. To investigate fatty acyl-CoA specificity, microsomes were incubated with 1-stearoyl-2[1-14C]arachidonyl-sn-glycerol (Amersham Biosciences, 15,000 dpm/nmol) and varying fatty acyl-CoAs (50 μm). Reactions were stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol (2:1). 15 μg of [3H]triolein was added as an internal standard/carrier, and the lipids separated by TLC in hexane:diethylether:acetic acid (180:20:1). The background was determined as the activity observed when the radiolabel was added after the chloroform/methanol. The sole representative of the DGAT2 gene family in S. cerevisiae,DGA1 (YOR245C), is predicted to encode a 418-amino acid polypeptide with ∼36% identity to the MrDGAT2A and MrDGAT2B proteins from M. ramanniana. Yeast Dga1p, in common with the other members of the DGAT2 family, is a predicted transmembrane protein, lacks a classical signal peptide and retains motifs and residues implicated at the active sites of bacterial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (34Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The heterologous overexpression of S. cerevisiae, DGA1 has been used to infer this gene product to possesses DG esterification activity (18Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A. Voelker T. Hawkins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38862-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological role of Dga1p in triglyceride synthesis in yeast, we generated a DGA1 deletion mutant (dga1Δ) by homologous recombination. The dga1Δ strain was assessed for changes in TG production by metabolic labeling of exponentially dividing cells with [3H]oleic acid. The contribution ofDGA1 under these conditions was significant but minor, with a 25% reduction in TG synthesis upon deletion of the gene (Fig.1 A). Previous assays of yeast strains lacking the PDAT reaction encoded by LRO1 showed an ∼75% reduction in TG synthesis in logarithmically growing yeast (Fig. 1 A, Ref. 21Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To determine the combined roles of DGA1 and LRO1 in TG synthesis, we generated compound lro1Δ dga1Δ deletion strains and assessed [3H]oleic acid incorporation into TG. During logarithmic growth, all but ∼2% of normal TG synthesis was lost due to these mutations (Fig. 1 A). Concomitantly, there was a statistically significant accumulation of the diacylglycerol and phospholipid substrates for these reactions inlro1Δ dga1Δ deletion strains (Fig. 1 B). As yeast cells pass through the diauxic shift or transition from logarithmic growth into the stationary phase of growth, their cellular metabolism is altered in response to the changing nutrient environment. This alteration includes the elevation of TG synthesis (35Taylor F.R. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Hosaka K. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 796: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the contribution of DGA1 andLRO1 to TG synthesis in late stationary phase (Fig.1 A). Deletion of DGA1 caused an ∼50% reduction in TG synthesis whereas deletion of LRO1 did not significantly effect TG synthesis. Thus, Dga1p can mediate essentially all cellular TG synthesis in stationary phase, in contrast to the situation in exponential phase where Lro1p predominates. This may reflect the marked transcriptional up-regulation of DGA1relative to LRO1 that is observed during the diauxic shift and stationary growth (37Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in stationary phase, the amount of substrate may be limiting such that a reduction in Dga1p or Lro1p levels has less of an effect on TG synthesis. Again, when both genes were deleted in concert, a major reduction (97%) in synthesis of TG together with an accumulation of DG and phospholipid resulted. To verify that deletion of DGA1 was the genuine cause of the TG synthetic defect, a DGA1 expression plasmid (pRS413-DGA1) comprising the DGA1 ORF and endogenous promoter was created in pRS413. [3H]oleic acid pulse-labeling ofdga1Δ or lro1Δ dga1Δ deletion strains transformed with either pRS413 or pRS413-DGA1 showed that plasmid-derived expression of DGA1 rescued the TG synthetic deficit (Fig. 2). TG biosynthesis is also markedly elevated when yeast cells are grown in the presence of oleate (38Casey W.M. Rolph C.E. Tomeo M.E. Parks L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or when diploid cells are induced to sporulate in the absence of nitrogen (39Esposito M.S. Esposito R.E. Arnaud M. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriology. 1969; 100: 180-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into TG following growth with 0.1% (w/v) oleate or in sporulation media. Deletion of LRO1 orDGA1 individually had no effect on TG accumulation in oleate-containing media (Fig.3 A). Deletion ofLRO1 also had no effect in sporulation media while deletion of DGA1 resulted in a 40% reduction (Fig. 3 A). Metabolic labeling experiments with [14C]oleic acid gave similar results (data not shown). The non-additive, or in the case of oleate media, non-existent, reductions in TG synthesis in the individual deletion strains may again reflect regulation or non-limiting amounts of either enzyme. Deletion of both genes resulted in the virtual loss of TG synthesis in both media, suggesting the absence of other genes that contribute significantly to TG synthesis under these growth conditions (Fig. 3 A). As observed in the previous growth conditions, the deficits in TG synthesis were associated with a striking accumulation of DG (Fig. 3 B). This observation confirms DG as a critical metabolic branch point in the Kennedy pathway for glyceride and glycerophosphatide synthesis (40Kennedy E. Fed. Proc. 1961; 20: 934-940PubMed Google Scholar), whereby either TG can be synthesized for storage or phospholipids synthesized for membrane formation, depending on cellular requirements. Accordingly, the accumulation of both DG and phospholipid is much less pronounced when cells were exponentially dividing (Fig. 2 B), presumably because the pathway is biased toward new membrane formation. In all of the growth conditions examined, there persists a very low level of TG synthesis that is independent ofDGA1 and LRO1. Given the role of the mammalianO-acyltransferase, DGAT1 in this process, we questioned whether the yeast O-acyltransferase gene family might be responsible for residual TG synthesis. Moreover, it has been suggested that the Are1p enzyme has this activity (41Sandager L. Dahlqvist A. Banas A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Gustavsson M. Stymne S. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2000; 28: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we generated dga1Δ lro1Δ are1Δ are2Δstrains. These quadruple deletion mutants incorporated no [3H]oleic acid into TG during stationary phase (Fig.4); TG dpm were equal to the background of the scintillation counter. Subsequent analysis of dga1Δ lro1Δ are1Δ and dga1Δ lro1Δ are2Δ strains showed that Are2p, and not Are1p, is responsible for the residual TG synthesis. As anticipated, the triple dga1Δ lro1Δ are2Δ and quadruple dga1Δ lro1Δ are1Δ are2Δmutants display significant reductions in steryl ester synthesis in the same metabolic labeling experiment (not shown). Normal yeast strains grown to stationary phase exhibit a marked accumulation of cytoplasmic neutral lipid droplets that can be envisaged by staining with the vital stain Nile Red, followed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5, Ref. (19Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). By contrast, the same analysis of a dga1Δ lro1Δmutant revealed a significant reduction in the number and intensity of lipid droplets (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the quadruple mutant displayed a complete absence of neutral lipid containing droplets (Fig. 5). Therefore, the dramatic effects of mutations in the DGA1,LRO1, and ARE2 genes on neutral lipid accumulation are observed with experiments using two independent assays, metabolic labeling and Nile Red staining. To assess the direct role of these enzymes in a classical DGAT reaction, microsomes were isolated from normal, single deletion, and compound deletion strains and incubated with DG and radiolabeled oleoyl-CoA (Table I). Even though LRO1 does not use acyl-CoA as a substrate, yeast microsomes can generate DG by the hydrolysis of phosphatidate derived from glycerol-3-phosphate and acyl-CoA (42Christiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore,LRO1 was also deleted to ensure that no radiolabel was incorporated into TG via the PDAT pathway. As anticipated from thein vivo experiments, the Dga1p protein is the major determinant of oleoyl-CoA incorporation into TG. A residual level of TG synthesis persists in dga1Δ and dga1Δ lro1Δmicrosomes, consistent with the in vivo assays. This activity is entirely accounted for by the Are2p enzyme; microsomes from triple dga1Δ lro1Δ are2Δ or quadruple dga1Δ lro1Δ are1Δ are2Δ mutants showed no oleoyl-CoA-dependent TG synthesis.Table IIn vitro, microsomal DG esterification assaysGenotypeIn vitro TG synthesispmol/min/mgnormal340.8 ± 40.7dga1Δ32.6 ± 2.2lro1Δ339.2 ± 56.8dga1Δlro1Δ39.8 ± 4.4dga1Δlro1Δ are1Δ55.9 ± 1.4dga1Δ lro1Δ are2Δ0.0 ± 1.4dga1Δ lro1Δ are1Δare2Δ0.0 ± 0.5lro1Δare1Δ are2Δ252.8 ± 29.3Microsomes from normal, single, and multiple deletion strains were incubated in the presence of DG and [14C]oleoyl-CoA for 10 minutes at 23 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data with standard deviations are from triplicate assays performed on the same day and are representative of assays performed on other days.

To define the acyl-CoA substrate specificity of Dga1p, microsomes were prepared from lro1Δ are1Δ are2Δ strains and assayedin vitro for the synthesis of TG from [1-14C]diacylglycerol and various acyl-CoA substrates (Table II). Oleoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA were the preferred substrates while myristoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, arachidonyl-CoA, and linoleoyl-CoA were used to a significantly lesser extent. By contrast, the Are1p and Are2p sterol esterification enzymes readily utilize linoleoyl-CoA as substrates while palmitoyl-CoA was barely incorporated (44Yang H. Cromley D. Wang H. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3980-3985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reason for preferential incorporation of fatty acid species into TG or steryl ester is not known.Table IIAcyl-CoA substrate specificity of the Dga1p reactionAcyl-CoA substrateIn vitro TG synthesispmol/min/mgMyristyl-CoA, 14:0203.85Palmityl-CoA, 16:0321.31Stearoyl-CoA, 18:0143.75Oleoyl-CoA, 18:1356.24Linoleoyl-CoA, 18:252.78Arachidonyl-CoA, 20:4116.92Microsomes from lro1Δ are1Δ are2Δ DGA1 strains were incubated in the presence of [14C]diacylglycerol and the indicated cold acyl-CoAs for 10 minutes at 23 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data is the mean of two experiments performed in duplicate on separate days.

The average difference between experiments was less than 5% in each instance. The lack of detectable DG esterification when the Dga1p, Lro1p, and Are2p reactions are absent suggests we have defined the compendium of TG biosynthetic reactions in this model. The use of acyl-CoA-dependent and -independent pathways for TG synthesis is conserved from yeast through plants (13Bouvier-Nave P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 41Sandager L. Dahlqvist A. Banas A. Stahl U. Lenman M. Gustavsson M. Stymne S. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2000; 28: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although as yet, no Lro1p-like PDAT reaction has been detected in human cells. In an interesting example of convergent evolution, theO-acyltransferases (DGAT1p and Are2p) and the DGAT2 enzymes (such as DGAT2p and Dga1p) utilize the same substrates, but exhibit no conservation of primary structure. However, the reactions are distinct;DGA1, unlike the ARE genes, is transcriptionally up-regulated by conditions such as growth to saturation and nitrogen deprivation. Furthermore, the two acyl-CoA-dependent esterification reactions in S. cerevisiae exhibit differences in substrate recognition regarding the nature of the acyl chain. Both reactions readily utilize oleoyl-CoA; however, the yeast O-acyltransferases incorporate linoleoyl-CoA but not palmitoyl-CoA, while Dga1p is the converse. It is interesting to speculate that with regard to the alcohol substrate that yeast ARE2 may represent the multi-substrate progenitor of its human orthologs ACAT1, ACAT2, and DGAT1, which subsequently developed more specific substrate specificities. Moreover, the existence of multiple DGA1orthologs in humans suggests that the DGAT2 gene family has also been expanded and presumably specialized for undetermined functions (16Cases S. Stone S. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Whether DGAT1 and the members of the DGAT2 gene family are entirely responsible for DG esterification in mammals remains to be determined. These studies have allowed the production of a mutant strain (dga1Δ lro1Δ are2Δ) that lacks the ability to store energy as TG. Moreover, when we introduced a deletion mutation in the second sterol esterification enzyme, Are1p, into this strain, we created a strain devoid of neutral lipids. The sole growth phenotype observed was a prolonged lag phase of growth in YPD media relative to normal strains with no significant change in the exponential or stationary phases (data not shown). It is surprising that despite their evolutionary conservation, the neutral lipid biosynthetic enzymes appear to be dispensable for vegetative growth. This may be unique to the laboratory setting. In the wild, when nutrients are not readily available, storage may confer a selective advantage. We are now in the unique situation to explore how a eukaryotic cell copes with the loss of neutral lipid synthesis."

Mutation of either ygaA orygaK eliminated inducible anaerobic NO metabolism, whereasygbD disruption partly impaired the activity. NO-sensitive [4Fe-4S] (de)hydratases, including the Krebs cycle aconitase and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, were more susceptible to inactivation in ygaK orygaA mutants than in the parental strain, and these metabolic poisonings were associated with conditional growth inhibitions. flavoRb (NO reductase) and flavohemoglobin (NO dioxygenase) maximally metabolized and detoxified NO in anaerobic and aerobic E. coli, respectively, whereas both enzymes scavenged NO under microaerobic conditions. We suggest designation of the ygaA-ygaK-ygbD gene cluster as the norRVWmodulon for NO reduction and detoxification. nitric-oxide reductases nitric-oxide dioxygenases flavohemoglobin flavorubredoxin rubredoxin:O2oxidoreductase Nitric oxide (NO) is present throughout the biosphere (1Zumft W.

Attempts to biochemically identify the NO reduction system have been complicated by its instability. Moreover, the E. coli genome lacks a NOR belonging to either the cytochrome bc complex or cytochrome P450 families (1Zumft W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Moreover, unlike the inducible NOR inE. coli (17Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol.

Genomic data and bioinformatics tools (NCBI Protein Database and BLAST) provided a strategy for identifying the E. coli system.E. coli ygaA encodes a protein bearing ∼42% identity to the NO-modulated Ralstonia eutrophus transcription regulators NorR1 and NorR2 (36Pohlmann A.

We demonstrate here the role of the E. coli NorR homolog YgaA in controlling NOR expression. We also elucidate the role of flavoRb (YgaK) and its reductase partner (YgbD) in the NO-induced anaerobic NOR activity in E. coli. We further demonstrate that NOR and NOD protect NO-sensitive [4Fe-4S]-containing (de)hydratases in critical anabolic and catabolic pathways and thus explain conditional growth defects observed with NO poisoning inE. coli. A mechanism for flavoRb-catalyzed NO reduction is envisioned. We suggest renaming the ygaA-ygaK-ygbD gene cluster as norRVW and annotating similar genes for a possible NO detoxification function.

A 13.355-kbKpnI-BamHI fragment containing theygaA, ygaK, and ygbD genes and the corresponding open reading frames (b2709, b2710, and b2711, respectively) was subcloned from 9G10 into pAlter (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) that was modified to express ampicillin resistance. Disruptions in the ygaA, ygaK, andygbD genes were created by Mu transposon insertion. MudIIPR13 (camR), a generous gift of Dr. Danièlle Touati, was randomly transposed to pAlter9G10 by the method of Castilhoet al. (43Castilho B.A. Olfson P. Casadaban M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 488-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Carlioz and Touati (41Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Briefly, strain QC720 carrying a Mucts prophage and MudIIPR13 was transformed at 30 °C with pAlter9G10. Mu transposition, phage growth, and cell lysis were induced at 44 °C in LB medium prepared with 10 g of Tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl prepared in 1 liter of deionized water and supplemented with 20 mm glucose. Phage lysates were used to transduce strain QC719 to ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance, thus selecting for plasmids carrying a Mudlactransposon. Ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant clones were further scored for β-galactosidase fusion phenotype on tetrazolium red-lactose agar (44Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). White β-galactosidase-positive colonies were selected and screened for Mudlac insertions inygaA, ygaK, and ygbD by restriction analysis. To enrich for NO-inducible, anaerobically expressed β-galactosidase gene fusions, ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were replica-plated onto tetrazolium red-lactose agar with antibiotics and grown overnight under an atmosphere containing 180 ppm NO balanced with N2. Following an additional 24 h of growth in air, colonies that were originally red, but turned pink upon exposure to NO, were chosen for restriction analysis. Insertion sites were determined by sequencing from the 5′-end of the Mudlac insertions using primer 5′-AATACATCTGTTTCATTTG-3′. Plasmids with insertions at amino acids 311, 232, and 11 in the respective YgaA, YgaK, and YgbD open reading frames were isolated. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI, and the DNA was used to transform strain JC7623 to chloramphenicol resistance (45Kushner S.R. Nagaishi H. Temple A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Site-specific insertion in theygaA, ygaK, and ygbD genes was confirmed by linkage to gshA using strain JTG10 as the recipient in P1 transduction analyses. Mutations were subsequently transduced to strain AB1157. Cultures were grown in phosphate-buffered LB medium (8Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol.

Minimal salts medium (pH 7.0) contained 60 mmK2HPO4, 33 mmKH2PO4, 7.6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.7 mmsodium citrate, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 μmMnCl2, and 10 μg/ml thiamin HCl and was supplemented with either 20 mm glucose or 2% potassium gluconate. Minimal medium was supplemented with 40 μg/ml l-arginine,l-histidine, l-leucine, l-proline, and l-threonine or with 0.25% casamino acids as indicated. Overnight 5-ml aerobic cultures were grown at 37 °C in 15-ml culture tubes with vigorous shaking. Overnight 10-ml anaerobic cultures were grown static at 37 °C in 15-ml culture tubes. For gas exposures, cultures were grown at 37 °C in rubber stopper-sealed 50-ml Erlenmeyer flasks continuously flushed with gas mixtures at 30 ml/min at a culture/flask volume ratio of at most 1:5 with vigorous shaking at 275 rpm. To minimize the disturbance of gases, culture aliquots were removed from flasks using a 1-ml tuberculin syringe connected via narrow tubing to the culture medium. Cell density was determined from culture absorbance at 550 nm and by plating and counting. An absorbance of 1.0 was taken to equal 3 × 108 and 7 × 108 bacteria/ml for cells grown in phosphate-buffered LB medium and minimal salts medium, respectively. Aerobic and anaerobic NO consumption activities were measured amperometrically using a 2-mm ISO-NOP NO electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) as previously described (16Gardner P.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Aerobic and anaerobic activities were measured at 37 °C and at 1.0 and 1.5 μm NO, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Cells were harvested; extracts were prepared; and aconitase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, and protein were assayed as previously described (16Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Salzman A.L. J. Biol.

Significance of differences between data (p < 0.05) were determined using Student'st test. To test the individual roles of theygaA, ygaK, and ygbD gene products in the anaerobic NO consumption activity, we constructed strains carrying insertion mutations using random Mudlac transposition (Fig.1). The anaerobic and aerobic NO consumption activities of strains AG200, AG300, and AG400, with Mudlac insertions in ygaA, ygaK, andygbD, respectively, were measured and compared with those of the parental strain, AB1157. Strains bearing mutations inygaA or ygaK showed no anaerobic NO consumption activity following exposure to 960 ppm NO under anaerobic growth conditions, whereas the ygbD mutant produced a rate ∼40% lower than that of its parental strain (Fig.2 A). None of the strains showed significant anaerobic NO consumption activity in the absence of NO exposure. We also measured the aerobic NO consumption activity of anaerobically induced cells. Each strain showed the normal basal level of aerobic NO consumption activity (Fig. 2 B, comparewhite bars), and this activity was induced to high levels by NO (black bars). The absence of ygaA,ygaK, or ygbD resulted in small increases in the induction of the aerobic NO consumption activity (compare black bars). This aerobic NO consumption activity is fully attributable to flavoHb (20Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, YgaA and YgaK constitute a novel modulon for NO reduction and detoxification in E. coli, with YgbD (NorW, flavoRb reductase) acting as an accessory for NO reduction. YgaA, YgaK, and YgbD may decrease aerobic NO consumption activities by decreasing steady-state NO levels and flavoHb/NOD expression in anaerobic cells. We examined the efficiency of the anaerobic NO consumption activity for NO scavenging. NOR showed an apparentK m(NO) value of 400 nm (Fig.3, ●) and was CO-resistant (○) and cyanide-resistant (17Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The K m(NO) value is identical to the values estimated for the flavoHb-type NOD inE. coli (21Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and for the cytochrome bc-type NOR in Pseudomonas perfectomarina (49Zafiriou O.C. Hanley Q.S. Snyder G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5694-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate the efficiency of the anaerobic system for NO scavenging. The results also indicate low affinities of the NO scavenger flavoRb (YgaK) for CO and cyanide. To define the NO detoxification function of ygaA, ygaK, and ygbD in cells, it is necessary to understand the protective role(s) of the system for critical target(s) of NO poisoning under physiological conditions. Thus, we tested the role of ygaA, ygaK, andygbD in the inducible anaerobic protection of the NO-sensitive Krebs cycle enzyme aconitase (16Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26528-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). E. coli(AB1157) exposed to 480 ppm NO gas (<1 μm) lost ∼45% of the aconitase activity after 30 min (Fig.4). Aconitase inactivation increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the presence of chloramphenicol, thus demonstrating the protective role for newly synthesized protein(s). Moreover, loss of aconitase activity in theygaA (AG200) and ygaK (AG300) mutants was greater than in the parental strain, thus demonstrating critical roles forygaA and ygaK in the adaptive protection. In contrast, ygbD (AG400) was not essential for aconitase protection under these conditions. To further define the functional importance of ygaA, ygaK, andygbD for E. coli, we investigated the effects of specific insertion mutations in each of these genes on the anaerobic growth of E. coli exposed to a NO stress. Surprisingly, there was little growth inhibition with 240 ppm NO gas (≤0.5 μm) for cells growing on a rich phosphate-buffered LB medium (Fig. 5 A). Higher NO exposure levels caused comparable growth inhibition of the mutants and the parental strain (data not shown). These results suggest a limited role for ygaA, ygaK, and ygbD and anaerobic NO metabolism in growth protection. Nevertheless, the exquisite sensitivity of aconitase to NO-mediated inactivation (Fig. 4) (8Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26528-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that anaerobic growth protection may be better observed under conditions requiring aconitase function, the citric acid cycle, or other NO-sensitive metabolic pathways. Aconitase expression is relatively low under these conditions; and moreover, aconitase function is not expected to be limiting for E. coli growth with glucose supplied as the substrate for energy production (50Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of NO on anaerobic growth of E. coli mutants was investigated under growth conditions demanding the function of putative NO-sensitive enzymes. The [4Fe-4S]-containing 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase of the gluconate-metabolizing Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the [4Fe-4S]-containing α,β-dihydroxyacid dehydratase of the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway are two enzymes that are predicted to be NO-sensitive (8Gardner P.R.

Rep. 1997; 17: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Anaerobic growth of strains AG200 and AG300 was significantly impaired by exposure to 240 ppm NO gas under growth conditions requiring gluconate metabolism (Fig.5 B) or amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 5 C). These results demonstrate important, albeit conditional, roles for YgaA (NorR) and YgaK (NorV) in NO detoxification. Measurements of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase activity following a 60-min exposure of parental or flavoRb-deficient cells to NO gas (240 ppm) demonstrated the protection that flavoRb (YgaK) and NO reduction afforded to 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (Fig.6, compare white andblack bars). The results establish the sensitivity of this [4Fe-4S] enzyme to NO and further demonstrate the protection NO metabolism affords against metabolic NO poisoning. The anaerobic NO consumption activity in E. coli is O2-sensitive, decaying with a half-life of ∼5 min in air (17Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that flavoRb may function poorly, if at all, in the presence of O2. On the other hand, the aerobic NOD activity of flavoHb shows a rather highK m value for O2 (60–100 μm) and is potently inhibited"
https://openalex.org/W2033212454,"Human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) slowly forms amyloid fibers in lipid-free solutions at physiological pH and salt concentrations (Hatters, D. M., MacPhee, C. E., Lawrence, L. J., Sawyer, W. H., and Howlett, G. J. (2000)<i>Biochemistry</i> 39, 8276–8283). Measurements of the time dependence of solution turbidity, thioflavin T reactivity, and the amount of sedimentable aggregate reveal that the rate and extent of amyloid formation are significantly increased by the addition of an inert polymer, dextran T10, at concentrations exceeding 20 g/liter. High dextran concentrations do not alter the secondary structure of the protein, fiber morphology, or the thioflavin T and Congo Red binding capacity of apoC-II amyloid. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies show that monomeric apoC-II does not associate significantly with dextran. The observed dependence of the overall rate of amyloid formation on dextran concentration may be accounted for quantitatively by a simple model for nonspecific volume exclusion. The model predicts that an increase in the fractional volume occupancy of macromolecules in a physiological fluid can nonspecifically accelerate the formation of amyloid fibers by any amyloidogenic protein."

Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) reported that a C-terminal fragment (aa 383–731, to help direct comparison, if not otherwise indicated, all Hsp90 sequences are given as sequences of human Hsp90α) indeed is able to bind to ATP-Sepharose in a novobiocin-sensitive manner. Deletion of amino acids 660–680 abolished both ATP and novobiocin binding, indicating this segment as part of a novel ATP-binding site. In the present study we have mapped the ATP-binding sites by direct biochemical approaches. Our results suggest that a residue in the middle domain interacts with the N-terminally bound ATP, pointing out the existence of a γ-phosphate-binding site to the analogy of the GHKL family members. More importantly, we could also identify a cryptic C-terminal, cisplatin-sensitive ATP-binding site, demonstrate that novobiocin inhibits both sites, and show that the N- and C-terminal ATP-binding sites interact in a very sophisticated way, supporting the existence of two cooperatively interacting parts of the chaperone. Rat liver Hsp90 was purified as described earlier (23Sõti Cs. Radics L. Yahara I. Csermely P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Human Hsp90α was expressed from a pMAL-cRI/human Hsp90α-(3–731) plasmid in Escherichia coli as a maltose-binding protein fusion partner and was purified on an amylose resin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After proteolytic removal of the maltose-binding protein tag, the protein was further purified on a Bioscale UNO Q column (Bio-Rad). The purified protein was fully soluble and active in chaperone assays. Photoaffinity labeling was performed according to Biswas and Kornberg (24Biswas S.B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7990-7993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three μg of Hsp90 were incubated in the presence of 200 μmATP (containing 5–10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA, or 5–10 mm MgCl2, 30 min at 37 °C, after a 30-min preincubation in the absence or presence of inhibitors. Samples were placed in an aluminum block on ice and were irradiated in a UV Stratalinker from a distance of 10 cm for 30 min. Non-bound radionuclide was separated on SDS-PAGE, and the gel was analyzed by silver staining, drying, and autoradiography. CD spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon VI dichrograph in a thermostated 0.01-cm path length cylindrical quartz cell at 25 °C. Samples contained 0.3–0.5 mg/ml Hsp90 in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Final concentrations of geldanamycin (Invitrogen) and ATP were 18 μm and 1 mm, respectively. In this case geldanamycin was diluted from an acetonitrile stock (instead of Me2SO), which did not influence the effectivity of the compound in the ATP affinity cleavage reaction. Mean residue ellipticities were calculated using a mean residue molecular mass of 115. Binding assays to γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were performed according to Grenert et al. (6Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

In the case of ATP competition, samples contained an ATP regeneration system (10 mm creatine phosphate and 20 units/ml creatine kinase). Finally, 25 μl γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose was added, and tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with frequent agitation, and then the resin was pelleted and washed twice with HKMN buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Affinity cleavage reactions were performed as described by Alonso and Rubio (25Alonso E. Rubio V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two μg of Hsp90 were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 20 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm FeCl3, 30 mm ascorbate, and 1 mm nucleotides, if not otherwise indicated. In the majority of experiments, samples contained an ATP regeneration system (10 mm creatine phosphate and 20 units/ml creatine kinase). In competition experiments a 15-min to 1-h preincubation was done with the indicated additions. Fragmentation was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining or immunoblotting with different antibodies (26; Institute of Immunology Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) directed against the N terminus (K41218, Hsp90α/β-reactive, PA3–012, Hsp90β-specific; Affinity Bioreagents) or the C terminus (K41007, Hsp90α-specific and K3725B, Hsp90β-specific) of Hsp90. ATP binding to Hsp90 was analyzed by retaining the protein-bound ATP on a nitrocellulose filter (TransBlot, Bio-Rad) as described by Wong and Lohman (27Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and Ban et al. (28Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane (protein binding capacity was determined to be 4.5–5 μg/well) was equilibrated for a minimum of 2 h in binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5) at 4 °C. Hsp90 was preincubated in the absence or presence of 60 μm radicicol or 36 μm geldanamycin for 1 h in binding buffer on ice, and then Mg-[α-32P]ATP (107–2 × 107 cpm/sample) was added at the indicated concentrations, and samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. 30-μl aliquots (containing 4.2 μg of Hsp90 or thioredoxin as control) in triplicate were filtered through the wells of the PR 648 Slot Blot Filtration Manifold (Hoefer) and immediately washed once with 200 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. Blots were rinsed and dried, and bound radioactivity was assessed using a PhosphorImager. Protein binding to the membrane was checked in samples containing no radioactivity and found to be constant, irrespective of the ATP/radicicol/geldanamycin concentration. Accurate stoichiometric determination of ATP binding was done by liquid scintillation counting and was compared with the total radioactivity of the samples. Nucleotide binding of both thioredoxin and nitrocellulose was negligible. Binding of p23 was assessed according to Sullivan et al. (9Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). 10 μg of Hsp90 and 4 μg of p23 were preincubated in the presence of the indicated inhibitors at 4 °C for 30 min, in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then samples were supplemented with 5 mm ATP or 0.5 mm ATPγS and an ATP regeneration system (10 mm creatine phosphate and 20 units/ml creatine kinase) and/or 20 mm molybdate and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the JJ3 anti-p23 antibody. Pellets were washed three times with binding buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transferred into serum-free medium and incubated either with 1.8 μm geldanamycin, 100 μm cisplatin (Sigma) or 1 mm novobiocin (Sigma) for 3 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were Dounce-homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.5 (lysis buffer), on ice and then clarified by centrifugation. Hsp70 was immunoprecipitated with the SPA-810 antibody (StressGen). Pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer + 50 mm KCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Hsp90 and anti-Hsp70 antibodies. First, prokaryotic (sp P10413 and sp P46208), yeast (sp P02829), plant (sp P36181 and sp P33126), protozoon (tr 076257), fruit fly (sp P02828), avian (sp P11501), murine (sp P34058 and sp P07901), and human (sp P07901 and sp P08238) Hsp90 as well as fruit fly (tr Q9V9D1) and human (sp Q12931) Trap1 sequences were screened for conserved Lys residues by multiple sequence alignment with ClustalW 1.74 (www.ch.embnet.org/software/ClustalW.html), using default values. Parallel with this, yeast, murine, and human Hsp90 sequences as well as the sequences of E. coli gyrase B (sp P06982) and MutL (sp P23367) proteins were sent to the Predict Protein Server (dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/), and secondary structure predictions were made according to Rost and Sander (29Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar, 30Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) with default values. Comparing the predicted structures with the known crystal structures using the coordinates of the Protein Data Bank (MutL, 1BKN; gyrase B, 1EI1; and human Hsp90α, 1YET), the overall accuracy was estimated as 81.6, 71.3, and 87.3% for MutL, GyrB and human Hsp90α, respectively, which shows a highly accurate prediction level. To find possible γ-phosphate-binding sites, segments containing conserved lysines with conserved Gln or Asn residues in the preceding 2–7 amino acid regions were selected, and a manual alignment between Hsp90 and MutL/GyrB was performed based on the known ATP-binding motifs and crystal structure of the GHKL family (13Dutta R.

Finally, the preselected γ-phosphate-binding sites were scored using secondary structure fitting as a matching criterion. Because exact three-dimensional structural studies of Hsp90 have been confined to the N-terminal domain (12Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), we decided to study the Hsp90-ATP interactions in solution on the whole protein. A smart and reliable but nevertheless seldom applied form of ligand-binding site mapping is the iron-catalyzed chemical proteolysis, where iron is targeted with a chelating molecule that specifically binds to the protein. Oxidation of the liganded Fe2+ by O2 produces hydroxyl radicals, which in turn attack and fragment the polypeptide backbone at the binding site. This reaction has been used to map the metal-isocitrate-binding site of NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (31Soundar S. Coleman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ATP-binding site of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (25; Fig.1 A). Fig. 1 B shows the result of an Hsp90 ATP-affinity cleavage reaction. Unliganded iron produces two specific fragments (Fig. 1 B, 2nd lane), suggesting the presence of a divalent cation-binding site. ADP and ATP generate several fragments, clearly distinguishable from the iron-produced fragments, among which the most prominent and identically present is a 70-kDa band (Fig. 1 B, 3rd and 4th lanes). To map the nucleotide-binding site(s), we performed protein footprinting experiments with anti-Hsp90 antibodies raised against the C or N terminus, respectively. For the sake of consistency, fragments are labeled by C or N (indicating the intact terminus) and a number denoting the apparent molecular weight. Although ADP produced only one prominent fragment, C70 (Fig. 1 C, 1st lane), corresponding to the 70-kDa band, ATP induced three additional fragments, C73, C65, and C36 (Fig. 1 C, 2nd lane). Under these strict cleavage conditions, only fragments with terminal residues coordinating the iron-phosphate complex are seen, so the difference between the ATP- and ADP-induced cleavage is caused by the ATP γ-phosphate, coordinated by an extreme N-terminal segment (C73) and another segment from the middle domain (C36, Fig. 1 C). In other experiments only the overall amount of fragmentation increased as a function of time or concentration of ATP/ADP, but the proportion of the different fragments was constant, excluding the possibility of differential kinetics in fragmentation. 2Cs. Söti and P. Csermely, unpublished data. The specificity of the affinity cleavage has been confirmed several ways. First, excess magnesium or preincubation with SDS abolished the cleavage. Second, the free radical scavenger, glycerol did not affect the specific fragmentation,2 pointing out a highly specific, protein structure- and metal-nucleotide complex-dependent interaction at the binding site. However, the most rigorous test was a competition experiment. Geldanamycin (GA, 36 μm), a specific antagonist of the N-terminal ATP-binding site (14Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), completely inhibited the N-terminal fragmentation and did not affect the iron-specific bands (Fig.1 C, 3rd to 5th lanes). In the simultaneous presence of GA and ATP (but not in the presence of GA and iron), one C-terminal (C31 Fig. 1 C, 4th lane) and two N-terminal (N48 and N46, Fig. 1 D, 4th lane) fragments appeared, suggesting that a second ATP-binding site exists in the C-terminal domain, which becomes accessible only when the N-terminal ATP-binding site is occupied. The reason why we cannot see these additional fragments with ATP preincubation lies in the fact that the Fe2+-ATP-complex initiates an instant cleavage of the N terminus, leaving no chance for the unmasking of the C-terminal ATP-binding site. On blots with higher exposure or a higher amount of protein three additional minor fragments (C39, N38, and N39) could also be detected, but the C-terminal cleavage could not be seen, suggesting that ATP is unable to bind first to the C terminus. C-terminal binding occurs only after the N-terminal binding site is filled (but not cleaved). Experiments with another N-terminal ATP antagonist, radicicol (15Soga S. Kozawa T. Narumi H. Akinaga S.

Sass B. Eber J. Orosz Gy. Csermely P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).2 Although the affinity cleavage experiments strongly supported our initial hypothesis of two cooperative nucleotide-binding sites (21Söti Cs. Csermely P. J. Biosci. 1998; 23: 347-352Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we felt necessary to examine the phenomenon by independent approaches. The γ-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose binding assay gave the first biochemical demonstration of Hsp90 N-terminal ATP binding (6Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). By using this approach Hsp90 bound to the resin in an ATP-competable manner (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1and 2), but even very high concentrations of GA inhibited Hsp90 binding by only 60% (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Because theK D value for GA is around 1 μm, at 36 μm GA the N-terminal site is fully saturated; therefore, any further specific ATP binding to this site can be excluded. Specificity was ensured by a complete competition with free ATP (Fig.2 A, lane 4) or ATPγS,2 further substantiating the presence of a GA-independent ATP-binding site. It should noted that Felts et al. (33Felts S.J. Owen B.A.L. Nguyen P.M. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

In our hands 3–4 washes substantially decreased the low affinity C-terminal binding in the presence of GA,2 so to preserve the low affinity (but ATP-competable specific) binding, we applied two washes. As another reason for the discrepancy, we carried out the incubations at 37 °C (instead of 30 °C) (6Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J.

Söti and P. Csermely, manuscript in preparation. More importantly, we omitted dithiothreitol from the assays because the C-terminal site is sensitive to dithiothreitol.3 Finally, although we analyzed the binding of rat Hsp90 (β), Marcu et al. (20Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) could detect a C-terminal ATP binding by studying ATP-Sepharose binding of recombinant chicken Hsp90α constructs. This binding was specific and could be inhibited by ATP or GTP. Moreover, they did not include dithiothreitol in the binding buffer either. These and the other independent experiments support the reliability of our results without questioning the accurate work of Felts et al. (33Felts S.J. Owen B.A.L. Nguyen P.M. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Our other independent approach has been widely used to detect protein-nucleotide interactions. Upon UV illumination, photolysis of the purine ring of ATP generates covalent adducts with adjacent side chains of the protein. By using radioactive isotope binding, the covalent adduct can be directly visualized after separation from the unbound nucleotide (24Biswas S.B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7990-7993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A representative experiment is shown in Fig.2 B. Hsp90 was cross-linked with [α- 32P]ATP (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Cross-linking was prevented by preincubation with cold ATP, ADP, NB, and molybdate (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7, respectively) but not with GA (Fig. 2 B, lane 5; GA was not destroyed by the UV light, not shown). Interestingly, p23 induced a slight inhibition of [α-32P]ATP binding, which was not further affected by GA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8 and 9). The interference of molybdate binding with the N-terminal ATP-binding site is in agreement with its competition with GA (34Hartson S.D. Thulasiraman V. Huang W. Whitesell L. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3837-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 undergoes a conformational change upon ATP binding (8Csermely P. Kajtár J. Hollósi M. Jalsovszky Gy.

The CD spectra observed in control and ATP-containing samples are similar to those reported before (8Csermely P. Kajtár J. Hollósi M. Jalsovszky Gy. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely P., Jr. Söti Cs.

GA did not affect the CD spectrum, whereas the addition of ATP to the GA-treated sample had a deep impact on the secondary structure, indicating at least three distinct conformations: the empty, or GA(or ADP)/empty-bound (9Sullivan W.

We have shown previously that minimally oxidized low density lipoprotein, oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (Ox-PAPC), activates endothelial cells to produce MCP-1 and IL-8. By using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry methods coupled with bioassay, we report a family of epoxyisoprostane (PEIPC) and epoxycyclopentenone (PECPC) phospholipids that are the components of Ox-PAPC responsible for the majority of this activity. Ox-PAPC contains five chromatographically distinguishable active PEIPC components (m/z 825.5) and four PECPC components (m/z810.5). All nine components induced endothelial cell synthesis of IL-8 and MCP-1 in a dose-dependent fashion between 0.1 and 5 μm concentrations. The five PEIPC components had identical functional groups and all underwent dehydration to producem/z 810.5. We present evidence that these phospholipids are regioisomers with epoxide groups at the 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, or 14,15-positions of the sn-2 fatty acid and their epoxide groups is important for biological activity. We have shown previously that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α is involved in MCP-1 synthesis in response to Ox-PAPC. We now show that PEIPC and PECPC isomers are potent activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. PEIPC and PECPC isomers are strongly recognized by specific circulating murine natural autoantibodies (EO6) and accumulate in cells treated with IL-1β. These studies demonstrate that PEIPC and PECPC isomers are potent activators of endothelial cells increasing synthesis of IL-8 and MCP-1.

Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were shown to be important regulators of atherogenesis (10Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A.

Furthermore, mice lacking receptors for homologous chemokines or the chemokines themselves are more resistant toward atherosclerosis and have fewer monocytes in their lesions (2Boring L. Gosling J.

Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) that MM-LDL and Ox-PAPC increased synthesis of MCP-1 and IL-8 by HAEC. Two components of MM-LDL and Ox-PAPC, POVPC and PGPC, increased IL-8 and MCP-1 but were much less active than Ox-PAPC suggesting there were additional active molecules present in Ox-PAPC. These studies identify epoxyisoprostane and epoxycyclopentenone phospholipids as the major components of Ox-PAPC inducing MCP-1 and IL-8. We have shown previously (14Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) that the Ox-PAPC induction of MCP-1 was dependent on PPARα. The present studies demonstrate that epoxyisoprostane and epoxycyclopentenone phospholipids are potent activators of PPARα.Another goal of the current studies was to determine whether bioactive phospholipids regulating chemokine synthesis could be produced in cell membranes in response to agents known to increase free radical production. There is evidence that oxidized phospholipids may be present in chronic diseases other than atherosclerosis, and we hypothesized that these might arise from cell membrane oxidation. To test this hypothesis, the ability of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), an important regulator of many processes of chronic inflammation, to induce the formation of bioactive phospholipids in endothelial cells was examined.DISCUSSIONThese studies were designed to identify the most active oxidized phospholipids in Ox-PAPC that induce synthesis of IL-8 and MCP-1 in HAEC. We have now identified a family of PEIPC and PECPC derivatives that were more potent inducers of chemokine production than the two previously identified biologically active phospholipids present in MM-LDL (POVPC and PGPC). Significant bioactivity of PEIPC and PECPC was obtained at 100 nm (Fig. 2, A–D) as compared with the 5 μm levels necessary for POVPC and PGPC. Others have shown that 50 μm lyso-PC is necessary to increase the levels of MCP-1 protein levels by 38% in endothelial cells (28Takahara N. Kashiwagi A. Maegawa H. Shigeta Y. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 559-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).We demonstrate that the active molecules are regioisomers of PEIPC and the corresponding dehydration products (PECPC) with epoxide groups at four different locations on the 20-carbon chain. The structural characterization of these molecules was obtained by detailed mass spectrometric analysis of the active m/z 828.5 isomers, their m/z 810.5 dehydration products, and the fatty acids liberated from these phospholipids (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Derivatization with BSTFA demonstrated the presence of one hydroxyl group in them/z 828.5 isomers, which is absent in the m/z810.5 isomers. Reduction of the m/z 828.5 isomers with sodium borohydride added 4 daltons equivalent to four hydrogen atoms, and treatment of the m/z 828.5 isomers with methoxylamine hydrochloride added 58 daltons equivalent to two methoxylamine groups which suggested the presence of carbonyl and/or epoxide groups (5Watson A.D.

The presence of one epoxide group in these molecules was confirmed by specific hydrolysis of epoxide to diol (Fig. 4). All isomers ofm/z 828.5 (λmax = 252 nm) and isomers of m/z 810.5 (λmax = 257.5 nm) possessed similar UV characteristics, which is attributable to the presence of an γ,δ-epoxy, α,β-unsaturated enone inm/z 828.5 isomers and γ,δ-epoxy, α,β-unsaturated dienone m/z 810.5 isomers (5Watson A.D. Subbanagounder G. Welsbie D.S. Faull K.F. Navab M. Jung M.E. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24787-24798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These values were comparable with the structurally related Δ12-prostaglandin J2 (λmax = 248 nm, ε = 17,000), which contains a δ-hydroxy, α,β-unsaturated enone (29Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of the fatty acid isolated fromm/z 828.5 and 810.5 demonstrated the presence of epoxide at the 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, or 14,15-positions (Fig. 5). Taken together these studies confirm the structures of four regioisomers of PEIPC (m/z 828.5) and the corresponding dehydration products, PECPC (m/z 810.5) with epoxide groups at 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-positions (Fig.10). These studies show that some peaks are mainly one regioisomer, whereas the other peaks contain multiple regioisomers.The proposed mechanism for the formation of regioisomeric PEIPC and PECPC during autoxidation of PAPC is shown in Fig. 10. Oxidation of arachidonoyl phospholipids were shown to generate four regioisomers of F2 or E2/D2 isoprostanes via the prostaglandin endoperoxide phospholipid intermediates (G2-IsoP-PC and H2-IsoP-PC) (30Rokach J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It is known that allylic hydroperoxides can undergo dehydration to generate allylic epoxides (32Gardner H.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 65-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 33Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Lowe J.R. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5547-5554Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Decomposition of endoperoxide nucleus and rearrangement of allylic hydroperoxide of G2-IsoP-PC isomers is expected to form an allylic epoxide containing 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyisoprostane E2 phospholipids (PEIPC isomers, m/z 828.5). Dehydration of PEIPC isomers can generate the corresponding epoxycyclopentenone phospholipids (PECPC isomers, m/z 810.5)(5). One of the unique characteristics of epoxyisoprostane phospholipids and their dehydration products is the UV absorption maxima of 252–258 nm, which is consistent with the presence of γ,δ-epoxy, α,β-unsaturated enone. This moiety is present in only in the E-type epoxyisoprostanes of 5,6-, 8,9-regioisomers and in the D-type epoxyisoprostanes of 11,12-, 14–15-regioisomers. Even though alternative type epoxyisoprostanes are possible, we do not have any evidence to support alternative E/D-type structures. There are four possible regioisomers for epoxyisoprostanes with characteristic γ,δ-epoxy, α,β-unsaturated enone. Each regioisomer will have 16 possible diastereoisomers, and the total number of possible isomers is 64. There will be 32 possible PECPC isomers, which are the dehydration products of 64 PEIPC isomers.We demonstrate that the peaks enriched in at least three regioisomers of PEIPC and PECPC are quite effective in causing MCP-1 and IL-8 synthesis in HAEC (Fig. 2, A–D). These molecules are active as the intact phospholipid rather than as a free fatty acid and require epoxide for their biological activity (Fig. 6). The common structural motif in all these molecules is the presence of γ,δ-epoxy, α,β-unsaturated enone moiety. In previous studies only one of the isomers of m/z 828.5, 5,6-PEIPC was active in causing endothelial cells to bind monocytes (5Watson A.D. Subbanagounder G. Welsbie D.S. Faull K.F. Navab M. Jung M.E. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24787-24798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and all other fractions of m/z 828.5 and 810.5 were inactive. This could be due in part to the differences in the pathways involved in monocyte bindingversus chemokine production. Oxidized phospholipid-mediated monocyte binding involves a cAMP pathway (8Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), whereas a PPARα pathway is involved in oxidized phospholipid-mediated chemokine production (14Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Recent studies (14Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) have shown that oxidized phospholipids are potent activators of PPARα pathway and that PPARα plays an important role in mediating the effects of these lipids. Our previous studies (14Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) demonstrate that PPARα−/− mouse aortic endothelial cells do not produce MCP-1/JE in response to oxidized lipids. In the present study, we demonstrate that PEIPC and PECPC isomers were potent activators of PPARα (Fig. 7). These results are consistent with recent studies that PPARα deficiency reduced atherosclerosis and lowered MCP-1 levels in the atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE-deficient mice (34Tordjman K. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Zemany L. Weng S. Feng C. Zhang F.J. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).To determine the in vivo importance of PEIPC and PECPC isomers, we examined the recognition of these lipids by monoclonal autoantibody EO6 as well as the ability of cells stimulated by cytokines to produce PEIPC and PECPC isomers. In addition to atherosclerosis, circulating natural antiphospholipid antibodies and/or their epitopes are increased in several disease states including antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (35Tsimikas S. Witztum J.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1930-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Hörkkö S. Olee T., Mo, L. Branch D.W. Woods V.L., Jr. Palinski W. Chen P.P. Witztum J.L.

EO6 strongly recognized PEIPC and PECPC isomers (Fig. 8). The cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibody EO6 with several oxidized phospholipids has been reported previously (6Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

The PC head group is an absolute requirement for binding of EO6, and phosphorylcholine (PC), as a salt, can totally abolish the binding of EO6 to oxidized LDL (39Shaw P.X. Hörkkö S. Chang M.K. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Silverman G.J. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). As shown previously (20Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), it recognizes a variety of oxidized PC-containing phospholipids, such as POVPC, but does not recognize non-oxidized PAPC. We have prepared an extensive number of phospholipid analogues and determined the requirements for EO6 binding (40Friedman P. Horkko S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (str 12/14): M1-08860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In brief these data document the absolute requirement for the intact PC head group, but this is not sufficient in and of itself for antibody binding. Lyso-PC does not bind, nor do oxidized PS or PE phospholipids. Phospholipids with very short chain fatty acids in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, such as diC3PC do bind, although with greatly reduced affinity, compared with PC or to POVPC. EO6 does not recognize PGPC. In addition, when oxidized phospholipids undergo Schiff base formation through the reactive aldehyde generated by oxidation, the resultant compound is an excellent antigen, and in addition such oxidized phospholipids undergo aldol self-condensation reactions that also render the oxidized lipid highly antigenic. Thus, the key seems to be the mode of presentation of the PC head group. When oxidized the PC head group becomes available for EO6 recognition.Oxidative stress has been implicated to play an important role in several disease states, and several agents including peroxide, high glucose, angiotensin II, oxysterols, and cytokines were shown to cause oxidative stress in cells (41Lum H. Roebuck K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C719-C741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dimmeler S. Hermann C. Zeiher A.M. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1998; 9: 697-698PubMed Google Scholar, 43Harrison D.G. Clin.

Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15168-15175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because oxidative stress has been shown to generate free radicals in cells, we reasoned that bioactive oxidized phospholipids might be produced in response to this stress. In the present study we demonstrate that the levels of bioactive oxidized phospholipids were increased in cells that were treated with IL-1β (Fig. 9). The presence of oxidized phospholipids in unstimulated endothelial cells may be due to cell culture conditions that do not provide the same antioxidant environment as obtained in vivo. These results suggest that in addition to the presence in MM-LDL, biologically active oxidized phospholipids are produced in response to cytokines in cells and could promote the synthesis of inflammatory chemokines at the sites of inflammation.In summary, we have characterized a family of oxidized phospholipids with potent biological activity. Because these molecules are formed by free radical oxidation, they may be important in the regulation of pro-inflammatory processes involving oxidative stress such as atherosclerosis. Monocytes/macrophages are the major inflammatory cells in the atherosclerotic lesion and have been shown to be important mediators of lesion initiation and progression (1Berliner J.A. Navab M.

https://openalex.org/W2003811454,"Abstract Nitric-oxide dioxygenase (NOD) and reductase (NOR) activities of flavohemoglobin (flavoHb) have been suggested as mechanisms for NO metabolism and detoxification in a variety of microbes. Mechanisms of NO detoxification were tested inEscherichia coli using flavoHb-deficient mutants and overexpressors. flavoHb showed negligible anaerobic NOR activity and afforded no protection to the NO-sensitive aconitase or the growth of anoxic E. coli, whereas the NOD activity and the protection afforded with O2 were substantial. A NO-inducible, O2-sensitive, and cyanide-resistant NOR activity efficiently metabolized NO and protected anaerobic cells from NO toxicity independent of the NOR activity of flavoHb. flavoHb possesses nitrosoglutathione and nitrite reductase activities that may account for the protection it affords against these agents. NO detoxification by flavoHb occurs most effectively via O2-dependent NO dioxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W1968091674,"Using models of serum deprivation and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), we investigated the mechanism by which thioredoxin (Trx) exerts its antiapoptotic protection in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and preconditioning-induced neuroprotection. We showed that SH-SY5Y cells are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and responsive to both extracellularly administered and preconditioning-induced Trx. Serum deprivation and MPP+ produced an elevation in the hydroxyl radicals, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE), causing the cells to undergo mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Trx in the submicromolar range blocked the observed apoptosis via a multiphasic protection mechanism that includes the suppression of cytochromec release (most likely via the induction of Bcl-2), the inhibition of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 activation, and the elevated level of Mn-SOD. The reduced form of Trx suppresses the serum-free-induced hydroxyl radicals, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis, indicating that H2O2 is removed by Trx peroxidase. The participation of Trx in preconditioning-induced neuroprotection is supported by the observation that inhibition of Trx synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides or of Trx reductase drastically reduced the hormesis effect. This effect of Trx-mediated hormesis against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is striking. It induced a 30-fold shift in LD50 in the MPP+-induced neurotoxicity.

Reduction of Trx-S2 is catalyzed by Trx reductase with NADPH as the electron donor. The thiol oxidoreductase activity of Trx makes it suitable to function as an electron carrier for the catalytic actions of peroxidases and as a protector protein against unwarranted oxidant-mediated inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond formation (1Holmgren A.

At a relatively high concentration, Trx can enhance the biosynthesis of Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) (8Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It can also selectively activate the DNA binding affinities of certain transcription factors. For example, reduced Trx enhances the NF-κB binding affinity to DNA, whereas Trx-S2 inhibits this binding (9Galter D. Mihm S. Dröge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Similarly, Trx elevates DNA binding to transcription factors AP-1 (10Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T.

Because many oxidants or activators of cellular oxidative metabolism are inducers of apoptosis (12Jacobson M.D. Trends in Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), oxidative stress has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which metabolizes to form 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinum (MPP+), known to generate ⋅OH and oxidative stress in vivo (13Chiueh C.C. Miyake H. Peng M.T. Adv. Neurol. 1993; 60: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar), has consistently been shown to induce apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (14Sheehan J.P. Palmer P.E. Helm G.A. Tuttle J.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because serum deprivation provokes apoptosis in a variety of cells, this in vitro model has been used extensively to investigate the regulation of apoptosis. The observed apoptosis has been attributed to decreased availability of cell survival factors (15Choi M.E. Ballerman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21144-21150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and/or increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (16Saitoh T. Sakai N. Enokido Y. Uchiyama Y.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2144-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggested that serum deprivation causes an increase in both nitric oxide and ⋅OH generation in SH-SY5Y cells. The observed serum deprivation-induced cell death was inhibited by ⋅OH scavengers but not by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase. Bcl-2 (18Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L.

Moreover, reduced Trx may form a stable 1:1 complex with the apoptosis signaling-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) and protect cells from apoptosis by inhibiting ASK1 (20Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M.

In this study, we showed that Trx in the submicromolar range protects neuronal SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis caused by serum deprivation or by MPP+. Using antisense oligonucleotides and reductase inhibitors, we showed that preconditioning treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with a non-lethal serum-free stress produces a hormesis effect mediated by the induction of Trx and leads to enhanced tolerance against oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by either serum deprivation or by MPP+. Our results also revealed that 1 μm of Trx can induce Mn-SOD generation and inhibit⋅OH production, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis. In addition, Trx also induces the synthesis of Bcl-2, which inhibits cytochromec release from mitochondria and suppresses mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were kindly provided by Dr. Carol Thiele (NCI). Other human cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Trolox was from Aldrich. Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide) and human Trx antibody were from Sigma and MBL Intl. (Watertown, MA), respectively. LEHD-pNA and DEVD-pNA were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human Mn-SOD and Cu, Zn-SOD antibodies were purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Antibodies against 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE) and cytochromec were from Alpha Diagnostics Intl. (San Antonio, TX) and BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. The horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody against IgG was from Amersham Biosciences. Human cell lines such as neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), astoroglioma cells (U-87MG), and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The human lung carcinoma cells (A549) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% serum. The cells were then incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2–3 days before use. In serum deprivation experiments, serum and phenol red were removed from the culture media for either 2 h (preconditioning stress) or 24 h (lethal stress). Antisense and sense oligonucleotides (nucleotide sequences: antisense, 5′-TCTGCTTCACCATCTTGGCTGCT-3′; sense, 5′-AGCAGCCAAGATGGTGAAGCAGA-3′; mutant antisense, 5′-TCGTTCTCACCATCTTGGTCCGT-3′), designed by Saitoh and co-workers (20Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar) to be hybridized with human Trx mRNA, were used. They were synthesized as phosphorthionate oligonucleotides (S-oligo). For transfection, 2 μm of eachS-oligo were mixed with 2 μl of transfection reagent TM-50 (Promega, Madison, WI) in medium (800 μl) with or without 10% fetal bovine serum for 15 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was added to cells at the beginning of cell culture. At the end of the serum deprivation experiments, control and treated cells were harvested and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min. After rinsing with saline, the nuclear DNAs were stained with 1 μm Hoechst 33258 fluorescent dye for 5 min at room temperature (excitation/emission wavelength = 365/420 nm) and observed with a fluorescent microscope. Apoptotic cells were identified on the basis of the presence of highly condensed or fragmented nuclei. A ⋅OH-trapping reagent, sodium salicylate (1 mm), was used to monitor the generation of ⋅OH in the culture media and to protect cells from oxidative damage induced by 24-h serum deprivation. Hydroxyl adducts of salicylate (2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) were monitored using a published high pressure liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection procedure (22Chiueh C.C. Krishna G. Tulsi P. Obata T. Lang K. Huang S.J. Murphy D.L. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 581-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Cells were collected 24 h after serum deprivation stress in the presence or absence of Trx (<1 μm). The collected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After sonication in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, the protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation (excitation/emission wave lengths = 356/426 nm) were measured using a Luminescent Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (23Rauhala P. Chiueh C.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The results were presented as relative fluorescent intensity. The numbers shown were defined as relative flurorescent units per mg. Cells were homogenized in cell lysis buffer that contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was quantified using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Cell protein (20 μg) was separated by electrophoresis using a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For the slot blotting experiments, cell lysates (1 μg) were blotted on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked with a 5% skim milk solution for 1 h at room temperature. It was then probed with a 1/2000 dilution of antibody such as anti-Trx, anti-cytochromec, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Mn-SOD, anti-Cu/Zn-SOD, or anti-catalase, at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, it was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody against mouse or rabbit IgG (1:2,000) for 1 h. Membrane-bound horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein bands were monitored with chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescent signals were detected using x-ray film, and the area and intensity of the signal was integrated using the NIH Image program. Cells were homogenized in cell lysis buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. After determining the protein concentration, one-half of the cell lysates were used for measuring the catalytic activities of caspase-9 and -3 using a colorimetric assay (R & D systems). LEHD-pNA, the substrate of caspase-9, and DEVD-pNA, the substrate of caspase-3, were incubated with cell lysates at 37 °C for 2 h. Caspase-9 and -3 activities were monitored by the pNA chromophore cleaved from the substrates and quantified at 405 nm with a spectrophotometer (n = 4). The assay used was described by Yang et al. (24Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). The cytochrome c content in the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions was determined using Western blotting procedures with anti-cytochrome c antibody. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of the results obtained from the average of 4–6 independent experiments. Some of the standard error bars are smaller than the symbols of the means. Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and p values were assigned using the Newman-Keuls test. Differences among means were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05. It is known that Trx, at ten or higher micromolar ranges, can prevent apoptosis and induce expression of Mn-SOD (8Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When human brain-derived neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in serum-containing culture medium for 24 h, only about 5% of the cells underwent apoptosis as indicated by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, which was revealed by the Hoechst 33258 dye-staining method. However, when the medium was replaced with serum-free medium, the population of cells that underwent apoptosis increased from 5.8 ± 1.4% to 65.6 ± 3% (p< 0.05, Fig. 1 A). Addition ofE. coli Trx-S2 (0.01–1 μm), a membrane-permeable Trx, to the serum-free medium protected the cell from apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Similar protection, but with much lower sensitivity, was also observed with the water-soluble homologue of vitamin E, Trolox (1–100 μm). Fig. 1 B shows that the observed protective effect of Trx (e.g. 1 μm) was inhibited by the addition of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), a specific inhibitor of Trx reductase (25Arner E.S. Bjornstedt M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3479-3482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a concentration range of 5–50 μm. Experiments designed to show the effect of DNCB on apoptosis either in the presence or absence of serum revealed that at 5–10 μm DNCB did not induce apoptosis, which is in agreement with that reported by Ishikawa et al. (27Ishikawa A. Kubota Y. Murayama T. Nomura Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 277: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, at 50 μm DNCB induced 15 and 23% apoptosis in the presence and absence of serum, respectively. The results in Fig.1 B indicate that the protective species is the reduced form of Trx. It should be pointed out that Trx has been shown to enhance the proliferation of various human cell lines (28Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28865-28870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results revealed that 1 μm Trx exerted no effect on the proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Therefore, under our experimental conditions Trx simply supports the survival instead of enhancing the proliferation of cells. Serum deprivation has been shown to cause an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (16Saitoh T. Sakai N. Enokido Y. Uchiyama Y. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1996; 733: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Andoh T. Lee S.Y. Chiueh C.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2144-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that at the end of a 24-h serum-free treatment there was a 6-fold increase in ⋅OH generation relative to that found in the control experiment. This elevation was reduced by the addition of 1 μm Trx to a level slightly higher than that observed in the presence of serum. In the presence of oxygen, ⋅OH can react with lipids to form peroxy lipid radicals that can react with polyunsaturated fatty acids to generate malondialdehyde and HNE (29Rikans L.E. Hornbrook K.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 30Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The data in Fig.2 B show that 24-h serum deprivation causes a 4.5-fold increase in malondialdehyde over serum control, and Trx suppressed the formation of malondialdehyde in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Furthermore, using anti-HNE antibodies we found that serum deprivation led to an elevation of the relative intensity of HNE (261.8 ± 3.5 units) from that of the control (137.8 ± 8.5 units), and the addition of 1 μm Trx abolished this increase (118.8 ± 4.1 units). In view of the fact that apoptosis is carried out by caspases (31Nijhawan D. Honarpoar N. Wang X. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), to investigate the nature of the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation we measured the activities of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Fig. 3 shows that 24-h serum deprivation causes a 10-fold increase in both caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities as measured by the cleavage of LEHD-pNA and DEVD-pA, respectively. The elevation in the activities of these caspases was inhibited by Trx in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05). To investigate how Trx inhibits this caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade, we monitored the changes in cytochrome c levels in both mitochondria and cytosol and the level of Bcl-2 as a function of serum deprivation incubation time in the presence or absence of Trx (Fig.4 A). Serum deprivation had no effect on Bcl-2 levels, whereas the addition of 1 μm Trx caused a time-dependent elevation in the Bcl-2 level. In the absence of Trx, the cytosolic level of cytochrome cincreased significantly after 8- and 24-h incubations in serum-free medium due to its release from mitochondria, a process inhibited by the Trx-mediated elevation of Bcl-2. Fig. 4 B also reveals that under serum deprivation for up to 24 h there was no change in the level of Mn-SOD, Cu, Zn-SOD, or catalase. However, only the expression of Mn-SOD was elevated after 4 more hours of incubation in the presence of 1 μm Trx.Figure 4Effect of exogenous Trx on the expression of Bcl-2, Mn-SOD , Cu, Zn-SOD, catalase, and cytochrome crelease from mitochondria. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in serum-free medium with or without 1 μm Trx. At the indicated times, the cells were assayed for Mn-SOD, Cu, Zn-SOD, and catalase levels (A) and Bcl-2 and cytochrome clevels in both mitochondria (mito) and cytosol (cyto) (B). All proteins were quantitated by the Western blotting method using antibodies against human Bcl-2, cytochrome c, Mn-SOD, Cu, Zn-SOD, and catalase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under our experimental conditions, the level of Trx required to induce the elevation of Mn-SOD was very much lower than the 28 μm reported by Das et al. (8Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) for human lung microvascular endothelial cells. To find the reason behind this discrepancy we measured the intrinsic concentration of Trx in the cells used. Fig. 5 shows that SH-SY5Y cells contain the least amount of Trx of the cells tested. Relative to the standard, we determined that Trx is present at only about 2.3 ng/μg of protein in SH-SY5Y cells. However, there are 10.3, 10.9, and 15.2 ng of Trx per μg of protein found in U-87MG, A549, and HeLa cells, respectively. The low Trx content in SH-SY5Y cells causes these cells to be highly susceptible to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (TableI). This property also makes these cells highly responsive to the Trx added extracellularly in protecting against oxidatively induced apoptosis. The data in Table I show that 0.5 and 1 μm Trx provides a 54 and 84% reduction in serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, respectively, observed with SH-SY5Y cells after a 24-h incubation. However, cells that contain much higher levels of Trx showed that similar serum-free treatment induced significantly lower levels of apoptosis, and addition of 1 μm Trx provided no observable protection.Table ISensitivity to Trx in different human cell linesSH-SY5YU-87MGHeLaA549Apoptotic cell death (%)Serum6.3 ± 0.94.9 ± 1.22.7 ± 0.35.4 ± 0.4Serum Free+ TRX (0)63.6 ± 3.81-aSerum-free vs. Serum (p < 0.05).22.1 ± 2.41-aSerum-free vs. Serum (p < 0.05).8.6 ± 1.11-aSerum-free vs. Serum (p < 0.05).19.9 ± 2.21-aSerum-free vs. Serum (p < 0.05).+ TRX (0.5)29.4 ± 3.01-bSerum-free vs. Serum-free + Trx (p < 0.05).22.9 ± 2.08.5 ± 0.718.6 ± 2.7+ TRX (1)10.1 ± 1.31-bSerum-free vs. Serum-free + Trx (p < 0.05).18.2 ± 2.87.9 ± 0.713.3 ± 4.5Apoptotic cell death was identified using nuclear DNA staining with Hoechst 33258.

Open table in a new tab Apoptotic cell death was identified using nuclear DNA staining with Hoechst 33258. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured for 24 h with or without serum. Trx, oxidized E. coli thioredoxin was applied in μm concentrations. Andoh et al. (17Andoh T. Lee S.Y. Chiueh C.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2144-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have shown that preconditioning stress provides additional protection against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Thus, we investigated whether endogenous Trx is involved in the observed hormesis. Fig.6 B reveals that following 24-h serum-free deprivation, the level of Trx increased by more than 3-fold. However, as shown in Fig. 6 A, when the cells were subjected to a non-lethal 2-h incubation in serum-free medium 12 h prior to the 24-h serum deprivation, the level of Trx was further augmented (Fig. 6 B). The results in Fig. 6, C andD show that without the preconditioning stress, 57–72% of the cells underwent apoptosis after the 24-h serum deprivation. However, hormesis (namely, with the 2-h non-lethal preconditioning stress) reduced the number of apoptotic cells to only 10–15%. The preconditioning-induced endogenous Trx was blocked if the prestressed cells were first transfected with antisense oligonucleotide (Fig.6 B). Moreover, in prestressed cells transfected with phosphorthionate sense or antisense mutants and then subjected to preconditioning stress followed by a 24-h serum-free deprivation, the levels of Trx appeared to be similar to those found in the absence ofS-oligo or controls. The changes in the endogenous Trx levels proportionately reflect the extent of cellular protection from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, the protective effect is abolished by DNCB (5–50 μm) in a concentration-dependent manner, implying that reduced Trx is the key player in this preconditioning action. MPP+ is a Parkinsonian-producing neurotoxin (34Markey S.P. Johannessen J.N. Chiueh C.C. Burns R.S. Herkenham M.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) that is known to generate ⋅OH in vivo(13Chiueh C.C. Miyake H. Peng M.T. Adv.

Res. 1997; 48: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows that when SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1 mm MPP+ for 24 h 75% of the population underwent apoptosis, and exogenous Trx inhibited the apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, addition of 1 mm sodium salicylate, a⋅OH scavenger, drastically reduced the MPP+-induced apoptosis. Fig. 8 depicts the concentration-dependent, MPP+-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells with or without preconditioning stress. These data reveal that hormesis, which causes the elevation of the endogenous Trx concentration, drastically enhances the tolerance of cells to oxidative stress. As a result, the LD50 of MPP+ shifted from 0.1 to 3 mm due to the effect of hormesis or preconditioning stress-induced neuroprotection.Figure 8The effect of hormesis on MPP+-induced apoptotic cell death. SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were treated with ● or without ○ a 2-h serum deprivation preconditioning 12 h prior to the addition of the indicated concentration of MPP+. After a 24-h incubation with MPP+, cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 to assess the extent of apoptosis (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using serum deprivation and MPP+ as models, our investigations of mechanisms by which Trx prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis revealed that its biosynthesis is required for hormesis, beneficial effects derived from low doses of potentially harmful substances, and preconditioning protection. Trx is known to induce cell proliferation (35Gallegos A. Gasdaska J.R. Taylor C.W. Paine-Murrieta G.D. Goodman D. Gasdaska P.Y. Berggren M. Briehl M.M. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5765-5770PubMed Google Scholar), and cancer cell lines with elevated expression of Trx are resistant to a variety of apoptosis-inducing agents including ROS (36Freemerman A.J. Powis G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Trx protects cells from apoptosis is not well understood. Serum deprivation has been shown to increase the levels of intracellular ROS levels as monitored by the ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (16Saitoh T. Sakai N. Enokido Y. Uchiyama Y. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1996; 733: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a nonspecific ROS indicator. Our results in Fig. 2 reveal that the elevated ROS include⋅OH and products of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde. In addition, HNE was also elevated. Unlike the reports in the literature in which greater than 10 μm of Trx was needed to protect against apoptosis, we observed that Trx in the submicromolar concentration range can protect SH-SY5Y cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Although at a much higher concentration, the protective effect of Trolox is indicative of the fact that lipid peroxidation occurs during serum-free treatment. Trolox inhibits the formation of HNE, a product of arachidonic acid peroxidation that is known to induce apoptosis in neuronal cells (26Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28865-28870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Malecki A. Garrido R. Mattson M.P. Hennig B. Tobroek M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2278-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion is the observation that antioxidants such asS-nitrosoglutathione, N-acetylcysteine, sodium salicylate, and the iron chelator desferoxamine also inhibited serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells (17Andoh T. Lee S.Y. Chiueh C.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2144-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 2T. Andoh, P. B. Chock, and C. C. Chiueh, unpublished data. To investigate the reason why SH-SY5Y cells are much more sensitive to Trx protection than most cells reported (e.g. A549 cells) (8Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we revealed that the level of Trx in SH-SY5Y cells is relatively low compared with that found in U-87MG, A549, or HeLa cells. Consequently, SH-SY5Y cells are more susceptible to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and more responsive to extracellularly added Trx-mediated protection (see Table I). Thus, SH-SY5Y cells are a good model cell line for studying the role of Trx in cellular protection. ROS have been implicated in the induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (27Ishikawa A. Kubota Y. Murayama T. Nomura Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 277: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), a process that includes the activation of procaspase-9 and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. The mitochondria-mediated apoptosis can be suppressed by reduced Trx. Our data show that only the reduced Trx is capable of protecting SH-SY5Y cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis because the inhibition of Trx reductase by DNCB prevents the protective effects of Trx-S2. It should be pointed out that the added Trx was the oxidized Trx-S2 from E. coli, since Trx-S2 is membrane permeable (1Holmgren A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 54: 237-271Crossref Google Scholar), andE. coli Trx-S2 can serve as a substrate for human Trx reductase (8Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Sherrill K. Powis G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7271-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, our data show that the apoptosis induced by serum-free treatment was mediated by activation of caspase-9 and the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Cytosolic cytochromec is required for the formation of Apaf-1·cytochromec complex in the presence of dATP or ATP. This multimeric complex binds procaspase-9 and leads to its activation. The activation process involves Smac-induced release of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and the active caspase-9 activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3 (31Nijhawan D. Honarpoar N. Wang X. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 32Du C. Fang M. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c is inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, each of which is known to preserve mitochondrial membrane integrity (33Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). Trx inhibits the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). This inhibition is most likely derived in part from its ability to elevate the levels of Mn-SOD and Bcl-2 (Fig. 4). This enhancement was particularly pronounced after 8 h of incubation in the serum-free media containing 1 μm Trx, the time at which a significant amount of cytochrome c was released into the cytosol in the absence of added Trx. The elevation in Mn-SOD may be mediated through Trx activation of protein kinase C (28Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28865-28870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since this activation has been linked to enhanced expression of Mn-SOD mRNA (41Kim H.P. Roe J.H. Chock P.B Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37455-37460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Andoh et al. (17Andoh T. Lee S.Y. Chiueh C.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2144-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported that when SH-SY5Y cells were subjected to a serum-free treatment for 2 h (which was nonlethal) they observed an increased expression of Bcl-2 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase 24 to 36 h after treatment. As shown in Fig. 6, such nonlethal stress causes a hormesis effect caused by the induction of Trx. This preconditioning stress effect requires the synthesis of Trx since the antisense oligonucleotide to Trx mRNA abolished the enhanced tolerance to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. To further investigate the nature of this observed hormesis, we studied its effect on MPP+-induced apoptosis. Chiueh et al. (13Chiueh C.C. Miyake H. Peng M.T. Adv. Neurol. 1993; 60: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar,22Chiueh C.C. Krishna G. Tulsi P. Obata T. Lang K. Huang S.J. Murphy D.L. Free Rad. Biol.

Therefore, the observed MPTP-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells can be attributed to oxidative stress mediated by MPP+ (14Sheehan J.P. Palmer P.E. Helm G.A. Tuttle J.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our data show that MPP+-induced apoptosis can be suppressed by either Trx or the ⋅OH scavenger, sodium salicylate (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the concentration-dependent, MPP+-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells is strikingly different between cells with and without hormesis. Cells that were subjected to two hours of nonlethal preconditioning oxidative stress 12 h prior to the 24-h MPP+ treatment exhibited a drastic increase in ability to protect against ROS-induced apoptosis. The LD50 for MPP+ shifted from 0.1 mm for the control cells to 3 mm obtained with the preconditioning stressed cells. In essence, we have shown that SH-SY5Y cells are highly sensitive to Trx-mediated protection against apoptosis and to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis due to the fact that these cells contain relatively low amounts of Trx. The protective effect of the reduced Trx is derived in part from its ability to elevate Mn-SOD and Bcl-2. In addition, we showed that hormesis against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is required for the biosynthesis of Trx."
https://openalex.org/W2068058635,"Neutral matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in bone matrix degradation accompanied by bone remodeling. We herein show for the first time that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) up-regulates MMP-13 (collagenase-3) mRNA of rat calvaria-derived osteoblasts. The mRNA up-regulation was seen at 3 h in response to MIF (10 μg/ml), reached the maximum level at 6–12 h, and returned to the basal level at 36 h. MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation was preceded by up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and MMP-9 (92-kDa type IV collagenase) were also up-regulated, but to a lesser extent. The MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation was significantly suppressed by genistein, herbimycin A and 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine. Similarly, a selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) and c-jun/activator protein (AP)-1 inhibitor (curcumin) suppressed MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation induced by MIF. The mRNA levels of c-junand c-fos in response to MIF were also inhibited by PD98059. Consistent with these results, MIF stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosine, autophosphorylation of Src, activation of Ras, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, a MAPK, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38, and phosphorylation of c-Jun. Osteoblasts obtained from calvariae of newborn JunAA mice, defective in phosphorylation of c-Jun, or newborn c-Fos knockout (Fos−/−) mice, showed much less induction of MMP-13 with the addition of MIF than osteoblasts obtained from wild-type or littermate control mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF increases the MMP-13 mRNA level of rat osteoblasts via the Src-related tyrosine kinase-, Ras-, ERK1/2-, and AP-1-dependent pathway.

Collagenases are largely categorized into three classes: collagenases 1, 2, and 3, which are mainly secreted from fibroblasts and osteoblasts, neutrophils, and breast carcinoma cells, respectively (1Mauviel A.

From the data available to date, it is considered that most molecules potentially inducing bone resorption often stimulate MMP-1 production in humans and MMP-13 production in rodents. In this context, it is conceivable that MMP-13 may play a pivotal role in bone remodeling in rats. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was originally identified as a soluble factor in culture medium of activated-T cells (9Bloom B.R. Bennet B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 10David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar); however, its precise biological function was largely unknown for nearly 30 years. Following the cloning of human MIF cDNA (11Weiser W.Y. Temple P.A. Witec-Giannoti J.S. Remold H.G. Clark S.C. David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7522-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), an array of novel biological functions of this protein has been reported (12Bucala R. FASEB J. 1996; 7: 19-24Google Scholar, 13Nishihira J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). MIF is released as a hormone by the anterior pituitary gland in endotoxin shock (14Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Mitchell R.A. Martin S.B. Tracy K.J. Voelter W. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1993; 365: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) and a glucocorticoid-induced immunomodulator released from macrophages in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli (15Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Regarding the potential role of MIF in induction of MMPs, we revealed that MIF could stimulate MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA expression in synovial fibroblasts obtained from rheumatoid arthritis patients (16Onodera S. Kaneda K. Mizue Y. Koyama Y. Fujinaga M. Nishihira J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 444-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting its pathological role for direct destruction of joint tissues in autoimmune disease. In a previous study, we demonstrated that mouse osteoblasts expressed high amounts of MIF (17Onodera S. Suzuki K. Matsuno T. Kaneda K. Kuriyama T. Nishihira J. Immunology. 1996; 89: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, its pathophysiological role in the bone tissues remains to be elucidated. We herein report for the first time that MIF enhances the MMP-13 mRNA level in osteoblasts obtained from newborn rat calvariae. Following this discovery, we further investigated the signal transduction pathway of MIF in the event of MMP-13 mRNA up-regulation to elucidate its intracellular mechanism of action. The following materials were obtained from commercial sources. Collagenase, staurosporine, genistein, and herbimycin A were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan); H-7 and H-8 from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan); 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); cycloheximide, indomethacin, and tyrphostin A25 from Sigma; [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate (8 mCi/ml, carrier-free) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Wilmington, DE); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH); fetal calf serum (FCS) from HyClone (Logan, UT); α-MEM and nonessential amino acids (NEAA) from Invitrogen; Isogen RNA extraction kit and GenePure from Nippon Gene (Toyama, Japan); Hybond N nylon membrane and ECL Western blotting detection system from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody from Bio-Rad; nonimmune mouse IgG plus Pansorbin cells from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA); Ex-Taq DNA polymerase and DNA random primer labeling kit from Takara (Kyoto, Japan); curcumin from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan); pT7 vector from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA); anti-mouse Src monoclonal antibody (mAb) (GD11; mouse IgG1) and Ras activation assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); antibodies for phosphorylated-form mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20; mouse IgG1) from ICN ImmunoBiologicals (Costa Mesa, CA); mouse anti-rat MMP-13 (collagenase-3) monoclonal antibody from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); anti-c-Jun (H-79) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit from Pierce. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Recombinant rat MIF was expressed in Escherichia coliBL21/DE3 (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified as described (18Nishihira J. Kuriyama T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Ohki S. Hikichi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It contained less than 1 pg of endotoxin/μg of protein, as determined by the chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Rat calvarial osteoblasts were prepared by serial collagenase digestion as described previously (19Wong G. Cohn D.V. Nature. 1974; 252: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In brief, newborn rat calvariae (day 1) were removed from soft tissues and digested with 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase in DMEM containing 100 μm NEAA for 10 min at 37 °C five times (fractions 1–5), of which fractions 3–5 were used. After centrifugation and washing with the medium, cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and NEAA in 100 mm culture dishes in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After 48 h, nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were harvested after treatment with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and were successively passaged. Rat synovial fibroblasts were prepared by 0.2% collagenase digestion of rat knee synovial tissues. The murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was purchased from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Rat osteosarcoma cell line UMR106 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD), and cultured in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and NEAA. Rat articular chondrocytes were obtained by collagenase digestion of minced articular cartilage tissues from the femoral chondyle, femoral head, and humeral head of 8-week-old rats. Rat skin fibroblasts were obtained by harvesting outgrowing cells from explant cultures of minced skin tissues from newborn rats. All of these cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and NEAA. To examine the effect of MIF on the expression of MMP mRNA, production of MIF protein, phosphorylation of tyrosine, Src kinase activity, MAPK activity, and Ras activation, cultured rat osteoblasts of the third passages were used throughout the experiment. After reaching confluence (10–14 days after initial plating), the osteoblasts were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), serum-starved for 24 h, and challenged with 100 ng/ml, 1 μg/ml, and 10 μg/ml MIF for 6 h in 10 ml of serum-free DMEM containing NEAA. Rat PTH (10−9m and 10−8m) and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) (10−6m) were used as positive controls. Two sets of the third-passage rat synovial fibroblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells, UMR106 cells, second-passage rat articular chondrocytes, and second-passage rat skin fibroblasts were used as control cells. For the time-course study, parallel cultures of rat osteoblasts were treated simultaneously with or without 10 μg/ml MIF, and harvested at indicated intervals after stimulation. Following this, the cells were subjected to Northern blot analysis to evaluate mRNA levels of MMP-13, TIMP-1, and type I (α) procollagen (col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar)), and also to immunoblot analysis and in vitro kinase assay. To exclude possible endotoxin contamination in recombinant MIF, the effect of heat-denatured recombinant MIF treated at 65 °C for 1 h was also assessed. Then neutralizing effect of an anti-MIF monoclonal antibody (IgG1) on MIF-induced MMP up-regulation was also evaluated. The anti-MIF monoclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing mice with recombinant rat MIF as described elsewhere (20Mizue Y. Nishihira J. Miyazaki T. Fujiwara S. Chida M. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Mukai M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate involvement of c-Jun phosphorylation in the signaling pathway of MIF, calvarial osteoblasts retrieved from newborn JunAA mice were also examined. In JunAA mice, serine residues 63 and 73 of the endogenous Jun allele were substituted with alanine residues (21Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). JunAA mice were a kind gift from Dr. E. F. Wagner (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria). Calvarial osteoblasts derived from native strain C57BL/6 mice were used as wild-type osteoblasts for positive controls. We also assessed the involvement of c-Fos in the signaling pathways of MIF using calvarial osteoblasts retrieved from newborn mice that were homozygous for the Fos mutation (Fos−/−) and littermate wild type (Fos+/+) mice as controls. Mice that were heterozygous for Fos mutation (Fos+/−) (B6, 129S-Fostm1Pa female and male mice) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). After mating, the genotypes of the newborn mice obtained were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the lysed tail from each of them. These murine calvarial osteoblasts were retrieved in a manner similar to rat osteoblasts, and were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS. To investigate the signal transduction pathways regarding up-regulation of MMP-13 mRNA in response to MIF, effects of various reagents on rat osteoblasts were tested. After reaching confluence following serum starvation for 24 h, the cells were challenged with MIF (10 μg/ml) 30 min after the addition of cycloheximide (3.6 μm), indomethacin (10 μm), genistein (10 and 100 μm), herbimycin A (1 and 10 μm), PP2 (1, 10, and 50 μm), tyrphostin A25 (10 and 100 μm), staurosporine (10 and 100 nm), H-7 (1 and 10 μm), H-8 (1.5 and 15 μm), PD98059 (5 and 25 μm), SB203580 (1, 10, and 20 μm), or curcumin (1 and 10 μm) in serum-free medium. After 6 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to Northern blot analysis for MMP-13 mRNA. Rat c-jun cDNA and rat col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) cDNA probes were kindly provided by Dr. M. Sakai (Department of Biochemistry, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine) and Dr. M. Shibanuma (Department of Microbiology, Showa University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences), respectively. The templates for Northern blot analyses of rat MMP-13, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, c-fos, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from a cDNA library of rat synovial fibroblasts. Preparation of each template was as follows: MMP-13 (424 bp), sense primer 5′-GCGGGAATCCTGAAGAAGTCTAC-3′ (143–165) and antisense primer 5′-TTGGTCCAGGAGGAAAAGCG-3′ (547–566) (GenBank™ M60616); MMP-2 (217 bp), sense primer 5′-GCTGATACTGACACTGGTACTG-3′ (1642–1663) and antisense primer 5′-CAATCTTTTCCGGGAGCTC-3′ (1840–1858) (GenBank™U65656); MMP-9 (280 bp), sense primer 5′-AAGGATGGTCTACTGGCAC-3′ (553–571) and antisense primer 5′-AGAGATTCTCACTGGGGC-3′ (815–832) (GenBank™ U24441); TIMP-1 (413 bp), sense primer 5′-CAGATATCCGGTTCGCCTACACC-3′ (149–171) and antisense primer 5′-CAGGCAAGGTGACGGGACTGGAAGC-3′ (539–561) (GenBank™ L29512); c-fos (897 bp), sense primer 5′-CTGAAAGAGAAGGAAAAACTGGA-3′ (693–715) and antisense primer 5′-TGGCTCACATGCTACTAACTACC-3′ (1567–1589) (GenBank™ X06769); GAPDH (983 bp), sense primer 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACGGATTTGGC-3′ (35–60) and antisense primer 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (994–1017) (GenBank™ M17701). Each PCR product was separated by 1% agarose gel, purified by GenePure, and subcloned into a pT7 plasmid vector by TA cloning. The subcloned plasmids were transformed into DH5α-competent cells. After amplification, each insert was prepared by restriction enzyme digestion, checked by a sequencing analyzer (ABI 377A), and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from rat osteoblasts using an Isogen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was quantitated using a spectrophotometer, and equal amounts of RNA (20 μg) from control and test samples were loaded on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize RNA standards, and the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane. Fragments obtained by restriction enzyme treatments for MMP-13, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), c-jun, c-fos, and GAPDH were labeled with [α-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate using a DNA random primer labeling kit. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24–48 h. Post-hybridization washing was performed in 0.1% SDS, 0.2× standard saline citrate (SSC) (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate) at 65 °C for 15 min. The radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 film and quantitatively analyzed using the NIH Image system. The results were normalized by GAPDH mRNA levels. Cells (1 × 106 cells) were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). The protein concentrations of the cell homogenates were quantitated using a Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit. Equal amounts of homogenates were dissolved in 20 μl of Tris-HCl, 50 mm(pH 6.8), containing 2-mercaptoethanol (1%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (2%), glycerol (20%), and bromphenol blue (0.04%), and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in PBS, probed with 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine mAb or anti-Src mAb, and reacted with the goat anti-mouse IgG Ab coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The resultant complexes were processed for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol. Moreover, we performed immunoblot analysis not only for the MMP-13 protein level in response to MIF, but also for three distinct MAPKs to further elucidate their involvement in the signal transduction of MIF for expression of MMP-13. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described above except for the use of antibodies against rat MMP-13 and MAPKs, including ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. The immune complex kinase assay was performed as described previously (23Iwabuchi K. Hatakeyama S. Takahashi A. Ato M. Okada M. Kajino Y. Kajino K. Ogasawara K. Takami K. Nakagawa H. Onoé K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed, precleared by incubating with nonimmune mouse IgG plus Pansorbin cells and Protein A-Sepharose 4B overnight. The supernatant was incubated with the anti-mouse Src mAb (10 μg) and then with 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose 4B for 2 h. These procedures were performed at 4 °C. The beads were incubated in a kinase buffer containing 370 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. Thereafter, the beads were washed, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, exposed to an imaging plate for 30 min, and analyzed with a BAS2000 imaging system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Primary osteoblasts were transfected with a recombinant adenovirus carrying a kinase-defective rat C-terminal Src family kinase (Csk). The recombinant virus contains the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer, chicken β-actin promotor, and rabbit β-globin poly(A) signal and AxCATcsk (K222R), in which the lysine 222 is replaced by an arginine residue, as described previously (24Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The control virus Ax1w1 contains no foreign genes. The third-passage rat primary osteoblasts were infected with the recombinant adenovirus as follows. The cells were cultured with small amounts of DMEM containing recombinant adenovirus for 1 h at 37 °C at an indicated multiplicity of infection. Then, more than 10 volumes of medium with 10% FCS was added to the cells. After 48 h of the infection, the cells were washed, serum-starved for 24 h, and treated with MIF (10 μg/ml) for 6 h. Then they were collected and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Rat osteoblasts were labeled as described previously (25Kasuga M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.0 × 106 cells were washed twice with 50 mm HEPES containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were propagated for 15 min in phosphate-free medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), labeled with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C, and then treated with MIF (10 μg/ml) at the indicated intervals. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 4 mm EDTA, and then solubilized for 10 min on ice in RIPA lysis buffer containing 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 4 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Then the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-c-Jun antibody and Protein G-Sepharose, and to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, exposed to an imaging plate for 30 min, and analyzed with a BAS2000 imaging system. The activation of Ras was evaluated using a Ras activation assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, rat primary osteoblasts (2.0 × 106cells) were serum-starved for 24 h, treated with MIF (10 μg/ml) at the indicated intervals, washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed with 1 ml of Mg2+ Lysis/Wash Buffer (MLB). Then the lysate was precleared by glutathione-agarose, 10 μg of Raf-1 Ras-binding domain (RBD)-conjugated agarose was added, and it was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Raf-1 RBD-conjugated agarose is a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein, corresponding to the human Ras binding domain (residues 1–149) of Raf-1, provided bound to glutathione-agarose; it specifically binds to and precipitates Ras-GTP from cell lysates. After washing the beads three times with MLB, they were suspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using 1 μg/ml anti-Ras mAb as a primary antibody, and visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system. In rat calvaria-derived osteoblasts, up-regulation of MMP-13 mRNA at 6 h after the challenge with MIF was slight at the dose of 1 μg/ml, but it became apparent at the dose of 10 μg/ml (12.8-fold increase compared with the level of nonstimulated control) (Fig.1 a). The induction of MMP-13 by MIF was much higher than that by PTH (10−9 to 10−8m) (2.1-fold increase at the dose of 10−8m), a representative physiological inducer of MMP-13. TPA (10−6m), a positive control, most strongly enhanced MMP-13 mRNA (25.2-fold increase at the dose of 10−6m). The TIMP-1 mRNA level was also up-regulated, but to a much lesser extent, at doses ranging from 0.1 μg/ml to 10 μg/ml. The type I procollagen (col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar)) mRNA level was higher at the basal level and was essentially unchanged with addition of MIF. Moreover, we assessed the responsiveness of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA to MIF. MMP-9 mRNA was significantly up-regulated, similar to MMP-13 but to a lesser extent (4.5-fold increase compared with the level of the nonstimulated control at 10 μg/ml MIF), whereas MMP-2 mRNA was slightly increased. To compare expression levels of MMP-13, TIMP-1, and col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) among different cell types in response to MIF, rat primary osteoblasts, rat primary synovial fibroblasts, murine MC3T3-E1 cells, and rat UMR-106 cells were examined. MMP-13 mRNA was up-regulated by MIF (10 μg/ml) in rat primary osteoblasts and in rat synovial fibroblasts (Fig. 1 b). It was minimally changed in MC3T3-E1 cells and UMR-106 cells, in which the basal expression level of MMP-13 in UMR-106 was very high. On the other hand, TIMP-1 mRNA was slightly up-regulated by MIF in rat primary osteoblasts, but not changed in synovial fibroblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells, or UMR-106 cells. The mRNA level of col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was essentially not affected by MIF stimuli in all these cells. Furthermore, we examined mRNA expression levels in rat articular chondrocytes and rat skin fibroblasts. MMP-13 mRNA was up-regulated in the articular chondrocytes in response to MIF, but not in skin fibroblasts (Fig. 1 c). A slight increase of TIMP-1 mRNA in articular chondrocytes was also observed. To assess the structure-specific action of MIF protein, we treated MIF at 65 °C for 1 h. The potential of MIF for induction of MMP-13 mRNA was significantly reduced by the heat treatment (data not shown). We also assessed the neutralizing effect of an anti-MIF monoclonal antibody on MMP-13 mRNA expression. Addition of 50 μg/ml antibody 30 min prior to addition of MIF significantly suppressed the induction of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 mRNAs, though the neutralizing effect was incomplete (Fig. 1 d). Nonimmune mouse IgG (IgG1) minimally affected the expression of MMP-13 mRNA. We performed immunoblot analysis of MMP-13 at the protein level to confirm the results regarding the mRNA level. We found that the MMP-13 protein level was increased in response to MIF (10 μg/ml) by 24 h treatment as seen for the PTH (10−8m) and TPA (10−6m) treatment used as positive controls (Fig. 2). MMP-13 mRNA expression of rat primary osteoblasts increased at 3 h after stimulation in response to MIF (10 μg/ml), reached the maximal level at 6–12 h (13.4-fold increase compared with the level of time 0), and returned to the unstimulated basal level at 36 h (Fig.3). The mRNA level of TIMP-1 was slightly up-regulated in response to MIF at 3 h after stimulation and then decreased. The mRNA level of col(I)α (1Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was essentially unchanged throughout the time course. Prior to the up-regulation of the MMP-13 mRNA level in response to MIF, transient increases of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels were observed. The c-jun mRNA was transiently up-regulated at 1 h after stimulation, and then decreased to the basal level at 3 h. The c-fos mRNA was markedly up-regulated at 30 min after stimulation, and immediately returned to the basal level at 1 h. No significant changes of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 mRNA levels were observed in the absence of MIF (data not shown). To examine whether the effect of MIF on rat MMP-13 mRNA levels de"
https://openalex.org/W2170291310,"LMO4 belongs to the LIM-only (LMO) group of transcriptional regulators that appear to function as molecular adaptors for protein-protein interactions. Expression of the LMO4 gene is developmentally regulated in the mammary gland and is up-regulated in primary breast cancers. Using LMO4 in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified the cofactor CtIP as an LMO4-binding protein. Interaction with CtIP appeared to be specific for the LMO subclass of LIM domain proteins and could be mediated by a single LIM motif of LMO4. We further identified the breast tumor suppressor BRCA1 as an LMO4-associated protein. The C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1, previously shown to bind CtIP, also mediated interaction with LMO4. Tumor-associated mutations within the BRCT repeats that abolish interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP had no effect on the association of BRCA1 with LMO4. A stable complex comprising LMO4, BRCA1, and CtIP was demonstrated in vivo. The LIM domain binding-protein Ldb1 also participated in this multiprotein complex. In functional assays, LMO4 was shown to repress BRCA1-mediated transcriptional activation in both yeast and mammalian cells. These findings reveal a novel complex between BRCA1, LMO4, and CtIP and indicate a role for LMO4 as a repressor of BRCA1 activity in breast tissue.

This motif was originally identified in LIM homeodomain transcription factors and subsequently found in a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins including LIM-only (LMO),1 LIM kinase, and focal adhesion proteins. In these proteins, there are usually two or more LIM domains, which may occur in association with functionally divergent domains or by themselves, where they constitute the majority of the protein (1Sanchez-Garcia I.

There is no evidence to suggest that the LIM domain binds DNA, despite possessing similarity to the GATA-1 zinc finger motifs. The LMO subclass of LIM proteins comprises four members (LMO1–4), each of which is defined by two tandem LIM domains (1Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 5Rabbitts T.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These regulatory molecules appear to have essential functions in cell proliferation and lineage determination. LMO1 and LMO2, both translocated in acute T cell leukemia (T-ALL), are oncogenic within T cells (5Rabbitts T.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). LMO2 has been demonstrated to have a central role in hematopoiesis where it is required for the development of all cell lineages (6Yamada Y. Warren A.J. Dobson C. Forster A. Pannell R. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LMO2 has been established to form a multiprotein complex with the hematopoietic transcription factors SCL/TAL-1 and GATA-1 (7Valge-Archer V.E. Osada H. Warren A.J. Forster A. Li J.

LMO4 is the most divergent member of the LMO subfamily, sharing only 50% homology with the LIM domains of other LMO proteins. The LMO4 gene is widely expressed in embryonic and adult tissues, but high levels are restricted to specific cell types (14Kenny D.A. Jurata L.W. Saga Y. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11257-11262Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Sugihara T.M. Bach I. Kioussi C. Rosenfeld M.G. Andersen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently established that the LMO4 gene is highly expressed in the proliferating mammary gland during pregnancy and that it is overexpressed in greater than 50% of primary breast cancers (18Visvader J.E. Venter D. Hahm K. Santamaria M. Sum E.Y.M. O'Reilly L. White D. Williams R. Armes J. Lindeman G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14452-14457Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, high levels of LMO4 were found to inhibit mammary differentiation (18Visvader J.E. Venter D. Hahm K. Santamaria M. Sum E.Y.M. O'Reilly L. White D. Williams R. Armes J. Lindeman G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14452-14457Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism by which LMO4 functions in breast epithelium, we searched for partners of LMO4 in these cells. Two interacting proteins were identified, the cofactor CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein) and the breast and ovarian tumor suppressor protein BRCA1, which has previously been shown to associate with CtIP (19Yu X.

A multiprotein complex involving LMO4, CtIP, and BRCA1 could be demonstrated in vivo. LMO4 was found to be a repressor of BRCA1-mediated transcriptional activity, invoking a potential role for LMO4 as a negative regulator of BRCA1 function in sporadic breast cancers. The pGBT9-LMO4 bait plasmid was generated by PCR amplification of mouse LMO4 in pSP72 using the following primers: forward, 5′-CGCGGATCCCCGGCTCCCTCTCCTGGAAGCGCTGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGCAGACCTTCTGGTCTGCCAG-3′; the resultant product was inserted into the BamHI site of pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The first LIM domain (residues 1–82) of LMO4 was PCR-amplified using the forward primer (5′-CGCGGATCCTGAATCCGGGCAGCAGCTCGC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CGCGGATCCTCACCCAAATAACCTAATGTAGTCATT-3′), then cloned into theBamHI site of the FLAG-pEF1α-puro vector (22Huang D.C. Cory S. Strasser A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The second LIM domain (residues 79–165) of LMO4 was PCR-amplified using the forward primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGGTTATTTGGGAATAGCGGTGCTTG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGCAGACCTTCTGGTCTGCCAG-3′) and subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of the FLAG-pEF1α-puro vector. Expression vectors encoding Lhx1 or Lhx3 (pSV-sport-FLAG) and LMK1 were kindly provided by A. Agulnick and O. Bernard, respectively. Full-length cDNAs corresponding to the coding region of mouse or human LMO4 were cloned into the FLAG-pEF1α-puro expression vector, and a 0.7-kb mouse LMO4 cDNA fragment was cloned into pEF1α-puro vector. The expression plasmids encoding residues 45–897 of human CtIP (pCMV-HA-ns311), human BRCA1 (pcDNA3-HA-BRCA1), and mouse LMO2 (pEF1α-FLAG-LMO2) have been described previously (13Visvader J.E. Mao X.

HA-tagged CtIP deletion mutants were generated either by PCR amplification or subcloning from plasmids (19Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol.

The SZ fragment of BRCA1 (residues 1528–1863) was recloned from pCMV-Gal4b-BR-SZ (19Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol.

Chen, unpublished data. The yeast expression construct encoding the activation domain (AD) of BRCA1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) was generated by PCR amplification of the region spanning amino acids 1293–1863 of BRCA1 and subsequent cloning into pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The mammalian Gal4DBD-AD fusion construct was generated by cloning a cDNA fragment encoding the BRCA1-AD region into pCMV-Gal4b (19Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol.

Full-length cDNA encoding mouse LMO4 was inserted into the yeast expression plasmid pYX212 (Ingenious). The reporter plasmid, pG5CAT, was from CLONTECH. Details of plasmid constructions are available on request. The pGBT9-LMO4 bait plasmid (residues 15–165) was used to screen 8.4 × 106transformants from a primary breast adenocarcinoma cDNA library (24Byrne J.A. Nourse C.R. Basset P. Gunning P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), following standard protocols (CLONTECH Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System). Full-length mouse LMO4 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The GST-LMO4 fusion protein was expressed in the bacterial strain UT5600, purified according to standard protocols (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5057) Google Scholar), and used to inject rabbits to produce polyclonal antisera. The generation of rat LMO4-specific monoclonal antibodies will be described elsewhere. 3E. Y. M. Sum, G. J. Lindeman, and J. E. Visvader, unpublished data. Human embryonal kidney 293T cells (10-cm plates) were transiently transfected with 4 μg of each expression construct and/or empty vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cell extracts (0.5 ml) were prepared in whole cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and normalized for protein concentration, as determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or anti-Myc 9E10 and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and separated by SDS-PAGE (Novex). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), filters were blocked and incubated with rabbit antisera against CtIP or Ldb1 (13Visvader J.E. Mao X. Fujiwara Y. Hahm K. Orkin S.H.

Filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For detection of endogenous proteins, nuclear extracts from human HBL100 cells were prepared (26Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Zhang N. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with either anti-LMO4 rabbit antisera or a rat anti-LMO4 monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer, filters were blocked and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to either CtIP (14.1) (27Yu X. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or BRCA1 (MS110, Oncogene Research Products), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). In vitro synthesis of35S-labeled BRCA1 (C-terminal residues 1528–1863) was performed by in vitro transcription/translation of HA-pCDNA3.1-BRCA1-SZ using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Binding assays were carried out with a 10-μl aliquot of 35S-labeled BRCA1-SZ primed lysate and 100 μl (50% slurry of GST-Sepharose beads; Amersham Pharmacia) of GST-LMO4 or GST-only protein in GST interaction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed twice in GST interaction buffer containing bovine serum albumin, followed by two more washes in GST interaction buffer without bovine serum albumin. Finally, the bound BRCA1 C-terminal polypeptide was eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min in 30 μl of loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from human and mouse breast epithelial cell lines cited in previous studies (28Douglas A.M. Grant S.L. Goss G.A. Clouston D.R. Sutherland R.L. Begley C.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Northern analysis was performed (29Visvader J.E. Elefanty A.G. Strasser A. Adams J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The yeast transcription assay was performed in the yeast strain BJ5462; this was cotransformed with the LacZ reporter plasmid, YepΔ62 (generously provided by P. Vaughan), and pGBT9-BRCA1(AD), and colonies selected on media deficient in Leu and Trp. These transformants were then additionally transformed with either the pYX212-LMO4 expression plasmid or empty vector and were selected on media lacking Ura, Trp, and Leu. β-Galactosidase activities were determined using theo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside liquid culture assay following standard protocol (CLONTECH Yeast Protocols Handbook). Kidney embryonal 293T cells were transiently transfected (six-well plates) with the indicated plasmids: 0.5 μg of pG5CAT (CLONTECH), 1 μg of pCMV-Gal4b-BRCA1-AD, or 1 μg of Gal4b parental vector, and either 2 μg of FLAG-EF1α-LMO4 or 2 μg of empty control vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. CAT activity was determined using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and was normalized against protein concentration, as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify LMO4-interacting proteins in breast epithelium. A screen of 8.4 × 106transformants of a primary breast adenocarcinoma cDNA library yielded more than 800 His+ colonies. Six-hundred and fifty-nine β-galactosidase-positive clones were isolated and sequentially screened by yeast colony hybridization using cDNA probes representing the known LMO4-associated proteins, Ldb1 and deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor (DEAF1) (14Kenny D.A.

Of 150 cDNA clones sequenced, 22 were found to correspond to either Ldb1 or Ldb2, 20 encoded DEAF1, at least 70 corresponded to false positives (e.g. ribosomal, mitochondrial, and extracellular matrix proteins), while the remaining 38 cDNAs represented 9 distinct genes or expressed sequence tags. One of these clones corresponded to the complete coding sequence of CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein), which encodes a cofactor originally identified on the basis of its interaction with the transcriptional corepressor CtBP (adenovirus E1A C-terminal-binding protein) (30Schaeper U.

A specific interaction between CtIP and LMO4 was confirmed in mammalian cells. Expression vectors encoding LMO4, LMO2, or heterologous LIM domain proteins, each carrying a FLAG or Myc epitope at the N terminus, together with an expression vector harboring CtIP (residues 45–897), were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Whole cell extracts were analyzed using a coupled coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, FLAG-LMO4 and CtIP were found to specifically associate in vivo, in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments (lanes 1 and4). CtIP was not detected in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing FLAG-LMO4 alone (lane 3) or in those using an isotype-matched control antibody. A single LIM domain of LMO4 (amino acids 1–82) was found to be sufficient to mediate interaction with CtIP in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Only the first LIM domain of LMO4, but not the second LIM domain (amino acids 79–165), could associate with CtIP (lane 2). CtIP also coprecipitated with the related LIM domain protein, LMO2 (5Rabbitts T.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, lane 2), but not with the nuclear LIM homeodomain proteins Lhx1 and Lhx3 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 3), nor with LIM kinase (LMK1) (Fig.1 C, lane 4). To test the interaction between endogenous proteins in breast epithelial cells, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against full-length mouse LMO4. This antiserum recognizes a protein of about 17 kDa in breast epithelial cells and in cells transfected with an LMO4 expression vector. Nuclear extracts from HBL100 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-LMO4 antiserum (Fig. 1 D,lane 2) or preimmune serum (lane 1). Immunoblotting with a mouse anti-CtIP monoclonal antibody revealed a specific band of 125 kDa (Fig. 1 D), thus confirming thein vivo association between native CtIP and LMO4 proteins. The function of CtIP is not known but it appears to serve as a cofactor for several nuclear regulatory proteins, including BRCA1, adenovirus E1A C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), retinoblastoma, and p130 pocket proteins (19Yu X.

A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition to the defined regions that interact with these proteins, CtIP contains two potential leucine zipper domains (amino acids 120–141 and 740–761) (31Fusco C. Reymond A. Zervos A.S. Genomics. 1998; 51: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), depicted in Fig. 2 A. To delineate the domains within CtIP that mediate interaction with LMO4, a series of CtIP deletion mutants (Fig. 2 A), each linked to an N-terminal HA-epitope tag, were cotransfected with FLAG-LMO4 into 293T epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, HA-CtIP (amino acids 45–371), HA-CtIP (amino acids 371–897), HA-CtIP (amino acids 45–897), and HA-CtIP (amino acids 620–897) proteins could associate with FLAG-LMO4 (lanes 2, 4, 5, and6). In contrast, neither the HA-CtIP (amino acids 59–320) nor HA-CtIP (amino acids 281–620) mutants were immunoprecipitable by an anti-FLAG antibody (lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Thus, there are apparently two regions within CtIP that can mediate interaction with LMO4: a small domain at the N terminus (residues 45–59) and a C-terminal region (residues 620–897), which encompasses a putative leucine zipper motif (Fig. 2 A). These regions are distinct from those that associate with CtBP (amino acids 392–396), retinoblastoma (amino acids 153–157), and BRCA1 (amino acids 133–369) (19Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A.

We surveyed their expression in a panel of breast epithelial cell lines, the majority of which were derived from human breast cancers but also included immortalized human cells (184). Northern analysis revealed CtIP RNA (3.6 kb) levels were relatively uniform, while expression of the LMO4 transcripts (1.8 and 2.3 kb) varied dramatically (Fig. 3). High levels of LMO4 were apparent in a number of human breast cancer cell lines, including BT-549, BT-474, HS-578T, MDA-MB361, T-47D, and ZR-75B (Fig. 3), relative to the low levels evident in the immortalized 184 cells, as we reported recently (18Visvader J.E. Venter D. Hahm K. Santamaria M. Sum E.Y.M. O'Reilly L. White D. Williams R. Armes J. Lindeman G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14452-14457Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In human breast cancers, overexpression of the LMO4 gene has been observed at both the RNA and protein levels (18Visvader J.E. Venter D. Hahm K. Santamaria M. Sum E.Y.M. O'Reilly L. White D.

Since CtIP was recently demonstrated to interact with the breast tumor suppressor BRCA1 (19Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol.

Lee W.H. J. Biol.

Both CtIP and LMO4 were coimmunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody from 293T cells expressing Myc-tagged BRCA1, FLAG-tagged LMO4 and CtIP (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). This finding revealed that all three proteins can form a stable multiprotein complex in vivo. The presence of exogenous CtIP was not necessary for immunoprecipitation of LMO4 by the anti-Myc antibody, as shown in Fig. 4 A (lane 1). These results raised the possibility that LMO4 might directly associate with BRCA1 (see below). To further examine this interaction in epithelial cells, a rat anti-LMO4 monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from HBL100-derived nuclear extracts. This antibody specifically recognizes a 17-kDa protein in cells transfected with a LMO4 expression vector but not in those lacking LMO4. Endogenous BRCA1 was immunoprecipitated by the anti-LMO4 monoclonal antibody (Fig.4 B, lane 2), but not with a control antibody (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). This result confirms anin vivo association between LMO4 and BRCA1 and, moreover, demonstrates that this interaction occurs between native proteins in epithelial cells. Immunoblotting of the anti-LMO4 immunoprecipitated protein with anti-CtIP monoclonal antibody yielded a faint band of 125 kDa, corresponding to CtIP (Fig. 4 B, middle panel), while blotting with anti-LMO4 antibody gave rise to the expected 17-kDa LMO4 protein (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Thus LMO4, BRCA1, and CtIP have the potential to form a native complex in vivo. We investigated whether the nuclear adaptor protein Ldb1, which binds LMO4 and other LIM proteins with high affinity (14Kenny D.A. Jurata L.W. Saga Y. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By virtue of their central position in both Glc uptake and utilization, hexokinases (HKs) are ideally suited to contribute to these effects.

We recently reported that ectopic HK expression mimics the anti-apoptotic effects of growth factors in cultured fibroblasts, but anti-apoptotic roles for HKs have not been examined in other cell types or in a cellular injury model. We therefore evaluated HK overexpression for the ability to mitigate acute oxidant-induced cell death in an established epithelial cell culture injury model.

The mechanisms underlying these cytoprotective effects are poorly understood, but contributions by both altered energy metabolism and cellular redox status have been suggested. Hexokinases (HKs) play a central role in both the uptake and utilization of Glc by catalyzing the first committed step of its metabolism, the phosphorylation of Glc to yield Glc 6-phosphate. By this mechanism, HKs maintain the downhill concentration gradient that permits facilitated Glc entry into cells. They also initiate all major pathways of Glc utilization and are ideally positioned to influence metabolic flux through both the glycolytic and the pentose phosphate pathways. Glycolytic flux is intimately linked to cellular energy metabolism, whereas pentose phosphate pathway flux plays a pivotal role in maintaining the cellular redox state. In principle, therefore, HK activity may directly contribute to the salutary effects associated with Glc metabolism in the setting of oxidative stress.Three high affinity HK isoforms, HKI, HKII, and HKIII, are expressed in the mammalian kidney (10.Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, HKI constitutes the principal renal isoform and accounts for roughly two-thirds of the total Glc-phosphorylating capacity of the normal kidney. The remaining HK activity is equally attributable to the two lower abundance renal isoforms, HKII and HKIII. Very little is known, however, about the normal expression, regulation, or function of individual HK isoforms in specific renal cell types. Cortical HK activity is increased in a variety of conditions associated with structural or functional alterations in the kidney (11.Dubach U.C. Recant L. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12.Anderson J.W. Stowring L. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 224: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13.Steer K.A.

Res. 1988; 20: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but the specific cell types and HK isoforms associated with these changes have not been defined. Given the substantial proximal tubular composition of the renal cortex, it is reasonable to assume that this nephron segment contributes significantly to these changes.The proximal tubule plays a number of centrally important roles in normal renal physiology. This nephron segment also exhibits marked susceptibility to both oxidative and toxic injury in vivo and represents the principal renal cell type affected by a wide variety of pathophysiologic conditions. Because a general inverse correlation exists between endogenous HK activity and injury susceptibility in individual renal cell types (15.Schmidt U. Marosvari I. Dubach U.C. FEBS Lett. 1975; 53: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16.Vandewalle A. Wirthensohn G. Heidrich H.-G. Guder W.G. Am. J.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that HK activity may constitute an intrinsic cellular protective mechanism and play important adaptive roles in cellular responses to oxidative stress. To directly test this hypothesis and to better understand this important family of enzymes in the kidney, we first examined the functional consequences of ectopic HK expression in an established cell culture model of acute oxidant-induced proximal tubule cell injury (19.Ryan M.J.

We then investigated whether changes in endogenous HK activity could contribute to the well-described salutary effects of growth factors on this cell type (22.Hammerman M.R. Safirstein R. Harris R.C. Toback F.G. Humes H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F3-F11Google Scholar). Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was specifically selected for study on the basis of its increased renal expression during recovery from acute ischemic injury (23.Homma T. Sakai M. Cheng H.F. Yasuda T. Coffey R.J.J. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), as well as the demonstrated ability of the closely related family member EGF to ameliorate toxic and ischemic renal injury in vivo (22.Hammerman M.R. Safirstein R. Harris R.C. Toback F.G. Humes H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F3-F11Google Scholar,24.Humes H.D. Cieslinski D.A. Coimbra T.M. Messana J.M. Galvao C. J. Clin.

Bacay A. Fine L.G. Clin. Sci. 1990; 78: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These findings have led some investigators to propose protective and/or reparative roles for HB-EGF in the oxidant injury associated with renal ischemia-reperfusion (22.Hammerman M.R. Safirstein R.

The final assay mixture consisted of 1 unit/ml Glc 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mg/ml β-NADP, 6.7 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Glc, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 11.1 mmmonothioglycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 μm EDTA, and 45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Total cellular protein content was assessed by the method of Bradford (33.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213220) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin (Bio-Rad) as a reference standard, and all data were expressed as specific HK activity in units per g of total protein, where 1 unit is defined as that amount of enzyme activity resulting in the coupled formation of 1 μmol of NADPH per min at 25 °C.Metabolic AssaysGlc utilization and lactate production were evaluated as described previously (31.Robey R.B. Ma J. Santos A.V.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F742-F749PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Robey R.B. Raval B.J. Ma J. Santos A.V.P.

For these experiments, cells were tested in normal growth medium containing 7.5 mm Glc and lacking both serum and phenol red. Where appropriate, medium aliquots were assayed colorimetrically for both Glc and lactate content. Net cellular reductive capacity was also monitored using a commercially available tetrazolium reduction assay (CellTiter 96 AQueousNon-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega; Madison, WI). This in situ assay, which relies on the ability of viable cells to reduce MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (34.Barltrop J.A. Owen T.C. Cory A.H. Cory J.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1991; 1: 611-614Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar)) in the presence of the electron acceptor phenazine ethosulfate, is widely employed to monitor net cellular reductive capacity as an indicator of both proliferation and viability. Originally attributed to mitochondrial metabolism (35.Slater T.F. Sawyer B. Sträuli U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 77: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), it has subsequently been demonstrated that tetrazolium bioreduction to yield formazan chromophores is primarily extramitochondrial and largely involves the pyridine dinucleotides NADH and NADPH (36.Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that formazan generation is critically dependent upon both the uptake and continued metabolism of Glc (37.Vistica D.T. Skehan P. Scudiero D. Monks A. Pittman A. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2515-2520PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Segu V.B.G. Li G. Metz S.A. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 824-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), presumably via the coupled reduction of pyridine dinucleotides. Thus, chromophore formation will necessarily reflect both ongoing metabolic activity and oxidative consumption of reduced nicotinamide cofactor pools. MTS reduction assays were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and were exploited to monitor net cellular reductive capacity in real-time as described previously (38.Segu V.B.G. Li G. Metz S.A. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 824-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Acute Oxidative Stress ModelThe oxidative stress model used for these studies was essentially as described by Zager and colleagues (19.Ryan M.J.

HsPTC cells were routinely grown to ∼90% confluence in normal growth medium before serum deprivation overnight to induce quiescence. In preliminary testing, serum deprivation alone, for periods up to 24 h, was not sufficient to induce apoptosis in these cells. 3J. M. Bryson and R. B. Robey, unpublished observations. Quiescent cell monolayers were then exposed to H2O2 at concentrations up to 10 mm for as long as 3 h at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing physiologic levels of Glc (5.6 mm).Cell Viability/Death AssaysIn initial experiments, cell death was monitored microscopically by the uptake of both YO-PRO-1 (39.Idziorek T. De Estaquier J. Bels F. Ameisen J.C. J. Immunol. Meth. 1995; 185: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and PI, fluorescent markers of apoptosis and necrosis, respectively. Quiescent HsPTC monolayers were exposed to H2O2 (0–10 mm) for up to 3 h at 37 °C in HBSS containing 1 μm YO-PRO-1 and/or 1.5 μm PI. The cellular uptake of both fluorophores was monitored, alone and in combination, using a Carl Zeiss LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope system equipped with an argon/krypton laser as previously described (40.Robey R.B. Ruiz O. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Kear F. Wang L.-J. Li C.-J. Bernardo A.A. Arruda J.A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9894-9901Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and unstressed control cells were routinely analyzed in parallel to exclude direct toxic effects of the fluorophores. The exclusion of both YO-PRO-1 and PI from viable, non-apoptotic cells makes them useful to screen for cell death in real-time, but because not all cells are visualized by this method, additional measures are required for quantitative estimates of cell death. For this reason, quantitative assessment of apoptosis was performed under selected conditions by conventional DAPI staining and cell counting (29.Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 41.Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordán J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In these experiments, cells were fixed, where appropriate, by the direct addition of formaldehyde to the medium to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). Detached cells were allowed to settle and adhere to the slide before DAPI staining and analysis using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscopy system equipped with a matched ultraviolet light source. Apoptotic cells were manually counted and expressed as a percentage of the total cell number. At least four independent fields of ∼100 cells were scored for each experimental condition.Cytolysis AssaysPlasma membrane integrity was serially assessed by monitoring cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the culture medium using a commercially available assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, LDH activity was colorimetrically assayed in cell-free aliquots of culture supernatants via the coupled enzymatic reduction of a tetrazolium salt to generate a formazan chromophore. The total releasable pool of cellular LDH activity was always assayed in identical paired cell monolayers following lysis with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the proportion of the total activity in the supernatant was taken as an index of the degree of cell lysis.Statistical AnalysisAll data are presented as the means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed by two-tailed paired t-testing using a significance level of 95% and StatView 5.0.1 software for Macintosh computers (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).RESULTSH2O2 Decreases Both HsPTC Viability and Net Cellular Reductive Capacity in a Time- and Concentration-dependent MannerTo characterize the general response of HsPTC to acute oxidative stress, quiescent cell monolayers were exposed to varying concentrations of H2O2 (0–10 mm) in the presence of fluorescent indicators of apoptosis (1 μm YO-PRO-1) and/or necrosis (1.5 μm PI). H2O2increased the cellular uptake of both fluorophores in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with virtually all cells exhibiting YO-PRO-1 uptake and nuclear condensation characteristic of apoptosis within 2 h of exposure to 10 mmH2O2 (Fig. 1A). PI uptake exhibited similar H2O2 concentration dependence but typically lagged behind YO-PRO-1 uptake by 0.5–1.0 h. 3J. M. Bryson and R. B. Robey, unpublished observations. In addition to this temporal delay, PI uptake by cells incubated with both fluorophores was observed only in YO-PRO-1-staining apoptotic cells, suggesting the development of secondary necrotic changes in these cells. Acute oxidative stress was also associated with marked depression of in situ tetrazolium bioreduction (Fig. 1B). This effect was similarly concentration-dependent and was most marked at H2O2 concentrations associated with increased early apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Changes in net cellular reductive capacity, however, uniformly preceded the uptake of both YO-PRO-1 and PI, which is temporally compatible with roles for both metabolism and cellular redox status in this model of acute oxidant-induced cell death.Adenoviral HKI Transgene Delivery Increases Total HK Activity in a Titer-dependent MannerTo directly assess the functional consequences of primary increases in cellular Glc phosphorylating capacity, HsPTC were transfected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either a β-galactosidase reporter gene (rAd-LacZ) or an HKI transgene. As depicted in Fig. 2A, control adenoviral transfections using the β-galactosidase-expressing vector (rAd-LacZ) resulted in uniform, titer-dependent reporter gene expression. HKI overexpression using a matched vector (rAd-HKI; Fig. 2B) similarly increased total HK activity in a titer-dependent manner. Basal HK activity (17 ± 1 units/g of protein) in untransfected HsPTC was comparable in magnitude to that reported previously for both this cell line (27.Racusen L.C. Monteil C. Sgrignoli A.

Toutain J.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1949-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In paired cell monolayers, infection with rAd-HKI at a relative multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of ∼1 increased total HK activity at 24 h by over 40% (25 ± 2 units/g of protein, p < 0.001), whereas a 10-fold higher viral titer increased total HK activity nearly 4-fold (64 ± 7 units/g of protein, p < 0.001).Figure 2Adenoviral HKI transgene delivery increases total HK activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Confluent cell monolayers were routinely transfected with matched recombinant pJM17-based adenoviruses (28.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gómez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B.

As shown in A, transfections with rAd-LacZ resulted in uniform, titer-dependent reporter gene expression, with virtually all cells expressing cytochemically detectable β-galactosidase at viral multiplicities-of-infection (m.o.i.) ≥ 1. A representative set of control transfections is shown. As depicted in B, transfection with rAd-HKI resulted in similar titer-dependent HKI transgene expression. At an m.o.i. ∼ 1, rAd-HKI increased total HK activity by over 40% at 24 h (*, p < 0.001). Exposure to a 10-fold greater titer of rAd-HKI (m.o.i. ∼ 10) resulted in a corresponding 4-fold increase in total HK activity (*, p < 0.001). Higher viral titers were associated with much smaller increments in HK activity and were variably accompanied by evidence of cellular toxicity, ostensibly due to higher levels of native adenoviral gene product expression (29.Gottlob K.

As shown in Fig. 3, cells overexpressing HKI (+rAd-HKI, m.o.i. ∼1; lower panels) exhibited improved cell morphology and attachment, as well as decreased uptake of both YO-PRO-1 and PI, relative to paired untransfected controls (wt; upper panels) or cells expressing a β-galactosidase reporter gene (+rAd-LacZ, m.o.i. ∼1; middle panels) when exposed to 10 mm H2O2 for 3 h.

https://openalex.org/W2121294571,"Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is the original member of the HDGF family of proteins, which contains a well-conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence (homologous to the amino terminus of HDGF; hath) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in gene-specific regions other than the hath region. In addition to a bipartite NLS in a gene-specific region, an NLS-like sequence is also found in the hath region. In cells expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP)-HDGF, green fluorescence was observed in the nucleus, whereas it was detected in the cytoplasm of cells expressing GFP-HDGF with both NLSs mutated or deleted. GFP-hath protein (GFP-HATH) was distributed mainly in the nucleus, although some was present in the cytoplasm, whereas GFP-HDGF with a deleted hath region (HDGFnonHATH) was found only in the nucleus. Exogenously supplied GFP-HDGF was internalized and translocated to the nucleus. GFP-HATH was internalized, whereas GFP-HDGFnonHATH was not. Overexpression of HDGF stimulated DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation, although HDGF with both NLSs deleted did not. Overexpression of HDGFnonHATH caused a significant stimulation of DNA synthesis, whereas that of hath protein did not. HDGF containing the NLS sequence of p53 instead of the bipartite NLS did not stimulate DNA synthesis, and truncated forms without the C- or N-terminal side of NLS2 did not. These findings suggest that the gene-specific region, at least the bipartite NLS sequence and the N- and C-terminal neighboring portions, is essential for the mitogenic activity of HDGF after nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2050595371,"We previously demonstrated in T47D cells transfected to express the transforming growth factor-β receptor type II (TGF-βRII) that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) could stimulate Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation, potentiate TGF-β1-stimulated Smad phosphorylation, and cooperate with exogenous TGF-β1 in cell growth inhibition (Fanayan, S., Firth, S. M., Butt, A. J., and Baxter, R. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 39146–39151). This study further explores IGFBP-3 signaling through the Smad pathway. Like TGF-β1, natural and recombinant IGFBP-3 stimulated the time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of TGF-βRI as well as Smad2 and Smad3. This effect required the presence of TGF-βRII. IGFBP-3 mutated in carboxyl-terminal nuclear localization signal residues retained activity in TGF-βR1 and Smad phosphorylation, whereas IGFBP-5 was inactive. Immunoneutralization of endogenous TGF-β1 suggested that TGF-β1 was not essential for IGFBP-3 stimulation of this pathway, but it increased the effect of IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3, like TGF-β1, elicited a rapid decline in immunodetectable Smad4 and Smad4·Smad2 complexes.

It is initiated by the association between TGF-β and the type II TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRII), resulting in the recruitment of the type I TGF-β receptor (TGF-βRI) into a heteromeric complex, which allows TGF-βRII to phosphorylate and activate TGF-βRI (3ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Signaling intermediates Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by active TGF-βRI followed by their association with Smad4 and the translocation of heteromeric Smad complexes to the nucleus (4Wu R.Y.

The disruption of any of these steps can lead to the loss of TGF-β signaling. In many cases, this resistance to TGF-β-induced growth inhibition is the result of a loss or mutational inactivation of one or several of the genes that encode the signaling intermediates of the TGF-β signaling pathway. For example, inactivating mutations in TGF-βRII occur in most human colorectal and gastric carcinomas with microsatellite instability (6Markowitz S. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L.

In some epithelial cancer cells, the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β on cell growth has been shown to be mediated by the up-regulation of IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein levels such that the blockade of IGFBP-3 up-regulation by antisense oligonucleotides ablates the inhibitory effect of TGF-β (13Oh Y.

However, these studies did not suggest a functional interaction between IGFBP-3 and TGF-β signaling in their regulation of cell growth. We demonstrated this interaction by showing that in T47D cells transfected to express the TGF-βRII (T47D-RII cells), TGF-β and IGFBP-3 act together to inhibit cell proliferation, an effect not seen in control cells transfected with empty vector (T47D-vec cells). A mechanism for this concerted action was suggested by the observation that IGFBP-3 stimulates the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in these cells and potentiates the stimulation of Smad phosphorylation by TGF-β (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to further examine the role of IGFBP-3 signaling through the Smad pathway by determining its initiation through TGF-βRI phosphorylation and its downstream consequences. We now report that IGFBP-3 can stimulate phosphorylation of the cell surface receptor TGF-βRI and activate the promoter of the TGF-β-responsive gene, PAI-1, which encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). PAI-1 blocks the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, a protease that causes partial fragmentation of IGFBP-3, thus limiting its ability to inhibit IGF action (15Campbell P.G. Durham S.K.

The rabbit anti-human TGF-βRII antibody, C-16, and rabbit anti-human TGF-βRI antibody, H-100, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-human TGF-β1 monoclonal antibody (MAb240) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-phosphoserine (Poly-Z-PS1), anti-human Smad2 (LPB2), and anti-human Smad3 (LPC3) antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), and anti-Smad4 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, NY. T47D and MCF-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Stock cultures of T47D and MCF-7 cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Cytosystems, North Ryde, Australia) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 2.92 mg/ml glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. T47D cells stably transfected with either pcDNA3 (T47D-vec cells) or pcDNA3/TGF-βRII (T47D-RII cells) have been described previously (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3/TGF-βRII by the LipofectAMINE procedure as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants (MCF-7-RII cells) were selected by maintaining the culture in 800 μg/ml Geneticin for 21 days. Cell stocks were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640/insulin/glutamine medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transferred to serum-free medium 24 h before each experiment, and all experiments were conducted free of serum. A promoter-luciferase reporter construct, PAI-1/L (22Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal.

Rifkin, Departments of Cell Biology and Medicine, New York University, New York) was transfected into T47D-RII cells. Transfections were performed with 1 μg of the PAI-1/L construct by the LipofectAMINE-mediated procedure. Transfected cells were maintained in medium containing 800 μg/ml Geneticin for 21 days to select for stable transfectants. Experiments were performed on mixed population cultures of transfectants. PAI-1/L-transfected cells were seeded at 5 × 104cells/well in 12-place multiwells and were allowed to attach for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was replaced with serum-free RPMI 1640/insulin/glutamine medium containing TGF-β1, IGFBP-3, or TGF-β1 + IGFBP-3 for various times at 37 °C. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was measured using Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) protein assay dye reagent. Standards contained a range of 0–100 μg of bovine γ-globulin (Sigma), and 10 μl of each sample was used for the assay. After a 15-min incubation at 22 °C with dye reagent, absorbance was read at 595 nm. Cells in 85–90% confluent cultures in serum-free RPMI 1640/insulin/glutamine medium were treated as shown in the figures. Cells were solubilized with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (5.8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmNaH2PO4, 6.8 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 g/liter sodium deoxycholate, and 1 g/liter SDS at 4 °C for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation of TGF-βRI, TGF-βRII, or Smads, cell lysates were incubated with antibodies as indicated in the text together with packed beads of protein A/protein G-agarose plus (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the immunoprecipitated samples were resuspended in sample buffer (1.25 mm Tris, 30 g/liter SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and boiled 5 min before electrophoresis. Samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel overnight, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (24Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the detecting antibody in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 10 g/liter bovine serum albumin. Following several washes in TBS, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at 22 °C with radioiodinated protein A. After several washes with TBS buffer, the dried membrane was exposed to Hyperfilm-MP for 48–72 h before developing. Bands on gels were quantitated by scanning using a Bio-Rad Model 620 video densitometer. Data were analyzed by one-factor ANOVA, with repeated measures where appropriate using Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Post-hoc analyses used Scheffe's F test with significance set at 0.05. In a previous study, T47D cells lacking TGF-βRII expression were transfected with TGF-βRII cDNA, resulting in the restored expression of TGF-βRII and synergistic growth inhibition by TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because the activation of Smad phosphorylation by IGFBP-3 was observed in that study, we determined the role of TGF-βRI in IGFBP-3 signaling. Fig. 1 Ashows that the level of TGF-βRI expressed in the T47D-RII cell line was down-regulated compared with that seen in control T47D-vec cells. Despite the relatively low level of TGF-βRI in T47D-RII cells, the stimulation of its phosphorylation by TGFβ1 and IGFBP-3 was readily demonstrated. As shown in Fig. 1 B, in T47D-RII cells, basal-phosphorylated TGF-βRI was evident increasing with exogenous TGF-β1 treatment and peaking at 5–10 min after treatment. IGFBP-3 was also capable of inducing TGF-βRI phosphorylation in T47D-RII cells with the maximum level observed 15 min post-IGFBP-3 treatment (Fig. 1 B). Little or no TGF-βRI phosphorylation was seen in T47D-vec cells, which lack TGF-βRII, despite their abundant level of TGF-βRI, consistent with the essential role of TGF-βRII in this process (data not shown). The effect of TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 co-treatment was examined by treating the cells with IGFBP-3 for 10, 15, or 30 min, of which the final 10 min included TGF-β1 treatment. Maximal phosphorylation of TGF-βRI induced by TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 co-treatment occurred at 10–15 min post-IGFBP-3 addition to the cells, but when quantitated by densitometry there was no evidence of synergism between the two agents (data not shown). Measurement of total cell TGF-βRI by immunoblot (Fig. 1 B) and quantitation by densitometry confirmed that the observed changes in phospho-TGF-βRI were not because of changes in total levels of receptor protein despite some variability in immunoprecipitated protein among lanes. The carboxyl-terminal region of IGFBP-3 has been shown to be involved in its cell surface binding (17Firth S.M. Ganeshprasad U. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, IGFBP-3 mutated in key cell-binding residues (K228M/G229D/R230G/K231E/R232A) surprisingly retained the ability to stimulate TGF-βRI phosphorylation. Fig.1 C compares wild-type and mutant recombinant IGFBP-3 with the plasma-derived IGFBP-3 used in previous experiments. All three preparations were active in stimulating TGF-βRI phosphorylation, indicating that the ability of IGFBP-3 to induce TGF-βRI phosphorylation does not require the presence of the carboxyl-terminal basic residues. IGFBP-5 is structurally related to IGFBP-3 with similar basic residues (214RGRKR) in its carboxyl-terminal region implicated in cell and matrix binding (25Arai T. Clarke J. Parker A. Busby W.J. Nam T. Clemmon D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Booth B.A. Boes M. Andress D.L. Dake B.L. Kiefer M.C. Maack C. Linhardt R.J. Bar K. Caldwell E.E. Weiler J. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1995; 5: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this similarity to IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5 was not capable of stimulating TGF-βRI phosphorylation when compared with IGFBP-3-induced TGF-βRI phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D). MCF-7 breast cancer cells were also transfected with a TGF-βRII cDNA, resulting in their increased responsiveness to TGF-β treatment (data not shown). As seen in T47D cells, MCF-7 cells express a high level of endogenous TGF-βRI, which decreased upon TGF-βRII overexpression (Fig. 2 A). Fig.2 B illustrates that, like T47D-RII cells, both TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 induction of TGF-βRI phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells occurred rapidly. TGF-βRI phosphorylation by TGF-β1 was induced within 5 min of TGF-β1 addition, peaking at 10 min post-TGF-β1 treatment. IGFBP-3 phosphorylation of TGF-βRI was also a rapid process with maximum phosphorylation observed after 10 min. Co-treatment with TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 also shown in Fig. 2 Bdid not provide evidence of synergism between exogenous TGF-β and IGFBP-3. As with the T47D-RII cells, the measurement of total cell TGF-βRI by immunoblot (Fig. 2 B) and quantitation by densitometry (data not shown) confirmed that the observed changes in phospho-TGF-βRI were not because of changes in total levels of receptor protein. As shown in Fig.3 A, Smad2 was undetectable in lysates of T47D-vec cells either without (lane 1) or with (lane 3) immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad2 antibody. In T47D-RII cells, Smad2 was undetectable without immunoprecipitation (lane 2) but was evident on immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of anti-Smad2 antibody (lane 4), indicating substantial up-regulation in the T47D-RII cells. Similarly, little Smad3 was detectable in T47D-vec cell lysate even when immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-Smad3 antibody (lane 3), whereas abundant Smad 3 was detectable when immunoprecipitated in T47D-RII cells (lane 4). Similar up-regulation of Smad2 and Smad3 was seen in MCF-7 cells transfected to increase TGF-βRII expression (Fig.3 B). As in the T47D cells, no Smad2 or Smad 3 was detectable without prior immunoprecipitation. When measured after immunoprecipitation, it was evident that although both Smad2 and Smad3 are present in MCF-7 cells, consistent with active TGF-β signaling in these cells, their levels are increased upon TGF-βRII overexpression. We previously reported the stimulation of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation by 2.5 ng/ml of TGF-β1 and 500 ng/ml IGFBP-3, concentrations that were optimal in the inhibition of cell proliferation (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 4, Aand D, shows dose response data for Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation, respectively, in which TGF-β1 treatment was carried out for 10 min (Smad2) or 15 min (Smad3), and IGFBP-3 treatment was carried out for 30 min, optimal times from previous experiments (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although lower concentrations of IGFBP-3 were capable of inducing both Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation, 500 ng/ml IGFBP-3 gave the maximal effect, whereas 1000 ng/ml was less effective. Similarly for TGF-β1, 2.5 ng/ml was optimal in stimulating the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 with 5 ng/ml being slightly less effective (Fig. 4,A and D). In view of these results, all subsequent TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 treatment experiments used TGF-β1 at 2.5 ng/ml and IGFBP-3 at 500 ng/ml. Compared with plasma-derived IGFBP-3, recombinant IGFBP-3 was equally effective in stimulating both Smad2 (Fig. 4 B) and Smad3 (Fig. 4 E) phosphorylation. However, as seen for TGF-βRI phosphorylation, recombinant IGFBP-5 was unable to stimulate Smad2 phosphorylation (test was not conducted on Smad3). The basic domain mutant form of IGFBP-3, which was able to increase TGF-βRI phosphorylation, also increased the phosphorylation of both Smad2 (Fig.4 C) and Smad3 (Fig. 4 F). Endogenous TGF-β1 produced by T47D cells was previously shown to reduce the proliferation rate of these cells when TGF-βRII was expressed, an effect that was partially reversed by immunoneutralization of the endogenous TGF-β1 (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This finding indicates the potential for autocrine signaling by TGF-β1 in these cells, raising the question of whether the ability of IGFBP-3 to activate the Smad pathway might require endogenous TGF-β. To test this hypothesis, cells were treated with IGFBP-3 in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml anti-TGF-β1 antibody MAb240, a concentration expected from previous experiments to fully neutralize endogenous TGF-β1 in these cells (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, no phosphorylated TGF-βRI or Smad2 was observed in vector-transfected T47D cells either in the absence or presence of IGFBP-3 or MAb240. In both T47D-RII and MCF-7 cells, immunoneutralization of the endogenous TGF-β1 reduced basal TGF-βRI and Smad2 phosphorylation to almost undetectable levels, an average of 98% decrease when quantitated by densitometry. IGFBP-3 when added alone to the cells increased TGF-βRI and Smad2 phosphorylation compared with the basal level. When co-treated with IGFBP-3 plus MAb240, the phosphorylation level of both TGF-βRI and Smad2, although reduced at an average of 54% compared with that induced by IGFBP-3 alone as quantitated by densitometry, remained much higher than the basal level of phosphorylation with TGF-β1 immunoneutralized. Similar results were seen with a higher concentration of MAb240 (30 μg/ml, data not shown). These results suggest that IGFBP-3 induction of signaling through the Smad pathway can occur independently of endogenous TGF-β1 but can be enhanced by it. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 associate with Smad4 before translocation into the nucleus (5Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 27Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the level of total Smad4 protein in T47D and MCF-7 cells following treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 (Fig.6 A). There was little apparent difference in the basal level of total Smad4 between T47D-vec and T47D-RII cells. In T47D-RII cells, IGFBP-3 treatment caused a rapid decline in detectable Smad4 from 15 to 30 min after treatment. TGF-β1 treatment resulted in an even greater reduction in Smad4 protein with the level almost abolished 10 min post-TGF-β1 treatment. This time course is consistent with TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 induction of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. In T47D-vec cells, the level of Smad4 protein remained constant following IGFBP-3 treatment, whereas a small reduction was visible following TGF-β1 treatment (Fig.6 A). In contrast to the rapid decline in total Smad4 detectable after exposure of T47D-RII cells to TGF-β or IGFBP-3, no change in total Smad2 protein was detectable (Fig. 6 B). To further elucidate the role of Smad4 in TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 signaling, we examined Smad4 interaction with Smad2. The lysates of cells treated with exogenous TGF-β1 or IGFBP-3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad4 antibody followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Smad2 antibody. Fig. 6 C shows that no Smad2 is detected in T47D-vec cells, indicating the absence of any detectable interaction between Smad2 and Smad4 under basal or treatment conditions in these cells and consistent with their very low level of Smad2 expression. In T47D-RII cells, Smad2 protein was co-precipitated with Smad4 under basal conditions (Fig. 6 C, lane 1), but its detectable level decreased at 30 min after treatment with either IGFBP-3 (lane 2) or TGF-β1 (lane 3), consistent with the decreasing levels of total Smad4 as shown in Fig.6 A. Comparable results were obtained with MCF-7 cells in which both exogenous TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 treatment reduced the level of Smad4 protein as detected by immunoblot analysis. As seen in T47D cells, total Smad4 was reduced more substantially in MCF-7 cells treated with TGF-β1 than with IGFBP-3 (Fig. 6 D). The level of Smad2 was only slightly decreased in MCF-7 cells following IGFBP-3 or TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 6 E). A similar experiment with Smad3 detection was not performed in this study. To examine the downstream consequence of activating signaling through the Smad pathway, we measured the activation of the promoter forPAI-1, a gene previously characterized as being TGF-β-responsive. Dose-response data for PAI-1 activation by TGF-β1 or IGFBP-3 are shown in Fig.7, A and B. The TGF-β1 effect was maximal at 2.5–5 ng/ml (p < 0.0001 compared with base line), whereas at 10 ng/ml, TGF-β1 was unable to induce luciferase activity (p = 0.8 compared with base line), consistent with a biphasic effect also observed in TGF-β1-induced Smad phosphorylation. For IGFBP-3, maximal PAI-1induction was seen at a concentration of 600 ng/ml (p < 0.0001 compared with base line) with significant stimulation seen by 200 ng/ml (p = 0.0002 compared with base line). Higher concentrations (800–1000 ng/ml) were less potent (Fig. 7 B), again correlating with the dose-response effect of IGFBP-3 treatment on Smad phosphorylation. Fig. 7 C shows the time course of activation of the PAI-1/L construct in T47D-RII cells following treatment with TGF-β1, IGFBP-3, or both. At 30 min after treatment with either TGF-β1 or IGFBP-3,PAI-1 promoter activity was still similar to the basal level (data not shown). However, significant induction of luciferase expression by both TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 was clearly seen at 60 and 120 min after TGF-β1 addition (p < 0.0001 by repeated measures of ANOVA). Despite their interaction in inhibiting cell growth (7Fanayan S. Firth S.M. Butt A.J. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39146-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the effects of TGF-β1 and IGFBP-3 co-treatment on PAI-1transcriptional activation were not greater than that of either agent alone (p > 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2049757044,"We have previously shown that transgenic expression of catalytically inactive lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in muscle (Mck-N-LPL) enhances triglyceride hydrolysis as well as whole particle lipoprotein and selective cholesterol ester uptake. In the current study, we have examined whether these functions can be performed by inactive LPL alone or require the presence of active LPL expressed in the same tissue. To study inactive LPL in the presence of active LPL in the same tissue, the Mck-N-LPL transgene was bred onto the heterozygous LPL-deficient (LPL1) background. At 18 h of age, Mck-N-LPL reduced triglycerides by 35% and markedly increased muscle lipid droplets. In adult mice, it reduced triglycerides by 40% and increased lipoprotein particle uptake into muscle by 60% and cholesterol ester uptake by 110%. To study inactive LPL alone, the Mck-N-LPL transgene was bred onto the LPL-deficient (LPL0) background. These mice die at ∼24 h of age. At 18 h of age, in the absence of active LPL, inactive LPL expression did not diminish triglycerides nor did it result in the accumulation of muscle lipid droplets. To study inactive LPL in the absence of active LPL in the same tissue in adult animals, the Mck-N-LPL transgene was bred onto mice that only expressed active LPL in the heart (LPL0/He-LPL). In this case, Mck-N-LPL did not reduce triglycerides or increase the uptake of lipoprotein particles but did increase muscle uptake of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol ester by 40%. Thus, in the presence of active LPL in the same tissue, inactive LPL augments triglyceride hydrolysis and increases whole particle triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and selective cholesterol ester uptake. In the absence of active LPL in the same tissue, inactive LPL only mediates selective cholesterol ester uptake.

As a homodimer, it is bound to endothelial heparan sulfate proteoglycans especially in the capillaries of heart muscle, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. By hydrolysis of plasma triglyceride (TG) from chylomicrons and VLDL, the enzyme controls fatty acid uptake into tissues and releases surface components for HDL formation (for a review, see Ref. 1Goldberg I.J.

Several possible mechanisms have been proposed. It was shown that LPL can bridge between lipoproteins and lipoprotein receptors, such as the LDL receptor-related protein, and in this manner enhance whole particle uptake (for a review, see Ref. 2Beisiegel U. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). LPL can also bridge between lipoproteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (for a review, see Ref.3Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), concentrating lipoproteins in the vicinity of receptors (4Mulder M. Lombardi P.

In addition, LPL is able to mediate selective cholesterol ester uptake from HDL (6Rinninger F. Kaiser T. Mann W.A. Meyer N. Greten H. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1335-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a process that may be analogous to hepatic lipase-mediated selective cholesterol ester uptake by the liver (7Santamarina-Fojo S. Haudenschild C. Amar M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We recently confirmed that catalytically inactive LPL can function in vivo in lipoprotein metabolism and uptake by tissues (8Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transgenic mouse lines were established that expressed mutant inactive human LPL (hLPL) driven by the muscle-specificMck promoter (Mck-156N-LPL). These mice, which also have normal mouse LPL (mLPL) expression in muscle, had decreased total and VLDL-TG and in muscle had an 80% increase in uptake of VLDL protein and a 130% increase in uptake of VLDL cholesterol. This study indicated that inactive LPL could increase TG hydrolysis, whole particle lipoprotein uptake, and selective cholesterol ester uptake. However, in these experiments active LPL was also present in muscle, so we could not be certain which effects of inactive LPL were due to augmenting the function of active LPL expressed in the same tissue and which were properties of inactive LPL alone (8Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This issue has been addressed in the current study. Two mouse models were generated that, in contrast to the previously described mice, express only inactive LPL in muscle but not active LPL. One model is the homozygous LPL knockout newborn mouse with and without transgenic expression of inactive LPL in the muscle. The second is the adult LPL-deficient mouse rescued from neonatal death by active heart LPL with and without transgenic expression of inactive LPL in muscle. The latter model has catalytically active hLPL in the heart but exclusively transgenic inactive LPL expression in muscle. In these models it was shown that inactive LPL alone can mediate selective cholesterol ester uptake, but the presence of active LPL in the same tissue was required for increased triglyceride hydrolysis and whole particle lipoprotein uptake. Mice with muscle-specific transgenic expression of catalytically inactive LPL (Mck-N-LPL, 2Transgenes: Mck-N-LPL, Mck-156N-LPL, mutated, inactive muscle LPL present; He-LPL, heart LPL transgene present.

A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were crossed with heterozygote LPL knockout mice (LPL1, 3Number of mLPL genes: LPL1, heterozygote mLPL-deficient; LPL2, wild type; LPL0, homozygote mLPL-deficient. Ref. 9Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setala K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenburg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Pups heterozygous for both LPL deficiency and the Mck-N-LPL transgene (LPL1/Mck-N-LPL) were crossed again with LPL1 mice. The following genotypes resulted from this cross: 1/8 wild type (LPL2), 1/8 wild type plus inactive LPL expression (LPL2/Mck-N-LPL), 1/4 LPL1, 1/4 LPL1/Mck-N-LPL, 1/8 LPL knockout (LPL0), and 1/8 LPL knockout plus inactive LPL expression (LPL0/Mck-N-LPL). Mice with heart-specific transgenic expression of active LPL (He-LPL) were generated using an 8-kb fragment of the proximal LPL promoter (10Levak-Frank S. Hofmann W. Weinstock P.H. Radner H. Sattler W. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3165-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The transgene was bred onto the LPL0 background to produce mice expressing active LPL exclusively in the heart (LPL0/He-LPL). These mice were crossed with LPL1/Mck-N-LPL mice. The following genotypes were expected to result from this cross (12.5% each, Fig. 1): LPL1, LPL1/Mck-N-LPL, heterozygous LPL deficiency with expression of heart-LPL without (LPL1/He-LPL) and with (LPL1/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL) inactive LPL in the muscle, LPL0, LPL0/Mck-N-LPL, and mice expressing active LPL exclusively in the heart without (LPL0/He-LPL) and with inactive LPL in the muscle (LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL). Littermate controls were used for all experiments. Mice were fed a regular chow diet with 4.5% of energy from fat; mice had free access to food and water. Genotypes were determined by PCR from tail tip DNA. To determine the genotype at the LPL locus, a previously reported 3-primer PCR was used (11Levak-Frank S. Weinstock P.H. Hayek T. Hofmann W. Verdery R. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17182-17190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another 3-primer PCR was established to detect transgenes for heart- and muscle-specific LPL expression by using specific upstream primers (5′-CGT TGA GCC CCG TTA TCG TT-3′ for He-LPL and 5′-CAC AGG GGC TGC CCC CGG GTC ACA TCA AG-3′ for Mck-N-LPL) with a common downstream primer (5′-CCT GTT ACC GTC CAG CCA TGG ATC ACC-3′). This PCR resulted in a 646-bp (He-LPL) and a 477-bp (Mck-N-LPL) PCR product. Total cellular RNA was extracted from frozen tissues (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a Gene Amp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a random primer mix. From total cDNA, mLPL was detected with a PCR using two specific primers (5′-CCG AGG AAT TCT GCG CCC TGT AAC-3′ and 5′-GTT ACC GTC CAG CCA TGG ATCACCA-3′) resulting in a 421-bp PCR product (13Merkel M. Weinstock P.H. Chajek-Shaul T. Radner H. Yin B. Breslow J.L. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PCR from total cDNA for expression of transgenic hLPL was done with the primers 5′-CAG TGT CCG CGG GCT ACA CC-3′ and 5′-CTC TGC AAT CAC GCG GAT AGC-3′, one of which bound before and one after intron 3 of the LPL minigene. In the inactive LPL minigene one TaqI cutting site was removed by the mutation. Therefore, digestion of the PCR product (398 bp) from unmutated wild type LPL (as in He-LPL) yielded three digestion fragments (181, 109, and 108 bp). Digestion of the PCR product from mutated, inactive LPL yielded two fragments (290 and 108 bp). Thus, expression of active and inactive LPL mRNA could be differentiated. Muscle tissues from 18-h-old pups expressing no transgenic LPL, enzymatically active hLPL (MCK-LPL, Ref. 14Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W.

Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in muscle were compared on different mLPL backgrounds. After barbiturate injection and decapitation, the carcasses were frozen in TissueTek, and 4-μm-thick cryocut sections from unfixed tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and oil red O. Small specimens from skeletal muscle were fixed in 3% cacodylate-buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.3) for 4 h, postfixed with 1% OsO4 in sodium cacodylate buffer, dehydrated, and finally embedded in Agar 100. Azure-methylene blue-stained semithin sections were examined by light microscopy. For quantification of lipid droplets, an arbitrary scale from 0 (no lipid droplets) to 4 (highest amounts of lipid droplets) was used. In addition, ultrathin sections were cut with a Reichert OmU4 Ultracut ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Philips EM 400 electron microscope at 80 kV. Histological analysis of 5–6-month-old mice was done after perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline from individual organs as described above. For immunofluorescence staining of hLPL, muscle tissue from the upper foreleg of 3-month-old mice was frozen in 5-methylbutan, which was precooled in liquid nitrogen, and then cut into 6-μm-thick sections, fixed in cooled methanol, and blocked with 5% donkey serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin-C in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% glycine. An anti-hLPL monoclonal antibody was directly labeled using the Alexa 568 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sections were incubated with a monoclonal antibody concentration of 1:500 (1 μg/ml). Cell nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindol. Control sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Blood was taken after 6 h of daytime fasting by puncture of the retro-orbital plexus. Plasma TG and cholesterol were determined using commercial kits that were adapted to microtiter plates. Lipoproteins were separated by sequential ultracentrifugation using 60 μl of plasma from individual mice, and cholesterol in the fractions was determined (15Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar). The qualitative distribution of the plasma lipoproteins was confirmed by gradient ultracentrifugation using 200 μl of pooled plasma in a continuous KBr gradient from 1.21 to 1.0 g/ml. Human chylomicrons from apoC-II-deficient donors were labeled in vitro with [1,2-3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether using cholesteryl ester transfer protein (provided by Dr. A. Tall, Columbia University, New York) as reported previously (13Merkel M. Weinstock P.H. Chajek-Shaul T. Radner H. Yin B. Breslow J.L. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Chylomicron apoproteins were labeled in vitro with125I-tyramine cellobiose (16Pittman R.C. Taylor C.A., Jr. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 612-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chylomicrons were reisolated by double ultracentrifugation. Less than 5% of125I label was found in chylomicron lipids. For turnover studies, anesthetized mice (seven to eight per group) were injected into their tail vein with chylomicrons labeled with 1.5 × 106 dpm [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether and 2 × 106 dpm 125I-tyramine cellobiose. Chylomicron turnover was determined from 15 μl of plasma drawn 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min after injection. Data were analyzed for individual animals using a two-pool exponential decay model, and the half-life for each label was calculated. After 60 min, the blood was removed by cardiac puncture, the right atrium was opened, and the carcass was perfused through the left ventricle with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 units of heparin. Organs and plasma were first counted for 125I, and the lipids were then extracted (17Dole V.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) and counted in scintillation fluid. In addition to chylomicrons, human VLDL particles were double-labeled as described for chylomicrons. VLDL labeled with 1.5 × 106 dpm [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether and 2 × 106dpm 125I-tyramine cellobiose was injected into LPL0/He-LPL and LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL mice (six per group), and data were gathered as described above. Unless otherwise stated, results are given as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was tested using two-tailed Student's t test. Analysis of turnover studies was made using the computer program Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To obtain mice expressing only inactive hLPL and no active mLPL, male LPL1/Mck-N-LPL mice were bred with LPL1 females. Since both LPL0 and LPL0/Mck-N-LPL mice die after about 24 h of life (8Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whole litters were sacrificed 18 h after delivery. From 27 litters, 168 mice with the expected genotype ratio were born (LPL2, 14.9%; LPL2/Mck-N-LPL, 12.5%; LPL1, 26.2%; LPL1/Mck-N-LPL, 22.6%; LPL0, 12.5%; and LPL0/Mck-N-LPL, 11.3%). After birth mice of all genotypes did not show any obvious differences. At 18 h of age, LPL0 and LPL0/Mck-N-LPL mice appeared pale due to high TG levels. TG and cholesterol from 18-h-old mice are given in Table I. On the LPL2 background, inactive LPL reduced TG by 47% (p < 0.005) and cholesterol by 20% (p < 0.005). On the LPL1 background, TG levels were reduced by 34% (p < 0.01), and cholesterol was not significantly changed. On the LPL0 background, TG dramatically increased to over 4,000 mg/dl, however, no significant effect of inactive LPL was observed. Therefore, inactive LPL reduced TG only in the presence of active LPL.Table IPlasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels of 18-h-old micenTriglyceridesCholesterolmg/dlLPL225150 ± 9887 ± 21LPL2/Mck-N-LPL2179 ± 2670 ± 12p<0.005<0.005LPL144219 ± 12684 ± 16LPL1/Mck-N-LPL38143 ± 9180 ± 14p<0.01NSLPL0214392 ± 2338153 ± 63LPL0/Mck-N-LPL194098 ± 2187172 ± 79pNSNSWhole litters of LPL1 × LPL1/Mck-N-LPL matings were sacrificed at 18 h of age and genotyped.

Open table in a new tab Whole litters of LPL1 × LPL1/Mck-N-LPL matings were sacrificed at 18 h of age and genotyped. The blood was examined for total TG and cholesterol. Data are mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to compare the influence of the transgene on the respective mouse LPL background. Muscle tissues from 18-h-old mice expressing wild type LPL (LPL2), wild type LPL plus inactive LPL (LPL2/Mck-N-LPL), no wild type LPL (LPL0), and no wild type LPL plus inactive LPL (LPL2/Mck-N-LPL) were stained with azure-methylene blue (Fig. 2,A–D insets, respectively) and with oil red O. In wild type animals a few finely disperse lipid droplets are seen (1 unit). In wild type animals with inactive LPL, more droplets are present. On the LPL0 background, despite very high TG, there were no muscle lipid droplets in mice without or with inactive muscle LPL. The light microscopic observations were confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 2). Therefore, lipid droplet accumulation in muscle does not occur if inactive LPL alone is expressed but also requires the expression of active LPL. Since LPL0 mice suffer neonatal death (9Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setala K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenburg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin.

To generate such mice, LPL1/Mck-N-LPL and LPL0/He-LPL mice were crossed (see Fig. 1 for complete breeding strategy). Taking into consideration the neonatal death of LPL0 and LPL0/Mck-N-LPL mice, the number of mice with each of the other six expected genotypes surviving to adulthood would be 16.7% per genotype. In actual fact in the 269 pups from 52 litters that survived to adulthood the genotypes were distributed as follows: LPL1, 15.3%; LPL1/Mck-N-LPL, 12.8%; LPL1/He-LPL, 17.0%; LPL1/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL, 18.1%; LPL0/He-LPL, 17.3%; and LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL, 19.5%. Organ-specific expression of the transgenes was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR as shown in Fig.3. Unmutated, active hLPL was found in the hearts of both LPL0/He-LPL and LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL but not in muscle and adipose tissue of these mice (181- and 109/108-bp bands). Mutated, inactive LPL was found in the muscle and in lesser amounts in the heart in LPL1/Mck-N-LPL and in LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL (290- and 108-bp bands). A low amount of Mck-N-LPL transgene expression in the heart is expected (19Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mouse LPL was present in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue in LPL1 and LPL1/Mck-N-LPL mice but not in LPL0/He-LPL and LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL mice. Therefore, adult mouse lines expressing inactive LPL with and without active LPL in muscle were established. Lipid and lipoprotein levels were determined on 10–12-week-old mice using blood drawn after a daytime fast (Table II) and 2 h after 200-μl olive oil challenge (Table III). In fasted LPL1 mice, inactive LPL reduced plasma TG by 40% in males (p < 0.001) and by 39% in females (p < 0.001). These results for total TG were reflected in VLDL-TG levels. After gavage, TG rose by about 100% in LPL1 mice. In this situation, inactive LPL reduced TG by 50% (p < 0.02) and VLDL-TG by 52% (p < 0.01). LPL-deficient mice rescued by active heart LPL (LPL0/He-LPL) had lower TG levels than LPL1 mice in the fasted state. On this background, inactive LPL did not reduce TG or VLDL-TG. After gavage, TG rose by almost 400% in LPL0/He-LPL mice. As in the fasted state, inactive LPL changed neither TG nor VLDL-TG levels on this background. Mice expressing both mLPL and active He-LPL (LPL1/He-LPL) also had lower TG and VLDL-TG levels than LPL1. In the fasted state, inactive LPL did not reduce TG and VLDL-TG on this background. However, after gavage with olive oil, inactive LPL reduced TG by 38% (p < 0.01) and VLDL-TG by 41% (p < 0.01). Total cholesterol and VLDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol were unchanged by muscle expression of inactive LPL on any background. Sequential ultracentrifugation data were confirmed by density gradient centrifugation (data not shown). Taken together these data show that inactive LPL must be expressed along with active LPL in the same tissue to exert its TG-lowering effect.Table IIPlasma lipoprotein levels in adult miceTGVLDL-TGTCVLDL-CLDL-CHDL-Cmg/dlMale mice LPL1117 ± 2357 ± 1675 ± 1411 ± 2.513 ± 3.856 ± 9.4 LPL1/Mck-N-LPL70 ± 2422 ± 1279 ± 119 ± 2.614 ± 2.959 ± 7.4 p<0.001<0.01NSNSNSNS LPL0/He-LPL58 ± 5.215 ± 3.084 ± 13.38 ± 1.724 ± 3.865 ± 9.9 LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL56 ± 8.517 ± 4.489 ± 13.48 ± 2.020 ± 6.267 ± 9.3 pNSNSNSNSNSNSLPL1/He-LPL61 ± 9.118 ± 5.087 ± 138 ± 2.221 ± 3.665 ± 7.1 LPL1/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL59 ± 8.516 ± 4.190 ± 158 ± 1.323 ± 4.868 ± 11.2 pNSNSNSNSNSNSFemale mice LPL193 ± 1737 ± 15.372 ± 5.47 ± 1.112 ± 1.852 ± 1.8 LPL1/Mck-N-LPL57 ± 8.121 ± 11.175 ± 119 ± 5.413 ± 3.151 ± 12 p<0.001<0.05NSNSNSNS LPL0/He56 ± 1723 ± 7.486 ± 1016 ± 1.613 ± 3.050 ± 3.3 LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL53 ± 1319 ± 3.994 ± 6.714 ± 4.716 ± 3.354 ± 11 pNSNSNSNSNSNS LPL1/He-LPL52 ± 4.622 ± 2.187 ± 6.515 ± 1.214 ± 3.950 ± 6.0 LPL1/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL52 ± 5.819 ± 3.889 ± 14.612 ± 7.015 ± 5.654 ± 3.4 pNSNSNSNSNSNSIndividual plasmas from 8–10 mice after 6 h of daytime fasting were separated by ultracentrifugation.

To investigate the organ uptake of lipoproteins, metabolic studies with radioactively labeled human chylomicrons from apoC-II-deficient donors were performed (Fig.4). On the LPL1 background, Mck-N-LPL increased lipoprotein protein uptake from chylomicrons into the muscle by 60% (125I-tyramine cellobiose protein: LPL1, 8.6 ± 2.3 cpm/mg; LPL1/Mck-N-LPL, 13.7 ± 2.6 cpm/mg;p < 0.005) and increased cholesterol ester uptake into muscle by 109% ([3H]cholesterol ether: LPL1, 0.37 ± 0.2 cpm/mg; LPL1/Mck-N-LPL, 0.71 ± 0.2 cpm/mg;p < 0.005). The presence of inactive LPL in muscle did not influence spleen, adipose tissue or heart 125I-tyramine cellobiose protein or [3H]cholesterol ether uptake. On the LPL0/He-LPL background without any active LPL in the muscle, Mck-N-LPL did not increase lipoprotein protein uptake into muscle (125I-tyramine cellobiose protein: LPL0/He-LPL, 6.6 ± 1.3 cpm/mg; LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL, 7.3 ± 1.9 cpm/mg;p = NS). However, on the LPL0/He-LPL background, Mck-N-LPL did increase the uptake of cholesterol ester into muscle by 41% ([3H]cholesterol ether: LPL0/He-LPL, 0.63 ± 0.09 cpm/mg; LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL, 0.96 ± 0.23 cpm/mg;p < 0.005). Again the presence of inactive LPL in muscle did not influence spleen, adipose tissue, or heart uptake. On the LPL1/He-LPL background, Mck-N-LPL mediated a 66% increased uptake of 125I-tyramine cellobiose protein (p < 0.05) and a 95% increased uptake of [3H]cholesterol ether (p < 0.005) into the muscle. On this background, the presence of inactive LPL in muscle also did not influence spleen, adipose tissue, or heart uptake. The results with doubly labeled chylomicrons were confirmed with doubly labeled VLDL. On the LPL0/He-LPL background, Mck-N-LPL did not increase muscle lipoprotein protein uptake from VLDL (125I-tyramine cellobiose protein: LPL0/He-LPL, 1.13 ± 0.4 cpm/mg; LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL, 1.25 ± 0.3 cpm/mg; p = NS), whereas cholesterol ester uptake was increased by 64% ([3H]cholesterol ether: LPL0/He-LPL, 0.36 ± 0.1; LPL0/He-LPL/Mck-N-LPL, 0.58 ± 0.17 cpm/mg; p < 0.02). Therefore, inactive LPL in muscle along with active LPL augments lipoprotein particle and selective cholesterol ester uptake. However, in the absence of active LPL in the same organ, inactive LPL increases only selective cholesterol ester uptake but not whole particle uptake.

https://openalex.org/W2105797498,"We have determined the solution structure of an albumin binding domain of protein G, a surface protein of group C and G streptococci. We find that it folds into a left handed three-helix bundle similar to the albumin binding domain of protein PAB from Peptostreptococcus magnus. The two domains share 59% sequence identity, are thermally very stable, and bind to the same site on human serum albumin. The albumin binding site, the first determined for this structural motif known as the GA module, comprises residues spanning the first loop to the beginning of the third helix and includes the most conserved region of GA modules. The two GA modules have different affinities for albumin from different species, and their albumin binding patterns correspond directly to the host specificity of C/G streptococci and P. magnus, respectively. These studies of the evolution, structure, and binding properties of the GA module emphasize the power of bacterial adaptation and underline ecological and medical problems connected with the use of antibiotics.

These studies of the evolution, structure, and binding properties of the GA module emphasize the power of bacterial adaptation and underline ecological and medical problems connected with the use of antibiotics. human serum albumin the second albumin-binding domain of protein PAB fromP. magnus strain ALB8 distance difference matrix protein G-related albumin-binding the third albumin-binding domain of protein G fromStreptococcus strain G148 heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear Overhauser effect root mean square hydrogen-deuterium high-performance liquid chromatography concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of binding immunoglobulin nuclear magnetic resonance In the complex molecular interplay between a pathogen and its human host, protein-protein interactions play important roles. For instance, bacteria express surface proteins that interact with abundant human extracellular proteins with high affinity and specificity. In human plasma, albumin (HSA)1and immunoglobulins (Ig) are the quantitatively dominating proteins, and significant human pathogens have developed surface proteins that bind these and other plasma proteins (for references, see Ref 1Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of the most well known such proteins are protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (2Forsgren A. Sjöquist J. J. Immunol. 1966; 97: 822-827PubMed Google Scholar) and protein G of group C and G streptococci (3Björck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar, 4Reis K.J. Ayoub E.M. Boyle M.D.P. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3091-3097PubMed Google Scholar), which both bind to the Fc region of IgG. In 1980, Myhre and Kronvall (5Myhre E.B. Kronvall G. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 6-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that HSA could bind to the surface of various streptococcal species, including group C and G streptococci. It was later found that protein G was responsible also for the interaction with HSA (6Björck L. Kastern W. Lindahl G. Widebäck K. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein G has separate binding domains for IgG and HSA (7Guss B. Eliasson M. Olsson A. Uhlén M. Frej A.-K. Jörnvall H. Flock J.-I. Lindberg M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 8Åkerström B. Nielsen E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13388-13391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as a result C and G streptococci are in vivo covered with an inner layer of IgG and an outer layer of HSA. Peptostreptococcus magnus are strictly anaerobic bacteria that are part of the indigenous human flora of the skin, oral cavity, and gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Some isolates of this species bind HSA (9Myhre E.B. J. Med. Microbiol. 1984; 18: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and notably these isolates are mostly from patients with deep wound infections (10de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that HSA binding turns the commensal P. magnus into a potential pathogen. The surface protein of P. magnus binding HSA is called PAB, and it contains a domain of 45 residues showing a high degree of sequence homology with the HSA binding domains of protein G (11de Château M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the gene encoding PAB suggested that this domain originates from protein G and has been transferred to and introduced into the pab gene through the action of a conjugational plasmid (related to pCF10 of Enterococcus faecalis) followed by a recombinational event (11de Château M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interspecies exchange of a structurally well defined motif represents the first example of so-called module shuffling (12Patthy L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 351-361Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in prokaryotic cells, and the motif was designated the GA (proteinG-related albumin binding) module. Functionally, GA-expressing bacterial strains show increased growth rates in the presence of HSA, whereas strains that do not bind HSA are unaffected (10de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that the HSA binding property adds selective advantages to the bacteria, which may also explain why HSA-binding P. magnus strains are more virulent than nonbinding strains (10de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the GA module of protein PAB originating from protein G, designated ALB8-GA, has been reported previously (13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein G from strain G148 (3Björck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar) contains three GA modules (14Olsson A. Eliasson M. Guss B. Nilsson B. Hellman U. Lindberg M. Uhlén M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the one nearest the C terminus of these (G148-GA3) exhibits 59% sequence identity at the protein level with ALB8-GA (see Fig. 1 A). To enable a structural comparison of the two GA modules, the solution structure of G148-GA3 has now been determined using NMR spectroscopy. NMR methods were also used to identify the albumin binding site of the two GA modules. This structural information, together with data obtained by competitive binding experiments with purified albumin and serum from different mammalian species, underlines the power of bacterial adaptation. Thus, our results suggest that the structure and albumin binding properties of the two GA modules studied here reflect bacterial host specificity. Expression and purification of ALB8-GA will be described elsewhere. 2M. U. Johansson, H. Nilsson, J. Evenäs, S. Forsén, T. Drakenberg, L. Björck, and M. Wikström (2002) J. Mol. Biol., in press. A peptide corresponding to a truncated ALB8-GA lacking the six N-terminal residues was purchased from Clinical Chemistry, Malmö General Hospital, where it was synthesized and subsequently purified using high performance liquid chromatography. The expression and purification of G148-GA3 were carried out as described previously (15Kraulis P.J. Jonasson P. Nygren P.-Å. Uhlén M. Jendeberg L. Nilsson B. Kördel J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of G148-GA3 at a concentration of 25 μm in 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was monitored by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm between 4 and 95 °C at a heating rate of 50 °C h−1 using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatted cell holder and using a 1-mm cell. All NMR spectra were recorded using a single sample of 2 mmG148-GA3 containing 50 mm phosphate buffer (uncorrected pH 7.2), 0.4% NaN3, and 10% D2O. All experiments were performed at a temperature of 27 °C using Varian Unity 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers. Spectra were processed with the NMRPipe program (16Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) using linear prediction in the 15N and/or13C dimensions of the three-dimensional spectra. The spectra were assigned, and the nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) and coupling constants were derived using the interactive graphics program ANSIG (17Kraulis P.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 627-633Google Scholar, 18Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbell-Burk S.L. Van Aken T. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). NOEs were obtained from three-dimensional15N- and 13C-separated NOE spectra, φ restraints were obtained from HNHA spectra, and χ1restraints were derived from HACAHB and HNHB experiments. Distance restraints were obtained by classifying relative NOE cross-peak intensities as strong (1.8–2.7 Å), medium (1.8–3.3 Å), weak (1.8–5.0 Å), and very weak (1.8–8.0 Å). Distances involving methyl groups, aromatic ring protons of Tyr and Phe, and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons were represented as a (Σr−6)−1/6 sum (19Nilges M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An additional correction of 0.5 Å was added to the upper distance limits for methyl groups. For 3 J HNHα values smaller than 5 Hz, constraints for the φ angle were included as −60 ± 20°. The χ1 angle was restrained, when possible, to one of the intervals −60 ± 20°, 60 ± 20°, or −180 ± 20° based on HACAHB, HNHB, and qualitative short range NOE patterns. Structures were generated using the program X-PLOR (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) modified to incorporate a conformational data-base potential for proteins (21Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Initial structures were obtained by distance geometry embedding using all atoms without metrization. These structures were thereafter refined using restrained simulated annealing. Nonbonded contacts are represented by a quartic van der Waals repulsion term (23Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). No hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, or 6–12 Lennard-Jones empirical potential energy terms are present in the target function used for simulated annealing. ALB8-GA and G148-GA3 were radiolabeled with 125I using the chloramine-T method (24Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6714) Google Scholar). HSA was coupled to polyacrylamide beads (Immunobeads, Bio-Rad). The binding of radiolabeled ALB8-GA to HSA-beads was blocked with unlabeled ALB8-GA, G148-GA3, or a synthetic peptide corresponding to a truncated ALB8-GA lacking the six N-terminal residues, respectively, as described previously (25Frick I.-M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Gomi H. Sjöbring U. Björck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8532-8536Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The binding of radiolabeled ALB8-GA and radiolabeled G148-GA3 to HSA-beads, respectively, was blocked with purified albumin and serum from different mammalian species (all from Sigma). A stock solution of rabbit serum albumin was titrated into free GA module (2 mm ALB8-GA or 1 mm G148-GA3) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.02% NaN3 and 10% D2O. Two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra at different albumin concentrations were recorded at a temperature of 37 and/or 47 °C using a Varian Unity 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. CD measurements were performed to investigate the thermal stability of G148-GA3 and to enable comparison with the remarkable thermal stability of ALB8-GA (26Johansson M.U. de Château M. Björck L. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Wikström M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both G148-GA3 (Fig. 1 B) and ALB8-GA (26Johansson M.U. de Château M. Björck L. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Wikström M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) start to unfold only at high temperatures. However, because of the gradual unfolding over a large temperature range it is not possible to determine the transition midpoint of the thermal denaturation for either of the two GA modules. The assignment of G148-GA3 has been reported previously (15Kraulis P.J. Jonasson P. Nygren P.-Å. Uhlén M. Jendeberg L. Nilsson B. Kördel J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The calculation of the G148-GA3 solution structure described here and evaluation of the structures obtained, based on agreement with experimental data, precision, and geometric quality is summarized in TableI. Of the final 50 structures computed, 30 structures having lowest energy and which simultaneously exhibited no distance violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 5°, were chosen for further analysis.Table IRestraints and structural statistics of G148-GA3Restraints used in the structure calculationNo. of distance restraintsIntraresidue294Sequential207Medium range230Long range108Total839No. of dihedral angle restraintsφ29χ110Total39Total number of restraints878Structural statisticsAgreement with constraintsNo. of violationsDistance restraint violations (>0.5 Å)0Dihedral angle violations (>5 °)0r.m.s. deviations from experimental restraintsDistance restraints (Å)0.028 ± 0.003Dihedral restraints (°)0.09 ± 0.14r.m.s. deviations from idealized geometry1-aIdealized covalent geometry is based on the parallhdg.pro force-field in X-PLOR (20).Bonds (Å)0.0028 ± 0.0001Angles (°)0.37 ± 0.02Impropers (°)0.31 ± 0.04Precisionr.m.s. deviations from average coordinates (residues 1–45)1-bResidue 18 is missing in the G148-GA3 sequence.Backbone atoms (Å)0.51All heavy atoms (Å)1.04Geometric qualityLennard-Jones van der Waals energy (kcal mol−1)−202 ± 9Ramachandran analysis1-cThe program PROCHECK_NMR (18) was utilized in the Ramachandran analysis.Residues in most favored regions (%)90.0Residues in additionally allowed regions (%)8.0Residues in generously allowed regions (%)1.7Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.3All variances are ± 1 S.D.1-a Idealized covalent geometry is based on the parallhdg.pro force-field in X-PLOR (20Brünger A.T.

The lack of distance violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 5° in combination with data for average root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from experimental restraints and average r.m.s. deviations from idealized geometry suggest that the computed structures do indeed agree well with experimental data (TableI). Average r.m.s. deviation from the average coordinates is 0.51 Å for the backbone (N, Cα, C′) atoms (Table I) when overlaying all residues of the defined GA module sequence (Fig. 1 A). All three helices are well defined with r.m.s. deviations of 0.39, 0.21, and 0.33 Å (the extents of helices are defined below). As for ALB8-GA, the relative orientations between the helices of G148-GA3 are also well defined, although not as well defined as the individual helices, as seen from the slightly higher r.m.s. deviation of 0.50 Å when superimposing all helices simultaneously. A stereo view of the superposition of the ensemble of 30 structures onto their unminimized average coordinates is shown in Fig.2 A, wherein the unordered character of the long N terminus is readily apparent, as is the distinct three-helix bundle structure formed by the remaining residues. Observed 13C chemical shifts (15Kraulis P.J. Jonasson P. Nygren P.-Å. Uhlén M. Jendeberg L. Nilsson B. Kördel J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) correlate well with the computed structures, having typical random coil values for the first 16–17 residues and showing typical helix values for three regions of consecutive residues. The geometric quality of the structures is manifested by a large negative Lennard-Jones van der Waals energy and by a large portion of the non-glycine residues having their φ and ψ angles in the most favored regions of a Ramachandran plot (Table I). As seen from Fig. 2 A, G148-GA3 is a three-helix bundle with a left twist. Segments −1–15, 20–27, and 32–45 in G148-GA3 are determined to be helical, and the relative orientations of the three helices are nearly anti-parallel; Ω12 = 171 ± 3, Ω13 = 13 ± 2, and Ω23 = 159 ± 3°. The secondary structure assignment was calculated using the method of Kabsch and Sander (27Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar) within the PROCHECK_NMR (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) program. Ribbon images of the GA modules shown in Fig. 2, B and C, and tube representations shown in Fig. 2 D illustrate the overall structural similarity of the two modules. However, there are differences between the structures. The lengths of the helices in the two GA modules are not the same according to Kabsch and Sander secondary structure assignment calculations of each ensemble. The first helix in G148-GA3 starts already at residue −1, which is in the segment not belonging to the actual protein G sequence (see legend to Fig. 1 A), and continues until residue 15. By contrast, the first helix in ALB8-GA runs between residues 4 and 13, i.e.this helix is seven residues shorter than the corresponding helix in G148-GA3. Helix 2 starts at residue 20 in both GA modules and ends at residue 27 in G148-GA3 but at residue 28 in ALB8-GA. The third helix starts at residue 32 and ends at residue 45 in both GA modules. Thus, the lengths and locations of helices 2 and 3 are nearly identical. Interestingly, this is the region hosting the albumin binding site (see below) and also the most conserved region of GA modules. The relative helix orientations in both GA modules are similar, with Ω12 = 171 ± 3, Ω13 = 13 ± 2, and Ω23 = 159 ± 3° for G148-GA3, and Ω12 = 167 ± 4, Ω13 = 26 ± 4, and Ω23 = 158 ± 4° for ALB8-GA. The largest difference is observed for Ω13 of the two sets of solution structures. The r.m.s. deviation of backbone atoms for residues belonging to the defined GA module sequence was 1.94 Å, whereas the r.m.s. deviation of backbone atoms for the 32 residues determined to be helical in both GA modules, segments 4–13, 20–27, and 32–45, was 1.69 Å. For both G148-GA3 and ALB8-GA, the structure closest to the mean was utilized for the r.m.s. deviation calculations. The ensembles of structures have also been compared through a distance difference matrix (29Akke M. Forsén S. Chazin W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 102-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (DDM). The DDM of average intramolecular Cα–Cα distances (Fig. 2 E) reveals that a majority of the significant differences are located in the proximity of residue 18 in ALB8-GA (Thr-18), at which position there is a deletion in the G148-GA3 sequence (Fig. 1 A). To analyze the interaction between each GA module and HSA, a competitive binding assay was used. In this assay, the binding of radiolabeled ALB8-GA to HSA-beads was blocked with unlabeled ALB8-GA and G148-GA3, respectively (Fig. 1 C, filled squares and circles, respectively). The inhibition curves obtained had similar shapes, suggesting the same binding site on HSA for ALB8-GA and G148-GA3. However, compared with ALB8-GA, a 100-fold higher concentration of G148-GA3 was required for efficient inhibition. Thus, the results from this competitive binding assay indicate that ALB8-GA has higher affinity for HSA than G148-GA3 has. To determine relative affinities, a competitive binding assay was again utilized. Purified albumin and serum from different mammalian species were used to block the binding of radiolabeled ALB8-GA and radiolabeled G148-GA3, respectively, to HSA-beads. TableII demonstrates that for each GA module the affinities for purified albumin from human, baboon, and rhesus monkey are of the same magnitude. The interactions between mouse, rabbit, and bovine albumin and the GA modules are noticeably weaker. The discrepancy in affinity for HSA in Table II versus Fig.1 C could be caused by the different assays that were used. Fig. 1 C shows the GA modules competing with ALB8-GA for binding to HSA. Table II describes albumin from different mammalian species competing with HSA in binding to ALB8-GA and G148-GA3, respectively. Thus, the numbers in Table II reflect interactions between each GA module and different albumins.Table IIInhibition of the binding of the two GA modules to HSA-beads by albumin from different mammalian species, shown as IC50 valuesSpeciesALB8-GAG148-GA3Human3.1 nm1.6 nmBaboon2.3 nm2.0 nmRhesus monkey4.0 nm3.0 nmMouse1.1 μm10.2 nmRabbit46.7 μm1.3 μmCow8.7 μm0.3 μm Open table in a new tab Among the different mammalian sera that were tested, human, baboon, rhesus monkey, rat, and cat could inhibit the interaction between ALB8-GA and HSA-beads quite efficiently, whereas a weaker inhibition was obtained with mouse, rabbit, bovine, guinea pig, dog, and horse sera (Table III). Goat, swine, and sheep sera have too low affinity for ALB8-GA to be detected in these experiments. As shown in Table III, the interaction between G148-GA3 and HSA-beads, on the other hand, could be inhibited by all mammalian sera tested, although rabbit, bovine, and goat sera were weak inhibitors. Taken together the data indicate that the GA module from C and G streptococci, G148-GA3, has broader albumin binding specificity compared with the ALB8-GA module from P. magnus.Table IIIInhibition of the binding of the two GA modules to HSA-beads by serum from different mammalian species; dilution of serum required for 95–100% inhibitionSpeciesALB8-GAG148-GA3Human1:10,0001:100,000Baboon1:10,0001:100,000Rhesus monkey1:10,0001:100,000Mouse1:1001:10,000Rat1:10,0001:1,000,000Rabbit–3-aDilution 1:10 gives 22% inhibition.1:10Cow–3-bDilution 1:10 gives 53% inhibition.1:100Guinea pig1:101:10,000Dog1:1001:10,000Cat1:1,0001:10,000Goat1:100Horse1:101:1,000Swine1:1,000Sheep1:1,0003-a Dilution 1:10 gives 22% inhibition.3-b Dilution 1:10 gives 53% inhibition. Open table in a new tab In the present study, the albumin binding site of the GA modules was determined from two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC NMR titration experiments in which rabbit serum albumin was added stepwise to a solution of each GA module. Rabbit serum albumin was chosen because the interaction between this albumin and the GA modules is weak (the IC50 of rabbit serum albumin is 1,000–10,000-fold greater than the IC50 of HSA; see Table II), leading to fast exchange conditions, which makes it possible to follow the perturbation of the chemical shift of most backbone 15N and1H resonances during the titrations. As described above, competitive binding experiments demonstrate that the two GA modules bind to the same site on HSA, and it is most likely that they bind to the same site on rabbit serum albumin also. However, because of the low affinity it was not possible to obtain inhibition data of the type shown in Fig. 1 C for rabbit serum albumin. The chemical shift perturbations obtained by tracking cross-peaks through titrations and the broadened cross-peaks caused by intermediate exchange are indicated in Fig. 3,A and B, where 0.6 eq of rabbit serum albumin have been added to each GA module at 37 °C. These conditions were chosen for illustration because they represent the highest concentration of rabbit serum albumin at 37 °C for which data are available for both GA modules. A full (from 0 to 1 eq of albumin) titration for ALB8-GA at 47 °C is shown in Fig. 3 C and identifies the same 18 residues as being most perturbed, although some (Tyr-22, Ala-29, Glu-34 (outside the selected region in Fig. 3 C), and Val-35) of the residues with broadened cross-peaks at 37 °C now instead change chemical shift significantly as expected when going from intermediate to fast exchange because of the higher temperature. Only cross-peaks associated with residues Thr-31 and Glu-33 (outside the displayed region in Fig.3 C) are broadened beyond detection in the presence of 1 eq of rabbit serum albumin at this higher temperature. Some (Trp(-1), Ser-19, and Val-32) of the residues with broadened cross-peaks at 37 °C, together with the unaffected His-46, are not visible at the higher temperature even in the absence of rabbit serum albumin, possibly because of faster proton exchange with solvent. The 13 residues with most perturbed (Δδav = ((Δδ(1H))2 + (0.2Δδ(15N))2)½ > 0.08 ppm) cross-peaks (Tyr-22, Phe-23, Asn-24, Ala-25, Ile-26, Lys-28, Ala-29, Glu-34, Val-35, Asn-36, Ala-37, Leu-43, and Lys-44) at 47 °C (which were also the residues with most shifted or broadened cross-peaks at 37 °C) are also indicated in Fig. 3 C. In summary, the 18 significantly perturbed residues of ALB8-GA are Trp(-1), Ser-19, Tyr-22, Phe-23, Asn-24, Ala-25, Ile-26, Lys-28, Ala-29, Thr-31, Val-32, Glu-33, Glu-34, Val-35, Asn-36, Ala-37, Leu-43, and Lys-44. Using criteria similar to those for ALB8-GA, 20 residues (Glu-11, Asp-13, Val-17, Ser-19, Tyr-22, Asn-24, Leu-25, Asn-28, Ala-29, Thr-31, Val-32, Glu-33, Gly-34, Val-35, Lys-36, Ala-37, Leu-43, Ala-44, Ala-45, and Leu-46) of G148-GA3 were identified as significantly perturbed at 37 °C. The obtained chemical shift perturbations are mapped by color-coding onto the surfaces of the GA modules in Figs. 3,D and E. Perturbations, i.e. chemical shift changes or broadening beyond detection of ligand cross-peaks upon binding, result from a number of direct and indirect structural and dynamic effects, and therefore interaction surfaces described by chemical shift perturbation methods are usually larger than the region in direct contact (30Spitzfaden C.

Jahnke W. Radhakrishnan I. Tennant L. Reymond M. Chung J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Not all of the significantly perturbed residues in ALB8-GA and G148-GA3 are surface exposed and thus cannot readily participate in the binding. For example, Ile-26 and Val-32 in ALB8-GA only have a total solvent accessible surface area of 1.1 Å2. These two conserved residues also have the least solvent accessible surface area (28.1 and 7.0 Å2 for Ile-26 and Val-32, respectively) in G148-GA3. The total solvent accessible surface area of the significantly perturbed residues is 1,300–1,400 Å2 in both GA modules, but it should be noted that some chemical shift information is missing (e.g. because of overlap) in one or both GA modules, preventing more extensive comparisons of albumin-binding sites. To analyze the importance of the N-terminal residues in the interaction, HSA binding of radiolabeled ALB8-GA to HSA-beads was blocked with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a truncated ALB8-GA lacking the six N-terminal residues (Fig. 1 A). The inhibition curve obtained (Fig. 1 C, open squares) had a shape similar to those for ALB8-GA and G148-GA3, suggesting the same binding site on HSA. However, compared with ALB8-GA, higher concentrations (∼1,000 times more) of the truncated ALB8-GA were required for efficient inhibition. Thus, competitive binding experiments indicate that the N terminus of the ALB8-GA construct is not crucial for the interaction with HSA, but the data show that this part is important for an efficient binding to take place, a fact also put forth by the previous hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments (13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that HSA contains one binding site for protein G, formed by loops 6–8 of HSA (32Falkenberg C. Björck L. Åkerström B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This region also contains the binding sites for tryptophan, fatty acids, and thyroxine. ALB8-GA has a tryptophan residue at position −1 which is missing in the truncated ALB8-GA lacking the six N-terminal residues, and this may explain the lower affinity for this peptide. The cross-peak corresponding to backbone 15N and 1H resonances of Trp(-1) was one of the 18 significantly perturbed in the titrations. Unfortunately, no data could be obtained for the cross-peak of the indole 15N and 1H resonances because this cross-peak is not visible at 37 or 47 °C, presumably the result of fast proton exchange with solvent. We have tried previously to map the albumin binding site of ALB8-GA by performing hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments on free and HSA-complexed GA module (13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in those experiments, nearly every residue exhibited a decreased amide proton exchange rate in the complex, preventing identification of a distinct albumin binding site. As described above, availability of 15N-labeled ALB8-GA (and the related G148-GA3) has now enabled15N-1H HSQC NMR titrations yielding a more distinct albumin binding site. In the previous hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments all residues, except Thr-05, Thr-18, Ser-19, Asp-20, Phe-21, Val-32, and Glu-33, were affected in some way. Even the unstructured and flexible (according to 15N NMR spin relaxation experiments)2 N terminus was found to be protected in the complex and therefore affected by binding. The large number of affected residues may be the result of albumin binding affecting the conformational dynamics of ALB8-GA, and therefore the binding site could not be determined from hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments alone. In the present study the importance of the N terminus for binding has been confirmed by the competitive binding experiment (Fig. 1 C) as well as by NMR titrations (Fig.3 A). Sequence differences between GA modules with different affinities for HSA (13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) indicated that a conserved region (residues 26–33) in the end of helix 2 and the beginning of helix 3 could contribute to the albumin binding. Especially Val-32, although unprotected in the hydrogen-deuterium experiments, was assumed to be part of a region crucial for the interaction with HSA. An explanation for the fact that surface-exposed residues, such as Val-32, at the putative binding interface are less protected than some buried residues was proposed previously (33Benjamin D.C. Williams D.C. Smith-Gill S.J. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9539-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Solvent penetration may be facilitated by transient opening of the complex allowing contact surface amide-hydrogens to exchange, whereas motions required for exchange of core amide-hydrogens would still be more restricted. In this study, Val-32 was shown to be affected in the 15N-1H HSQC NMR titration experiments for both GA modules, indicating the importance of this residue. One of the main conclusions from the present study, and a point of difference from the previous study (13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), is the distinctness with which it is seen that helix 1 is essentially unaffected by albumin binding for both GA modules (Fig. 3, A and B). G148-GA3 (Ref. 15Kraulis P.J. Jonasson P. Nygren P.-Å. Uhlén M. Jendeberg L. Nilsson B. Kördel J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and present study), like ALB8-GA (13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Johansson M.U. de Château M. Björck L. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Wikström M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), has a similar three-helix bundle structure as the IgG binding domains (34Gouda H. Torigoe H. Saito A. Sato M. Arata Y. Shimada I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9665-9672Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) of protein A from S. aureus (designated E, D, A, B, and C from the N terminus), even though they display different binding properties and show no sequence homology. These three three-helix bundles all show high temperature stability (Refs. 13Johansson M.U. de Château M. Wikström M. Forsén S. Drakenberg T. Björck L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and 35Cedergren L. Andersson R. Jansson B. Uhlén M. Nilsson B. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and present study), most likely because of hydrophobic residues forming the core of the protein domains. The most tangible structural difference is the relative helix orientations. The Fc binding site of protein A is defined by helices 1 and 2 (36Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 37Gouda H. Shiraishi M. Takahashi H. Kato K. Torigoe H. Arata Y. Shimada I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the Fv binding site is defined by helices 2 and 3 (38Starovasnik M.A. O'Connell M.P. Fairbrother W.J. Kelley R.F. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, in all the three-helix bundles discussed here (ALB8-GA, G148-GA3, and the IgG binding domain(s) of protein A), a single face of the molecules, composed of residues from two helices, forms the corresponding binding site. The GA module has been subject to shuffling between C/G streptococci and P. magnus (11de Château M. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12147-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The predecessor of protein PAB, called urPAB, has been identified (10de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It lacks the shuffled GA module but contains an analogous domain, uGA, showing 38% sequence identity with the GA module. The uGA domain, which is found also in protein PAB, binds HSA with much lower affinity than the GA module (10de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In proteins PAB and urPAB, the uGA domain is located in the same position. Moreover, the presence of a gene sequence adjacent to the GA module with homology to a region of the conjugational plasmid pCF10, and the fact that P. magnus strains expressing protein PAB are tetracycline-resistant, 3E. Holst and L. Björck, unpublished data.suggest that the uGA domain is older than the more recently acquired GA module and that antibiotics could represent the selective pressure behind the shuffling. This notion is supported further by the observation that strains of P. magnus expressing protein PAB, a more efficient albumin-binding surface protein, grow better and are isolated from patients with deep wound infections (10de Château M. Holst E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26609-26615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) who are often treated with broad spectrum antibiotics such as tetracycline. In this dynamic and ongoing evolution, interdomain so-calledrecer sequences with intron-like function appear to play an important role (39de Château M. Björck L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8490-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In relation to the present study, it is noteworthy that C/G streptococci infect virtually all mammalian species, whereasP. magnus has been isolated only from humans. During the relatively short time period when the protein G-GA of C/G streptococci has been part of protein PAB of P. magnus, its only function has therefore probably been to bind HSA. As a result, PAB-GA binds non-primate albumins with much lower affinity than it binds primate albumins, whereas for G-GA the difference in affinity between non-primate and primate is much less pronounced (Tables II and III). The studies of the evolution, structure, and binding properties of the GA module emphasize the power of bacterial adaptation. They also underline ecological and medical problems connected with the use of antibiotics. The results suggest that under the selective pressure of antibiotics, P. magnus, a member of the normal bacterial flora, can turn into a potential pathogen through module shuffling."

Recent advances have revealed that HSP47 recognizes the (Pro-Pro-Gly) n sequence but not (Pro-Hyp-Gly) n and that HSP47 recognizes the triple-helical conformation. In this study, to better understand the substrate recognition by HSP47, we synthesized various collagen model peptides and examined their interaction with HSP47 in vitro. We found that the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet forms an HSP47-binding site. The HSP47 binding was observed only when Arg residues were incorporated in the Yaa positions of the Xaa-Yaa-Gly triplets. Amino acids in the Xaa position did not largely affect the interaction. The recognition of the Arg residue by HSP47 was specific to its side-chain structure because replacement of the Arg residue by other basic amino acids decreased the affinity to HSP47. The significance of Arg residues in HSP47 binding was further confirmed by using residue-specific chemical modification of types I and III collagen.

Nascent procollagen α-chains entering the lumen of the ER are modified by specific enzymes including prolyl 4-hydroxylase. After completion of translocation, three C-terminal propeptides selectively associate, and the trimer is stabilized by disulfide bridges. The long triple helix (300 nm for type I collagen) comprised of tandem Xaa-Yaa-Gly repeats is believed to propagate from the C-terminal nucleus, like fastening a zipper (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Tuderman L. Guzman N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). HSP47 is only one heat-shock protein found in the ER, and it specifically interacts with various types of collagen (2Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J.

We (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) previously found that HSP47 binds to classical collagen model peptides with the sequence of (Pro-Pro-Gly) n and that the binding was negatively affected by replacements of Pro residues at Yaa positions with 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues. Triple-helical conformation of the substrate was also shown to be important in recognition by HSP47 (8Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we have not yet determined the actual HSP47-binding sites in procollagen molecules at the amino acid level. In this study, we describe the results of in vitro binding analysis elucidating the HSP47-binding sequences in the collagen triple helix using a series of synthetic collagenous peptides. The residue-specific chemical modifications of native collagens also enabled us to identify essential amino acid residues in the substrate recognition by HSP47. Peptide chains were constructed manually based on the standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based strategy on H-Gly-ClTrt-resin (Novabiochem). tert-butyl,tert-butoxycarbonyl, 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl, and triphenylmethyl (Trt) were used as side chain-protecting groups for hydroxyl, amino, guanidino, and thiol groups, respectively. Peptide cleavage from the solid support and simultaneous side-chain deprotection were performed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid:m-cresol:thioanisole:water:1,2-ethanedithiol (82.5:5:5:5:2.5, v/v) at room temperature for 1 h. For the Arg-containing peptides, the treatment was prolonged to 3 h. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water, both containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Purity of the peptides was greater than 95% on analytical HPLC, and identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The melting temperatures of refolded (Pro-Hyp-Gly)3-Xaa-Yaa-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4peptides in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 3.7 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) were estimated by monitoring ellipticity at 225 nm on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter, and the values were in a window of 32–46 °C. Peptide immobilization onto CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and the solid-phase binding assay were performed as reported earlier (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the set of basic peptides, an extra Cys residue was added to the N terminus of each peptide, and the peptides were coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Immobilized peptides were kept at 4 °C for 2 days before the binding assay to refold the peptides. Escherichia coli lysate containing the GST-HSP47 fusion protein (100 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of the binding buffer and a 30-μl bed of the affinity beads. The binding was carried out at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the bed, proteins retained on the beads were eluted by adding Laemmli's SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. The competitive elution assay was performed as described previously (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-HSP47 fusion protein retained on (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 beads (30 μl bed) was mixed with 180 μl of competitor solution in the binding buffer, and the mixture was shaken at 4 °C for 1 h. Before use, competitor peptides were refolded at 4 °C for 2 days. GST-HSP47 retained on the beads was eluted with Laemmli's SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Arg-specific chemical modification, a 80-μl bed of porcine type I or III collagen (Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan) immobilized to NHS-activated Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was treated with 0.2 m 2,3-butanedione in 160 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 20% methanol at room temperature for 4 days. The Arg modification was confirmed by amino acid analysis of the corresponding 6 n HCl-hydrolysates. To acetylate Lys residues, the collagen beads were treated with 0.8 m acetic anhydride in saturated NaHCO3 adjusted to pH 8.3, at room temperature for 4 h. An aliquot of the acetylated collagen beads was further treated with 150 mm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide in 1 methanolamine-HCl (pH 7.4) for 8 h to modify carboxyl groups. For modification of His and Met residues, the collagen beads were mixed with 150 mm iodoacetic acid in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the suspension was incubated at room temperature for 4 h. These residue-specific modifications were confirmed by shifting the collagen bands on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels visualized by silver staining. Before the binding assay, all of the modified collagen beads were washed and equilibrated with the binding buffer. Chick HSP47 was purified from 13-day-old chick embryos according to the protocol described by Saga et al.(10Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-3010 spectrophotometer using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Fluorescence quenching was monitored at the emission wavelength of 340 nm. In the binding assays, stock solutions of type I collagen or collagenous peptides were added to a solution of chick HSP47 (31 μg/ml) in 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. After each addition, the sample solution was equilibrated for 2 min. To ensure the triple-helical conformation of collagenous peptides, all measurements were performed at 4 °C using an Eyela NCB-2200 circulating water bath. The spectra were corrected for dilution. In the previous study (9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we identified dozens of HSP47-binding sequences from a random DNA library designed to encode Gly-Pro-Pro-(Gly-Pro-Yaa)6-Gly-Pro-Pro in the yeast two-hybrid screening using HSP47 as a bait. At the Yaa positions in the selected peptides, Arg and Pro residues were highly enriched (6- and 5-fold enrichment, respectively) from the basal frequencies (9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of Arg residues on the interaction with HSP47, we first analyzed the binding of the GST-HSP47 fusion protein produced in E. coli to synthetic Arg-containing collagenous peptidesin vitro. Because only (Pro-Pro-Gly) n -peptides are known to interact with HSP47 in the in vitro binding assay (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), sequences of the Arg-containing peptides to be tested were designed to be (Pro-Pro-Gly) m -Pro-Arg-Gly-(Pro-Pro-Gly) n (Fig.1 A). In accordance with the previous data (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), specific binding of GST-HSP47 to (Pro-Pro-Gly) n was observed in a chain length-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). The minimal length required for the HSP47 binding was shortened to five triplets (15 amino acid residues) when one of the Pro residues at the Yaa positions was replaced by an Arg residue (Fig. 1 B,lane 9, R8-(PPG)5). The binding of HSP47 to the Arg-containing peptide was saturated at the 18-mer peptide R11-(PPG)6 (lanes 10 and 11). Single substitution of the Pro11 of (Pro-Pro-Gly)8 for an Arg residue markedly enhances the affinity to GST-HSP47 (lanes 7 and 11). Taken together, the Arg residue incorporated in the Yaa positions of (Pro-Pro-Gly) n enhances the interaction with HSP47. Arg residues at the Yaa positions are known to stabilize the triple-helical conformation of collagen model peptides as well as Hyp residues (11Yang W. Chang V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is therefore necessary to clarify whether the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet forms an actual binding surface for HSP47 or the Arg residue merely stabilizes the triple-helical conformation of an adjacent HSP47-binding sequence of Pro-Pro-Gly. To solve this issue, we examined the effect of Arg incorporation to (Pro-Hyp-Gly)8 that was previously shown to not interact with HSP47 (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In parallel, the effect of incorporation of Pro, Gln, Met, Ile, Thr, and Ala, which were also enriched by the previous two-hybrid selection of HSP47-binding peptide, to the Yaa positions was also examined (9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Among the peptides of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)3-Pro-Yaa-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4, only the Pro-Arg-Gly-containing peptide showed significant binding to GST-HSP47 (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). Other peptides containing a Pro-Pro-Gly, Pro-Gln-Gly, Pro-Met-Gly, Pro-Ile-Gly, Pro-Thr-Gly, or Pro-Ala-Gly triplet did not show detectable interaction with GST-HSP47 (lanes 6 and8–12). We also reconfirmed the previous result that HSP47 does not bind to Pro-Hyp-Gly repeats (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (lane 5). This result indicates that HSP47 directly interacts with the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet in the triple helix and that the affinity to Pro-Arg-Gly is much stronger than the affinity to the previously identified HSP47-binding triplet Pro-Pro-Gly (lane 4). The difference in HSP47 binding affinity of these peptidic substrates was further confirmed by a competitive elution assay (Fig. 2 B). GST-HSP47 bound to (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 beads was eluted by the addition of refolded peptides, and the IC50 values were estimated to be about 40 μm for Arg11-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)8 and >1 mm for (Pro-Pro-Gly)8 (Fig. 2 C). Because the Xaa and the Yaa amino acids are not spatially equivalent in the collagen triple helix, we further examined the positional effect of an Arg residue on the interaction with HSP47 using similar (Pro-Hyp-Gly)3-Xaa-Yaa-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4peptides. In the binding assay, four variations of the triplets, Pro-Hyp-Gly, Pro-Arg-Gly, Arg-Hyp-Gly, and Arg-Pro-Gly, were tested for GST-HSP47 binding. As shown in Fig.3 A, only the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet interacted with GST-HSP47, and peptides possessing Arg residues at Xaa positions did not show detectable interaction with GST-HSP47. The possible contribution of side-chain basicity to the interaction with HSP47 was also examined by replacing the Arg residue with other basic amino acids. We prepared Cys-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)3-Pro-Yaa-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4, to Yaa of which Arg, homoarginine, Lys, and Orn were incorporated, and these peptides were coupled to Sepharose beads through N-terminal disulfide bonds. The result of a similar solid-phase binding assay using these basic peptides is shown in Fig. 3 B. Replacement of the Arg residue in the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet with a homoarginine residue resulted in a decrease of affinity to GST-HSP47 (Fig.3 B, lane 5). When the Arg was replaced with either a Lys or an Orn, the binding to GST-HSP47 was not detected (lanes 6 and 7). These results indicate that the positive charge of the Yaa residue does not account for the specific binding to HSP47 and probably the guanidino group, and the length of the Arg side chain is a critical factor for the interaction. We concluded that HSP47 recognizes the Arg residue in a position-specific and side chain-specific fashion. In the native collagen sequences, various residues are found in the Xaa positions. Among Xaa-Arg-Gly sequences, Gly-Glu-Arg (2.7%), Gly-Pro-Arg (2.6%), Gly-Asp-Arg (1.2%), and Gly-Ala-Arg (1.1%) are prominent, and other combinations are at less than 1% frequency each (12Ramshaw J.A.M. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Xaa residues on the interaction with HSP47, we synthesized peptides containing an Xaa-Arg-Gly triplet and afforded to the GST-HSP47 binding assay. All of the tested triplets, Pro-Arg-Gly, Ala-Arg-Gly, Asp-Arg-Gly, and Glu-Arg-Gly, showed significant binding to GST-HSP47, suggesting that Xaa amino acids does not largely contribute to the binding to HSP47 (Fig. 3 C). All of the data presented above strongly suggest that Xaa-Arg-Gly triplets in the triple helix form binding sites for HSP47 in collagen. To confirm this suggestion, homotrimeric porcine type III collagen was chemically modified by several residue-specific modification reagents, and the binding of GST-HSP47 to the modified collagens were examined. When type III collagen was modified with 2,3-butanedione to block the guanidino group of Arg residues, the binding of GST-HSP47 was abolished (Fig.4, upper panel, lane 4). Modification of other amino acid side chains including Lys (lane 6), His/Met (lane 8), and Lys/Asp/Glu (lane 10) did not largely affect the GST-HSP47 binding. This result indicates that Arg residues are important for type III collagen to be recognized by HSP47 in accordance with the data using synthetic peptides. Other amino acid residues such as Lys, His, Met, Asp, and Glu were also revealed to not significantly contribute to HSP47-type III collagen binding. The effect of side-chain modification in heterotrimeric type I collagen on HSP47 binding was also examined, and very similar results as those shown for type III collagen were obtained (Fig. 4, lower panel). Relative binding affinity of chick HSP47 to type I collagen and synthetic substrates was further estimated by means of fluorescence quenching of intrinsic Trp residues of HSP47 (13Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, specific interaction of HSP47 with type I collagen, Arg11-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)8, and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, whose binding was detectable in the previous solid-phase binding assay, was also detected in this spectrometric assay. The non-binder, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, did not quench the fluorescence of HSP47. Comparison of the triple-helical triplet-based affinity revealed that the affinity of a Pro-Pro-Gly triplet in (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 was weaker than that of the mean Xaa-Yaa-Gly triplet in type I collagen. When the concentration of type I collagen was converted to that of the Xaa-Arg-Gly triplet unit (34 homotrimeric Xaa-Arg-Gly triplets in type I collagen), the affinity was comparable with that of a Pro-Arg-Gly triplet in Arg11-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)8. This result also indicates that the interaction of HSP47 with type I collagen is attributed to the binding to the triple-helical Xaa-Arg-Gly triplets. The indispensable role of HSP47 in collagen biosynthesis was recently demonstrated by the analysis of embryonic lethalhsp47 −/− mice (6Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In the mouse embryos, various collagen-based tissue structures were severely disrupted, and cells derived from the mice produced abnormal molecules of at least types I and IV collagen. In addition, two-hybrid screening of cDNA using HSP47 as bait yielded cDNA sequences encoding proteins containing collagenous Xaa-Yaa-Gly repeats. 2Y. Watanabe, K. Sato, T. Yorihuzi, and K. Nagata, unpublished results. These findings were in good agreement with the fact that HSP47 interacts with various types of collagen (at least type I-V) (3Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S.-I. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taking this into consideration, HSP47 is expected to function through a specific interaction with common sequences in the domain(s) found in various types of collagen. In other words, HSP47-binding sites should exist in the triple helix-forming region of collagens. In our (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) previous search of HSP47-binding sequences, we identified the HSP47-binding sequence (Pro-Pro-Gly) n . The triple-helical conformation was also revealed to be important in recognition by HSP47 (8Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in the biosynthetic pathway of procollagen, most of the Pro-Pro-Gly sequences are converted to Pro-Hyp-Gly, to which HSP47 does not bind, by the action of prolyl 4-hydroxylase before triple helix formation. This discrepancy led us to further search for HSP47-binding sequences other than (Pro-Pro-Gly) n . Here, we identified Xaa-Arg-Gly triplets as the HSP47-binding sequences by using various synthetic collagen model peptides (Figs. 2 and 3), and the dominance of this sequence in HSP47 binding to collagen was demonstrated utilizing a residue-specific chemical modification technique (Fig. 4). The affinity of HSP47 to the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet was also shown to be much higher than that to the previously identified (Pro-Pro-Gly) n sequence (Fig. 2). In the fluorescent quenching-based binding assay, the affinity of HSP47 binding to a synthetic Pro-Arg-Gly triplet was shown to be comparable with that to an Xaa-Arg-Gly triplet in type I collagen when other triplets were assumed to have negligible affinity (Fig. 5). This result emphasizes our conclusion that Xaa-Arg-Gly triplets in procollagen are dominant binding sites for HSP47. In addition, interactions of HSP47 with Pro-Pro-Gly triplets in (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 are also detectable in the spectrometric assay performed at 4 °C consistently with the previous data (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the similar binding assay at 25 °C failed to detect significant binding between HSP47 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 as reported by Macdonald and Bächinger (13Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This temperature dependence in the HSP47 binding would be further evidence for the importance of triple-helical conformation of the substrates (8Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The information derived from the experiments shown in this study has enabled us to estimate the HSP47-binding sites in native homotrimeric collagens. For instance, HSP47-binding sites in the triple-helical region of bovine type III collagen can be estimated as shown in Fig.6. Type III collagen possesses 32 possible binding sites for HSP47 having the identified sequences of Xaa-Arg-Gly (Xaa = Glu, Pro, Asp, or Ala; Fig. 6,shadowed). Based on an extended assumption that any amino acid residues are tolerable in the Xaa positions, nine additional binding sites were predicted in type III collagen (Fig. 6, underlined). The Arg-containing sequence is also shown to be necessary in the recognition of heterotrimeric collagen such as type I collagen (Fig. 4,lower panel). An Arg residue at the Yaa position in the Xaa-Yaa-Gly triplets is known to enhance the thermal stability of triple-helical conformation in a similar magnitude to a Hyp residue. This stabilizing effect was suggested to be attributed to hydrogen bond formation between the guanidino group and a backbone carbonyl group (11Yang W. Chang V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the basicity of the Arg side chain did not largely contribute to the interaction with HSP47 (Fig. 3 B) and that high ionic strength buffer did not disrupt the binding of HSP47 to the Pro-Arg-Gly triplet (data not shown). This result coincides with the previous suggestion that a hydrophobic interaction would mainly contribute to the HSP47-collagen interaction (10Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We suggest that a hydrophobic ring formed by the Arg side chain would directly interact with the hydrophobic cleft or patch of HSP47 molecule. This speculation explains the previous data that HSP47 binding to (Pro-Pro-Gly) n was abolished by the introduction of a hydroxyl group to the γ-carbons of the hydrophobic proline rings at Yaa positions (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We proposed in the previous report that HSP47 would be involved in the quality control of procollagen molecules transported to the Golgi apparatus by surveying the level of prolyl 4-hydroxylation. This hypothesis was based on the result obtained from the peptide binding experiments that HSP47 interacts with unhydroxylated Pro-Pro-Gly sequences in the triple-helical structure (7Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis seems unlikely once Xaa-Arg-Gly was identified as the dominant binding site for HSP47. In addition, two other possible roles of HSP47 were recently proposed. One is for the stabilization of correctly folded triple-helical intermediates of procollagen that are otherwise unstable at body temperature (8Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The other is the prevention of lateral association, or bundle formation, of procollagen in the ER (14Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our findings presented here support both of these hypothetical roles. HSP47 would stabilize triple-helical intermediates of procollagen by binding to Xaa-Arg-Gly triplets found approximately every 30 residues (Fig. 6). This stabilizing effect could be precisely evaluated by estimating the melting temperatures of Pro-Arg-Gly-containing triple-helical peptides in the presence and absence of HSP47 in vitro in the future. Although this hypothesis explains the heat-shock inducibility of HSP47, Macdonald and Bächinger (13Macdonald J.R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25399-25403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) recently reported that HSP47 has little effect on the thermal stability of collagen. HSP47 may also act as an inhibitor of the lateral association of procollagen in the ER by masking Arg residues because charged amino acid residues including Arg are presumed to be, at least in part, involved in the formation of the higher order collagen structures (15Hu X.W. Knight D.P. Grant R.A. Tissue Cell. 1996; 28: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Suzuki Y. Someki I. Adadhi E. Irie S. Hattori S. J. Biochem.

The latter scenario is also supported by procollagen aggregate formation occurring at the Golgi apparatus where procollagen is liberated from the chaperone (4Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,18Bonifati L. Mironov A.A., Jr. Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Martella O. Fusella A. Baldassarre M.

Because excessive collagen production in pathophysiological conditions is always associated with the up-regulation of HSP47 (19Masuda H. Fukumoto M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Iehara N. Takeoka H. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Int. J. Exp.

Poulter C.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Two metabolic pathways, either mevalonate-dependent or –independent, are available for the production of isopentenyl pyrophosphate. For mevalonate-dependent isoprenoid synthesis, assembly begins with the condensation of three acetyl-CoAs to generate a β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA molecule, which is reduced to mevalonate. Mevalonate kinase transfers the γ-phosphoryl group from ATP to the 5-hydroxyl oxygen in mevalonate to produce phosphomevalonate (Fig. 1). A second phosphoryl group is then added by phosphomevalonate kinase and the product, 5-pyrophosphomevalonate, is decarboxylated to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (1Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Huang K.-X. Scott A.I. Bennett G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite the existence of a mevalonate-independent pathway in some microorganisms, the process that generates isopentenyl pyrophosphate via mevalonate is critical in most eukaryotes and some microorganisms. Kinases have been classified mainly into three distinct families according to their sequence similarities and structural folds (3Matte A. Tari L.W. Delbaere L.T. Structure. 1998; 6: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The classical P-loop-containing kinases share a common loop between a β-strand and an α-helix, with the consensus sequence Gly-Xaa2-Gly-Xaa-Gly-Lys (3Matte A. Tari L.W. Delbaere L.T. Structure. 1998; 6: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A second group, composed primarily of protein kinases (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 15: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar), has a conserved loop connecting two antiparallel β-strands that are involved in phosphate binding. The third group, which includes actin, Hsp70, and sugar kinases (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), uses two β-hairpins to bind the phosphate in ATP. Mevalonate kinase is a member of the distinct GHMP superfamily, which includes galactokinase (G), homoserine kinase (H), mevalonate kinase (M), and phosphomevalonate kinase (P) (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). 4-Diphosphocytidyl-2C-methylerythritol kinase, mevalonate 5′-diphosphate decarboxylase, and archaeal shikimate kinase have also been assigned as members of this family (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Daugherty M. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is important to note that shikimate kinases classified in yeast and prokaryotes have the P-loop kinase fold (8Daugherty M. Vonstein V. Overbeek R. Osterman A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Krell T. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These proteins share several structural features. A common motif, Pro-Xaa3-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ala, is highly conserved and is thought to be involved in the binding of ATP, functioning as a phosphate-binding loop. The crystal structure of the homoserine kinase, which shares about 20% sequence identity with the mevalonate kinase, has recently been solved, both as the apoprotein and as complexed forms (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Its structure shows a novel left-handed βαβ fold similar to domain IV of elongation factor G (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar to classic P-loop kinases, the phosphate binding site is composed of a conserved loop between a β-strand and an α-helix, with the consensus sequence Pro-Xaa3-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ala. Unexpectedly, the HSK1-substrate complex structures suggest that the orientation of the bound ATP to HSK is different from classical P-loop kinases, with the purine base located at what would be the phosphoryl acceptor substance binding site in a classic P-loop kinase (3Matte A. Tari L.W. Delbaere L.T. Structure. 1998; 6: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, ATP seems to adopt an energetically less favorable syn conformation, which is not found in classic P-loop kinases (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence similarity in GHMP proteins suggests that other members may share at least some of the structural features of HSK (4,7). The Methanococcus jannaschii MVK sequence was initially cloned into pET28a vector with an N-terminal His tag and a T7 promoter, and the construct was used to transform B834(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (2Huang K.-X. Scott A.I. Bennett G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until A 600 was around 0.8. Cells were harvested, washed with M9 minimal medium (with 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml 19 amino acids except Met), and then grown in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Selenomethionine was added to 50 μg/ml and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm concentration. Cells were grown at 18 °C for 20 h and then harvested and frozen at −20 °C. Cells were thawed, re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mmimidazole (pH 8.0), and then lysed by French press and sonication. The extract was heated to 70 °C for 15 min to precipitate most E. coli proteins. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE, on a nickel affinity column (AP Biotech) following the instructions of the supplier. Crystallization was accomplished by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The MVK (10 to 15 mg/ml) in 5 mm Tris, 10 mm dithiothreitol (pH 8.0) was mixed with an equal volume of the precipitation solution (28% dioxane and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and equilibrated against 100–200 μl of reservoir solution in which components were the same as the precipitation solution. Single crystals grew overnight at 16 °C but were generally very small. Well formed crystals were picked and transferred to newly set protein drops in the same precipitation solution except with the addition of 10 mmMgCl2. Larger crystals grew to a size of about 0.2–0.3 mm in three dimensions. All crystals belong to the space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 56.138 Å, b = 44.028 Å, c = 64.845 Å, α = 90°, β = 102.71°, γ = 90°, with one molecule in each asymmetric unit. Data were collected at 121 K using a cryoprotection solution containing the original precipitant with additional 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Data were collected at beamline 14-BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory.

DALI (23Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) was used to search the Protein Data Bank for proteins having folds similar to the MVK N- and C-domains. SwissPDB Viewer (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar) was used to make structural alignments. The mevalonate molecule was generated and docked into the MVK cavity using the AFFINITY module in the INSIGHT program (25Luty B.A. Wasserman Z.R. Stouten P.F.W. Hodge C.N. Zacharias M. McCammon J.A.

The ATP was initially modeled into the MVK cavity by superimposing the HSK-AMPPNP-homoserine structure with the apo-MVK structure and changing AMPPNP to ATP (9Krell T. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The conformation of ATP is the same as that of AMPPNP; however, the ATP molecule was rotated slightly and translated to achieve a low energy between the ATP and the protein, calculated using INSIGHT. All other analysis of the structure and all figures shown were produced using SPOCK (20Christopher J.A. SPOCK: The Structural Properties Observation and Calculation Kit. Program Manual.. The Center for Macromolecular Design, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX1998Google Scholar). Three very conserved motifs, designated motif I, II, and III, have been identified in GHMP proteins (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The multiple sequence alignment of MVK from different species and the M. jannaschii HSK is shown in Fig.2. Motif I is close to the N terminus of the protein, including residues corresponding to Lys8 and Glu14 of the M. jannaschii MVK. Motif II corresponds to the region between Pro104 and Ser114 of the M. jannaschii MVK, with an internal Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ser-Ala sequence that is invariant, and forms the phosphate-binding loop. Motif III is characterized by Lys272–Cys281 of the Methanococcus jannaschii MVK and has an invariant sequence Thr-Gly-Ala-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly among various mevalonate kinases. In HSK, this region corresponds to the sequence Thr-Ile-Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-Pro, a loop in close contact with the phosphate-binding loop, which is presumed to stabilize the conformation of the latter (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The structure of MVK contains all 312 residues of the wild-type MVK as well as five residues from the N-terminal histidine tag fusion. It is a monomer in crystal, although the dimer was reported in the aqueous solution (2Huang K.-X. Scott A.I. Bennett G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The R-factor has been refined to 0.20 with an accompanying R free value of 0.28 (Table II). Nearly 88% of the non-glycine residues are in the most favorable conformation. The Cα of MVK is shown in Fig.3 a. Similar to HSK, the MVK monomer contains two structural domains. At the domain interface there is a deep cavity presumed to be the active site (Fig. 3, aand b). Two molecules of dioxane, used as the crystallization precipitant, have been found to occupy this cavity (Fig. 5 b). The structure of MVK is readily superimposable with that of HSK (Fig. 3 c), indicating the structural conservation among the GHMP kinases. The root mean square deviation is 1.6 Å between the 155 superimposed Cα atoms.Figure 5The putative MVK active site. a, stereoscopic view of the putative active site.

The phosphate-binding loop is shown in yellow. The N terminus of helix D (in MVK) or helix A (in HSK) is shown in white. Inc, residues Thr183 and Ser134 have been changed to Gly to remove a bridge across the active pocket so that the pocket can be revealed fully in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N-terminal domain of MVK comprises a large mixed five-stranded β-sheet (formed by strand a, b, c, d, and e) and a smaller anti-parallel four-stranded β-sheet (formed by strand a, b, f, and g), which are packed with four long α-helices (Fig.4 a). The coordinates for the N-terminal domain (defined as residues 1–176) were used to search for similar structures by DALI (23Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The best match was with 1fwk, the structure of HSK (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with a Z-score 16.6. The second highest hit was 1fi4, the mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Bonanno J.B. Edo C. Eswar N. Pieper U. Romanowski M.J. Ilyin V. Gerchman S.E. Kycia H. Studier F.W. Sali A. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with a Z-score of 9.7. Other top hits include 1dar, the elongation factor G (Z-score 5.4); 1b63, the Mutl protein (Z-score 5.0); and 1e3h, the guanosine pentaphosphate synthetase (Z-score 4.2). Although the N-terminal domains of MVK, HSK, and MDD (shown in Fig. 4,a–c) are similar, there are substantial differences around the region corresponding to β-strand c in MVK. Compared with HSK, there is an insertion between β-strand c and α-helix D in MVK, which includes strand d and most of the following loop. MDD lacks the equivalent β-strands c and d of MVK, but instead it has a very long loop that links β-strand f (equivalent to strand b in MVK) with α-helix A (corresponding to helix D in MVK). The structure of the C-terminal domain has a core unit that adopts a βαββαβ fold, formed with a four-strand β-sheet (strand h, i, j, and k) packed with two α helices (L and M). There are three additional helices (I, J, and K) that are considered to be an insert between strand h and helix L (4Zhou T. Daugherty M. Grishin N.V. Osterman A. Zhang H. Structure. 2000; 8: 1247-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DALI searches were performed using the coordinates of the C-terminal domain (defined as residues 177–312). The top match corresponds to 1fwk, the code for homoserine kinase (HSK), with a Z-score of 9.9, followed by 1fi4, the mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase, with Z-score 9.4. All other hits possessed Z-scores less than 5.0, including 1dar (elongation factor G, Z score 4.2), 1ha1 (a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, Z-score 4.0), and many others. The C-terminal domains of MVK, HSK, and MDD are shown in Fig. 4,d–f. Each possesses a similar core unit with several insertions composed mainly of α-helices. Compared with those in HSK and MDD, the C-terminal tail in MVK is truncated and lacks the C-terminal β-strand (strands l and n in HSK and MDD, respectively) that folds toward the N-terminal domain and joins the large mixed β-sheet. Mutations such as E19D, S145A, S146A, E193Q, D204A, and A334T in human MVK and K13M in rat MVK have been shown to decrease the activity of the enzymes (28Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Cho Y.-K. Rios S.E. Kim J.P. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5741-5746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In M. jannaschii MVK, Glu14, Ser111, Ser112, Glu144, Asp155, Ala276, and Lys8 are identical to the equivalent residues of the human and rat protein, respectively (Fig. 2). Among the mutations studied, D204A elicits the most pronounced effects on catalysis by decreasingV m ∼10,000-fold (28Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results helped to establish the probable mechanism of the enzyme and facilitated our analysis of the active cavity. All of these conserved residues are located in a region that defines the active site cavity (Fig.5 a). For example, the residues corresponding to motif III form a Gly-rich loop very close to the phosphate-binding loop corresponding to motif II. Cys281 in the Gly-rich loop is ∼2.0 Å from Cys107 in the phosphate-binding loop. The relative orientation of these two residues as well as a continuous electron density connecting their side chains suggest a disulfide bond, despite the existence of dithiothreitol in the crystallization condition. Formation of the disulfide linkage may stabilize the conformation of the putative phosphate-binding loop. In addition, Lys272 in the Gly-rich loop is 3.1 Å away from Glu14, a motif I residue, which indicates electrostatic interactions. The positions of the phosphate-binding loops of MVK and HSK (Fig. 5,b and c) are nearly identical when the proteins are superimposed. A dioxane molecule is bound about 3.0 Å from the main chain amides of Ser111 and Ser112(which are both invariant residues on the phosphate-binding loop) and probably forms hydrogen bonds with these two amino acids. In various HSK-substrate complex structures, this region is occupied by phosphate groups and hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides on the phosphate-binding loop are present. For example, one HSK-ADP structure shows that the β-phosphate group occupies this position and forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides of Ser97 and Ser98 (equivalents of Ser111 and Ser112). Close to the phosphate-binding loop is the invariant residue Glu144, which aligns with Glu130 in HSK, a residue that coordinates the Mg2+ ion (10Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results reveal roughly the region in MVK where the phosphate tail of ATP may bind. In HSK, the purine ring is bound in a pocket close to the phosphate-binding site. A similar pocket is apparent in MVK that likely serves the same function. The backbone of Lys74–Cys76 of MVK can be superimposed to the backbone of Asn62–Ala64 of HSK. In HSK, these residues form van der Waals contacts with the purine ring (within 5 Å), and the main chain amide of Val63 forms a hydrogen bond with N7 in the purine. Although the exact amino acids are somewhat different, the similarity of the molecular surfaces and the constellation of protein atoms in this region suggest that it is likely that in MVK these corresponding residues may form similar interactions with the purine ring. Based on the alignment of the structures of apo-MVK and HSK-AMPPNP-homoserine, an ATP molecule and a mevalonate molecule were docked into the cavity (Fig. 5 d). The phosphate tail of the docked ATP molecule closely interacts with the phosphate-binding loop (within 5 Å) and forms hydrogen bonds with several main chain amides, including that of Ser112. The purine ring fits well into the putative purine-binding pocket, consistent with the analysis described above. The carboxyl group of the docked mevalonate molecule is near a large positively charged patch in the C-domain part of the cavity and forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide of Ala276 and the side chain amide of Arg196. The 3′-methyl group of the mevalonate fits into a hydrophobic patch at the N-domain side of the cavity. In the model, the 3′-OH group is within hydrogen bond distance of the side chain of Lys8, a conserved residue in motif I. The 5′-OH group in the docked mevalonate is less than 3.0 Å from the γ-phosphorus of the docked ATP molecule. The 5′-OH group of the modeled mevalonate is only about 4.0 Å from Asp155. The model indicates a possible reaction mechanism that is consistent with previous enzymological studies on MVK. The reaction is likely to be initiated by the nucleophilic attack to the γ-phosphorus of ATP by the 5′-OH of mevalonate (Fig. 6). Based on the analysis of the active cavity, the best candidate for the catalytic residue is Asp155 (located about 4.0 Å from the 5′-OH of the docked mevalonate), which is consistent with the mutation data available for human MVK (28Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is likely that Asp155functions as a general base with its side carboxyl group in position to abstract a proton from the 5′-OH of mevalonate, thereby facilitating the nucleophilic attack. Notably, this residue is structurally aligned with Asn141 in HSK, which has been shown to interact directly with the δ-OH of the homoserine (10Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lys8, Ala276, and Arg196 appear to be key to the binding of mevalonate (Fig. 6). The phosphate-binding loop might be the main force to bind and stabilize the phosphate tail of ATP. The N terminus of α-helix E is pointing toward the phosphate groups and may offer some stabilizing effect during phosphoryl transfer, as is the case in many other kinases (3,4). The Mg 2+ that might be coordinated by Glu144 is likely to activate the γ-phosphate. This mechanism is consistent with the model proposed by the Miziorko laboratory (29Cho Y.-K. Rios S.E. Kim J.P. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12573-12578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our work has defined the structure of M. jannaschii mevalonate kinase and revealed the structural conservation among GHMP proteins. As more GHMP protein structures are solved, the detailed comparison and analysis of these proteins with substrates and inhibitors will further our understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms and offer us opportunities to design potential drugs against various diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2002543407,"We have characterized a pore-forming lytic protein from the saliva of the hematophagous insect Triatoma infestans, a vector of Chagas disease. This protein, named trialysin, has 22 kDa and is present in the saliva at about 200 μg/ml. Purified trialysin forms voltage-dependent channels in planar lipid bilayers with conductance of 880 ± 40 pS. It lyses protozoan parasites and bacteria indicating that it has a role in the control of microorganism growth in the salivary glands. At higher concentrations, but below those found in saliva, trialysin can also permeabilize and lyse mammalian cells, suggesting that it might also facilitate insect blood feeding by interfering with the cell response of the host. The translated cDNA sequence of trialysin shows a basic, lysine-rich protein in which the N-terminal region is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helical structure with positive charges on one side and hydrophobic amino acids on the opposite side. A synthetic peptide corresponding to this cationic amphipathic α-helix induces protozoan lysis and mammalian cell permeabilization, showing that this region is involved in lytic activity. However, the lytic peptide G6V32 is 10-fold less efficient than trialysin in lysing parasites and 100-fold less efficient in permeabilizing mammalian cells. Trialysin activity is about 10-fold reduced in salivary gland homogenates prepared in the presence of an irreversible serine-protease inhibitor. Since trialysin precursor contains an anionic pro-sequence of 33 amino acids contiguous to the cationic amphipathic putative α-helix, we propose that removal of the acidic pro-sequence by limited proteolysis activates trialysin by exposing this lytic basic amphipathic motif.

Molecules able to form pores in biological membranes have been evolutionarily selected in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms where the balance between permeabilization and lytic effect dictates their functions. Over the last decade, several pore-forming peptides, ranging from 12 to 45 amino acid residues, have been identified in animals and plants (1Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 2Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Alamillo J.M. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Most of them are part of an innate defense mechanism against microorganisms. Despite differences in the primary and secondary structure (α-helices and β-sheets), they share a highly basic and amphipathic feature with a higher selectivity to lyse bacteria than host cells (3Matsuzaki K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another well studied class of pore-forming molecules includes proteins like bacterial toxins (4Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 15-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Welch R.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Pathol. 1972; 25: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (7Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol.

Crystallographic data showed that α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus is formed by the oligomerization of 33-kDa monomers in a heptameric β-barrel pore (9Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Octameric and pentameric pores were found in HlyE hemolysin of Gram-negative bacteria (10Wallace A.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), respectively. In cholesterol-dependent cytolysins produced by more than 20 species of Gram-positive bacteria, the pores can be larger and formed by monomer assembling into rings of 30–50 subunits (12Olofsson A. Hebert H. Thelestam M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Sekiya K. Satoh R. Danbara H. Futaesaku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5953-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cytolysins are bacterial virulence factors, affecting host immune cell function and cytokine induction (14Billington S.J. Jost B.H. Songer J.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here we describe a new type of pore-forming molecule in the salivary glands of Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), an obligate hematophagous insect that transmits the human pathogenic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, through its feces. It is a 22-kDa protein that shares the properties of the two classes of lytic molecules. It possesses a basic amphipathic lytic motif in the N-terminal region containing 27 amino acid residues, similar to antimicrobial lytic peptides, and a protein portion that increases the lytic specificity toward eukaryotic cells such as bacterial toxins. This protein, named trialysin, was purified from the salivary glands of T. infestans. It forms negative voltage-dependent pores in planar lipid bilayers and induces lysis of bacteria, Trypanosoma, and mammalian cells. In addition, we provide evidence that trialysin is synthesized as a precursor and is processed by limited proteolysis. T. infestans were reared at the Laboratório de Xenodiagnóstico, Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia, São Paulo, Brazil, in glass cylinders at 28 °C. The insects fed on ducks between each molt. Male adults were used in this study. One week after feeding, the collector held the insects ventrally and gently blew air at their rostrum to liberate the maxilla with a drop of saliva. This small drop was collected immediately using a glass capillary and stored at −20 °C. The assays were performed with trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (Y strain) obtained from an infected tissue culture of LLC-MK2 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The parasites were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to the indicated concentrations with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation with lytic material, the parasites were placed on ice, and the number of live parasites was counted in a Neubauer chamber using a phase microscope. Hemolysis was determined by hemoglobin release from human erythrocytes by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm after centrifugation. A 100% rate of hemolysis was achieved by treatment with 2% Triton X-100. Bacteriolytic activity was quantified after plating bacteria incubated with the lytic fractions onto LB agar. Permeabilization was detected by incubating bacteria in suspension or mammalian cells attached to glass coverslips with the lytic molecules in the presence of 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Fluorescence and phase contrast images were acquired with a digital camera (MX12P, Adimec) connected to a fluorescence microscope and processed with Leica Qwin version 2.3 software. Trialysin was purified by diluting 1 volume of saliva with 2 volumes of MilliQ/H2O. A precipitate was formed and removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was chromatographed on a 1.0-ml Hitrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The unbound material was collected and mixed with 1 volume of 3.4 m(NH4)2SO4. The sample was further purified through a 1.0-ml phenyl-Superose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 20 ml of the above buffer to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 0.5 ml/min. The fractions containing the lytic activity were pooled and applied to a 1.0-ml Mono S column equilibrated with 20 mmMES, 1MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidAPMSFaminophenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideG6V32the peptide corresponding to the segment from glycine 6 to valine 32 of trialysin pH 6.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. All purification steps were performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue or silver nitrate staining. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid aminophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride the peptide corresponding to the segment from glycine 6 to valine 32 of trialysin A cDNA library from T. infestans salivary glands was constructed with poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from D1/D2 salivary glands using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA was prepared from 3 μg of mRNA using the SuperScriptTM Lambda System for cDNA Synthesis and inserted into the Lambda ZipLox vector (Lambda Cloning System, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The library was packed with the Ready to Go Lambda Packing System (Amersham Biosciences) and amplified in Escherichia coli Y1090 (ZL). The library was used as a template for PCR containing a primer based on the N terminus of trialysin, the degenerated oligonucleotide-NT (5′-TTYAARATHAARCCNGGNAARG) and the SP6 promoter primer located downstream of the λ vector cloning site. The oligonucleotides-CT (5′-CGGGATCCTTAATCAATTTCAACTTCATC) and the T7 promoter primer were used to amplify the full-length cDNA. Amplified products were purified from agarose gels and cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega). Plasmids were inserted into E. coli DH5α, and clones were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems Inc. 377 Sequencing Apparatus. Planar lipid bilayers were formed using a solution of 2.5% azolecithin (Sigma) inn-decane according to the technique of Mueller et al. (15Mueller P. Rudin H.T. Tien T. Wescott W.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1963; 67: 534-535Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The membranes for macroscopic conductance measurements were 0.8–1.0 mm in diameter, and those for single-channel recordings were 300–500 μm wide. Conductance was measured using a patch clamp amplifier (Dagan Instruments, model 8900) configured in a voltage clamp mode. The data were acquired using the Axotape 2.0.2 software (Axon Instruments) and analyzed with an AxoScope 8.0 (Axon Instruments). The voltage was simultaneously monitored in a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 340A). Peptides were synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology as described by Hirata et al. (16Hirata I.Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using an automated bench top simultaneous multiple solid-phase peptide synthesizer (PSSM 8 system from Shimadzu, Tokyo). Peptides were purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 analytical column, and the sequence was confirmed by Edman degradation (PPSQ 23 system from Shimadzu, Tokyo). Peptide concentration was determined from stock solutions by amino acid analysis. We found that saliva of T. infestans killed the infective (trypomastigotes) and replicative (epimastigotes) insect stages of the protozoan T. cruzi. Lysis was abolished at 0 °C or when the saliva was heated to 85 °C, suggesting that a protein was involved in parasite lysis (not shown). When the saliva was separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the parasite lytic activity was detected in a gel position corresponding to proteins of 30 kDa (Fig.1, A and B). Likewise, diluted saliva induced an exponential increase in the conductance of the planar lipid bilayer until disruption of the membrane after 10–20 min (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that a pore-forming activity was responsible for the lytic activity. To purify the lytic molecule, ejected saliva from 800 insects (400 μl) was diluted in water, and the soluble fraction was applied to an anion exchange column (Hitrap Q). Unbound fractions containing the lytic activity (Fig. 2 A) were pooled and adjusted to 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, and the pool was chromatographed through a phenyl-Superose column. The lytic activity eluted with ∼750 mm ammonium sulfate (Fig.2 B). Fractions with lytic activity were pooled and applied to a cation exchange column (Mono S). The lytic material was eluted with 800 mm NaCl and was separated from most contaminants that did not bind to the column (Fig. 2 C). The bound-active fractions contained a protein that migrated as a single band of 22 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE stained with silver nitrate (Fig. 2 C, inset). Part of the lytic activity did not bind to the Mono S column when the sample was loaded in the presence of 750 mm ammonium sulfate (Fig. 2 C). This lytic activity may be trialysin-bound to other proteins because when we dialyzed the phenyl-Superose pool, all the lytic activity bound to Mono S and eluted with 800 mm NaCl, exactly as trialysin. In this case, however, several other proteins bound to the column, contaminating the trialysin fraction. The final fraction yielded a single silver-stained band by SDS-PAGE of a similar size to the original lytic activity found in saliva. From 400 μl of saliva, about 80 μg of trialysin were obtained in a typical purification procedure, indicating that the concentration of this protein in saliva is at least 200 μg/ml or 9 μm. This purification protocol was repeated several times with similar results. Purified trialysin induced lysis of T. cruzi trypomastigotes and human red blood cells at 8 μg/ml (0.4 μm). However, parasite lysis occurred much more rapidly than hemolysis (Fig.3 A). This kinetic difference is probably due to the different membrane composition because both types of cells have similar surface sizes. Trialysin was able to permeabilize (Fig. 3 B) and kill E. coli K12 at 8 μg/ml (not shown). Adherent LLC-MK2 epithelial cells were also permeabilized but required high concentrations of trialysin (1.5 μm), as shown in Fig. 3 C. In an initial attempt to elucidate the mechanism of lysis, we found that saliva generates macroscopic currents in large bilayers. The pore-forming activity of trialysin was then tested in small bilayers where evidence of pore-forming events was obtained, as shown in Fig.4 A. Trialysin added to thecis aqueous solution at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml generated a predominant mean current state of 43.77 ± 2.33 pA (n = 100; V clamp =V trans = −50 mV) with aP o of ∼0.5 and a second current level of 84.82 ± 2.85 pA, indicative of the insertion of two pore-forming complexes in the lipid membrane (Fig. 4, A andB). At positive trans voltages (+30 to +100 mV), previous unitary currents were switched off, with reversal to unitary currents upon reclamping to negative trans voltages (Fig.4 C). Purified trialysin was submitted to N-terminal sequencing, and the first 20 amino acids were determined. A single sequence was generated (Fig. 5 A, bold letters), indicating that the protein was highly purified. From the first eight N-terminal amino acids (underlined in Fig. 5 A), a degenerated oligonucleotide primer was designed. This primer and the SP6 promoter primer, located downstream of genes cloned in a directional λ ZipLox library of T. infestans salivary glands, were used to amplify the trialysin cDNA by PCR. Several clones were obtained and sequenced. Seven clones showed the translated sequence of the first 20 amino acids found by protein sequencing. These clones were fully sequenced, presenting similar DNA sequences and almost the same amino acid sequence of 205 amino acids, as shown for clone 30 in Fig. 3 A. Some clones had conserved amino acid changes (A28L, clone 31; G45S, M123T, and D183E, clones 17 and 22; F12L and I169V, clone 1), which might be attributed to the fact that we used a population of insects to prepare the cDNA library. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that more than one gene encodes trialysin. The amino acid sequence predicts a protein with a pI of 9.46, compatible with the high retention in Mono S, and a molecular mass of 22.2 kDa, similar to those obtained by reducing SDS-PAGE. No similarity to other proteins from the data bases was found. One striking feature of this molecule was the high percent of lysine residues (16%), even in comparison to the other positively charged amino acids,i.e. arginine (2%) and histidine (0.5%) residues. The repetitive distribution of these lysines in the N-terminal portion suggested that these initial amino acids form an amphipathic α-helical structure. The region between Gly6 and Val32 predicts an amphipathic α-helix region by GOR (17Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar) and Eisenberg methods (18Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5 B). By plotting this region as a helical wheel (19Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), the charged amino acids were found predominantly on one side of the helix, whereas the hydrophobic amino acids lay on the opposite side (Fig. 5 C). This configuration is similar to that of several other antimicrobial pore-forming lytic peptides such as magainin from frog skin (20Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar), cecropin (21Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), and sarcotoxin (22Okada M. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7174-7177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found in insect hemolymph. The G6V32 sequence of trialysin also has a cluster of glycines between the charged and hydrophobic amino acids, as seen in magainin and sarcotoxin. To verify whether the region between the Gly6 and Val32 amino acids of trialysin was involved in the lytic activity, the G6V32 peptide was synthesized and tested for lytic activity. As shown in Fig. 6, the peptide lysed T. cruzi trypomastigotes and permeabilized mammalian cells. The lysis was specific since the peptide was ineffective at 0 °C, and the purified peptide with blocked lysine residues was unable to induce lysis (not shown). Comparatively, trialysin was more efficient than G6V32 in both assays. However, trialysin-induced parasite lysis was about 10-fold higher, and trialysin-induced mammalian cell permeabilization was about 100-fold higher. This result shows that the remaining amino acid residues of the protein, excluding the cationic amphipathic lytic region, increased the activity of trialysin mainly toward mammalian cells. Since trialysin was efficient in permeabilizing mammalian cells, it could also produce damage in the insect salivary gland if synthesized with full lytic activity. Therefore, we searched for a precursor molecule by amplifying the cDNA library with an anchor primer corresponding to a site upstream of the vector cloning site and a primer corresponding to the C terminus of trialysin. We obtained a PCR product with about 1100 bp, 300 bp longer than the product amplified based on purified trialysin. Its DNA sequence predicts an amino acid sequence that contains a typical signal peptide (23Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) followed by a 33-amino acid sequence rich in negatively charged amino acids (7 Asp and 8 Glu) separated by 1 arginine located upstream of the N-terminal sequence of the purified trialysin (Fig.7 A). This finding suggests that the mature protein is produced by limited proteolysis and that these acidic amino acids might control the lytic activity by neutralizing the basic amino acids in the adjacent region corresponding to the lytic amphipathic α-helix. Since we have reported previously (24Amino R. Tanaka A.S. Schenkman S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) the presence of a serine protease in salivary glands of T. infestans that is activated at the time of the bite and specifically cleaves arginines, we tested the lytic activity of salivary gland homogenates prepared in the presence or absence of an irreversible serine protease inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 7 B, a 10-fold reduction in lytic activity was obtained in the presence of APMSF, showing that a serine protease is involved in the processing and activation of trialysin. APMSF did not affect T. cruzi lysis when pre-activated saliva was used, excluding the participation of serine proteases in parasite lysis. In the present study we have characterized the cytolytic salivary activity of T. infestans. It is a pore-forming protein, activated by limited proteolysis, that permeabilizes and lyses prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This protein was purified to homogeneity, cloned, and named trialysin (from Tria toma infestans cytolysin). We obtained several trialysin cDNA sequences, but all of them predict for proteins with conserved modifications in amino acid sequence. No significant similarity was found between trialysin and other sequences in data banks. However, the region delimited by Gly6 and Val32 (30% lysine) is a suitable cationic amphipathic lytic motif and structurally resembles several antimicrobial lytic peptides. The synthetic peptide G6V32, which corresponds to this domain, lyses trypomastigotes and permeabilizes mammalian cells. However, the entire protein is more efficient than the peptide in inducing parasite lysis and particularly in permeabilizing mammalian cells. Compared with trialysin, larger amounts of G6V32 are required to permeabilize adherent epithelial cells, whereas only a 10-fold molar excess is required to lyse T. cruzi. These findings indicate that the remaining 178 residues of the protein have a role in increasing the activity of trialysin-mediated parasite killing and, to a greater extent, the activity of permeabilizing mammalian cells. This relative mammalian cellular specificity has probably evolved from an early predatory ancestor molecule used to lyse invertebrate cells, once triatomines evolved from predatory family of reduvids insects. Nevertheless, protozoan parasites and bacteria are more susceptible to trialysin and G6V32 compared with mammalian cells, a fact that could be related to differences in their membrane composition and structure. Saliva generates an exponential increase in conductance leading to disruption of artificial lipid membranes. This effect may be due to the trialysin pore forming activity and not to a detergent-like activity. First, trialysin is found at high concentration in saliva, and in its purified state forms single channels. Second, the lipid membrane remained stable in the presence of trialysin and in absence of a negative potential, and no lytic activity could be detected at 0 °C. Finally, trialysin generated conductance only at negative trans potentials with the channels reversibly closing at positive trans potentials. Events at positive trans voltages were rarely detected, probably due to insertion of trialysin in the trans side of the membrane. Cytolytic activities need to be tightly regulated in order to avoid self-damage, mainly in storage compartments such as T. infestans salivary glands, where they reach high concentrations (9 μm). One way of controlling the lytic activity is to rely on differential specificity of molecules, as seen with bacterial toxins targeted to specific membrane components of host cells. Another way depends on proteolytic processing, as shown for defensins (25Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), aerolysin (26Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Buckley J.T. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32656-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and vibriolysin (27Hall R.H. Drasar B.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3375-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data strongly support the notion that trialysin is synthesized as a precursor molecule that is activated by limited proteolysis. The precursor of trialysin contains a signal peptide sequence followed by an acidic 33-amino acid pro-sequence (45% of Glu and Asp), not found in the mature protein. This anionic region is adjacent to the cationic amphipathic lytic motif (30% of Lys), which is located at the N terminus of the mature protein. This suggests that the anionic pro-sequence controls the trialysin activity by neutralizing the adjacent cationic lytic motif. In addition, the hair pin formed by electrostatic interaction of these opposite charged sequences may organize the site of protein processing (Arg56) in an exposed loop for a proper proteolytic attack. A similar anionic pro-sequence of 45 amino acid residues (18% of Glu and Asp) is found in defensin, which is a 30-amino acid peptide that forms cationic amphipathic β-sheets and contains 13% of arginine (28Valore E.V. Martin E. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ratio of negatively and positively charged amino acids is about 1.5 in both molecules, a finding that suggests a general mechanism of activation control. We have described previously a serine protease called triapsin, which is present in the salivary glands of T. infestans and is released in the ejected saliva (24Amino R. Tanaka A.S. Schenkman S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the present data, it appears that triapsin is responsible for trialysin activation. First, triapsin is the major proteolytic activity in the salivary glands ofT. infestans. Second, triapsin is highly specific for cleavage of the arginine bond, and this is the amino acid found before the N terminus of the mature trialysin. Third, APMSF, an irreversible specific inhibitor of triapsin, significantly impairs the activation of trialysin in salivary gland homogenates. Finally, triapsin is activated at the time of saliva ejection, a condition that would prevent self-damage by trialysin. We propose a simplified model of activation and pore formation, as shown in Fig. 8. The pro-trialysin is stored in the inactive form in salivary glands. At the time of the bite a serine protease is activated (Fig. 8 A) and cleaves the exposed Arg56 of pro-trialysin separating the anionic peptide from the mature pore-forming protein, thus exposing the cationic amphipathic motif of trialysin. This cationic domain of trialysin then binds to the negative head group of membrane phospholipids (Fig. 8 B) and inserts the amphipathic α-helix into the lipid bilayer forming an aqueous pore, which has acis-trans asymmetry (Fig. 8, C and D), being opened by negative trans voltages. In hematophagous insects, lytic activities have been associated with a digestive hemolytic role (29Lehane M.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1994; 24: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that trialysin has a nutritional role, since blood is stored in the stomach for weeks without hemolysis, which is performed in the posterior midgut ofT. infestans. A possible role of trialysin may be related to its antimicrobial activity, as shown for cationic amphipathic peptides found in insects (30Bulet P. Hetru C. Dimarcq J.L. Hoffmann D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that trialysin prevents microbial colonization of salivary glands of T. infestansbecause there is no bacterial growth when saliva from 10 insects is plated onto LB agar (data not shown). Consequently, trialysin could impair the transmission of pathogens through the insect saliva. This is the case of Trypanosoma rangeli, a protozoan genetically related to T. cruzi (31Stevens J.R. Teixeira M.M. Bingle L.E. Gibson W.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 1999; 29: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which is transmitted by saliva of the triatomine vector Rhodnius prolixus but is not transmitted by the bite of T. infestans (32D'Alessandro A. J. Med. Entomol. 1972; 9: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33D'Alessandro A. de Hincapie O. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1986; 35: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Cuba C.A. Rev. Soc. Bras. Med. Trop. 1998; 31: 207-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differently from T. infestans, R. prolixus has no lytic activity in the salivary glands (35Gregorio E.A. Ratcliffe N.A. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1991; 86: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but expresses a lytic peptide in the stomach (36Azambuja P. Guimarães J.A. Garcia E.S. J. Insect Physiol. 1983; 29: 833-837Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This basic peptide from the stomach ofR. prolixus also lyses T. cruzi and may provide insect protection against some parasite strains (37Mello C.B. Azambuja P. Garcia E.S. Ratcliffe N.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also found that in some T. infestans feeding on mice infected withT. cruzi, the recovery of parasites in the gut is low, suggesting that trialysin might also impair the transmission ofT. cruzi in some cases. 2R. Amino, R. M. Martins, J. Procopio, I. Y. Hirata, M. A. Juliano, and S. Schenkman, manuscript in preparation. No lytic activity is detected in the stomach extracts of starved T. infestans. A role of trialysin in blood feeding on the mammalian host should also be considered. Saliva is the only interface that T. infestans possesses to counteract immune, inflammatory, and hemostatic host responses to obtain successfully its blood meal (38Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agent Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, trialysin may also act during blood feeding since it is able to permeabilize mammalian cells at concentrations lower than those found in saliva. In fact, diluted saliva permeabilizes cells present in rat mesentery and lymphocytes (data not shown). When injected into vertebrate skin, saliva encounters several cell types, such as nerve fibers, mast cells, platelets, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, which depend on controlled ionic flux to exert their physiological roles. It has been demonstrated that pore-forming molecules inhibit platelet function (39Walch M. Ziegler U. Groscurth P. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 82: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Ashmarin I.P. Tkachenko S.B. Rud'ko I.A. Korneva E.A. Kokriakov V.N. Kubatiev A.A. Bull. Exp. Biol.

Microbiol. 2000; 29: 39-45PubMed Google Scholar), promote shedding of L-selectin in leukocytes, inhibit the lymphocyte proliferative response, and immunoglobulin production (44Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) among other cellular activities (14Billington S.J. Jost B.H. Songer J.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results place trialysin between the lytic pore-forming peptides and the lytic pore-forming bacterial proteins. The cationic amphipathic pore-forming peptides are classically characterized as antibacterial molecules because of the resistance of mammalian cells to peptide lysis and are found in the immune system of several unrelated species. This resistance could be clearly seen when comparing the permeabilizing activity of peptide G6V32 and the entire protein. On the other hand, there are pore-forming proteins from bacteria that possess target specificity for eukaryotic host cells and in many cases interfere with cell function, thus being important determinants of bacterial virulence. Trialysin is able to kill microorganisms like a lytic peptide and permeabilize mammalian cells like a bacterial toxin. This dual role may allow it to act on blood feeding by interacting with host cells and on microbial growth control in salivary glands. In addition, the lytic molecule is activated by proteolytic removal of the anionic pro-sequence contiguous to the cationic lytic motif. Understanding how lytic molecules control their activities and specificities is desirable in order to design cell-specific regulated cytolytic proteins.

The most extensive studies of cross-link repair have been carried out in Escherichia coli, in which the major interstrand cross-link repair pathway is well characterized, both genetically and biochemically. ICL repair in eukaryotes is less well understood, and there may be several pathways (4De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In E. coli and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the repair of ICLs depends on both nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination (5Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cole R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Jachymczyk W.J. von Borstel R.C. Mowat M.R. Hastings P.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In mammals, mutant cell lines sensitive to cross-linking agents have been useful to identify proteins that might be involved in ICL repair. XPF and ERCC1 mutant cell lines, in addition to being defective in nucleotide excision repair, are particularly sensitive to cross-linking agents (8Hoy C. Thompson L. Mooney C. Salazar E. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1737-1743PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins play a special role in ICL repair. Similarly, mutations in the XRCC2 and XRCC3genes, encoding proteins with sequence homology to the human RAD51 protein, confer sensitivity to cross-linking agents (9Thompson L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fanconi anemia cell lines are also particularly susceptible to such agents. Thus far, eight Fanconi anemia complementation groups have been defined, and six genes have been mapped and cloned, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Studying Fanconi anemia will likely be of great value in understanding human ICL repair mechanisms, but the function of the FANC proteins is still unclear. In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in themus308 gene lead to marked sensitivity to cross-linking agents. Experiments suggested that some incision event takes place inmus308 mutants, but full repair does not take place (10Boyd J.B. Sakaguchi K. Harris P.V. Genetics. 1990; 125: 813-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of the Mus308 protein encodes a DNA polymerase, whereas the N-terminal portion encodes the seven characteristic motifs found in DNA and RNA helicases (11Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sharief et al. (12Sharief F.S. Vojta P.J. Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1999; 59: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) cloned a human cDNA for POLQ, encoding a polypeptide homologous to the Mus308 polymerase domain but with no corresponding helicase region. A longer cDNA sequence for human POLQ, deposited with the NCBI data base by Abbas and Linn (NCBI accession number NM_006596, predicts a presumably full-length protein with the polymerase domain in the C-terminal portion and a helicase domain at the N terminus, similar to D. melanogasterMus308. In many DNA repair pathways, the function of DNA helicases is essential. In particular, UvrD helicase is needed to repair ICLs inE. coli (13Yoakum G.H. Cole R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7023-7030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, defects in DNA helicases are the causes of several human diseases. BLM and WRN, the products of the Bloom and Werner syndrome genes, are members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases (14Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.-Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 15Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although their most critical roles in cells are not precisely known, they participate in pathways of DNA damage tolerance. Another member of the RecQ family of helicases, RECQ4, has been implicated in a subset of cases of Rothmund-Thompson syndrome (16Kitao S. Lindor N.M. Shiratori M. Furuichi Y. Shimamoto A. Genomics. 1999; 61: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). XPD and XPB helicases, two of the subunits of TFIIH transcription/repair factor, are involved in nucleotide excision repair (17Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), and mutations in their genes can lead to the disorders xeroderma pigmentosum and trichothiodystrophy. With the aim of isolating new proteins implicated in DNA cross-link repair, we sought mammalian homologs of the putative helicase portion of D. melanogaster Mus308. We report identification of new human and mouse genes and the biochemical activity of the human gene product. Human and mouseHEL308 genes were cloned by 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a CLONTECH SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit. Primers were designed from human expressed sequence tags AA625285, H08004, and R24580 in order to clone the full human HEL308 coding region. cDNA was prepared from the testis cancer cell line 833K and the bladder cancer cell line MGH-U1 (18Köberle B. Grimaldi K.A. Sunters A. Hartley J.A. Kelland L.R. Masters J.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Two fragments of 1767 bp (3′ RACE) and 2167 bp (5′ RACE) were combined to obtain the entire HEL308coding region. The mutant HEL308 K365M gene was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); the single AAA to ATG (lysine to methionine) substitution was confirmed by sequencing. Primers were designed from mouse expressed sequence tag AA517170 to clone mouse Hel308 by RACE PCR from mouse leukemia L1210 cells RNA (19Vilpo J.A. Vilpo L.M. Szymkowski D.E. O'Donovan A. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and mouse total liver RNA (Ambion Inc.) using a CLONTECH SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit. The human HEL308open reading frame was subcloned into plasmid pFastBac HTb, and the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) was used to obtain recombinant baculovirus to infect Sf9 cells. A 500-ml spinner flask of Sf9 cells (1 × 106/ml) was infected with the His6-HEL308 baculovirus (multiplicity of infection of 2) for 48 h at 27 °C. Cells were lysed in 20 ml of Buffer A (0.15 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (22,000 × g for 15 min). KCl was added to raise the salt concentration to 0.3 m. The extract (12.2 mg/ml) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate superflow resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer A plus 20 mmimidazole, and the protein was eluted with 20 ml (4 column volumes) of 100 mm imidazole. After reducing the salt concentration to 0.1 m with 10% (v/v) glycerol, the eluate was loaded onto a Mono Q column, HR 5/5 (AKTA design system, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with Buffer C (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.1m KCl. The column was washed with 1 column volume of equilibration buffer, and HEL308 protein was eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m KCl in Buffer C. HEL308 presence in the eluted fractions was detected by ATPase and helicase activities and by immunoblotting. Active fractions eluting from 0.275 to 0.425 m KCl were pooled, dialysed into Buffer C containing 0.1 m KCl, and loaded onto a Mono S column, HR 5/5 (AKTA design system, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with Buffer C containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed with 1 column volume of equilibration buffer, and HEL308 protein was eluted with a 20-column volume linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.3 min Buffer C. Active fractions eluting from 0.125 to 0.20 mKCl were pooled and dialysed into Buffer C containing 0.1 mKCl. Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). For analysis by gel filtration, 200 μl of fraction number 28 from the Mono Q elution (∼0.3 m KCl) was loaded onto a Superose TM 6 HR 10/30 column (AKTA design system, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in Buffer C without Nonidet P-40 and containing 0.5m KCl. Protein was eluted with 1.5 column volumes of the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting, ATPase, and helicase assays. A calibration curve was prepared by measuring the elution volumes of molecular weight standards using a Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained: 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm cold ATP, 0.25 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity > 5000 Ci/mmol), 1.4 nm HEL308 or 1.4 nm HEL308K365Mprotein. Incubations were for 60 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Released phosphate was separated from ATP by thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose using 0.75 mKH2PO4 as the running buffer. Hydrolysis was quantified with the use of a Fuji phosphorimaging device. Partially double-stranded DNA substrates were generated by annealing oligonucleotides to M13mp18 viral DNA (New England Biolabs). Sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: 20-mer, 5′-GGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCC; 24-mer, CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC; 40-mer, GCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCG; 40-mer + 3′-tail, same sequence as 40-mer plus a non-complementary stretch of (A)10 at its 3′-end; 40-mer + 5′-tail, same sequence as 40-mer plus a non-complementary stretch of (A)10 at its 5′-end; 60-mer, AGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGTAA; 70-mer, TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGC. The gel-purified oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to M13mp18 viral DNA. For determination of polarity, 60- and 70-mer oligonucleotides were annealed to M13mp18, and the duplex portion was cut with SalI and labeled with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), 15 μm cold dTTP, and 20 μCi [α-32P]dCTP. Labeled substrates were separated from labeled oligonucleotides with MobiSpin Sephacryl S-400 columns (MoBiTec). Unless otherwise specified, standard reaction mixtures contained 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, and ∼6 fmol of substrate in a 20-μl volume. Human RPA was produced as a recombinant protein in E. coli, purified according to the method of Henricksen et al. (20Henricksen L. Umbricht C. Wold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and included where indicated. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 6 μl of gel loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 30% glycerol, and 0.17 m EDTA). DNA species were separated by electrophoresis through non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels that were dried and analyzed by autoradiography or quan- tified with a Fuji phosphorimaging device. The GenBankTMaccession number of D. melanogaster mus308 isL76559. The human POLQ NCBI accession number is NM_006596. The mus1 homolog from Caenorhabditis elegansspans cosmids U50184 and U00066 (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers). The Arabidopsis thaliana homolog is on cosmidAL022537 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number). With the aim of isolating proteins involved in DNA cross-link repair, we searched data bases with the DNA helicase portion of Drosophila mus308. We found three human expressed sequence tags, AA625285, H08004, and R24580(NCBI accession numbers), homologous to motif VI of the D. melanogaster mus308 helicase domain. From this ∼700-bp sequence, primers were designed to clone the whole gene by 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (CLONTECH SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit). Total RNA was prepared from a testis cancer cell line (833K) and a bladder cancer cell line (MGH-U1). Two different amplification reactions were performed for each cell line, and in both cases, two fragments of 1767 and 2167 bp were amplified through 3′ RACE and 5′ RACE, respectively. Six different PCR products (three from the 3′ RACE and three from the 5′ RACE) were sequenced to exclude mistakes obtained by PCR amplification. Finally, the complete open reading frame (3303 bp) was constructed by subcloning the 5′- and 3′-fragments into NcoI and KpnI sites of plasmid pFastBac HTb. To reflect the helicase activity described below and the high homology to mus308, we designated the previously unannotated gene as HEL308. The human HEL308 gene maps on chromosome 4q21 and encodes for a protein of 1101 amino acids with a predicted molecular size of 124.5 kDa. We also found a mouse expressed sequence tag (NCBI accession number AA517170) that allowed us to clone mouseHel308 by 3′ and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Mouse Hel308 maps on chromosome 5-E in a region that is syntenic to human 4q21. Human and mouse proteins share 88.6% identity and 93.5% similarity in the region shown in Fig. 1, and they belong to the “superfamily II” of DNA and RNA helicases. We aligned human and mouse HEL308 to D. melanogaster Mus308, C. elegans MUS-1 (3Lawley P.D. Phillips D.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 13-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), human POLQ, and the A. thalianahomolog that we found in the data base (Fig. 1). These proteins share ∼50% similarity, and they fall into the group of helicases designated by Harris et al. (11Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as the MUS308 subfamily. Over the helicase domain region, Drosophila Mus308 has 40% identity (55% similarity) with HEL308 and 50% identity (66% similarity) with human POLQ. Human POLQ and human HEL308 share 40% identity (55% similarity) over the same region. No other human sequences were found approaching these high levels of homology to theDrosophila Mus308 helicase domain. TheHEL308 open reading frame was cloned into plasmid pFastBac HTb, linked to a hexahistidine tag at the N-terminal end. We also generated a cDNA expression construct encoding a tagged version of HEL308 with a single amino acid substitution at position 365. This conserved lysine residue is in the putative Walker A nucleotide binding motif and was changed to a methionine residue using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting protein is referred to as HEL308K365M. For a number of ATPases, includingE. coli UvrD and S. cerevisiae Rad3, mutation of the equivalent lysine residue severely impairs nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis, although the overall structure of the protein seems to remain intact (21Sung P. Higgins L. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22George J.W. Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Winkler G.S. Vermeulen W. Coin F. Egly J.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Weeda G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For protein production, both cDNAs were placed under the transcriptional control of the polyhedrin promoter in recombinant baculoviruses. These viruses were used to transfect Sf9 cells. The proteins HEL308 and HEL308K365M were detected in cell extracts by immunoblotting (data not shown). The extract was fractionated over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate superflow resin (Qiagen), a Mono Q column, and a Mono S column, and samples of the HEL308-containing fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2). A sample of the final purification step of the HEL308K365M protein, which was produced and purified in exactly the same manner as the wild type protein, is shown in Fig. 2, lane 5. To characterize human HEL308, helicase and ATPase assays were performed on fractions along the Mono Q column gradient. Human HEL308 co-fractionated with a helicase activity and an ATPase activity (Fig.3), though protein eluting after the peak fraction may be in a less active form. The helicase assay tested the ability to displace a 24-nt oligonucleotide from M13mp18 viral DNA (Fig. 3 B). In the ATPase assay, released radiolabeled phosphate was separated from non-hydrolyzed ATP by thin layer chromatography, and the extent of hydrolysis was quantified (Fig.3 C). This ATPase activity was dependent upon the addition of single-stranded DNA to the reaction mixture, as found for other related enzymes (24Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Human HEL308 was further purified through a Mono S column. HEL308 ATPase activity was strongly stimulated by single-stranded DNA but not by double-stranded plasmid DNA (Fig.4 A). Unwinding of the 40-bp partial duplex substrate catalyzed by HEL308 required a nucleotide cofactor (Fig. 4 B), as expected. Substituting 4 mm Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ gave barely detectable helicase activity (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). A non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, could not support the helicase activity (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). To determine whether nucleotide hydrolysis was needed for helicase activity, increasing amounts of AMP-PNP or ATPγS were added to reaction mixtures that contained 2 mm ATP (Fig. 4 C). AMP-PNP at 10 mm and ATPγS at 2 mm were competitive inhibitors of helicase action, indicating that they bind to HEL308 in place of ATP and that nucleotide hydrolysis is necessary for activity. The result also suggests that ATPγS has a higher affinity for HEL308 nucleotide binding sites than AMP-PNP. Drosophila RecQ5 helicase activity is similarly inhibited by an equimolar ratio of ATPγS to ATP but not by an equimolar ratio of AMP-PNP to ATP (25Özsoy A.Z. Sekelsky J.J. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2986-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 2–4 mm AMP-PNP stimulated unwinding activity by about 2-fold in the presence of 2 mm ATP. This may suggest cooperative binding to an enzyme that has both catalytic and noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites, as found for the hexameric T7 gene 4 and E. coli Rho helicases (26Kim D.E. Shigesada K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11623-11628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). T7 gene 4 helicase prefers dTTP as a nucleotide cofactor, and the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analog dTMP-PCP can bind to a noncatalytic site with little effect on dTTPase turnover (27Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the nucleotide preference of HEL308, eight nucleotides were tested for their ability to support unwinding of the 40-bp partial duplex substrate. At the 2 mm nucleotide concentration used, only ATP and dATP gave detectable activity with 76% displacement in the presence of dATP and 33% displacement with ATP (Fig.4 B). ATP was used in further experiments since the ATP concentration in the cell is higher than the dATP concentration. To determine whether HEL308 can unwind longer DNA duplexes, similar DNA substrates were constructed containing 60- or 70-nt fragments annealed to M13mp18. DNA helicase assays were performed with each DNA substrate in the presence of increasing amounts of HEL308 (Fig.5). The mutant HEL308K365Mcould displace none of the substrates (Fig. 5, lanes 3, A–F) and had no ATPase activity (not shown), confirming that these catalytic activities are due to wild type HEL308 enzyme. The HEL308 helicase displaced both the 60- and the 70-nt fragments, although with much less efficiency than the 20- and 40-nt fragments. After 30 min, 1.4 nm HEL308 displaced 89, 32, 2.6, and 2.5% of the 20-, 40-, 60-, and 70-nt oligonucleotides, respectively. Substrates with 3′- or 5′-unpaired flaps were also tested. A non-complementary stretch of (A)10 was added either 5′ or 3′ of the 40-nt fragment (Fig. 5, C and D). In neither case was unwinding activity changed, as compared with the displacement of the 40-nt fragment (Fig. 5 G). We followed the unwinding reaction of the 20-bp partial duplex substrate at different time points using 0.14 nm HEL308 (Fig.5 H). After 10 min, 20% of the substrate was unwound with 50% unwinding reached after 18 min. The percentage of unwound substrate increased further with time. One possible reason for the fact that the HEL308 helicase is less efficient in unwinding DNA duplexes of increasing length might be that the displaced single strand tends to re-anneal. If this is the case, the activity of HEL308 might be stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. To test this possibility, the helicase activity was measured in the presence of purified human RPA (Fig. 6). In reactions containing the annealed 70-nt fragment and 2.8 nm HEL308, RPA stimulated HEL308 helicase activity with maximal stimulation at ∼2 nm RPA. At this concentration, RPA increased displacement of the 70-nt fragment by 2.6-fold. 7.5 nm RPA did not stimulate HEL308 helicase activity (Fig. 6, lane 8), and concentrations of RPA equal or higher than 15 nm inhibited its activity (data not shown). These results suggest that RPA stimulates HEL308 by binding to the unwound regions produced by HEL308 helicase activity and inhibiting re-annealing. Given a binding site of about 30 nt for human RPA (28Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36446-36453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), 15 nm RPA covers approximately 25% of the M13 single-stranded DNA annealed to the 70-nt fragment. This concentration of RPA may more likely inhibit HEL308 translocation on DNA rather than its binding to DNA. The order of addition of RPA and HEL308 did not affect these results (data not shown). To determine the polarity of the HEL308 helicase,the 60-nt oligonucleotide was annealed to M13mp18 DNA, cut with SalI, and labeled at the 3′-ends with 32P. This produced linear M13mp18 DNA with a 20-nt fragment annealed to its 5′-end and a 44-nt fragment annealed to its 3′-end. HEL308 displaced only the 20-nt fragment, indicating translocation in the 3′ to 5′ direction (Fig.7 A). Because HEL308 helicase activity decreases as a function of the size of the annealed oligonucleotide that it has to displace, a second DNA substrate was prepared. In this case, 42- and 32-nt fragments were annealed at the 5′- and 3′-end of linear M13mp18 DNA, respectively. HEL308 helicase activity displaced only the 42-nt fragment (Fig. 7 B). These results confirm that the polarity of the HEL308 helicase is 3′ to 5′ relative to the single-stranded region. The oligomeric structure of a DNA helicase is an important parameter that may have implications for its mechanism of action (29Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The native molecular weight of human HEL308 was estimated from gel filtration analysis. Fraction 28 of the Mono Q column was loaded onto a Superose column equilibrated in buffer that included 0.5 m KCl. Proteins were eluted, and fractions were analyzed. Immunoblotting, ATPase, and helicase activities all co-eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular size of ∼600 kDa as determined from standards (Fig.8). This would be consistent with a possible hexameric association given the predicted molecular size of 124 kDa for a HEL308 monomer. Under the same gel filtration conditions, the mutant HEL308K365M protein eluted at the same position as wild type HEL308 as determined by immunoblotting (not shown). This suggests that the point mutation K365M in the Walker A motif does not alter the quaternary structure of the protein. We isolated human and mouse homologs of the helicase domain ofD. melanogaster mus308 and designated them HEL308. Drosophila mus308 encodes a DNA polymerase in its C-terminal portion and a DNA helicase in its N-terminal portion (11Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We found homologs of Drosophila mus308 in C. elegans andA. thaliana in addition to those in human and mouse, but we could not find any homolog in S. cerevisiae or in other yeast and bacterial species. The presumably full-length cDNA for human POLQ also has a predicted helicase domain at the N terminus, but its activity remains to be demonstrated. The MUS308 family of helicases is part of the superfamily II of DNA and RNA helicases. Harris et al. (11Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) identified other sequences in GenBankTM that have sequence similarity to the helicase domain of Drosophila mus308. Besides the seven characteristic motifs of the superfamily II, these putative helicases include motifs Ib and IVa containing characteristic residues in the MUS308 subfamily. Motif I (the Walker A box) is unusual in having a serine in place of the glycine found in almost all Walker A motifs of known or putative helicases (Fig. 1, asterisk). Other residues, shown with an asterisk in Fig. 1, are peculiar to the MUS308 family of helicases: in motif V, the threonine is usually a hydrophobic residue in other members of superfamily II; in motif VI, the methionine is on the contrary usually a charged residue. Moreover, the MUS308 subfamily seems to combine motifs from various families. Motif II is characteristic of the so-called DEXH family of helicases, which includes many “repair/recombination” helicases, such as Rad3, Rad54, WRN, and BLM, whereas motif IV has characteristics of the DEAD family of RNA helicases. HEL308 is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase. It translocates on DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity and efficiently displaces 20- to 40-mer duplex oligonucleotides. Although activity on longer substrates is lower, it can be stimulated by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA. Other helicases have been shown to be stimulated by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. For example,S. cerevisiae MER3 helicase efficiently unwinds a 631-nt fragment only in the presence of RPA (30Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Substrates with 3′- or 5′-unpaired flaps do not stimulate HEL308 activity, whereas many helicases, such as E. coli DnaB, phage T4 gene 41 protein, and phage T7 gene 4 protein, require a forked DNA substrate to initiate DNA unwinding in vitro (29Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). WRN helicase displaces a 40-nt oligonucleotide much more efficiently when two unpaired 10-mers are added to the 40-mer at its 3′- and 5′-ends (31Suzuki N. Shimamoto A. Imamura O. Kuromitsu J. Kitao S. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Both BLM and WRN prefer a fork DNA substrate to unwind DNA (32Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis suggests that HEL308 behaves as a multimer, possibly a hexamer. A few DNA helicases studied to date operate as monomers, such as PcrA (33Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and T4 Dda helicase (34Morris P.D. Tackett A.J. Babb K. Nanduri B. Chick C. Scott J. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19691-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Many more helicases are active as oligomers, often as hexamers (T7 gene 4, T4 gp41, E. coli DnaB, and BLM) or dimers (E. coli Rep helicase) (29Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 35Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Studies by electron microscopy will reveal whether HEL308 forms multimeric structures. Drosophila mus308 is believed to be involved in the repair of interstrand DNA cross-linking damage since mus308 mutants are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as photoactivated psoralen, diepoxybutane, and nitrogen mustard but are not sensitive to the monofunctional alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (11Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Not much is known about how interstrand cross-links are repaired in eukaryotes. Biochemical and genetic analyses in prokaryotes indicate that DNA interstrand cross-links are repaired by an excision-recombination mechanism (36Cheng S. Van Houten B. Gamper H.B. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15110-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sladek F.M. Munn M.M. Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6755-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli,removal of a DNA interstrand cross-link is initiated by the UvrABC endonuclease complex, which incises one strand on each side of the cross-link. The 5′ nuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, in concert with the UvrD helicase, generates a gap at the site of incision. The resulting single-stranded region provides a substrate for binding of RecA protein and for the initiation of homologous pairing and strand exchange. The polymerase activity of DNA polymerase I can then carry out repair synthesis with an undamaged homolog as a template. Some aspects of this mechanism of interstrand cross-link repair may be conserved in eukaryotes. Genetic data suggest that both excision and recombination are involved in the repair of interstrand cross-links in eukaryotes as well. Mus308 and POLQ belong to the A family of DNA polymerases, as does E. coli DNA polymerase I. Both UvrD and HEL308 are 3′ to 5′ multimeric DNA helicases. This direction of translocation along DNA would fit a model where coupling between a helicase and a polymerase coordinates duplex unwinding and polymerization. Gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 encodes a protein (gp4) that has both a helicase and an RNA primase domain. gp4 forms hexameric rings that can translocate along single-stranded DNA, coupling the unwinding of duplex DNA with the synthesis of short RNA primers that are elongated by T7 DNA polymerase (38VanLoock M.S. Chen Y.J. Yu X. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to analyze whether HEL308 interacts with a polymerase and forms a complex with an activity similar to T7 gp4. The existence of both HEL308 and the very similar putative helicase of POLQ raises further questions concerning the functions of these enzymes. It is possible that they function in DNA repair processes in different tissues. Fanconi anemia cell lines are sensitive to interstrand cross-linking agents. Thus far, eight Fanconi anemia complementation groups have been defined, and six genes have been mapped and cloned (1Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the possibility that HEL308 might be one of the two remaining uncloned genes, FANCB andFANCD1.

MIR1 and MIR2 do not affect the assembly or transport of their target proteins through the secretory pathway; rather, they act to enhance the selective endocytosis of target chains from the cell surface. Sequence inspection reveals that the modulator of immune recognition (MIR) proteins contain an NH2-terminal zinc finger of the plant homeodomain (PHD) subfamily, two transmembrane (TM) domains, and a C-terminal conserved region (CR). Here we examine the transmembrane topology and functional organization of MIR2. Both the PHD domain and the CR are disposed cytosolically and are essential for MIR-mediated endocytosis. MIR proteins form homo-oligomers; this activity is independent of the PHD and CR elements and maps instead to the TM regions. Analysis of chimeras between MIR1 and MIR2 reveals that the TM regions also mediate target selectivity. Mutations that ablate the PHD or CR regions generate dominant negative phenotypes for major histocompatibility complex class I endocytosis. These findings suggest a domain organization for the MIR proteins, with the TM regions involved in target selection and the cytosolic PHD and CR domains involved in the possible recruitment of cellular machinery that directly or indirectly regulates internalization of target molecules.

Herpesviruses are a family of large DNA viruses that are able to induce a persistent (usually lifelong) infection. To facilitate the production of such long term infections, herpesviruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade immune detection.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (also known as human herpesvirus 8) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and several other AIDS-related proliferative disorders (1Whitby D. Boshoff C.

A. 2000; 97: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have shown that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus possesses two genes, K3 and K5, that encode protein products termed MIR1 and MIR2, respectively (for modulator of immune recognition). MIR1 and MIR2 are homologous proteins that are localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lead to reduction of the levels of MHC-I chains present at the cell surface (3Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Despite their predominantly ER localization, MIR1 and MIR2 do not affect the assembly, glycosylation, or transport of MHC-I chains in that organelle. Rather, they act to enhance the endocytosis of MHC-I chains from the cell surface, with the endocytosed chains subsequently targeted to the lysosome for proteolytic destruction (3Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). major histocompatibility complex endoplasmic reticulum intracellular adhesion molecule modulator of immune recognition plant homeodomain transmembrane conserved region fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence-activated cell sorting green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP horseradish peroxidase hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin allophycocyanin major histocompatibility complex endoplasmic reticulum intracellular adhesion molecule modulator of immune recognition plant homeodomain transmembrane conserved region fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence-activated cell sorting green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP horseradish peroxidase hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin allophycocyanin This enhanced endocytosis of MHC-I does not reflect a generalized induction of endocytosis, since many other surface proteins known to undergo internalization, including the transferrin receptor and MHC class II molecules, are unaffected by the MIR proteins (3Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, MHC-I is not the sole target of the MIR protein family. Two other molecules involved in immune recognition can be down-regulated by MIR2 expression: B7.2, a cell surface protein involved in helper T cell activation (costimulation), and intracellular adhesion protein-1 (ICAM-1), an adhesion protein important for the formation of the immunological synapse (7Coscoy L. Ganem D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Ishido S. Choi J.K. Lee B.S. Wang C. DeMaria M. Johnson R.P. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. Immunity. 2000; 13: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither of these two proteins is targeted by MIR1, indicating that there has been functional specialization of the MIRs during Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus evolution. Although the overall fate of the target surface immunoregulatory proteins is clear, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which MIR1 and MIR2 target these chains and mediate their endocytosis remains fragmentary. Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of the MIR proteins shows that they contain a zinc finger domain of the plant homeodomain (PHD) subfamily at their amino terminus, along with two transmembrane (TM) domains near the center of the proteins (see Fig.1 A). Distal to TM domain II is a short sequence (termed the conserved region (CR)) that is also highly conserved between MIR1 and MIR2. PHD family zinc fingers, also known as leukemia-associated protein zinc fingers (9Linder B. Newman R. Jones L.K. Debernardi S. Young B.D. Freemont P. Verrijzer C.P. Saha V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), have been implicated in protein-protein interactions (9Linder B. Newman R. Jones L.K. Debernardi S. Young B.D. Freemont P.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutations in the zinc finger region abrogate MIR function (8Ishido S. Choi J.K. Lee B.S. Wang C. DeMaria M. Johnson R.P. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. Immunity. 2000; 13: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but beyond this, little is known of structure-function relationships in the protein. To gain a better understanding of which regions of the MIR proteins are important for function, we have examined the transmembrane topology and functional organization of MIR2. These studies show that the transmembrane domains of the protein play a key role in determining the target specificity of the protein. The PHD and CR elements are also critical for function, and mutations targeted to these regions result in dominant negative inhibitors of MIR2 action. These findings suggest a domain organization for the MIR proteins, with its TM regions involved in target selection and the cytosolic PHD and CR domains involved in the possible recruitment of cellular machinery that could directly or indirectly regulate internalization of target molecules. CV-1, Phoenix, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME-H21), and BJAB lymphoma cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640. All media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections of CV-1 and Phoenix cells were performed using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. BJAB cells were transfected by electroporation (250 V, 950 microfarads) of 20 μg of plasmid DNA into 107 cells in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium (13Lagunoff M. Lukac D.M. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5891-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cells were then transferred to complete RPMI, which was preincubated to 37 °C. The transfection efficiency of BJAB cells was routinely 30–50% under these conditions. For immunofluorescence analysis, mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 20 μg/ml and rabbit anti-HA (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:50. Sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to FITC (Sigma) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas Red (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used at a concentration of 4 μg/ml. For FACS analysis, mouse anti-HLA class I (APC-conjugated or FITC-conjugated; Caltag Laboratories) and mouse anti-B7.2 (phycoerythrin-conjugated; Caltag Laboratories) were used at a dilution of 1:300. Western blotting used mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:400, mouse anti-GFP (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:300 or rabbit anti-HA (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:256 or mouse anti-GFP. Secondary antibodies for Western blots were HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig and donkey anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that were both used at dilutions of 1:1500. All constructs were made by PCR amplification of MIR1, MIR2, or EGFP. Chimeric fusions between EGFP and MIR2 truncation or MIR1 and MIR2 were made by amplification of overlapping PCR fragments. All expression constructs were introduced into the BamHI and NotI site of pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The amino FLAG-tagged/internal HA-tagged version (see Fig. 2 A) of the MIR2 gene was subcloned from pCR3.1-FLAG-MIR2-HA vector into pBMN-ZIN (kindly provided by G. Nolan, Stanford University). This retroviral vector permits the expression of pCR3.1-FLAG-MIR2-HA and the neomycin resistance gene from a single bicistronic mRNA. Upon transfection with the retroviral vectors (pBMN), the Phoenix packaging cell line produces replication-defective viral particles that can be used to stably transduce CV-1 cells. Phoenix cells were transfected, and the virus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 h after the transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and diluted with Polybrene (4 μg/ml final dilution). CV-1 cells (in six-well dishes) were infected by spin infection (800 × g for 2 h at 20 °C) using 2 ml of viral supernatant. Selection of transduced CV-1 was started 36 h after infection by adding 1.5 mg/ml of G418. Cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and washed again with PBS. For selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, cells were incubated in 5 μg/ml of digitonin (Sigma) in digitonin buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Pipes at pH 6.8) for 5 min on ice. Complete permeabilization was achieved by incubating cells in 0.2% saponin (Sigma) in PBS plus 1% BSA for 40 s at room temperature as previously described (14Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R. Gerard C. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14122-14129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All subsequent incubations of the completely permeabilized samples were carried out in the presence of 0.2% saponin. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in PBS plus 1% BSA to block nonspecific binding. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS plus 1% BSA, washed with PBS, and incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in PBS plus 1% BSA. After extensive washing, the cells were mounted onto glass slides with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed by using a Leica fluorescent microscope using appropriate filters. As a negative control, cells not exposed to either detergent displayed only background levels of staining with FLAG or HA antibodies (not shown). When cells were exposed to either digitonin or saponin under the above conditions, over 90% of cells examined were stained by anti-FLAG antibody, indicating efficient detergent action. 10-cm dishes of 293T cells were transfected by Fugene6 with 6 μg of pCR3.1-FLAG-MIR2 or pCR3.1-HA-MIR2 and 6 μg of pCR3.1. In parallel, another dish was transfected with 6 μg of each of the tagged versions of MIR2. 48 h posttransfection, the medium was removed, and the plates were washed with PBS that was preincubated to 4 °C. Radioimmune precipitation buffer (PBS with 1% Igepal (Sigma), 0.5% deoxycholic acid sodium salt (Sigma), and 0.1% SDS) was added to the plate, the cells were scraped from the dishes, and protein lysates were made by passing through a 21-gauge needle. The lysates were cleared of debris by centrifuging in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min; split in half; and incubated with either mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody, mouse anti-GFP, or rabbit anti-HA antibody. The antibody-bound proteins were then incubated with protein A/G+-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to immunoprecipitate the antibody-bound tagged versions of MIR2. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel; transferred to nitrocellulose; and Western blotted with either mouse anti-FLAG M2, mouse anti-HA, or mouse anti-GFP and then incubated with goat-anti mouse Ig HRP and visualized with Luminol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were washed in 1% PBS plus BSA and incubated with specific mAbs (1 μg/106 cell) for 60 min at 4 °C. Cell surface fluorescence was analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and cell populations were analyzed with CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson). 293T cells in six-well dishes were transfected with 2 μg of vector alone or 0.5 μg of pCR3.1-MIR2-EGFP and either 1.75 μg of pCR3.1 vector or pCR3.1-FLAG-MIR2-ΔPHD. After 36 h, the cells were removed from their dishes by using cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were washed with PBS, incubated in mouse anti-HLA (APC-conjugated; Caltag Laboratories) in PBS plus 1% BSA at a dilution of 1:300 for 1 h, and washed twice with PBS. Cell surface fluorescence was analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur. In Figs. 5 and 6, the FACS analysis was gated on EGFP-positive (i.e. transfected) cells, and the level of MHC class I on the surface of such cells was quantified.Figure 6A C-terminal truncation of MIR2 has a dominant negative phenotype. 293T cells were transfected with pCR3.1 (four times), pCR3.1-MIR2 (FLAG-tagged) (one time) (A) or pCR3.1-MIR2 (FLAG-tagged) (one time) and pCR3.1-MIR2 ΔC1 (four times) (B). After 36 h, cells were stained with mouse anti-HLA class I conjugated to APC and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. FLAG-positive cells were gated, and the levels of HLA class I on the cell surface were measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MIR2 contains no recognizable signal sequence in its primary amino acid sequence, but the protein is predicted to contain two transmembrane domains. To determine the transmembrane topology of the MIR2 protein, we employed a recently described system involving selective permeabilization-based immunofluorescence (14Mziaut H. Korza G. Hand A.R.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, a form of MIR2 was constructed in which a FLAG epitope tag was placed at the amino terminus of the molecule and an HA tag was placed between the two transmembrane domains. This doubly tagged protein is fully functional for B7.2 and ICAM-1 down-regulation (data not shown). CV-1 cells were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding this version of MIR2. These cells were fixed and subjected to permeabilization with either (i) digitonin, which selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane but leaves the ER membrane intact, or (ii) saponin, which under these conditions permeabilizes both the plasma membrane and the internal membranes of the cell (16Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 17Hill A. Jugovic P. York I. Russ G. Bennink J. Yewdell J. Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Following detergent treatment, cells were stained for the FLAG tag (detected by FITC-conjugated second antibody) or the HA tag (stained with Texas Red-conjugated second antibody). Digitonin permeabilization allows immunofluorescent tagging of only the FLAG tag (Fig. 1 C) and not the HA tag (Fig.1 D), suggesting that the amino terminus of MIR2 is in the cytosol while the intermembranous loop is in the lumen. This is confirmed by permeabilization with saponin (Fig. 1, E andF), which allows immunofluorescent staining of both of the tags. This orientation disposes the zinc finger/PHD domain on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (Fig. 1 G). Since PHD domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (9Linder B. Newman R. Jones L.K. Debernardi S. Young B.D. Freemont P. Verrijzer C.P. Saha V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), this would place it in a context where it could be available for interactions with cytosolic constituents. Similar studies with a C-terminal tagged version of MIR2 show that the C terminus is also in the cytoplasm (not shown). Western blotting of MIR2 in whole cell lysates often shows high molecular weight bands (Fig.2 A), raising the possibility that MIR2 may form homo- or hetero-oligomeric structures. To test if MIR2 can homo-oligomerize, the protein was tagged with either a FLAG epitope or an HA epitope at its amino terminus. The tagged versions of MIR2 were transfected alone (Fig. 2, A and B,lanes 1 and 2) or together (Fig.2 B, lane 3) into 293T cells, and cell lysates were prepared. Fig. 2 A shows that both HA- and FLAG-tagged MIR2 display high molecular weight forms and that, as expected, there is no serologic cross-reaction between the HA and FLAG tags. Therefore, the high molecular weight forms are not the result of nonspecific antibody reactivity. As shown in lane 3 of Fig. 2 B, immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies show that the differentially tagged versions of MIR2 can coimmunoprecipitate. This coprecipitation is dependent upon coexpression of the two proteins and indicates the formation of stable homo-oligomers. Similar findings have been made for MIR 1 (data not shown). A truncated form of MIR2 containing the two transmembrane regions and only a portion of the CR (Fig. 2 C) is able to specifically coimmunoprecipitate with full-length MIR2 (Fig. 2 D), showing that oligomerization probably happens by interactions within the transmembrane domain and/or intermembranous loop. To map regions of MIR2 that are important for its function, we generated a series of MIR2 truncations and examined their ability to down-regulate surface MHC-I and B7.2 (Fig.3 A). As outlined in the legend to Fig. 3, most of the truncations were expressed as MIR2-GFP fusion proteins. (Wild-type MIR2 is fully functional when fused to GFP in this fashion (Fig.3 C). 2L. Coscoy, unpublished data. ) Following transfection, the FACS analysis was gated on transfected (e.g. GFP-positive) cells, whose surface MHC-I and B7.2 levels were then examined. All truncations were stably expressed as judged by immunofluorescence analysis and flow cytometry (not shown). As expected from previous results (8Ishido S. Choi J.K. Lee B.S. Wang C. DeMaria M. Johnson R.P. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. Immunity. 2000; 13: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), a deletion of the amino terminus to the first transmembrane region (thereby removing the PHD zinc finger) abrogates the ability of MIR2 to down-regulate either MHC class I or B7.2 from the cell surface (Fig. 3 D). However, the PHD zinc finger by itself is not sufficient to induce the removal of target molecules from the cell surface (Fig. 3 E). Consistent with this, removal of the entire C-terminal cytosolic tail also destroys function, indicating that even a PHD zinc finger tethered to the membrane does not suffice to up-regulate endocytosis (Fig.3 F). This is despite the fact that it is stably expressed and accumulates in the ER as efficiently as WT MIR2 (not shown). However, the addition of a small portion of the downstream cytosolic tail encompassing the CR sequences restores full function for B7.2 down-regulation and partial function for MHC-I down-regulation (Fig.3 G). Thus, each cytosolic domain contains conserved sequences that are necessary, but not sufficient, for MIR function. To map regions of MIR responsible for determining the selection of its targets, we took advantage of the fact that MIR2 can down-regulate B7.2 and ICAM-1 as well as MHC-I, whereas MIR1 can only down-regulate MHC-I chains (7Coscoy L. Ganem D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Ishido S. Choi J.K. Lee B.S. Wang C. DeMaria M. Johnson R.P. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. Immunity. 2000; 13: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine which regions of MIR2 account for its expanded target range, we constructed chimeras between these two highly related viral proteins (Fig.4 A) and analyzed the ability of the resulting chimeras to down-regulate surface MHC-I, B7.2, and ICAM-1 following transient transfection of BJAB cells (Fig.4 B). (Unlike in Fig. 3, the FACS analysis of Fig.4 B does not gate on the transfected cells; it displays the entire BJAB population, about 30–50% of which are transfected). A chimeric molecule that replaces the amino terminus of MIR2 with that of MIR1 does not affect the down-regulation of B7.2 (Fig. 4 B, construct I). Similarly, replacement of both the N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains of MIR2 with their cognate regions of MIR1 does not affect the target selectivity of the protein; like WT MIR2, this chimera also down-regulates both MHC-I and B7.2 (Fig. 4 B, construct III). Thus, this selectivity must reside in the TM domains and intermembranous loop of MIR2. As expected, the chimera encoded by construct II, which bears the TM and intermembranous regions of MIR1, has the target range of MIR1. Finally, replacement of the intermembranous loop of MIR2 with that of MIR1 has no impact on MIR2 function (data not shown), suggesting that it is the TM domains of MIR2 that account for its target selectivity. In all cases, the abilities of the chimeras to down-regulate B7.2 and ICAM-1 were inseparable (data not shown), so only the B7.2 data are depicted here. The above experiments establish that there are several domains of MIR2 that are required for the MIR2-mediated endocytosis of molecules from the cell surface; some of these affect target selectivity, whereas others affect functions common to all targets. In other multifunctional proteins, deletion of a single effector domain often generates dominant negative mutants. Such mutants can have many bases: formation of nonfunctional hetero-oligomers, competition for binding to an essential partner, etc. Accordingly, we sought to establish whether deletion of one domain of MIR2 might engender a dominant negative mutant. For this, we initially selected the MIR2 ΔPHD mutant (see Fig. 3 A), which lacks the NH2-terminal cytosolic domain (including the conserved PHD domain). Cells were cotransfected with a fixed quantity of WT MIR2 and either the empty vector or a vector expressing the ΔPHD mutant. As expected, wild-type MIR2 expression reduces the surface level of MHC class I when cotransfected with vector alone (Fig.5 A). When MIR2 was cotransfected with the MIR2 ΔPHD mutant, the surface level of MHC class I was restored to a level comparable with the vector-transfected controls (Fig. 5 B), indicating that MIR2 ΔPHD acts as a dominant negative mutant. As a specificity control, expression of MIR2 ΔPHD did not restore surface levels of MHC-I that had been reduced by cotransfection with a vector expressing the herpes simplex ICP47 protein (Fig. 5 C). ICP47 acts by inhibiting the TAP transporter, preventing the loading of assembling MHC-I chains with antigenic peptides and thereby blocking egress of MHC-I chains from the ER (17Hill A. Jugovic P. York I. Russ G. Bennink J. Yewdell J. Ploegh H. Johnson D. Nature. 1995; 375: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 18Fruh K. Ahn K. Djaballah H. Sempe P. van Endert P.M. Tampe R. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the negative effects of the ΔPHD mutant are selective for MHC-I down-regulation mediated by MIR. Similar findings were made with mutant MIR2ΔC1, which lacks the C-terminal cytosolic region including the CR element (see Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.6 A, WT MIR2 cotransfected with an empty expression vector produced the expected reduction in cell surface MHC-I chains. However, this reduction could be abrogated by coexpression of the MIR2ΔC1 mutant (Fig. 6 B). Thus, deletion of either the N- or C-terminal cytosolic tail of MIR2 generates mutants that can block the ability of the WT protein to regulate the selective endocytosis of its MHC-I protein target. These data establish that MIR2, a novel viral mediator of immune evasion, is an oligomeric, type III membrane protein with two transmembrane domains flanked by cytosolic regions at the N and C termini. Each cytosolic tail contains conserved sequences; the NH2-terminal region harbors a conserved zinc finger of the PHD subfamily, whereas the C-terminal tail contains a shorter CR of unknown function. Analysis of MIR1/MIR2 chimeras indicates that the transmembrane regions are the major determinants of target selectivity. We do not know whether one or both TM regions are required for this activity, nor do we yet understand the biochemical basis for target selection. The simplest model would be that the TM regions of MIR2 interact, directly or indirectly, with the TM domains of its target(s). Consistent with this idea, we and others (6Stevenson P.G. Efstathiou S. Doherty P.C. Lehner P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have recently found that MIR2 can down-regulate human but not mouse MHC-I chains, and chimeras between human and mouse MHC-I implicate the TM domain of the target in conferral of MIR2 regulation (19Coscoy L. Sanchez D. Ganem D. J. Cell Biology. 2001; 155: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, more indirect models are also possible. This raises an interesting conundrum, since MIRs localize principally in the ER (3Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 5Ishido S. Wang C. Lee B.S. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but their targets are endocytosed from the plasma membrane (3Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). It is possible that the interaction between effector and target takes place in the ER, leading to “marking” of the target chains for later endocytosis. However, in an earlier study (3Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), we showed that MHC-I chains made in the absence of MIR proteins could be down-regulated following subsequent introduction of MIR expression vectors. If so, this would make “ER marking” an unlikely model. We think it more likely that a small fraction of MIR chains escape the ER and travel to the plasma membrane, where they can carry out their function. However, since flow cytometric and surface labeling experiments 3L. Coscoy and D. Ganem, unpublished observations. have been unable to reproducibly observe such chains above the background level, we estimate that putative surface MIR proteins would have to represent <5% of the total intracellular pool. Our analysis of deletion mutants and chimeras supports the notion that the MIR2 protein is composed of multiple domains, with the TM regions determining target selection and the cytosolic regions mediating other function(s) that are common to the endocytosis of all target proteins. Our experiments do not suffice to define the nature of these cytosolic function(s) but indicate that, whatever they may be, both cytosolic domains are required for their action. Deletion of cytosolic regions not only inactivates MIR2 function but, consistent with the aforementioned domain organization, creates dominant negative mutants. Since only the TM and intermembranous regions are required for oligomer formation, such phenotypes might result from the creation of mixed, nonfunctional oligomers with WT MIR2. Alternatively (or additionally), the mutants might act by titrating away a putative essential cellular cofactor required for either interaction with the substrate or downstream interactions of a putative MIR-substrate complex with the endocytic machinery. We are currently screening for host factors that might interact with these regions, using a variety of genetic and biochemical screens. Given the remarkable selectivity of MIR-regulated endocytosis, delineation of the pathways that are engaged by MIR proteins can be expected to further inform our understanding of the cell biology of regulated endocytosis.

CS protein is a member of the thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR) domain family and possess a single copy of TSR domain toward its carboxyl terminus. We show by a direct measurement the correlation between the binding activity of various segments of the CS protein and their ability to inhibit the invasion of liver cells by the sporozoites. We made eight truncated versions of Plasmodium falciparum CS protein to elucidate the role of various regions in the binding and invasion process. Deletion of the TSR domain actually enhanced binding activity by 2–3-fold without the loss of receptor specificity, indicating that TSR may not be the only domain in defining the specificity of binding. These same deletions blocked invasion of live sporozoites more efficiently than proteins that include the TSR domain. Deletion of as little as six amino acids from amino terminus of the protein, however, renders it incapable of binding to liver cells and as an inhibitor of sporozoite invasion. Hence, the binding of CS protein to liver cells and its ability to inhibit the invasion process are affected in a parallel manner, both positively and negatively, by sequence changes in the encoded CS gene. This indicates that both assays are measuring interrelated phenomenon and points to the essential involvement for the amino-terminal portion of the CS protein in these processes.

The central repeat segment is a low complexity region containing multiple copies of species-specific repeat peptides (NANP in case of P. falciparum) with no obvious sequence homology to any known protein.

Given that the TSR domain receptors are ubiquitous on host cells, it is difficult to envision that the TSR domain alone is responsible for specific binding and invasion of hepatocytes. To address this issue, we have constructed variants of the CS protein lacking either the TSR domain or residues from amino terminus or both. Characterization of these mutants uncovers the crucial role of amino terminus of CS protein in these processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsEscherichia coli strain BL21(λDE3) and vector pET11a were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). Heparin, fucoidan, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate B, dextran sulfate, chondroitinase ABC, and heparinase I of Flavobacterium heparinum was obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen. Heparin-Sepharose column was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The hepatoma cell line (HepG2) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Anti-mouse-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was from Pierce. Monoclonal antibody 2A10 directed against the (NANP) n repeat domain was a kind gift from Dr. Robert Wirtz (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA).Construction of CS Deletion MutantsCarboxyl Terminus DeletionsPlasmid pCS1 was used as template for the construction of these deletion mutants. Plasmid pCS1 contains DNA sequence encoding for a mature CS protein in pET11a, a T7 promoter-based E. coli expression vector (19Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two CS DNA sequences lacking 90 and 109 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus were amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotides used for amplification were designed such that an NdeI and a BamHI restriction site was introduced at 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The insert was digested and cloned in pET11a, giving rise to plasmids pCS20 and pCS21 lacking 109 and 90 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus, respectively. Plasmid pCS27 only encodes for the first 97 amino acids from the amino terminus and has been described elsewhere (20Rathore D. Kumar S. Lanar D.E. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Amino Terminus DeletionsDNA encoding truncated versions of CS, lacking 6, 14, 23, 28, and 90 amino acids from the amino terminus, were amplified by PCR from plasmid pCS1 and cloned in vector pET11a giving rise to plasmids pCS19, pCS16, pCS17, pCS6, and pCS7, respectively.Carboxyl and Amino Terminus DeletionPlasmid pCS20 was used as a template to amplify a fragment of CS lacking 28 amino acids from the amino terminus and 109 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. The truncated fragment was cloned in pET11a, giving rise to plasmid pCS25.Expression, Localization, and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsAll the constructs were expressed in bacterial strain BL21, containing T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of lacpromoter, as described (19Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transformed with the desired plasmid and the culture was expanded in super broth (pH 7.2), containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At A 600 of 1.0, cells were induced for 4 h with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested, and the periplasm was separated by a gentle osmotic shock without disrupting the cell membrane. Except for pCS7, CS proteins from all the constructs were purified on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column as described (19Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Periplasmic extract containing CS7 was purified on a Q-Sepharose (anion exchange) column. Subsequently, all the proteins were subjected to gel filtration chromatography.Cell Binding AssayHepatoma cell line HepG2 was used to evaluate the binding activity, and the assay was performed as described (3Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Clavijo P. Santos M.J. Nussenzweig V. Cell. 1992; 70: 1021-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by blocking with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Proteins were incubated with cells for 1 h, followed by anti-CS monoclonal antibody for 30 min and alkaline phosphatase coupled anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate was used as substrate, and fluorescence was measured in a fluorometer with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 460 nm. The sensitivity of the fluorometer was adjusted such that the fluorescence activity in a given assay was within the maximum detection limit of the instrument.Binding Activity of CS Mutants in the Presence of GAGsFor evaluating the effect of various GAGs on the binding activity of the carboxyl terminus deletions, 50 nmrecombinant proteins were co-incubated with different concentrations of heparin, fucoidan, chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate B, or dextran sulfate for 15 min at 37 °C before the addition of this mix onto the cells. For amino-terminal deletions, 50 nm protein was co-incubated with 5 nm heparin. The assay was continued as described above.Effect of Heparinase I and Chondroitinase ABC on the Binding Activity of CS-Heparin ComplexHepG2 cells were treated with log dilutions of heparinase I or chondroitinase ABC or buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, followed by addition of 50 nm recombinant protein and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence was measured as described above.Competition Binding AnalysisFor competition analysis, HepG2 cells after blocking were incubated with different concentrations of CS27 or peptide (MRGSSSNTRVLNELNYDNAG) for 60 min before adding the protein. The experiment was continued as described above.Sporozoite Invasion AssayThe assay was performed as described by Shi et al.(21Shi Y.P. Hasnain S.E. Sacci J.B. Holloway B.P. Fujioka H. Kumar N.

Science. 1981; 213: 1021-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells at a density of 5 × 104/well were seeded in eight-well chamber slides 3 days before the experiment. P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoites were isolated from mosquito salivary glands using a discontinuous gradient as described (23Pacheco N.D. Strome C.P. Mitchell F. Bawden M.P. Beaudoin R.L. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of CS proteins were added to triplicate wells immediately followed by the addition of 25,000 sporozoites. Sporozoites were incubated with cells for 3 h following which unattached sporozoites were removed by washing. The cells were then fixed with ice-cold methanol and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The slides were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 10 μg/ml NFS1 antibody (anti-NANP repeat monoclonal) for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Bound enzyme was revealed by using diaminobenzidine as substrate. Slides were mounted with Permount and read using a 20× objective lens. The percentage of inhibition was determined by the following formula: [(control − test)/control] × 100.DISCUSSIONThe CS protein has long been of interest because of its putative role in parasite targeting and invasion of the liver. We constructed eight different deletion mutants of mature CS protein to study what role its various regions might play in the binding and invasion of liver cells by the parasite.Once the proteins were purified, the contrast between CS deletions and the full-length protein in cell binding was evaluated, and the results were subsequently compared with their potential to inhibit invasion of liver cells by live sporozoites. Surprisingly, in the absence of TSR domain, the truncated protein not only bound to HepG2 cells, it actually showed a 2–3-fold enhancement over the full-length protein (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, deletion of the first six residues from amino terminus alone (CS19) resulted in a major loss of binding activity and deletion of more than six residues totally inactivated the protein (Fig. 2 B). Binding activity of active TSR deletion mutant (CS20) was also lost when the first 28 amino acids were deleted (CS25), clearly demonstrating that a major binding motif of CS is located in the amino terminus region of the protein. Curiously, although deletion of the first few amino acids (CS19, CS16, CS17, CS6) resulted in a loss of binding to HSPG on HepG2 cells, these proteins had bound to the heparin column. Heparan sulfate, although structurally related to heparin, has low levels of sulfation and contains a glucuronic acid residue in place of the flexible iduronic acid residue found in heparin. Both heparin and heparan sulfate, because of their negative charge, interact with positively charged amino acids in a given protein. In protein CS6 (lacks 28 amino terminus residues), 22% of the remaining amino terminus residues (15 of 67) are positively charged. Binding of CS6, CS16, CS17, CS19, and CS25 to heparin column can be attributed to the flexibility and high sulfate content of heparin, which would have allowed it to interact with positively charged residues of CS protein that otherwise may not be a part of the binding motif involved in interaction with HSPG-based receptor on liver cells.Could the binding of TSR domain deletions be the result of nonspecific interaction of these truncated proteins with liver cells? To investigate this proposition, we competed the binding of TSR domain deletions (CS20 and CS21) with five different GAGs. These GAGs have been regularly used as competitors by several investigators to evaluate the specificity of CS protein binding to liver cells (4Frevert U. Sinnis P. Cerami C. Shreffler W. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Pancake S.J. Holt G.D. Mellouk S. Hoffman S.L. J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11518-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reduction in binding activity of these TSR domain deletions in the presence of heparin was comparable with the inhibition profile of the full-length protein CS1 (Fig. 3 A). This indicates that, like the full-length protein, the TSR deletion mutants bind through a GAG-based receptor on hepatocytes. Additionally, both the deletion mutant and full-length CS protein lost their binding activity when HepG2 cells were pre-treated with heparinase I (Fig. 4). These experiments indicated that, like the full-length protein, the TSR domain truncated proteins were binding through a heparin-based receptor on hepatocytes.We have recently shown that heparin, at substoichiometric concentrations, enhances the binding activity of CS protein presumably by cross-linking a large number of CS molecules (29Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8530-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An enhancement in the binding of TSR domain deletion mutants in the presence of submolar concentrations of heparin indicated that residues involved in enhancement did not relate to the TSR domain. In contrast, proteins truncated at proximal end of the amino terminus, as CS19, lacking the first six amino acids, showed only partial activation. Proteins with deletions extending beyond those six amino acids could not be activated (Fig. 5), indicating that the residues involved are located toward the amino terminus of the protein and this phenomenon is not because of nonspecific aggregation of the proteins by GAGs.An enhancement of CS binding at substoichiometric concentrations of GAGs is not an isolated biological event. Previously, heparin has been shown to mediate adhesion of Leishmania amistigotes to cellular receptors (34Love D.C. Esko J.D. Mosser D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and, recently, McCormick et al.(35McCormick C.J. Newbold C.I. Berendt A.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 327-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that heparin can enhance the binding ofP. falciparum infected erythrocytes to human microvascular endothelial cells. Similarly, T. gondii tachyzoites show an increased infectivity in the presence of low concentration of sulfated glycoconjugates (36Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hence, a carefully modulated response to varying concentrations of GAGs could be a fine-tuned mechanism that these pathogens have adapted for their propagation and survival.A peptide including the entire amino terminus (CS27) served to compete with the entire protein for binding to cells. To further elucidate the contribution of this amino-terminal region in binding, we tried to inhibit binding of the CS protein with a peptide containing only the first 20 amino acids of mature P. falciparum CS protein (Fig. 6). The 20-mer peptide did not inhibit binding, which may indicate that the residues involved in interaction are not contiguous in the primary structure of the amino terminus, although in a tertiary conformation they could be present close to one another and an intact amino terminus might be essential for providing the correct structural conformation.A similar situation exists in fibroblast growth factor, another heparin-binding protein, where eight amino acids involved in heparin binding are widely distributed (Asn-27, Arg-120, Thr-121, Lys-125, Lys-129, Gln-134, Lys-135, and Ala-136) but are present close to one another in the tertiary structure of the protein (37Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 38Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of the amino terminus of CS protein from various species does suggest the presence of at least four conserved positively charged residues (Arg-9, Lys-34, Lys-43, Arg-46), which could be responsible for the binding activity of CS protein.An intact amino terminus is required for the binding of CS protein to HepG2 cells. Is an intact amino terminus a prerequisite for invasion? To investigate this proposition, full-length and truncated proteins were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit the invasion of HepG2 cells by P. falciparum sporozoites. The results, where sporozoites that successfully invaded the hepatocytes were counted, were consistent with the binding profiles. The TSR domain deletion (CS21) completely inhibited invasion of sporozoites at the lowest concentration. The truncated protein, missing only six amino acids at the amino terminus, was required in a 20-fold excess to achieve the same level of inhibition. More extensive deletions of the amino terminus were totally ineffective as competitors, clearly showing that an intact amino terminus is not only required for binding, it is also a prerequisite for the invasion process. Recently it has been shown that, prior to invasion, attachment of sporozoites to liver cells requires binding of CS protein to cell surface HSPG (39Pinzon-Ortiz C. Friedman J. Esko J. Sinnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26784-26791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The inhibition of invasion by TSR deletion mutants could have occurred by effectively competing out sporozoites from attaching on to the liver cells, although blocking subsequent steps that result in invasion could not be ruled out.We have recently shown that the TSR domain could be effectively neutralized, by converting a conserved cysteine of TSR domain at position 395 to alanine, without losing the binding activity of the protein (30Rathore D. McCutchan T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8530-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been reported in thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP), another sporozoite protein, where this domain could be eliminated without affecting the ability of sporozoites to infect mice (40Wengelnik K. Spaccapelo R. Naitza S. Robson K.J. Janse C.J. Bistoni F. Waters A.P. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5195-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results necessarily alter our vision of sporozoite entry into the liver cells. We propose that, in CS, involvement of TSR domain could be a part of a multistage process of interaction where TSR domain could be acting as a low affinity molecular anchor for the parasite, whereas amino terminus mediates a high affinity and specific cell surface binding. A similar mechanism exists in protease nexin 1, where retention of the protein complex and cell surface binding is mediated by two different regions of the protein (41Crisp R.J. Knauer D.J. Knauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19628-19637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Presence of both the motifs in the protein could reflect an optimal equilibrium between the two activities.

The NAD(P) derivatives nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose are likewise among the most potent calcium-mobilizing agents (1Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 2Patel S. Churchill G.C. Gallione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). NAD is the substrate for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a vitally important post-translation modification occurring within the nuclei of higher eukaryotes by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (3De Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signaling to Cell Death: Poly ADP-Ribosylation Reactions. Oxford University Press Inc., New York2001Google Scholar). NAD is also the substrate for mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, an enzyme that transfers a single ADP-ribose unit from NAD onto target proteins in both mammalian and prokaryotic cells (4Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 35: 247-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Most recently, high levels of NAD were shown to extend yeast cell life-span, a phenomenon linked to the action of NAD-dependent catalysis of protein deacetylation (5Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarante L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar,6Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Like ATP and GTP, NAD performs multiple tasks in both energy and signaling transduction, indicating why NAD homeostasis must be tightly regulated in all living organisms. Any impairment in NAD synthesis seriously impairs cellular metabolism, eventually resulting in cell death (7Hughes K.T. Lakida D. Roth J.R. Olivera B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of this key redox coenzyme is accomplished either through a de novo pathway or through NAD-recycling salvage routes with notable differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (8Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). All the known biochemical pathways converge to the reaction catalyzed by NMN adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.1), abbreviated NMNAT1 (8Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). This transferase catalyzes the nucleophilic attack by the 5′ phosphate NMN or nicotinic acid mononucleotide on the α-phosphoryl of ATP, releasing PPi and NAD or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (9Lowe G Tansley G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the eukaryotic enzyme forms NAD and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide at similar rates, its prokaryotic counterpart prefers the deamidated substrate (nicotinic acid mononucleotide) (8Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). Because the reaction is fully reversible, NAD can also be reconverted to ATP (10Di Lisa F. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human NMNAT, the only NAD/nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide biosynthetic-pathway enzyme within the nucleus (11Balducci E. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Natalini P. Biochem.

An equally relevant issue is the multistep metabolic activation of the prodrug tiazofurin (15Jayaram H.N. Pillwein K. Lui M.S. Faderan M.A. Weber G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to form tiazofurin adenine dinucleotide where the last step is mediated by NMNAT. The NAD analog known as tiazofurin adenine dinucleotide strongly inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, a widely acknowledged target for cancer chemotherapy (16Jayaram H.N. Cooney D.A. Grusch M. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 561-574PubMed Google Scholar). NMNAT activity is reduced to below 5% of its wild type activity in a tiazofurin-resistant cell line (17Boulton S. Kyle S Durkacz B.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), stressing the key role of NMNAT both in prodrug activation and as a potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Because our group aspires to achieve the rational design of antineoplastic and antimicrobial agents (18D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M.

Based on structural similarities identified on the basis of the Methanococcus jannaschii structure, previously solved by our group (18D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Structure. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), NMNAT was recognized to be a member of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily of α/β-phosphodiesterases. Characterized by the presence of a highly conserved (H/T)XGH motif (19Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), these enzymes share a common adenylylation mechanism. We have now determined the crystal structure of recombinant human NMN adenylyltransferase in its free form at a resolution of 2.5 Å. The structure reveals a hexameric assembly with 322 symmetry composed of α/β-topology subunits. The enzyme active site has been analyzed through a detailed structural comparison with M. jannaschii (18D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M.

Our structural data also revealed a remarkable structural conservation in ATP-recognition motifs GXXXPX(T/H)XXH and SXTXXR, which we propose to be the universal signature for NMNATs. The recombinant protein used in the crystallization experiments was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously and consists of a polypeptide chain of 279 residues (14Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The protein was provided in a buffered solution containing 0.02 m Tris at pH 8.0, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2 and has proven to be active. Crystals of human NMNAT were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by equilibrating 2 μl of purified protein solution at a concentration of 20 mg/ml against an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1m Tris, pH 8.1, 4% v/v isopropyl alcohol. The crystals grow to a size of ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm in about 4–5 days at 20 °C and can be assigned to two different space groups depending on the cryoprotectant employed for data collection at 100 K. If 20% glycerol is used, the analysis of the diffraction data sets collected allowed us to assign the NMNAT crystals to the monoclinic space group P21 (crystal form I) with cell dimensions a = 141.0 Å, b = 87.0 Å, c = 141.9 Å, β = 118.10° containing six molecules per asymmetric unit with a corresponding solvent content of 70%. For crystal form I, a diffraction limit of a 3.3-Å resolution was observed. On the other hand, when light paraffin oil is employed as a cryoprotectant, NMNAT crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6322 (crystal form II) with cell dimensionsa = b = 147.50 Å and c = 61.50 Å and diffract to a 2.5-Å resolution. In this case, one molecule is present per asymmetric unit with a corresponding solvent content of 60%. For data collection and heavy atom screening, the crystals were transferred in a stabilizing solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1m Tris, pH 8.1, 4% v/v isopropyl alcohol, 2 mmATP, and 2 mm MgCl2. All data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation at the beam line ID14 EH3 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France, λ = 0.8139 Å) at a temperature of 100 K. Diffraction data sets employed for SIR phasing were collected on the monoclinic crystals, whereas the high resolution data set employed in refinement was collected on the hexagonal crystals. Diffracted intensities were evaluated and integrated using the program MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter Protein Crystallography, No. 26. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar), whereas the CCP4 suite was used for data reduction (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: D760-D767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). TableI gives a summary of the data collection statistics. The mercuric chloride isomorphous difference Patterson map was solved using SHELX-90 (25Sheldrick G.M. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering 25–26 January 1991. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991: 23-38Google Scholar), and heavy atom parameters were refined using MLPHARE (26Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend 25–26 January 1991. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar); phasing statistics are reported in Table I. The soaking time for the mercuric derivative was 6 h at a concentration of 0.5 mm. The initial SIR electron density map calculated for the monoclinic crystal form did not allow chain tracing, providing only a clear identification of the protein boundaries. The initial SIR phases were then sensibly improved by means of 6-fold density averaging. The presence of a hexamer with 32-point group symmetry in the asymmetric unit was confirmed through the calculation of the self-rotation function, performed using the program AmoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: A157-A163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). Five strong peaks located at κ = 119.5, φ = 84.1, ψ = 273.2 (4.5 ς over r.m.s.); at κ = 180.0, φ = 60.0, ψ = 5.8 (4.2 ς over r.m.s.); at κ = 180.0, φ = 6.2, ψ = 180.0 (5.2 ς over r.m.s.); and at κ = 180.1, φ = 59.7, ψ = 180.0 (10.2 ς over r.m.s.) were identified. This hexameric arrangement was also consistent with the position of the 12 heavy atom sites located in the difference Patterson. The locations of the non-crystallographic 3- and 2-fold axes were determined with the program GLRF (28Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: A783-A792Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), used in the real-space translation function mode (option tfun = 2). The SIR phases were then improved by simultaneous application of 6-fold density averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram matching with phase extension from 5.0 to 3.3 Å, as implemented in the program DM (29Cowtan K.D.

The resulting electron density map was of good quality but allowed a clear tracing of the backbone only, suffering from a limited resolution (3.3 Å). Nevertheless, 80% of the entire protein was traced as a polyalanine model at this stage. This partial structure was employed as a search model for molecular replacement calculation against the hexagonal crystal form. An unambiguous solution for both the cross-rotation and translation functions could be obtained using the program AmoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: A157-A163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), therefore providing the operator that relates the coordinates of the monoclinic and hexagonal crystal structures. At this point, a multicrystal density averaging procedure was attempted. An envelope was defined on the basis of the polyalanine model built in the monoclinic structure (covering one monomer), whereas the starting electron density was derived from the initial SIR phases. The calculation was carried out with the program DMMULTI (29Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: D43-D48Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), extending the phases for the hexagonal crystal form to a 2.5-Å resolution. The resulting electron density map was of high quality, and an unambiguous tracing, including all the side chains, was performed using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: A110-A119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, three major breaks were present in the electron density map between residues 1–4, 111–147, and 258–279.Table ICrystallographic statisticsNative IHgCl2Native IIX-ray dataSpace groupP21P21P6322Resolution3.34.32.5Unique reflections420411406814056Redundancy3.22.38.4Completeness96.098.799.8R merge1-aRmerge = Σ‖Ii − 〈Ii〉‖/Σ〈Ii〉, where 〈Ii〉 is the mean value of the ith intensity measurements.10.410.07.5R iso1-bRiso = Σ∥F PH‖ − ‖F P∥/Σ‖F P‖, whereF PH and F P are the derivative and native structure factors, respectively.20.4Phasing power1-cPhasing power = ‖FH‖/E, where FH is the calculated heavy atom structure factors and E is the residual lack of closure.1.28R cullis1-dRcullis = Σ∥FPH + FP ‖ −FH ‖/Σ‖FPH +FP ‖, where FP,FPH, and FH are the observed protein, observed derivative, and calculated heavy atom structure factors with the sum over all centric reflections.0.80FOM1-e〈FOM〉 (10.0–3.5 Å) = ∫ P(θ) exp (ιθ)dθ/∫P(θ)dθ, where P is the probability distribution of the phase angle θ.0.31No. of protein atoms1750No. of solvent atoms58R-factor (%)1-fR-factor = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/Σ‖F obs‖.23.4R-free (%)1-gR-free = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/Σ‖F obs‖ (for the selected portion of all data).28.6r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.018r.m.s.d. bond angles (degrees)2.0r.m.s.d. planar 1–4 distance (Å)0.0111-a Rmerge = Σ‖Ii − 〈Ii〉‖/Σ〈Ii〉, where 〈Ii〉 is the mean value of the ith intensity measurements.1-b Riso = Σ∥F PH‖ − ‖F P∥/Σ‖F P‖, whereF PH and F P are the derivative and native structure factors, respectively.1-c Phasing power = ‖FH‖/E, where FH is the calculated heavy atom structure factors and E is the residual lack of closure.1-d Rcullis = Σ∥FPH + FP ‖ −FH ‖/Σ‖FPH +FP ‖, where FP,FPH, and FH are the observed protein, observed derivative, and calculated heavy atom structure factors with the sum over all centric reflections.1-e 〈FOM〉 (10.0–3.5 Å) = ∫ P(θ) exp (ιθ)dθ/∫P(θ)dθ, where P is the probability distribution of the phase angle θ.1-f R-factor = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/Σ‖F obs‖.1-g R-free = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/Σ‖F obs‖ (for the selected portion of all data). Open table in a new tab Only the hexagonal structure was subjected to refinement because of the highest resolution obtained using these crystals. The crystallographic refinement was carried out at 2.5 Å employing REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: D240-D255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). A random sample containing 965 reflections (roughly 1% of the total number of reflections) was excluded from the refinement and used for the calculation of the free R-factor (32Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). The program O was used for manual rebuilding of the model. The initial model (80% of the whole molecule) was subjected to 10 cycles of rigid body refinement in the 15.0–4.0 Å resolution range, lowering the R-factor and the R-free to 39 and 41%, respectively. Subsequently, 50 cycles of REFMAC were performed, observing a drop of the crystallographic R-factor to 34% (free R-factor 36%). An additional 50 cycles of refinement were carried out, obtaining a R-factor and a free R-factor of 26 and 28%, respectively. Solvent molecules were manually added at positions with density > 4ς in theFo − Fc map, considering only peaks engaged in at least one hydrogen bond with protein atom or solvent atom. A final round of 20 cycles of refinement was carried out on the resulting model until convergence, at an R-factor of 23.4% and R-free of 28.1%. The current model contains 216 amino acid residues and 58 water molecules. The three major breaks detected after the multicrystal density averaging procedure were still present in the refined electron density map, between residues 1–4, 111–147, and 258–279. These breaks in the electron density were also present in all six subunits of the monoclinic structure. The average B-factors for the 1750 protein atoms and for the 58 ordered water molecules are 58.7 and 56.2 Å2 (54.6 Å2 for the main chain and 62.7 Å2 for the side chains), respectively. The results of refinement are summarized in Table I. The coordinates of human NMNAT have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1KKU). Two different crystal forms could be obtained depending on the cryocooling condition: crystals of form I belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with six molecules in the asymmetric unit, and crystals of form II belong to the hexagonal space group P6322 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (see “Experimental Procedures”). The structure of human NMNAT was solved by means of the single isomorphous replacement method in conjunction with multicrystal density averaging. Only the hexagonal crystal form was refined, and the current model contains 216 residues and 58 solvent molecules with anR-factor of 0.234 and R-free of 0.286 at a 2.5-Å resolution. No electron density is present for residues 1–4, 111–147, and 258–279, neither in the hexagonal nor in the monoclinic structures. The stereochemistry of the refined model has been assessed with the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 90% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no outliers are present. Residue 19 has been recognized as a cis proline. Coordinates of human NMNAT have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. The polypeptide chain of each NMNAT folds into six β-strands, nine α-helices, and connecting loops. The protein architecture consists of a classical α/β-dinucleotide binding domain (residues 5–216) whose core is a strongly twisted six-stranded parallel open β-sheet, flanked on both sides by α-helices (Fig. 1). The C-terminal portion of the protein (residues 217–258) forms a second small domain, made up by two α-helices (Fig. 1). A hexameric assembly was observed in both of the two crystal forms. In the hexagonal crystal form, the 322 crystallographic symmetry operations assemble the monomers present in the asymmetric unit into a hexamer (Fig.2, a and b). The same oligomeric arrangement is observed in the monoclinic crystal form, where a hexamer endowed with 32-point group symmetry is present in the asymmetric unit.Figure 2Ribbon representation of the hexamer of NMN adenylyltransferase as produced by the program MOLSCRIPT (48Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) viewed along the local 3-fold axis (a) and the local dyad (b). Each of the six subunits is colored differently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The overall quaternary structure can be viewed as a trimer-of-dimers, where two major intersubunit interfaces can be distinguished. The first concerns associated protomers related by a dyad axis (Fig. 2,a and b), whereas the second involves protomers related by a 3-fold axis (Fig. 2 a). A total of 2100 Å2 of molecular surface are buried upon oligomerization on each monomer. In particular, 1200 Å2 of the accessible surface are buried on each monomer upon dimer formation. Many interactions occurring across the dyad axis participate in dimer stabilization, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Residues 217–220 meet their equivalent in the facing monomer, and residues 234–238 of one subunit contact residues 26–33 of the other (Fig. 3). Phe-217 appears to play an important role in the dimer stabilization, making a strong hydrophobic interaction with Ile-221 of the other monomer (Fig. 3). Interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism was reported for human NMNAT, resulting in the expression of either phenylalanine or leucine at position 217 (34Schweiger, M., Lerner, F., Hennig, K., Niere, M., Hirsch-Kauffmann M., Oei, S. L., and Ziegler, M. (2001) in Targeting ADP-Ribosylation for Development of New Therapies, p. 89, 13th International Symposium on ADP-Ribosylation, June 8–11, New York, NYGoogle Scholar). In our structure, a phenylalanine residue occupies position 217 (Fig. 3). However, the presence of a leucine residue would be fully compatible with the structural environment observed and would not disrupt the network of hydrophobic interaction essential for the dimer stability. Fewer contacts are observed between protomers related by the triad axis where 500 Å2 of accessible surface area are buried on each monomer upon trimer formation, revealing a loose trimer. The intratrimer contacts observed consist of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and are provided by two regions on each monomer, encompassing residues 198–204 and 228–232. Among the electrostatic interactions observed, Tyr-A198 provides two strong hydrogen bonds with its OH atom at a distance of 2.8 Å from the Arg-B228 NH1 atom and its carbonyl atom at 2.8 Å from the Arg-B231 NH2 atom. A strong hydrophobic interaction occurs between Trp-B204 and Arg-A232, whose guanidino group stacks against the aromatic ring of Trp-B204. All the contacts observed are repeated between subunit B and C as well as C and A. The approximate overall dimensions of the globular hexamer of human NMNAT are 60 Å along the triad axis and 50 Å across it. As can be seen in Fig. 2 a, a solvent channel crosses the entire hexamer running along the 3-fold axis. Based on structural comparison with the previously reported structures of M. jannaschii(18D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Structure. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and M. thermoautotrophicum (20Saridakis V. Christendat D. Kimber M.S. Dharamsi A Edwards A.M. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7225-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) NMNAT, we proposed the enzyme active site to be located in a wide cleft facing the channel and extending from the top of the hexamer to the trimer-trimer interface (Fig. 2 a). The interior of the channel is characterized by a distribution of positively charged residues, including Arg-188, Arg-228, Arg-231, Arg-232, and Lys-225, all located in proximity of the proposed enzyme active site (Fig. 4). As already observed in the hexameric structure of M. jannaschiiNMNAT, such a distribution could be suited for the highly negative substrate ATP to be steered to its binding site from the bulk solvent (18D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Structure. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the extension of the positive surface observed in human NMNAT is smaller than that reported in the case of M. jannaschii NMNAT, reflecting the lower number of positively charged residues featuring the active site of the human enzyme (Fig.4). The structural arrangement of human NMNAT suggests a conservation of the hexameric assembly in all NMNATs since the same structural architecture was reported for both M. jannaschii (18D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Structure. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) andM. thermoautotrophicum enzymes (20Saridakis V.

However, human NMNAT was reported by us to be a tetramer in solution, based on gel filtration experiments (14Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Saccucci F. Pierella F. Amici A. Raffaelli N. Magni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, the crystallographic observed hexamer could not represent the only functionally active oligomeric state for NMNAT. In this respect, the dimer building up the hexamer (Fig. 3) could be considered as the minimal NMNAT oligomeric unit resulting in tetramers or hexamers, depending on the environmental conditions. Consistent with its subcellular localization, a putative nuclear localization signal was identified in the human enzyme in the123PGRKRKW129 amino acids stretch (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F.

Moreover, a previously proposed interaction with PARP1 (35Ruggieri S. Gregori L. Natalini P. Vita A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Magni G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has recently been confirmed (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L.

Despite the fact that NMNAT was proven to be a substrate for nuclear kinases in vitro (12Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M.

In an effort to characterize the ATPase activity of hsp90, we have observed marked differences in activities among various species of hsp90. Chicken or human hsp90 hydrolyzed ATP with ak cat of 0.02 min−1 and aK m greater than 300 μm. In contrast, yeast hsp90 and TRAP1, an hsp90 homologue found in mitochondria, were 10–100-fold more active as ATPases. Sedimentation studies confirmed that all are dimeric proteins. Chicken hsp90 mutants were then analyzed to identify regions within the protein that influence ATPase activity. A truncation mutant of chicken hsp90, N1–573, was found to be monomeric, and yet the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) was greater than 100 times that of the full-length protein (k catof 0.24 min−1 and K m of 60 μm). In contrast, an internal deletion mutant, Δ661–677, was also monomeric but failed to hydrolyze ATP. Finally, deletion of the last 30 amino acids resulted in a dimeric protein with an ATPase activity very similar to full-length hsp90. These data indicate that sequences within the last one-fourth of hsp90 regulate ATP hydrolysis. hsp90, in addition to being an abundant and pivotal cytoplasmic chaperone protein, has been shown to be a weak ATPase.

Interestingly, hsp90 seems to assist in the late stages of folding its substrate and may be important for modulating specific interactions such as ligand or co-factor binding or covalent modifications such as phosphorylation. hsp90 functions optimally in a multicomponent complex of chaperone proteins including hsp40, hsp70, Hop, p23, and one of a variety of immunophilins (1Pratt W.B.

There is now direct evidence that hsp90 binds ADP and ATP and that the conformational state of hsp90 differs substantially depending upon which nucleotide is bound (7Sullivan W. Stensgard B.

The crystallization of the amino-terminal 220 amino acids of hsp90 with either nucleotide or an hsp90-specific inhibitor, geldanamycin, revealed that hsp90 possesses a unique nucleotide-binding site that differs substantially from that of hsp70 (8Stebbins C.E.

Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). It has thus been proposed that hsp90 belongs to the GHKL superfamily of ATP-binding proteins that includes the DNA-repair protein MutL, DNA gyrase, topoisomerase II, and histidine kinases (12Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of action for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase II requires transient ATP-mediated amino-terminal dimerization to form a “molecular clamp” that allows single-stranded DNA strand passage to occur. Binding of single-stranded DNA increases the ATPase activity of the enzyme by severalfold, and ATP hydrolysis is required to reset the “clamp” (13Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hsp90 may interact with ATP and its substrate (client protein) through a similar molecular clamp mechanism (4Richter K. Buchner J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 5Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Although the binding site for adenine nucleotides has been localized to the amino terminus of hsp90, nucleotide binding has a profound impact on more distal parts of the protein. Specifically, the hsp90 co-chaperone p23 associates with hsp90 only when it is bound to ATP but not when it is bound to ADP or the ansamycin inhibitor geldanamycin (7Sullivan W. Stensgard B.

The two nucleotide-dependent conformational states of hsp90 are perhaps similar, therefore, to the “open” and “closed” forms of either hsp70 (15Johnson E.R. McKay D.B.

The nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of the hsp90 class of molecular chaperones are not as thoroughly characterized as they are for hsp70. hsp70 binds ATP with a K m of around 50 μm and hydrolyzes it slowly with ak cat of 0.5 min−1 in the absence of co-chaperones and substrate (19Wilbank S.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12893-12898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of substrate, or the co-chaperone hsp40, hsp70 hydrolyzes ATP 10–20 times more efficiently, and the resulting hsp70-ADP complex binds substrate more tightly (20McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 21Cyr D.M., Lu, X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Dissociation of the substrate from the hsp70-ADP complex is promoted by a nucleotide exchange factor (23Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26282-26285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of the nucleotide exchange factor has recently been deduced. Upon binding hsp70, the nucleotide exchange factor opens the nucleotide-binding pocket, thereby releasing ADP and stabilizing the nucleotide-free state of hsp70 (24Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Höhfeld J. Hartl F.-U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Unlike either hsp70 or the DNA repair enzymes, an in vitrosubstrate binding reaction has not been discovered that affects the ATP-hydrolyzing capabilities of hsp90. Additionally, a nucleotide exchange factor has not been identified. However, based on the available crystal structure data and recognized co-factor requirements for hsp90 function as a chaperone, a hypothesis in which nucleotide and most likely co-factor and/or substrate binding alter the conformation of hsp90 is plausible. The impact that these structural alterations have on ATP hydrolysis activity is unknown. Initial studies with yeast hsp90 indicate that the full-length protein is required for maximal ATPase activity (25Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, although amino acids 1–221 are capable of binding nucleotide, additional residues (1–450) are needed to observe tight (i.e. committed) ATP binding, and residues beyond 450 are necessary for efficient ATP hydrolysis (26Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ATP binding has been shown to induce dimer interactions near the amino terminus of hsp90, but this conformational change requires greater than 500 amino acids of the protein (25Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the full expression of ATPase activity requires regions of hsp90 beyond the minimal ATP-binding domain. To further our understanding of how structure and conformation of hsp90 correlate to ATPase activity, we have studied kinetically hsp90 proteins derived from human, chicken, yeast, Escherichia coli (HtpG), and an hsp90 homologue, TRAP1, found in human mitochondria. Within this analysis, the more complex the organism from which the hsp90 protein is derived, the less efficient the enzymatic activity. This finding predicts that hsp90 from higher eukaryotes would require co-factors to regulate ATP binding, substrate binding, and/or ATPase activity. Indeed, it has been shown previously that the hsp90 cofactor Hop inhibits the ATPase activity of hsp90 (27Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), but p23, another hsp90 cofactor isolated from active chaperoning complexes (28Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), has no discernible effect on ATPase activity (29Young J.C. Hartl F.-U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis of chicken hsp90 was also performed in order to correlate hsp90 structure to ATPase activity. Our findings indicate that sequences within the carboxyl-terminal fourth of the protein profoundly affect ATPase activity. E. coli hsp90 (HtpG) was expressed in E. coli from a high copy number plasmid (30Jakob U. Meyer I. Bügl H. André S. Bardwell J.C.A. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Yeast hsp90 was purified from a yeast strain that overexpresses Hsc82 from a 2-μm URA3 overproducing plasmid (30Jakob U. Meyer I. Bügl H. André S. Bardwell J.C.A. Buchner J. J. Biol.

TRAP1 was purified from E. coli, and its cloning and expression are detailed elsewhere (31Felts S.J. Owen B.A.L. Nguyen P.M. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Full-length chicken hsp90α, deletion mutants N1–220, N1–692, and Δ661–677 were all expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (10Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J.

Human hsp90β was expressed in Sf9 cells as described previously (7Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Overexpressed proteins were purified to near-homogeneity from cell lysates by successive chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, heparin-Sepharose, Mono-Q, and Superdex 200. Purified proteins were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Additional details of purification are published (7Sullivan W.

Chicken hsp90-α (1 mg/ml) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm DTT was digested with 10 μg/ml bovine thrombin (generously supplied by W. G. Owen, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) for 0–24 h at 30 °C. Proteolysis was near completion (>95%) at 4 h, and no further proteolysis was detected after 24 h at 30 °C. Under these conditions, thrombin cleaved hsp90 at a single site, between Lys-611 and Ala-612, as determined by carboxyl-terminal sequencing. Purified hsp90 (5 μm, unless otherwise indicated) was incubated with 1 μm[α-32P]ATP (2 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 0–480 min in a buffer containing 40 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. For ATP concentrations exceeding 1 μm, unlabeled ATP was added accordingly from a 100 mm stock of ATP-Mg, pH 7.4. Reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of a “stop” solution containing unlabeled AMP, ADP, ATP, and EDTA (12 mm, each). Thin layer chromatography was used to assess the extent of ATP hydrolysis. A 1:5 dilution of each ATPase reaction (2.5 μl) was spotted on cellulose PEI thin layer chromatography plates (Selecto Scientific Inc., Suwanee, GA), and ascending chromatography in 0.5m LiCl and 2 n formic acid was performed for 1 h at room temperature (33Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). After completion of chromatography, the plates were air-dried, and the radioactive spots corresponding to ADP and ATP were quantified by PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The ratio of ADP to ATP was used to calculate percent ATP hydrolysis. Each reaction was analyzed in duplicate at various time points depending upon the ATP concentration. A blank consisting of all the reaction components added to the stop solution at reaction time = 0 min was run at each concentration of ATP assayed. Kinetic data were analyzed by plotting velocity, v, in micromoles of ATP hydrolyzed/min versus μm ATP concentration, [S]. Rate constants were extracted by two methods. A primary plot of v versus [S] when fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation yielded a simple, rectangular 2 parameter hyperbola (Sigmaplot) using Equation 1. v=Vm[S]/Km+[S]Equation 1 K m and V max values were calculated directly with standard deviations. A replot of the kinetic data of v/[S] versus v, using the Eadie-Hofstee equation (Equation 2), yielded −1/K m as the slope and V max/K m as the y intercept. v/[S]=Vm/Km−v/KmEquation 2 Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using the Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. All proteins were equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm DTT buffer using BioSpin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Samples (300 μl) of each protein at ∼1 mg/ml (5–10 μm) were analyzed in double-sector cells fitted with sapphire windows against a reference composed of the BioSpin column equilibration buffer. To visualize the protein at the bottom of the cell, 20 μl of the immiscible fluorocarbon FC-43 was added to each sample containing hsp90 or derivative protein. All hsp90 full-length proteins and truncations were analyzed at 10,000 rpm and N1–220, N1–573, and N1–692 were also analyzed at 18,000 rpm. Full-length chicken hsp90 was also analyzed at 8,000 and 12,000 rpm at protein concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 mg/ml. Samples were either run in an An60Ti (4-hole) or An50Ti (8-hole) rotor at 20 °C. Data were obtained using Rayleigh interference optics as scans of fringe displacement (protein concentration, C)versus radial distance (r). Equilibrium was achieved when scans taken 3 h apart after an initial 24 h of centrifugation were superimposable. Primary data were fit to a self-association model using a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear, least squares fitting routine which minimizes the x 2 residuals between the function (see below, Equation 3) and the data (XL-I UltraScan-Origin, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). The monomer-polymer model is represented by Equation 3, Cr=a1exp(Mω2(1−νρ)/2RT(r2−rm2))+a2exp(nMω2Equation 3 (1−νρ)/2RT(r2−rm2))+bWhere Cr is the concentration at radial positionr in the cell, and r the radial position at the meniscus. a 1 and a 2 are the absorbance values of the monomer and dimer, respectively, at the meniscus. M is the molecular weight of the monomer,R is the gas constant, T the temperature (in degrees Kelvin), ω is the angular velocity, ε the partial specific volume of the protein, and ρ the density of the buffer. The number of monomers in the polymer assembly is n, and b is the base-line absorbance. Fig. 1 illustrates the constructs used in this study and lists their relative ATPase activities based on k cat/K m . Each species is indicated by a uniquely shaded block to emphasize that although all proteins are hsp90 family members, there are substantial species-specific differences. Residues 1–220 are delineated by the first block for each protein and represent the most conserved region between species. TRAP1 has 18 additional amino acids at its amino terminus that are unique. Both TRAP1 and HtpG lack the “charged domain” represented by the line segment shown for chicken and yeast hsp90, comprising 57 and 53 amino acids, respectively. In addition to lacking the charged domain, HtpG and TRAP1 also lack ∼30 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus that contain a terminal MEEVD sequence also found in hsp70 proteins. Truncations or internal deletions were chosen for the following reasons. N1–220 represents the minimal ATP- or geldanamycin-binding site and has been crystallized with both geldanamycin and nucleotide (8Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U.

Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase fusion version of N1–573 had been used previously by Chadli et al. (34Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and shown to bind p23 in vitro. In addition, Weikl et al. (26Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that residues 1–450 are required for trapping the nucleotide by yeast hsp90, and therefore N1–573 should be fully competent to bind ATP. Amino acid 573 in the chicken occurs at the beginning of an exon boundary in the corresponding human sequence and therefore may define a stable protein folding domain (35Rebbe N.F. Hickman W.S. Ley T.J. Stafford D.W. Hickman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15006-15011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N1–692 removes the last 30 amino acids from the chicken hsp90 that are not found in either HtpG or TRAP1. Finally, the internal deletion mutant, Δ661–677, removes one of the proposed dimerization domains from the carboxyl terminus of chicken hsp90, yet Δ661–677 has been shown to confer viability in a yeast strain lacking endogenous hsp90 (36Meng X. Devin J. Sullivan W.P. Toft D. Baulieu E.-E. Catelli M.-G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity for each protein was assayed by incubating with [α-32P]ATP and measuring the direct conversion to [α-32P]ADP as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Full-length chicken hsp90 hydrolyzed ATP poorly with aK m for ATP of 1.5 mm and ak cat of 0.02 min−1 at 30 °C (Fig. 2). In contrast, yeast hsp90 hydrolyzed ATP at nearly 10 times this rate, whereas HtpG and TRAP1 were still more efficient ATPases (Fig. 1 and TableI). These results imply that chicken hsp90 does not hydrolyze ATP efficiently in the absence of either cofactors and/or substrate.Table IA comparison of hsp90 ATPase activitiesHsp90 protein (species or mutant)K mk catCatalytic efficiency (k cat/K mμmμm/min/μmWT (chicken, α)1530 ± 330.025 ± 0.00171.6 × 10−5WT (human, β)324 ± 680.015 ± 0.00129.6 × 10−5N1–220 (chicken, α)ND<0.002NDN1–573 (chicken, α)99 ± 180.24 ± 0.032.4 × 10−3N1–692 (chicken, α)1359 ± 110.027 ± 0.0021.9 × 10−5δ661–677 (chicken, α)ND<0.002NDTRAP1 (human, mitochondrial)33 ± 80.1 ± 0.043.0 × 10−3Hsc82 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)511 ± 540.08 ± 0.011.5 × 10−4HtpG (E. coli)260 ± 910.1 ± 0.0123.8 × 10−4Each protein (5 μm) was assayed for ATPase activity using 1–10,000 μm ATP. k cat andK m values are presented with S.D.

ND, not done; WT, wild type. Somewhat surprisingly, the N1–573 construct hydrolyzed ATP over 100-fold better than the full-length protein (see Fig. 1). N1–573 hydrolyzed ATP with a K m of 100 μm and a k cat of 0.24 min−1 (Fig.3). Thus, the kinetics of this carboxyl-terminally truncated chicken protein were more efficient than those found for full-length yeast hsp90 and similar to the kinetics for the mitochondrial homologue, TRAP1 (see below and Ref. 31Felts S.J. Owen B.A.L. Nguyen P.M. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These results are particularly interesting because all carboxyl-terminal truncations tested in the yeast protein to date have resulted in decreases of ATPase activity (26Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Likewise, our efforts to generate a similar truncation mutant in TRAP1 have resulted in proteins with substantially reduced ATPase activities. Specifically, the carboxyl-terminal truncation of TRAP1 at amino acid 529, which coincides with amino acid 573 of the chicken sequence, resulted in a decrease in ATPase activity to less than 5% of the full-length protein. A more conservative carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant, TRAP1 N1–578, was slightly more active as an ATPase but still had less than 20% of the activity of wild-type TRAP1 (data not shown). Removal of the last 30 amino acids of chicken hsp90 (N1–692) had little effect on ATPase activity (Fig. 1 and Table I). The deletion mutant Δ661–677, which had one of the proposed dimerization domains removed, showed ATPase activity that was approximately one-tenth that of the full-length chicken hsp90. Similarly, and in agreement with studies in yeast, the N1–220 truncation mutant of chicken hsp90 also had less than 1/10 the ATPase activity of the full-length protein. The observation that truncating full-length hsp90 to residue 573 dramatically enhanced ATPase activity suggested that the carboxyl terminus negatively regulates activity. To test this hypothesis, we generated two additional truncation mutants by proteolysis. Bovine thrombin cleaves chicken hsp90 between residues Lys-611 and Ala-612, as determined by carboxyl-terminal sequencing of the thrombin-cleaved product, generating a homogeneous truncation mutant of N1–611 (Fig.4 B). This mutant, which has only 38 additional carboxyl-terminal amino acids than N1–573, hydrolyzed ATP in a manner similar to full-length hsp90 and N1–692 (Fig. 4 A). During purification, the internal deletion mutant, Δ661–677, displayed an increased susceptibility to proteolysis. We mapped the susceptible site by mass spectrometry to within 1200 mass units carboxyl-terminal to residue 574. Carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed the proteolytic cleavage site to be after amino acid Val-584. Fortuitously, the parental and cleaved Δ661–677 proteins were separable by Mono-Q chromatography (Fig. 4 B). The cleaved product, N1–584, had an ATPase activity that was 10 times that of the full-length chicken hsp90 protein and approximately one-third that of N1–573 protein (Fig. 4 A). Taken together, these findings suggest that the amino acid sequence found between residues 574 and 611 suppresses the ATPase activity of full-length, dimeric chicken hsp90. Equilibrium sedimentation analysis was used to determine the oligomerization state of the full-length or deletion mutant hsp90 proteins in solution. To determine whether full-length chicken hsp90 behaved ideally and homogeneously in solution over the concentrations used for ATPase assays, the protein was analyzed at 8,000, 10,000, and 12,000 rpm using protein concentrations that ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/ml or 2.9 to 15.7 μm, as shown in TableII. The average molecular weight determined from these measurements was 166,993 ± 890 (n = 9). The calculated molecular mass for chicken hsp90, based on primary amino acid sequence, is 84,060 (monomer) or 168,120 (dimer). Therefore, in solution, full-length chicken hsp90α exists as an unambiguous dimer over a 5-fold range of protein concentration.Table IISedimentation equilibrium analysis of chicken hsp90[Protein]SpeedM̄ w(measured)Root mean squareM̄ w(theoretical)Oligomer statusμmrpm× 10 −3Chicken, α (2.9 μm)8,000168,8543.584,058Dimer10,000162,2570.3612,000168,3670.74Chicken, α (8.9 μm)8,000168,9541.384,058Dimer10,000167,4352.5312,000162,7000.69Ch"

Here we found that slow inactivation is mediated by an annular determinant composed of hydrophobic amino acids located near the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments S6 of each repeat of the α1C subunit. We have determined the molecular requirements that completely obstruct slow inactivation. Critical interventions include simultaneous substitution of A752T in IIS6, V1165T in IIIS6, and I1475T in IVS6, each preventing in additive manner a considerable fraction of Ba2+ current from inactivation. In addition, it requires the S405I mutation in segment IS6. The fractional inhibition of slow inactivation in tested mutants caused an acceleration of fast inactivation, suggesting that fast and slow inactivation mechanisms are linked. The channel lacking slow inactivation showed ∼45% of the sustained Ba2+ or Ca2+ current with no indication of decay. The remaining fraction of the current was inactivated with a single-exponential decay (τf ∼ 10 ms), completely recovered from inactivation within 100 ms and did not exhibit Ca2+-dependent inactivation properties. No voltage-dependent characteristics were significantly changed, consistent with the C-type inactivation model suggesting constriction of the pore as the main mechanism possibly targeted by Ca2+ sensors of inactivation.

The voltage-gated inward current of Ca2+ ions is a common mechanism of transient increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration that stimulates a great variety of cellular responses. The rapid and complete inactivation of Ca2+ current is the critical step terminating Ca2+ influx and preventing Ca2+ overloading of the cell. In the case of L-type (α1C) Ca2+channels, two different mechanisms are in control of the Ca2+ current inactivation (1Hadley R.W. Lederer W.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 444: 257-268Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One mechanism is driven by Ca2+ ions on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (2Eckert R. Chad J.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 215-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), whereas the other depends on transmembrane voltage. Replacement of Ca2+ ions by Ba2+ ions in the extracellular medium eliminates Ca2+-dependent inactivation so that Ba2+-conducting Ca2+ channels are inactivated in a voltage-dependent manner. Two major mechanisms have been previously implicated in voltage-dependent inactivation (3Yellen G. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The ball and chain mechanism of an ion pore occlusion by a positively charged segment of the N-terminal tails was first described in the tetramericShaker K+ channel where it supports fastN-type inactivation (4Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Somewhat similarly, thehinged-lid mechanism in the Na+ channel is mediated by the IFM motif of the cytoplasmic linker between repeats III and IV (5West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L.

In both Na+ and K+channels, receptor sites for the different inactivation gates are located in S4–S5 intracellular loops (6Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

In these regions, multiple amino acids were shown to be critical for the rate of inactivation of the Ba2+ current (12Hering S. Berjukow S. Sokolov S. Marksteiner R. Weiβ R.G. Kraus R. Timin E.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 528: 237-249Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A systematic analysis of these multiple determinants has not been performed. In this work we focused on determinants situated in all four transmembrane segments S6. The approach was based on our earlier observation (25Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S. AlBanna B. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that Ca2+ channel inactivation was impaired by the A752T mutation at a position −2 from the cytoplasmic end of IIS6 identified in the human fibroblast α1CCa2+ channel transcript (26Soldatov N.M.

Similarly, Val-1504 in IVS6 of the rabbit cardiac α1C was shown to be critical for the channel inactivation (18Berjukow S. Gapp F. Aczel S. Sinnegger M.J. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Hering S. J.

The goal of our work was to determine, by single and combined amino acid substitutions, the role and molecular requirements for the involvement of S6 segments in voltage-dependent inactivation. The results are consistent with the C-type inactivation model (4Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 8Choi K. Aldrich R.

Complete removal of slow inactivation by a specific set of mutations in all four repeats gave us a unique opportunity to investigate the properties of Ca2+ channels that retain only the fast component of inactivation. pHLCC94 coding for α1C,II was constructed as described previously (25Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S. AlBanna B. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). α1C,IL, α1C,IS, α1C,ILS as well as α1C,III and its derivatives (α1C,IIIF, α1C,IIID, α1C,IIIK, α1C,IIIS1, α1C,IIIS2, and α1C,IIIT) were generated by the “megaprimer” method (27Sarkar G. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare pHLCC250 coding for α1C,III, sense 5′-gctgtacacctgttca-3′ (3162–3177) and mutated antisense primer 5′-gaaaggtgacgatgGTgaagcccacgaagatg-3′ (3477–3508) were amplified in 25 cycles of PCR (40 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 42 °C, 40 s at 72 °C) with 400 ng ofBamHI-linearized pHLCC77 (GenBankTMz34815) using the Ampli-Taq polymerase kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The purified 347-bp megaprimer was subjected to 5 “conditioning” cycles (28Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), each composed of 1 min at 94 °C and 3 min at 68 °C. Then antisense primer 5′-tacctcggtgattgctatatcaacaatgctacccacaaca-3′ (3870–3909) was added for 25 cycles of PCR (40 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, 2 min at 73 °C). The SfuI/NsiI fragment (3342–3846) of the amplified DNA containing the mutation was incorporated at the respective restriction sites into pHLCC77. Other IIIS6 mutants were prepared in a similar way using the following antisense primers: 5′-gaaaggtgacgatgTcgaagcccacgaag-3′ (3508–3480; V1165D), 5′-cctgaaaggtgacgatTTTgaagcccacgaagatg-3′ (3511–3477; V1165K), 5′-cctgaaaggtgacgatgGGgaagcccacgaagatg-3′ (3511–3477; V1165F), 5′-ctcctgaaaggtgacgGAgacgaagcccacgaag-3′ (3511–3474; I1166S), 5′-ggtgacgatgacgGagcccacgaagatg-3′ (3504–3477; F1164S), 5′-ggtgacgatgacgaagGAcacgaagatgttcatc-3′ (3504–3471; G1163S), and 5′-gtgacgatgacgaagccGGTgaagatgttcatc-3′ (3503–3468; V1162T). To prepare α1C,IL, α1C,IS, and α1C,ILS, megaprimers were amplified using the mutated sense 5′-ctcggtgtgACtagcggagag-3′ (1201–1221), 5′-ggtgtgcttaTcggagagttttcc-3′ (1204–1227), or 5′-ggttctcggtgtgACtaTcggag-3′ (1197–1219) primers, respectively, with the antisense primer 5′-gttgacggactcggtc-3′ (1410–1425). Each of the megaprimers was used with the sense 5′-gcattgtcgaatggaaaccat-3′ (356–376) primer for PCR amplification of the pHLCC77 template. The resulting mutated DNAs were digested by MunI andSphI, and 1-kb fragments (409–1398) were ligated into the respective restriction sites of pHLCC77. α1C,IV-coding pHLCC249 was prepared using the Altered Sites II in vitromutagenesis system (Promega) and antisense mutation primer 5′-gttgtccatgGtgacagctac-3′ (4414–4434) essentially as described earlier (29Soldatov N.M., Oz, M. O'Brien K.A. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Combined II+III (α1C,II,III) and II+IV (α1C,II,IV) mutations were introduced by ligatingPpuMI/NotI fragments of pHLCC250 and pHLCC249, respectively, into pHLCC94. Combined III + IV (α1C,III,IV) and II + III + IV (α1C,II,III,IV) mutations were introduced via ligation of the NsiI/AatII fragment of pHLCC249 into pHLCC250 and the pHLCC94/250 chimera, respectively. All three quadruple mutants (α1C,I–IV) have been generated by a ligation ofMunI/SphI fragment (409–1398) of pHLCC251 or pHLCC252 with the SphI/NsiI fragment (1398–3846) of the pHLCC94/250 chimera and theMunI/NsiI vector part of pHLCC249. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type (α1C,WT) and mutated α1C subunits were co-expressed with β1 (30Ruth P. Rohrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulia S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V.

Membrane currents were recorded at 20–22 °C by a two-electrode voltage clamp method using a TEV-200A amplifier (Dagan). The bath solution contained, in millimolar, 40 Ba2+, 50 Na+, 1 K+, 5 HEPES, and 0.3 niflumic acid (pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances between 0.2 and 1 MΩ. One hour before recordings, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 100 mm BAPTA (1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) (pH 7.4 with CsOH). The duration of test pulses used for the calculation of inactivation kinetics was 1 s to avoid deterioration of the stability of oocyte preparation. Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2.5 kHz. pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition, and KaleidaGraph software was used for the analysis. The values of the double-exponential fitting are presented only for the purpose of comparison of different mutants; they characterize only the 1-s current kinetics and do not represent the absolute values. Data are given as means ± S.E. Endogenous current, determined in the presence of 5 μm(±)-PN200-110 to block the α1C current, did not exceed 1–2% of the total current. The mutation A752T (26Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that impairs Ca2+ channel inactivation (25Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S.

Biol. 2000; 177: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) is located at the position −2 from the cytoplasmic end of the putative transmembrane segment IIS6 (Table I). The analogous S6 positions in repeats III and IV of α1C are also occupied by hydrophobic amino acids that are essentially conserved among the other Ca2+ channels except in the cases of α1A and α1B, that have an equivalent replacement V1165I (12Hering S.

To examine the role of these hydrophobic amino acids in Ca2+ channel inactivation, the homologous mutations V1165T in IIIS6 (α1C,III) and I1475T in IVS6 (α1C,IV) have been introduced alone and in combinations with each other or with A752T (α1C,II).Table IMutations for probing the amino acids in transmembrane segments S6 critical for inactivation of the α 1C channelSegmentAmino acid motifMutationα1C constructIS6398NLVLGVLSGE407L404Tα1C,IL NLVLGVLS GES405Iα1C,IS NLVLGVLS GEL404T,S405Iα1C,ILSIIS6746NVFLAIAVDN755A752Tα1C,IIIIIS61159NIFVGFVIVT1168V1165Tα1C,III NIFVGFVIVTV1165Fα1C,IS,II,IIIF,IV NIFVGFVIVTV1165Dα1C,IS,II,IIID,IV NIFVGFVIVTV1165Kα1C,IS,II,IIIK,IV NIFVGFVI VTI1166Sα1C,IS,II,IIIS,IV NIFVGFVIVTF1164Sα1C,IS,II,IIIS1,IV NIFVGFVIVTG1163Sα1C,IS,II,IIIS2,IV NIFVGFVIVTV1162Tα1C,IS,II,IIIT,IVIVS61469NLFVAVIMDN1478I1475Tα1C,IVUnderlined are putative cytoplasmic ends of the predicted transmembrane segments S6 of the four repeats in the L-type α1C Ca2+ channel (26Soldatov N.M.

The test pulses to +10 mV eliciting maximum currents were selected to compare the kinetics (Table II and Fig.1 A) and voltagedependence of activation and inactivation of the mutated channels (Fig. 1, B and C). For every trace of Ba2+ current, the steady-state current was determined from the fit (see Table II) and normalized to the peak amplitude. This sustained component of the current (I o) is a measure of the non-inactivating fraction of the Ba2+ current. The inactivating component of the current was further analyzed by double-exponential fitting as a sum of the fast and slow components. Increase of the pulse duration to 2 s did not greatly change the calculated parameters (see TableII, asterisk).Table IIKinetics of Ba 2+ current inactivation in α 1C mutantsMutantFraction ofI oFraction ofI fτfFraction ofI sτs2-bThe slow time constants (τs) are not discussed in this work and in fact require longer pulse intervals for more reliable estimation.n2-cn, number of tested oocytes.%%ms%ms α1C,WT16.9 ± 1.044.4 ± 3.876.0 ± 4.438.7 ± 3.8425 ± 1923Repeats II, III, IV α1C,II25.2 ± 2.047.9 ± 3.071.4 ± 5.526.9 ± 3.0415 ± 2622 α1C,III22.2 ± 1.846.7 ± 3.386.2 ± 9.131.1 ± 3.3404 ± 3214 α1C,IV28.9 ± 2.051.0 ± 1.478.4 ± 2.920.1 ± 1.4395 ± 1619 α1C,II,III52.1 ± 4.331.2 ± 5.369.9 ± 7.816.7 ± 5.3635 ± 839 α1C,II,IV47.0 ± 3.129.4 ± 4.981.0 ± 9.924.0 ± 4.9671 ± 4911 α1C,III,IV50.7 ± 3.132.6 ± 2.863.2 ± 5.416.7 ± 2.8752 ± 7917 α1C,II,III,IV69.7 ± 2.022.9 ± 2.053.8 ± 3.37.4 ± 2.0708 ± 6429Repeat I α1C,IL18.0 ± 2.750.0 ± 4.777.2 ± 7.430.0 ± 4.7507 ± 4917 α1C,IS29.7 ± 3.060.3 ± 1.846.9 ± 3.310.0 ± 1.8337 ± 369 α1C,ILS7.8 ± 2.166.8 ± 3.356.2 ± 2.225.4 ± 3.3354 ± 208All four repeats α1C,IL–IV29.9 ± 2.350.5 ± 4.837.7 ± 3.519.6 ± 4.8641 ± 9112 α1C,ILS–IV43.0 ± 4.956.1 ± 1.014.8 ± 1.80.9 ± 1.0471 ± 2711 α1C,IS-IV45.0 ± 4.855.0 ± 4.810.8 ± 0.4––17Ba2+ currents were elicited by 1-s test pulses2-aIncrease of pulse interval duration to 2 s did not greatly affect the fast time constant (τf) values (88.5 ± 9.0 ms) but somewhat changed the relative distribution of the kinetic components determined from the fit (Io = 13.8 ± 1.0%; If = 56.1 ± 3.9%; Is = 30.1 ± 3.9%) and the τs value (506 ± 30 ms, n = 16. to +10 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV.

Thus the sum I f +I s represents the apparent inactivating component of the net current. I o is the sustained current component determined as the ratio of steady state to peak current amplitudes. The results, summarized in Table II, show that the mutations to threonine introduced at the −2 positions in any of the S6 segments in repeats II, III, or IV increased the size of the sustained Ba2+ current at the end of a 1-s depolarization pulse ∼1.4- to 1.7-fold compared with the wild-type channel. None of the mutations have markedly altered the kinetics of inactivation. Indeed, the faster inactivating component representing 60–70% of Ba2+ current decay has the time constant τfranging from 71 to 86 ms. The remaining slower component of the Ba2+ current inactivated with a τs from 395 to 415 ms, i.e. in the range characteristic for the α1C, WT channel (Table II). When single mutations were introduced, a 3- to 4-mV shift in both directions in steady-state inactivation curves was observed (Fig.1 C). At the end of the 2-s conditioning pulse, 6.1 ± 1.4% of the maximum Ba2+ current through the wild-type channel remained noninactivated. This fraction increased to 11.5–21.2% by the threonine substitution in repeats II–IV, suggesting that inactivation of the mutated channels was obstructed. The maximum effect of a single mutation was seen with α1C, II, thus confirming the results of our earlier study of this mutant expressed in HEK293 cells (25Soldatov N.M. Zhenochin S. AlBanna B. Abernethy D.R. Morad M. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the hydrophobic residues of Ala-752 in IIS6, Val-1165 in IIIS6, and Ile-1475 in IVS6 each contribute to the voltage-dependent inactivation of the α1C channel. Mutation of these amino acids to hydrophilic Thr appears to impair the transition from the open to inactivated state and/or destabilizes the inactivated state of the channel. Given the similarity in the effects of the tested single mutations to Thr, our data may suggest that the hydrophobic amino acids in the −2 positions of segments IIS6, IIIS6, and IVS6 are concurrently involved in voltage-dependent inactivation. To test this hypothesis, the S6 mutations in repeats II–IV were combined in the double and triple mutants listed in Table II. We observed that each additional homologous mutation inhibited a considerable fraction of the Ba2+ current inactivation (Fig. 1 A and Table II) without significantly altering current-voltage relationships (Fig.1 B). The voltage dependences of the time constants of inactivation were not strongly affected (Fig. 1 D). Indeed, the ratio τf(−10)/τf(40) of the time constants measured at −10 mV and +40 mV for Ba2+ currents through the α1C,II,IV, α1C,III,IV, and α1C,II,III,IV channels decreased less than 2-fold compared with α1C,WT and other mutants. Steady-state inactivation curves showed an increase of the noninactivating component of Ba2+ current from 6.1 ± 1.4% in α1C,WT to 48.5 ± 3.0% in α1C,II,III,IV (Fig. 1 C). For some of the mutants, these curves were shifted by 3–4 mV toward positive potentials, whereas their slopes in α1C,II,IV and α1C,II,III,IV were less steep than in α1C,WT and other mutants. These data suggest that the combined double and triple mutations to threonine may slightly change the voltage dependence and cooperativity of the voltage sensors for inactivation in these channels. In the three double mutants tested (α1C,II,III, α1C,II,IV, and α1C,III,IV), the sustained component of Ba2+ current increased 2-fold compared with the single mutants, and accounted for 47–52% of the total current (Table II). An augmentation of the sustained current was due to both the fast and slow components of the current, which decreased about proportionally in the analyzed single and double mutants (I f/I s ∼ 2). In the case of α1C,II,III,IV, the fraction of the sustained current increased to ∼70% of the total current (Fig. 1 Aand Table II). It is important to note that the ratio ofI f/I s ∼ 3 determined for the α1C,II,III,IV channel suggests a substantial additional decrease of the slower inactivating component. The triple mutation did not appear to greatly affect the property of Ca2+-dependent inactivation (Fig.2). First, the dominating (87.8 ± 0.2%) fast component of the decay of the Ca2+ current atV t = +10 mV (τf = 16.0 ± 1.2 ms, n = 7; Fig. 2 A) exhibited a 4.6-fold acceleration as compared with the Ba2+ current (Table II) but had kinetics essentially similar to those through the wild-type channel (τf = 15.3 ± 1.5 ms;I f = 95.1 ± 0.5%; n = 16). Second, we observed a U-shape voltage dependence of τf (Fig. 2 B) reflecting the relationship between the inactivation rate and the size of Ca2+ current expected for Ca2+-induced inactivation (32Neely A. Olcese R. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1895-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, with Ca2+ as a charge carrier, a sustained component of the current was also observed, but its amplitude (11.6 ± 1.8%,n = 5) was smaller than those measured with Ba2+ current (Table II) and appreciably larger than that in the case of I Ca through α1C,WT(2.8 ± 1.0%; n = 16). One of the possible explanations for the significant residual sustained component of the Ca2+ current in the triple mutant may be partial compensation of the impaired voltage-dependent inactivation in α1C,II,III,IV by the Ca2+-induced inactivation. Although the hydrophobic amino acid mutations were introduced in the presumed pore region of the channel (9Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar, 10Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the ratio of maximum Ba2+ to Ca2+ currents (∼2.7; n = 3) through the α1C,II,III,IVchannel did not change substantially compared with the wild-type channel, indicating that the ion selectivity was not appreciably affected. Segment IS6 appears to contribute to the voltage-dependent inactivation differently as compared with other S6 segments. The inactivation properties of the L404T mutant α1C,IL are very similar to those of the wild-type channel (Table II). However, incorporation of the L404T mutation into the α1C,II,III,IV channel significantly reversed the effect caused by the combined mutations to threonines in repeats II–IV leading to α1C,II,III,IV (cf. decays of Ba2+ current through the α1C,II,III,IVchannel in Fig. 1 A and those through the α1C,IL–IV channel in Fig.3 A). The sustained component of the Ba2+ current through the α1C,IL–IVchannel was reduced 2.3-fold. Both fast and slow components of the decay increased in size, and the faster inactivating component of the Ba2+ current was accelerated (Table II). Steady-state inactivation curves for α1C,IL and α1C,IL–IV were shifted by 7 and 13 mV toward negative voltages, and their slopes were steeper compared with α1C,WT and α1C,II,III,IV, respectively (Fig. 3 B). In the case of the α1C,IL–IVchannel, the half-maximal activation was also shifted by 12 mV toward negative potentials (Fig. 3 C), but the current-voltage relation for α1C,IL was not appreciably different from those for the other isoforms (Fig. 1 B). Unlike transmembrane segments IIS6–IVS6, segment IS6 contains a hydroxyl amino acid"

Here, we provide a novel paradigm for nongenomic E2 signaling independent of nuclear ER. E2induces a rapid rise in the intracellular free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+] i) through membrane estrogen receptors in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. This E2-induced Ca2+ signaling is not prevented by different ER blockers and cannot directly activate stably transfected c-fospromoter or the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK, or NO production. However, the E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i specifically down-regulates the serum-stimulated activation of c-fos promoter and ERK1/2, and conversely, it specifically up-regulates lipopolysaccharide-stimulated activation of c-fos promoter, p38, and NO production. The E2-changed activation of c-fos promoter can be prevented by an intracellular Ca2+ chelator.

Moreover, E2 is known to increase risk for autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis (10Cutolo M. Sulli A. Seriolo B. Accardo S. Masi A.T. Clin. Exp.

All these activities of E2 are considered to be mediated at the cellular level through estrogen receptor (ER) α or ERβ belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily (11Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). For a long time, it has been thought that the ER, after binding of E2and translocation into the nucleus, acts exclusively as a ligand-inducible transcription factor causing E2-specific gene expression and repression, respectively (12Beato M.

However, there is also information available that nongenomic E2 actions can be independent of the classical nuclear ER. In particular, the E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i has been reported to be mediated through membrane ER (mER) on the cell surface (25Audy M.C. Vacher P. Duly B. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of mER is currently under controversial debate. Some authors suggest the mER to be largely identical with the classical ER (23Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 29Watson C.S. Gametchu B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 9-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other authors emphasize the views that the mER belongs to the class of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (26Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or that the mER even represents larger complexes containing GPCR linked somehow to nuclear ER (31Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At present, however, the key question is whether the E2-induced nongenomic rise in [Ca2+] i through mER, irregardless of its molecular nature, is able to exert any effects on cell functioning, in particular on gene expression at all. Indeed, there is information available that Ca2+ signaling has a profound influence on expression of especially immediate early genes such as c-fos (32Roche E. Prentki M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J.

Res. 1999; 19: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In general, however, the E2-induced rises in [Ca2+] i are characterized by low amplitude and short duration, and they are therefore widely regarded as meaningless for affecting gene expression and cell functions. Here, however, we demonstrate that E2-induced Ca2+ signaling through surface receptors, not inhibitable by ER blockers, exerts specific regulatory effects on genotropic signaling pathways induced by serum and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine macrophages. The c-fospromoter from −520 to +109 was amplified from mouse DNA, cloned into pSEAP2 Basic Vector (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany), and stably transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in combination with pEGFPN3 (CLONTECH) into the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB-71). The cells were grown in phenol red-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated low endotoxin fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany). Clones were selected and maintained in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418. The clone RAW-fos13, which did not express any detectable enhanced green fluorescent protein, was used throughout all experiments. Cell stocks were preserved in liquid nitrogen, and the cells used were passaged not more than eight times. Total RNA was isolated from RAW-fos13 cells as well as from the uteri of C57BL/10 mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA fragments of ERα and ERβ were amplified as described recently (27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The following primer pairs were used: ERαS1 sense, 5′-ACA-GGA-ATC-AAG-GTA-AAT-GTG-TGG-3′; ERαS1 antisense, 5′-CTC-CAG-GAG-CAG-GTC-ATA-GAG-G-3′; ERαS2 sense, 5′-GGC-TGG-AGA-TTC-TGA-TGA-TTG-G-3′; ERαS2 antisense, 5′-GGG-TAT-GTA-GTA-GGT-TTG-TAA-GG-3′; ERβS1 sense, 5′-CAA-TGT- GCT-AGT-GAG-CCG-TCC-3′; ERβS1 antisense, 5′-CTG-CTG-CTG- GGA-AGA-GAT-TCC-3′; ERβS2 sense, 5′-CAA-GTC-CGC-CTC-TTG- GAA-AGC-3′; ERβS2 antisense, 5′-CAT-CTG-TCA-CTG-CGT-TCA- ATA-GG-3′; ERβD1 sense, 5′-CTT-GCC-TGT-AAA-CAG-AGA-GAC- C-3′; ERβD1 antisense, 5′-GAC-GGC-TCA-CTA-GCA-CAT-TGG-3′. PCR fragments were separated in 2% Tris borate-EDTA agarose gels, purified using a PCR product purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and cloned into TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherland). The fragments were sequenced with Thermo Sequenase fluorescent-labeled sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed with a LI-COR sequencer (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) as described previously (27Benten W.P.M.

Both intact cells and permeabilized cells were labeled with the anti-ER antibodies ERα(MC-20) and ERα(H-184) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and with the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate (Sigma) and donkey anti-goat-FITC antibody (a gift from P.

Intact RAW-fos13 cells in a 150-μl suspension were incubated for 1 min with 17β-estradiol 6-(O-carboxymethyl) oxime (E2)-BSA-FITC (Sigma) or with the control BSA-FITC (Sigma) as described previously (27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cells were incubated with concanavalin A-rhodamine (1:50) (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 15 min at room temperature then thoroughly washed before labeling with E2-BSA-FITC or BSA-FITC as described previously (36Benten W.P.M.

Aliquots of 1.5 × 106cells labeled with antibodies or E2-BSA-FITC as above were postfixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, analyzed in a FACSCalibur sorter (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) with 10,000 gated cells per sample, and evaluated with the FACScan software as described previously (36Benten W.P.M.

Cells grown overnight on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were labeled with antibodies or E2-BSA-FITC or BSA-FITC as above. The cells were postfixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, mounted on slides, and analyzed with a Leica TCS NT confocal laser-scanning microscope version 1.5.451 (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 488-nm argon laser line for excitation of FITC fluorescence and a 568-nm krypton laser line for rhodamine fluorescence. Evaluation was described previously (37Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Cells at a concentration of 107/ml were suspended in 20 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, and 1 mg/ml glucose before loading with 1 μm Fura-2/acetoxymethylester (Sigma) for 1 h. The Ca2+ measurements were performed in a LS 55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) measuring Fura-2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm for excitation and 509 nm for emission with a dissociation constant of Fura-2-Ca2+ complex taken as 224 nm. The [Ca2+] i was computed from the ratio of 340/380-nm fluorescence values as described previously (27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After serum starvation for 18 h, cells were stimulated with 10% (v/v) FCS for various periods. The FCS used was stripped by incubating twice with 1 g of charcoal and 0.1 g of dextran for 500 ml of FCS for 30 min at 56 and 37 °C, respectively, with final filtration through 0.22-μm pore-sized membranes (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). For stimulation with LPS, the cells were incubated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 5% stripped FCS for 18 h before adding 1 μg/ml LPS. NO in the supernatants of cells was measured as nitrite using Griess reagent as described previously (35Krücken J. Stamm O. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Wunderlich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24383-24391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 × 105 cells in 1 ml were cultured in 24-well plates overnight. Just before stimulation, 100 μl of culture fluid from the wells were collected as controls (RLU0 h) and another 100 μl after 3 h stimulation (RLU3 h). Secreted alkaline phosphatase activity was determined using a Phospha-Light kit (Tropix, Weiterstadt, Germany) with a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) as described previously (35Krücken J.

The relative activity of c-fos promoter was calculated by subtraction of 0.9 × RLU0 h from RLU3 hand normalizing to controls. After stimulation, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 tablet/10 ml protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were boiled with loading buffer for 5 min then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protan, Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with the anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies (mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) E10 monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/182), rabbit anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt/Main, Germany)). Incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed for 1 h, before membranes were subjected to ECLTM Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After immunodetection, the membranes were stripped and then reprobed with the corresponding anti-total kinase protein antibodies (New England Biolabs). The software Quantiscan (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) was used for densitometric quantification, and relative activation was calculated from the ratio of phosphorylated kinase protein/total kinase protein. Macrophages, which play a key role in immunity, have been reported to express both nuclear ER (39Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Cenci S. Ross F.P. Adler S. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and mER (27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The presence of both classical nuclear ERs and mERs is confirmed in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, which we have stably transfected with the reporter gene human secreted alkaline phosphatase driven by the c-fos promoter. These RAW-fos13 macrophages express ERα, but not ERβ, as revealed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig.1 A). Expression of ERα can be also detected, but only in permeabilized cells, by flow cytometry using the antibody ERα(H-180) binding to the N-terminal steroid binding domain of ERα (Fig. 1 B) and the antibody ERα(MC-20), probing the C-terminal part of ERα (data not shown). The majority of ERα was localized in the cytoplasm of cells, as revealed by CLSM (Fig. 1 C). However, these two anti-ERα antibodies did not react with any ERα on the surface of intact RAW-fos13 cells. Nevertheless, the RAW-fos13 cells exhibit binding sites for E2 on their surface. When intact RAW-fos13 cells were incubated with the plasma membrane-impermeable E2-BSA-FITC for 1 min, the cells revealed an increased fluorescence intensity, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig.2 A). CLSM localized this bound fluorescence exclusively on the cell surface (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, the cells did not bind any BSA-FITC under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, the red fluorescence of concanavalin A-rhodamine was localized on the surface of intact cells and was colocalized with E2-BSA-FITC (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Existence of mER in RAW-fos13 cells. A, flow cytometry of intact RAW-fos13 cells labeled with E2-BSA-FITC and BSA-FITC. B, CLSM localizes E2-BSA-FITC but not BSA-FITC on the surface of RAW-fos13 cells.

The amount of E2-raised Ca2+ varied from experiment to experiment between about 50 to 90 nm Ca2+. About the same increase in [Ca2+] i can be induced with the plasma membrane-impermeable E2-BSA, whereas BSA alone was ineffective in affecting [Ca2+] i (Fig.3 B). Moreover, the E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i cannot be prevented upon pre-incubation of the cells with different ER blockers such as ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, and raloxifene (Fig. 3, C and D). The rise in [Ca2+] i could be due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and/or to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores such as endoplasmic reticulum. When extracellular Ca2+ was removed by 2 mm EGTA, E2 was still able to induce a slight increase in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3 E). In addition, the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 prevented most of the E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i, whereas the ineffective analog compound U-73343 did not abrogate the E2-induced increase in [Ca2+] i (Fig.3 F). This indicates that E2 induces both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores in RAW-fos13 cells. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) abolished most of the E2-induced rise in Ca2+, which suggests participation of G-proteins in the E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3 G). It has been reported that E2 can directly activate MAPKs (15Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T. McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore examined the effect of E2 on the activation of the three MAPK family extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) p38 MAPK, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). When the cells were incubated with 1 nm E2 for various periods up to 180 min, none of the three MAPKs became activated, as revealed by immunodetection (data not shown). Moreover, E2 is reported to induce expression of the Ca2+-sensitive immediate early gene c-fos (17Duan R. Xie W. Burghardt R.C. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11590-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, 1 nm E2was not able to induce any significant activation of the stably transfected c-fos promoter in RAW-fos13 cells (Fig.4 A). In line with these negative results, E2 cannot induce any detectable NO production in cells. LPS is known to activate macrophages including induction of the immediate early gene c-fos (40Collart M.A. Belin D. Vassalli J.D. Vassalli P. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 949-955PubMed Google Scholar, 41Introna M. Hamilton T.A. Kaufman R.E. Adams D.O. Bast R.C., Jr. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2711-2715PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance, we can show that LPS also stimulates the c-fos promoter by about 4-fold in RAW-fos13 cells (Fig. 4 A). E2 even augmented this LPS effect, whereas 17α-E2 was ineffective (Fig.4 B). The up-regulatory E2 effect cannot be prevented by the ER inhibitors ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, and raloxifene (Fig. 4 B). E2 exerts its augmentation of LPS stimulation on the c-fos promoter through the rise of [Ca2+] i . Indeed, 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethaneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA), when used under conditions blocking intracellular free Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 3 H), also prevented the E2-induced augmentation of LPS-stimulated c-fos promoter (Fig. 4 C). There was also no increase of LPS stimulation by E2 when Ca2+ rise was inhibited with the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122, in contrast to the ineffective compound U-73343 (Fig.4 C). Moreover, the inhibitor GF109203X of the Ca2+-sensitive protein kinase C prevented the E2-induced up-regulation of LPS-activated c-fospromoter (Fig. 4 C). Because PTX blocks this E2activation, G-proteins are obviously involved in the E2-induced augmentation of c-fos promoter activity (Fig. 4 C). Activation of macrophages by LPS is also associated with activation of the three MAPK families ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK (42Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 43Feng G.J. Goodridge H.S. Harnett M.M. Wei X.Q. Nikolaev A.V. Higson A.P. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, when RAW-fos13 cells were stimulated with LPS for various periods up to 180 min, all of the three MAPK families were mostly activated at 15 min, and thereafter, activation was declined but still detectable after 180 min (Fig. 5). E2selectively interfered with activation of MAPKs induced by LPS. E2 did not affect the activities of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK but only the activation of p38 became up-regulated at 15 min (Fig. 5). Activation of p38 MAPK is known to be involved in the control of NO production of macrophages (44Chen C. Chen Y.H. Lin W.W. Immunology. 1999; 97: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have therefore examined the effect of E2 on LPS-stimulated NO production. In RAW-fos13 cells, stimulation with LPS for 24 h caused a dramatic increase in NO production to ∼30 μm nitrite (Fig.6 A). Moreover, co-incubation with E2 resulted even in an increase of NO production by about 50%. This stimulatory E2 effect cannot be inhibited by the ER blockers tamoxifen and raloxifene (Fig. 6 A). However, the E2 effect can be abrogated by preincubation of cells with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (Fig.6 A). The view that Ca2+ is important for this E2 up-regulatory activity is further supported by the fact that phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 blocked the E2-stimulated LPS activation of NO production but not the ineffective analog compound U-73343 (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, the inhibitor GF109203X of the Ca2+-sensitive protein kinase C prevented the E2-induced up-regulation of LPS-stimulated NO production just as did PTX (Fig. 6 B). In contrast to its effects on LPS signaling, we found the opposite effect of E2 on charcoal-stripped FCS-induced signaling. FCS stimulated the activation of the c-fos promoter by about 5-fold, whereas E2, but not 17α-E2, down-regulated FCS-stimulated activity of c-fos promoter to about 2–3-fold (Fig. 7 A). This down-regulation cannot be prevented by tamoxifen or raloxifene (Fig. 7 A). The down-regulatory effect of E2 is mediated through mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, as substantiated by experiments using BAPTA, U-73122, U-73343, and GF109203X (Fig. 7 B). Also, PTX prevented the E2-induced down-regulation of FCS-stimulated c-fos promoter (Fig. 7 B). FCS stimulation of RAW-fos13 cells activated ERK1/2 (Fig. 8) but not p38 and SAPK/JNK (data not shown). The presence of E2 during FCS stimulation down-regulated ERK1/2 activation to a similar extent as it did in c-fos promoter activation (Fig. 8).Figure 8Effects of E2 on activation of ERK1/2 induced by charcoal-stripped FCS. Cells were stimulated with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1 nm E2 plus FCS for different periods, with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (AN) as a positive control of ERK1/2 activation. Cell lysates were subjected to immunodetection, and the relative activation of ERK1 and ERK2 from each group was expressed relative to the activation level at 0 min of FCS stimulation. Representative blots are shown, and the results were verified in at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our data provide evidence for a novel paradigm of E2action at the cellular level: E2 triggers nongenomic signaling, independent of the classical nuclear ER, and this nongenomic signaling specifically regulates genotropic signaling induced by FCS or LPS in murine macrophages. Nongenomic E2 signaling manifests itself as an E2-induced rapid rise in [Ca2+] i of RAW-fos13 cells. This rise is due to both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores, as we have recently also found in mouse IC-21 macrophages (27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). E2-induced nongenomic Ca2+signaling has been described to be independent of the classical nuclear ER (25Audy M.C. Vacher P. Duly B. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as well as to be dependent on ER (15Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T. McDonnell D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4686-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although the RAW-fos13 cells express ERα, the E2-induced Ca2+ signaling is not mediated through ERα but rather through mER. This view is supported by the following findings. First, the E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i cannot be prevented by the ER blockers ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, and raloxifene. Second, E2-BSA, which is not able to enter the cells and which binds to neither ERα nor ERβ (45Stevis P.E. Deecher D.C. Suhadolnik L. Mallis L.M. Frail D.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5455-5458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is also capable of rapidly raising [Ca2+] i, just as free E2. Third, the RAW-fos13 cells exhibit distinct binding sites for E2-BSA-FITC on their surfaces that are not accessible for anti-ER antibodies on intact cells. Fourth, our finding that the E2-induced increase in [Ca2+] i via phospholipase C is insensitive to ICI 182,780 contrasts to recent data showing inhibition by ICI 182,780 of E2-induced activation of phospholipase C via transfected ERα and ERβ, which also are expressed in the plasma membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). This strongly supports the view that the E2-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling in RAW-fos13 cells does not rely on the classical ER linked somehow to the plasma membrane. Fifth, inhibition of the E2-induced Ca2+ signaling by PTX indicates that the mER is not identical with the classical nuclear ER, but rather the mER belongs to the class of G-protein-coupled receptors. As with numerous other G-protein-coupled receptors, the mER is agonist-sequestrable, as recently characterized in detail in mouse IC-21 macrophages (27Benten W.P.M. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that classical nuclear ERs mediate nongenomic E2 effects such as activation of MAPK (15Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T. McDonnell D.P. Proc.

Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Although RAW-fos13 cells express ERα, E2 is not able to directly induce any activation of the c-fos promoter or the NO production or one of the three MAPK families p38, ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK. Nonetheless, all these parameters except SAPK/JNK are responsive to E2, which becomes apparent only when cells are activated by LPS or FCS. Indeed, E2 down-regulates FCS-stimulated c-fos promoter activation, whereas it up-regulates LPS-induced c-fospromoter activation in RAW-fos13 cells. These E2 effects are not mediated through ERα but rather through nongenomic Ca2+ signaling. This view is substantiated by our findings that (i) these E2 effects are not prevented by the ER blockers ICI 182,780, tamoxifen, and raloxifene, (ii) they can be abolished by BAPTA under conditions capturing the intracellular free Ca2+ ions generated by E2, and (iii) they are prevented by PTX and inhibitors of phospholipase C, which both inhibit an E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i . The down- and up-regulation of genotropic FCS and LPS signaling, respectively, by an E2-induced rise in [Ca2+] i are not simply due to a general dampening or stimulation of all cell activities but, rather, are highly specific. Indeed, although LPS activates all of the three MAPK families, p38, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK, only the p38 MAPK is up-regulated by the E2-induced Ca2+ signaling. Finally, the specific up-regulatory effect of E2-induced Ca2+ signaling on LPS-stimulated p38 and c-fospromoter results in increased activation of macrophage, which becomes evident as increased NO production. Again, this up-regulatory effect of E2 on LPS-stimulated NO production of macrophages is independent of ERα. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence for a linkage of E2-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling through mER, independent of the classical nuclear ER, with cell functions. We are aware of the fact that our results are in conflict to numerous other findings showing ER-mediated nongenomic E2 effect (15Improta-Brears T. Whorton A.R. Codazzi F. York J.D. Meyer T.

Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). At present, a plausible explanation for this difference is that nongenomic E2 actions vary among different cell types and that such a nongenomic E2signaling as we described in RAW-fos13 macrophages is possibly restricted to macrophages. But even if this type of nongenomic E2 signaling were restricted to macrophages, it is presumably of importance for human health, for example, with respect to the outcome of infectious diseases. Activation of macrophages, induced by components of infectious agents such as the bacterial LPS, is a prerequisite to effectively recognize and kill microorganisms as well as even malignant tumor cells (49Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). By contrast, over-activation of macrophages is believed to be responsible for deleterious clinical manifestations of infectious diseases, such as hypercoagulation, hypotension, cachexia, somnolence, multiple organ failure, and even death (50Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar)."

Oligomerization in these enzymes induces conformational changes, which provide active or open forms that are essential for catalytic functions.In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomerase forms an active multimer in vivo that may contain two active sites. This suggests that Est2p can oligomerize (17Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, one group reported that the human telomerase complex also forms a homodimer that contains two template RNA molecules (18Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M. Kelleher C. Damm K. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and another group found that two separate, catalytically inactive TERT proteins can complement each other in trans to reconstitute catalytic activity (19Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6151-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results indicated that just one hTERT molecule and one hTR molecule alone could not reconstitute telomerase activity. In other words, hTERT and hTR molecules must form a multimer and reconstitute telomerase activity by working together. However, it was not clear whether disruptions to the oligomeric formation of hTERT reduce telomerase activity.Here we demonstrate that two independent regions outside of motifs T to D have an important role in the oligomeric interaction of hTERTin vitro using purified recombinant hTERT in the absence of hTR, and in mammalian cells transiently co-expressing various tagged hTERTs. These two independent regions can interact. We also demonstrate that catalytically inactive truncated forms of hTERT, which contain the binding region can inhibit telomerase activity of the wild-type hTERT.DISCUSSIONTERT is a unique enzyme among a family of nucleic acid-dependent polymerases harboring a fingers, palm, and thumb substructure, because it forms a tight complex with template RNA for the activity (2Nugent C.I.

We previously reported that hTERT and hTR are the minimum components required for telomerase activity when telomerase is reconstituted in vitro with two purified components (4Masutomi K. Kaneko S.

During this study we found that the catalytic activity of the purified hTERT was not detectable when concentrations of hTERT were low in the assay reaction (data not shown). This concentration dependence of hTERT reminded us of the template switching of telomerase previously reported in S. cerevisiae (17Prescott J. Blackburn E.H.

Hepatology. 2001; 33: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two groups recently reported the oligomeric role of telomerase using the different methods (18Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6151-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether TERT forms multimer intrinsically or with help of template RNA. Here we show that the homomeric interaction of hTERT in vitro with partially purified differently tagged-hTERTs. Human TR seems to have no effect on the structural oligomerization of hTERT (Fig. 1 C), and RNase treatment did not affect the homomeric interaction in vivo (Fig.2 A) and in vitro (data not shown). These results indicate that hTERT has an intrinsic ability to oligomerize in the absence of intact hTR.Two separate regions of hTERT (aa 301–538 and aa 914–1132) can be mapped to bind the wild-type hTERT in vitro and in vivo. This result may be consistent with a previous report (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in which some combinations of two different truncated hTERT mutants defective in telomerase activity reconstituted telomerase activity. Two regions we mapped are outside the fingers and palm substructure covering motifs T to D. The amino-terminal fragment, aa 301–538, overlaps the region important for hTR binding (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Armbruster B. Banik S.R.S. Guo C. Smith C.A. Counter M.C. Mol. Cell.

The carboxyl-terminal fragment, aa 914–1132, includes motif E and a putative thumb. The two separate regions can bind each other, but no homologous interaction of aa 301–538 or aa 914–1132 was detected (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). The result seems to support a model that the homomeric interaction of hTERT occurs in a “head to tail” fashion. Our result cannot explain the previous result that the amino-terminal region (aa 1–300) and some truncated mutants (such as aa 301–1132) reconstituted telomerase activity (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The region (aa 1–300) critical for telomerase activity (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Armbruster B. Banik S.R.S. Guo C. Smith C.A. Counter M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) may be not essential for the oligomerization but essential to interact with one or more critical factors such as hTR-binding proteins or Hsp90, which is recruited to telomerase by hTR or hTERT.Functional oligomeric formations of telomerase have been proposed since two functional template RNAs in the telomerase complex having two active sites were found in S. cerevisiae and in humans (17Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,18Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M. Kelleher C. Damm K. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the substituted mutant hTERT-D712A-V713I, bound to the wild-type hTERT in vivo and in vitro(data not shown) and inhibited its telomerase activity (Fig. 6), suggesting that oligomeric formation of the wild-type and the mutant hTERTs is the reason of the inhibition. The D712A or D712A-V713I mutants at the VDV sequence, which is critical for substrate binding, have been previously described as dominant negative mutants that eliminate endogenous telomerase activity and cause telomere shortening and cell senescence due to lack of telomerase activity (23Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 31Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2388-2399Crossref Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect of the mutant on the wild-type hTERT was not severe when transiently co-expressed in the telomerase-negative cells even if the amount of plasmid of the mutant was more than 10 times higher than the wild-hTERT (Fig. 6). The result seems to be consistent with the previous report by Beattie et al. (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) who observed a partial restoration of telomerase activity in the presence of hTERT-D712A and the truncated hTERTs harboring the intact pocket for active center but missing the amino-terminal region. These results suggest that the mutants defective in substrate binding (D712A or D712A-V713I) are not dominant negative enzymatically when these mutants oligomerized with the wild-type hTERT, although reconstituted telomerase activity of oligomers consisting of the wild-type and D712A or D712A-V713I hTERTs seems to be much weaker than that of the wild-type oligomer (Fig. 6) (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The apparent dominant negative phenotype of D712A or D712A-V713I in the previous reports may be explained by a huge difference in expression levels between endogenous hTERT and the ectopically expressed mutant hTERT, which may squelch out one or more critical factors for telomerase activity.We expected that the truncated mutants, which have the hTERT-binding regions, would exhibit strong inhibitory effects on the wild-type hTERT by competing oligomerization of the wild-type hTERT. Rather weak inhibitory effects of the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal binding regions may be due to weaker binding abilities to the wild-type hTERT or inefficient recruitment of the proteins to the wild-type hTERT.Telomere maintenance is essential to the replicative potential of malignant cells, and inhibition of telomerase leads to telomere shorting and cessation of unrestrained proliferation (9Meyerson M.

Telomeres are specialized structures positioned at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes that provide a mechanism for maintaining chromosome length and stability. The termini of telomeric DNA cannot be fully replicated by the conventional replication machinery. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of template RNA and several proteins, elongates telomeres as one means of end replication (1McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT1), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is a specific type of reverse transcriptase that forms stable complexes with template RNA (TR) (2Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Human TERT is the rate-limiting factor for telomerase activity both biologically and biochemically (3Bodnar A.G.

TERT is part of a large family of nucleic acid-dependent nucleic acid polymerases that share a “ fingers, palm, and thumb substructure” (2Nugent C.I. Lundblad V.

Oligomerization in these enzymes induces conformational changes, which provide active or open forms that are essential for catalytic functions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomerase forms an active multimer in vivo that may contain two active sites. This suggests that Est2p can oligomerize (17Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, one group reported that the human telomerase complex also forms a homodimer that contains two template RNA molecules (18Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M. Kelleher C. Damm K. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and another group found that two separate, catalytically inactive TERT proteins can complement each other in trans to reconstitute catalytic activity (19Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6151-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results indicated that just one hTERT molecule and one hTR molecule alone could not reconstitute telomerase activity. In other words, hTERT and hTR molecules must form a multimer and reconstitute telomerase activity by working together. However, it was not clear whether disruptions to the oligomeric formation of hTERT reduce telomerase activity. Here we demonstrate that two independent regions outside of motifs T to D have an important role in the oligomeric interaction of hTERTin vitro using purified recombinant hTERT in the absence of hTR, and in mammalian cells transiently co-expressing various tagged hTERTs. These two independent regions can interact. We also demonstrate that catalytically inactive truncated forms of hTERT, which contain the binding region can inhibit telomerase activity of the wild-type hTERT. DISCUSSIONTERT is a unique enzyme among a family of nucleic acid-dependent polymerases harboring a fingers, palm, and thumb substructure, because it forms a tight complex with template RNA for the activity (2Nugent C.I.

In our experiments, the substituted mutant hTERT-D712A-V713I, bound to the wild-type hTERT in vivo and in vitro(data not shown) and inhibited its telomerase activity (Fig. 6), suggesting that oligomeric formation of the wild-type and the mutant hTERTs is the reason of the inhibition. The D712A or D712A-V713I mutants at the VDV sequence, which is critical for substrate binding, have been previously described as dominant negative mutants that eliminate endogenous telomerase activity and cause telomere shortening and cell senescence due to lack of telomerase activity (23Hahn W.C.

However, the inhibitory effect of the mutant on the wild-type hTERT was not severe when transiently co-expressed in the telomerase-negative cells even if the amount of plasmid of the mutant was more than 10 times higher than the wild-hTERT (Fig. 6).

These results suggest that the mutants defective in substrate binding (D712A or D712A-V713I) are not dominant negative enzymatically when these mutants oligomerized with the wild-type hTERT, although reconstituted telomerase activity of oligomers consisting of the wild-type and D712A or D712A-V713I hTERTs seems to be much weaker than that of the wild-type oligomer (Fig. 6) (25Beattie T.L.

We previously reported that hTERT and hTR are the minimum components required for telomerase activity when telomerase is reconstituted in vitro with two purified components (4Masutomi K. Kaneko S.

During this study we found that the catalytic activity of the purified hTERT was not detectable when concentrations of hTERT were low in the assay reaction (data not shown). This concentration dependence of hTERT reminded us of the template switching of telomerase previously reported in S. cerevisiae (17Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the oligomeric interactions of poliovirus (15Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K.

Hepatology. 2001; 33: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two groups recently reported the oligomeric role of telomerase using the different methods (18Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M.

Here we show that the homomeric interaction of hTERT in vitro with partially purified differently tagged-hTERTs. Human TR seems to have no effect on the structural oligomerization of hTERT (Fig. 1 C), and RNase treatment did not affect the homomeric interaction in vivo (Fig.2 A) and in vitro (data not shown). These results indicate that hTERT has an intrinsic ability to oligomerize in the absence of intact hTR. Two separate regions of hTERT (aa 301–538 and aa 914–1132) can be mapped to bind the wild-type hTERT in vitro and in vivo. This result may be consistent with a previous report (25Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in which some combinations of two different truncated hTERT mutants defective in telomerase activity reconstituted telomerase activity. Two regions we mapped are outside the fingers and palm substructure covering motifs T to D. The amino-terminal fragment, aa 301–538, overlaps the region important for hTR binding (25Beattie T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1975117643,"Several recent studies have demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activation is abolished by pertussis toxin, suggesting that trimeric G proteins of the G<sub>i</sub> class are novel cellular targets of the IGF-1 signaling pathway. We report here that the intracellular domain of the <i>Xenopus</i> IGF-1 receptor is capable of binding to the <i>Xenopus</i> homolog of mammalian GIPC, a PDZ domain-containing protein previously identified as a binding partner of G<sub>i</sub>-specific GAP (RGS-GAIP). Binding of xGIPC to xIGF-1 receptor is independent of the kinase activity of the receptor and appears to require the PDZ domain of xGIPC. Injection of two C-terminal truncation mutants that retained the PDZ domain blocked IGF-1-induced <i>Xenopus</i> MAP kinase activation and oocyte maturation. While full-length xGIPC injection did not significantly alter insulin response, it greatly enhanced human RGS-GAIP in stimulating the insulin response in frog oocytes. This represents the first demonstration that GIPC·RGS-GAIP complex acts positively in IGF-1 receptor signal transduction."

Site-directed mutagenesis of residues H165A, E214A, E266A, and H269L within the conserved EXXH motif abolished the ability of TAO to complement the heme-deficient Escherichia colistrain GE1387. These mutations also reduced the growth of this E. coli auxotroph to about 85% of the control cells containing wild type TAO. In contrast, mutation of residues outside the EXXH motifs, e.g. V205A, L243A, C261A, and V271A, had little effect on complementation, and the reduction in the cell growth was about 5–10%. Mutations of the putative iron-binding residues within the EXXH motifs of TAO abolished the ability to confer SHAM-sensitive respiration to E. coliheme mutant, whereas mutations of the non-conserved/non-iron binding residues resulted in 20–30% reduction of SHAM-sensitive respiration of the E. coli auxotroph. Immunoblot analysis of the total cellular protein of transformed E. coli revealed that the expression level of mutated and wild type TAO (35 kDa) remained unaltered. Mutation at C261A produced a truncated but functional protein of 28 kDa. The addition of ortho-phenanthroline to the growth medium produces a non-functional TAO. The effect ofortho-phenanthroline on the activity of TAO was completely alleviated by the addition of iron in the medium, which suggests that iron is needed for the activity of TAO.

The parasite has a digenetic life cycle; it lives in the bloodstream and tissue fluid in the mammalian host as the bloodstream forms. In the insect alimentary gut it exists as the procyclic form. The bloodstream-form trypanosomes do not have cytochromes and use glycolysis as their sole source of energy (1Clayton C.E. Michel P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 465-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Reducing equivalents generated during glycolysis are re-oxidized by transferring electrons to a mitochondrial cyanide-resistant, salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive terminal oxidase called trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO)1 (2Clarkson A.B.

A considerable sequence homology has been observed among the deduced amino acid sequences of all AOX cDNAs. Analysis of the primary and the secondary structure of different alternative oxidases has revealed the presence of two hydrophobic domains at the center of the enzyme and putative diiron-binding motifs (EXXH) (9Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The presence of the EXXH signature motifs places alternative oxidases as members of the class II type of diiron carboxylate proteins that include Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase R2 subunit (10Logan D.T.

Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), methane monooxygenase (12Lee S.K. Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4423-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (13Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Sommerville L. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12776-12786Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The alternative oxidases consist of three EXXH motifs; the N-terminal and the C-terminal motifs are highly conserved, whereas the histidine residue in the middle EXXH motif varies among different alternative oxidases (AOXs). In TAO, this residue is isoleucine (Ile-218) (15Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Siedow et al. (9Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) first proposed an active site model of the alternative oxidase consisting of four putative α-helices, containing non-conserved and conserved EXXH motifs in helices 1 and 4, respectively. The two conserved hydrophobic regions of AOXs were previously postulated as the transmembrane domains. Recently, a revised model was proposed by Andersson and Nordlund (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this model alternative oxidase was proposed as an interfacial inner membrane protein. This model also consists of four α-helices with two EXXH motifs in helices 2 and 4, respectively (9Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, all alternative oxidases possess six conserved amino acid residues proposed as ligands to the iron center. These consist of two bridging bidentate glutamates (Glu-162 and Glu-266), two terminal glutamates (Glu-123 and Glu-214), and two monodentate histidines (His-165 and His-269) (Fig. 1). Histidine residues as well as the bridging glutamates form part of the EXXH motif that holds the putative metal-containing active center. The amino acid residue number indicated in parentheses are from the TAO sequence (Fig. 1). Andersson's model has been further modified by changing one of the proposed glutamate terminal ligand in helix 3 based on the sequence data of the recently cloned Arabidopsis thaliana IMMUTANS(Im) gene, a distant relative of the AOXs (17Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Earlier, we have demonstrated that TAO was able to rescue the heme mutant of E. coli strain GE1387 by conferring on them the SHAM-sensitive alternative pathway of respiration (5Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). InHansenula anomala, iron has been suggested to be required for the activity of the alternative oxidase (18Minagawa N. Sakajo S. Komiyama T. Yoshimoto A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previously, site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved glutamic acid residue of theSauromatum guttatum alternative oxidase (19Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as mutation of the corresponding residue (Glu-215) in the TAO (15Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) revealed that this residue is essential for the activity of the enzyme. Given the information about the proposed models, we hypothesize that mutations of the conserved residues in the EXXH motifs will alter the activity of the TAO. To address this idea, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved amino acid residues His-165, Glu-214, Glu-266, and His-269. The experiments reported here present for the first time with any alternative oxidase a systematic analysis of key residues in the EXXH motifs and establish conserved amino acid residues His-165, Glu-214, Glu-266, and His-269 as essential for the alternative oxidase activity. These experiments provide biochemical confirmation of the proposed active site model for the alternative oxidases. E. coli heme mutant strain GE 1387 (F-145 lis 85 trp R55 pro 48 tsx 84 hemA204 rpsL80r-9) (20Verkamp E. Beckman V.M. Bjornsson J.M. Soll D. Egertsson G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. D. Soll, Yale University, and was grown on M9 minimal medium containing glycerol (0.2%) as the carbon source, supplemented with 5-aminolevulinic acid (50 μg/ml). Methionine, histidine, tryptophan, and proline (50 μg/ml) were added when needed. The strain was also grown on LB agar plates supplemented with 5-aminolevulinic acid and in liquid medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). E. coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) and M15pREP4 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) were used for cloning, mutagenesis studies, and the expression of recombinant protein. TAO was expressed after the addition of IPTG (1.0 mm) in the medium, and the cells were grown for 2–4 h. The E. coli heme mutant transfectants were grown in LB liquid medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) without 5-aminolevulinic acid supplement. The cultures were grown for 48 h at 37 °C in a shaker incubator. Bacterial growth was measured using A 600. In some experiments, OP (50 mm), FeSO4 (125 mm), or CuSO4 (125 mm) was added along with IPTG as noted. A 416-bp fragment (amino acid residues 179–319) from TAO open reading frame was subcloned into pGEM vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at NarI and MluI sites and designated pGEM416. This 416-bp TAO cDNA fragment, containing residues from the proposed EXXH signature sequence of diiron active site, was used for site-directed mutagenesis studies using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each mutated clone was designated according to the amino acid residue mutated, the amino acid residue number, and respective substitution (e.g. E214A, where the codon (GAA) for glutamic acid was changed to the codon (GCC) for alanine). Other changes were in the EXXH motifs (H165A, E266A, and H269L) and outside the EXXH motifs (V205A, L243A, C261A, and V271A). Mutation H165A was performed using full-length TAO cDNA subcloned in the pQE vector. Site-specific mutation of selected clones was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing or automated sequencing using oligonucleotide primers 1 5′ GCCATTATGTACCTCTTCCTCCTG 3′ and 2 5′ GGAATGTGGCATTTTTGCTGA 3′ from TAO cDNA, which were ∼100-bp upstream or downstream of the mutations. After mutations were performed, the 416-bp fragment was religated to the original plasmid to obtain the full-length pQE30/TAO and sequenced for verification. Purified plasmid DNA (5 μg) containing wild type TAO or mutants of the EXXH motifs and non-EXXH motifs were used to transform competent E. coli heme-deficient mutant GE1387 (20Verkamp E. Beckman V.M. Bjornsson J.M. Soll D. Egertsson G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A. thaliana alternative oxidase cDNA clone (pAOX) and vectors alone (pQE30 and pBS SK+/−) were used as controls. The transfectants were plated on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. An isolated colony of E. coli transfectant with TAO mutants as well as wild type TAO were grown in LB ampicillin medium without 5-aminolevulinic acid supplement for 24–48 h. Equal amounts of cells were harvested and suspended in an appropriate amount of LB medium to obtain cell density equivalent to 20 at A 600. Forty microliters of these cell suspensions were used to measure oxygen consumption using an oxygen monitoring system (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) as described previously (21Bass Jr., H.S. Njogu M.R. Hill G.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). SHAM and KCN were used during assay at the final concentration of 2.0 and 1.0 mm, respectively. M15 cells transfected with wild type TAO or mutated TAO plasmids were grown at 37 °C overnight in LB medium in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (120 μg/ml). Fresh LB medium was inoculated with the culture grown overnight; the cells were grown until A 600reached 1.0–1.2, and the cells were then induced with IPTG (1.0 mm) for 2–3 h. Equal amounts of cells (A 600 equivalent) were harvested by centrifugation. All pellets from individual samples were lysed with Laemmli's sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and used for 10% SDS-PAGE analysis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C at 32 V in 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 20% (v/v) methanol, and a duplicate gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Blots were developed with a monoclonal antibody (7D3) raised against TAO (15Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as primary antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as secondary antibody. The color was developed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad) for the desired time. The E. coliauxotroph GE1387 is an excellent system to test the effect of mutations on TAO function because it is defective in the synthesis of heme and produces no cytochromes if not supplemented by 5-aminolevulinic acid. This strain of E. coli does not grow aerobically in medium without 5-aminolevulinic acid, and wild type TAO is able to complement this defect and provide the SHAM-sensitive alternative pathway of respiration to the heme mutant (5Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The complementation ability of TAO mutants was analyzed in comparison to non-mutated TAO (TableI). The results showed that mutation of residues Glu-266, the bridging bidendate glutamate, His-165, His-269 monodendate histidines, and Glu-214, the terminal ligand in the Andersson's proposed model (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), resulted in a heme mutant of E. coli GE1387 that was not rescued. In contrast, mutation of the non-conserved residues Val-205, Leu-243, Cys-261, and Val-271 (Fig.1) showed little difference from the complementation ability of the wild type TAO (Table I). These results demonstrate that His-165, Glu-214, Glu-266, and His-269 are essential for TAO function.Table IComplementation of the Escherichia coli heme mutant GE1387Plasmids used for transfections, mutationsResults, growth of coloniesResidues within the EXXH motifsH165ANo growthH269LNo growthE266ANo growthNon-conserved residues outside the EXXHV205AGrowthL243AGrowthC261AGrowthV271AGrowthConserved residue outside the EXXH motifsE214ANo growthNo mutationspTAO 25 (T. brucei alternative oxidase)GrowthpAOX (A. thaliana alternative oxidase)GrowthpQE (vector alone)No growthE. coli heme mutants were transformed with purified plasmid DNA from mutated and non-mutated TAO, A. thalianaalternative oxidase cDNA, and vector alone.

Open table in a new tab E. coli heme mutants were transformed with purified plasmid DNA from mutated and non-mutated TAO, A. thalianaalternative oxidase cDNA, and vector alone. The transformants were allowed to grow for 48 h on an LB plate. Appearance of colonies within 48–72 h were considered as growth. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. To evaluate these mutations further, growth of the transformants in liquid medium was measured at A 600. As shown in Fig. 2 mutations at H165A, E214A, E266A, and H269L in TAO reduce the growth of the E. coli heme mutant to the level of the growth of the same E. coli strain transformed or with vector containing no insert. However, cells transformed with mutants V205A, L243A, C261A, and V271A supported to 70–80% the growth of the E. coli heme mutant compared with the cells transformed with wild type TAO. The ability of the wild type TAO to complement theE. coli heme mutants corroborates the presence of SHAM-sensitive respiration conferred by TAO in these auxotrophs that normally do not exhibit any SHAM-sensitive respiration. Thus, to study the effect of different mutations on TAO function, we compared the SHAM-sensitive respiration of the E. coli cells transformed with the two groups of mutations. E. coli auxotroph GE1387 transformed with TAO mutants V205A, L243A, C261A, and V271A grown in LB/ampicillin broth without supplementation of the 5-aminolevulinic acid. The respiration of these transformants grown in this ampicillin broth was about 70–80% SHAM-sensitive. Cells transformed with the wild type TAO were 100% sensitive to SHAM (TableII). Mutations of glutamate and histidines residues H165A, E214A, E266A, and H269L (EXXH motif mutations) did not rescue the E. coli heme mutants in media deficient in 5-aminolevulinic acid.Table IIRespiration assay of the heme-deficient E. coli GE1387StrainsInhibition by SHAM%E. coli GE1387 containing pTAO100E. coli GE1387 without plasmid0Mutations of the non-conserved residuesE. coli GE1387 containing pTAO V205A79(±1)E. coli GE1387 containing pTAO I218H70(±3)E. coli GE1387 containing pTAO L243A74(±2)E. coli GE1387 containing pTAO C261A78(±3)E. coli GE1387 containing pTAO V271A74(±1) Open table in a new tab To determine whether these TAO mutants also confer SHAM-sensitive respiration to bacteria, we transformed the normal E. colicells that have the standard cytochrome system and cyanide-sensitive respiration with mutated or wild type TAO. Respiration of these transformants grown with or without IPTG was assessed in the presence or absence of cyanide, SHAM, or in the presence of both respiratory inhibitors. In E. coli transformed with wild type TAO but not induced with IPTG, 90% of the observed respiration was KCN-sensitive. However, when grown in the presence of IPTG, 45% of the respiration of these transformants was KCN-sensitive, and the residual KCN-resistant respiration of these cells was inhibited by SHAM (TableIII). These observations demonstrate that detection of the SHAM-sensitive, KCN-resistant respiration of the cells transformed with TAO mutants or wild type TAO is correlated with the ability of the TAO polypeptide to confer SHAM-sensitive respiration. The kinetics of the respiration of the E. coli transformants containing mutations within the putative EXXH motifs (H165A, E214A, E266A, and H269L) was similar to those of the wild type E. coli cells without plasmid or E. coli cells containing wild type TAO but without IPTG. These mutations completely abolished the ability of TAO to promote SHAM-sensitive respiration in the heme mutant. On the other hand, the respiration of the E. colitransformants containing V205A, L243A, C261A, and V271A located outside of the proposed active site was inhibited 65% by KCN and about 90% by the combination of KCN and SHAM. Therefore, E. coli cells expressing wild type TAO showed about 55% KCN-resistant/SHAM-sensitive respiration. This respiration was reduced to 35% by mutations at V205A, L243A, C261A, and V271A (non-EXXH motif) and was absent in mutations H165A, E214A, E266A, and H269L (EXXH motifs).Table IIIRespiration assay of the transformed M15 E. coliM15 with or without plasmidInhibition of respiration by KCNInhibition of respiration by KCN + SHAM%No plasmid100100pTAO (uninduced)82 ± 4100pTAO (induced)45 ± 5100M15 containing TAO mutationsV205A55 ± 6100I218H68 ± 3100L243A55 ± 5100C261A65 ± 1100V271A63 ± 3100H165A84 ± 4100E214A90 ± 3100E266A83 ± 3100H269L84 ± 3100Transformed E. coli cells were grown in appropriate medium. Cells were harvested, and the oxygen consumption of the whole cells was measured by Instech O2 electrode as described under “Experimental Procedures.” KCN (1.0 mm) and SHAM (2.0 mm) were used to inhibit the respiration via cytochrome and alternative oxidase, respectively. Results are the mean of three independent experiments, and the standard deviations are represented. Open table in a new tab Transformed E. coli cells were grown in appropriate medium. Cells were harvested, and the oxygen consumption of the whole cells was measured by Instech O2 electrode as described under “Experimental Procedures.” KCN (1.0 mm) and SHAM (2.0 mm) were used to inhibit the respiration via cytochrome and alternative oxidase, respectively. Results are the mean of three independent experiments, and the standard deviations are represented. To analyze whether mutations of TAO have any effect on expression or stability of TAO protein, we measured the steady state level of TAO protein in all E. coli transformants by using immunoblot analysis. Fig. 3 shows that the 35-kDa recombinant TAO protein was expressed in equal amounts in all E. coli cells transformed with wild type TAO and TAO mutants. Coomassie Blue staining of the duplicate gel showed equal loading of the protein. This suggests that mutation of these residues probably has no effect on the level of expression of TAO protein. However, as detected by monoclonal antibody, the size of the protein inE. coli transformed with a TAO mutant C261A was 28 kDa, probably due to truncation of one end of the protein (Fig. 3). To demonstrate that iron is needed for the functional activity of TAO, E. coli cells containing wild type TAO were grown in the presence and absence of iron, and KCN-resistant/SHAM-sensitive respiration was measured to assess the activity of TAO. The level of the expressed protein was measured by immunoblots. When OP was added to chelate the metal ions at the time of induction of TAO expression by IPTG, no SHAM-sensitive/KCN-resistant respiration was observed (Fig.4 A). However, the simultaneous addition of excess iron with OP restored the SHAM-sensitive/KCN-resistant respiration of the E. coli as conferred by the wild type TAO to 90% (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, we have found that the activity of the expressed TAO in E. coli was not restored when equal amounts of Cu2+ (Fig.4 A) or other metal ions (e.g. Zn2+and Mn2+) (not shown) were added in the medium with OP. The level of the expressed protein remained unaltered in all cases as revealed by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody against TAO as the probe (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, iron is essential for the activity of this enzyme. TAO is the only terminal oxidase of the bloodstream form ofT. brucei, an obligate aerobic parasitic protozoa (4Helfert S. Estevez A.M. Bakker B. Michels P. Clayton C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, TAO is probably essential for the parasite survival and an important chemotherapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis. From the similarities of the predicted primary and the secondary structure of TAO and other similar SHAM-sensitive, KCN-insensitive plant and fungi AOXs with known diiron proteins, it has been speculated that the active site structure of this class of oxidases consists of a bimolecular iron center (9Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, neither the native nor the recombinant alternative oxidase protein from any system has yet been purified; similarly, no characteristic spectral evidence has been identified. Thus, to understand the active site structure of this enzyme, we have investigated the effect of mutations of different amino acid residues within the proposed active site on the structural and functional properties of this enzyme. We have previously shown that Glu-215 in TAO is essential for its functional activity (15Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we extend our site-directed mutagenesis studies for several other conserved and non-conserved residues within the proposed active site of TAO. Results revealed that the proposed iron ligands His-165, Glu-214, Glu-266, and His-269 are essential for TAO function. Moreover, it has been found that the presence of iron, Fe2+ in the medium is required for the functional activity of the recombinant TAO. These results provide evidence that TAO is possibly a diiron protein. The effect of mutations on TAO functional activity was analyzed using the heme mutant of E. coli, which is devoid of a functional cytochrome system and a 5-aminolevulinic acid auxotroph. Kumar and Soll (23Kumar A.M. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that complementation of the E. coliheme mutants with A. thaliana alternative oxidase permits aerobic growth. TAO was demonstrated to complement the heme mutant ofE. coli and confer the unique SHAM-sensitive respiration to bacteria (5Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This strain of E. coli has also been used for the selection of AOX mutants of A. thaliana AOX that are resistant to SHAM (24Meunier B. Madgwick S.A. Reil E. Oettmeier W. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of these heme mutants to express a functional alternative oxidase and to sustain growth and respiration in the absence of 5-aminolevulinic acid was utilized to measure the effect of mutations of different amino acid residues in TAO. In our studies, mutation of the amino acid residues His-165, Glu-214, and Glu-266 to alanine and that of His-269 to leucine drastically reduces the complementation ability of TAO to E. coli heme mutants. These residues are highly conserved among all AOXs characterized to date. Glu-266 and His-269 are in the second EXXH motif in the active site models of AOXs recently proposed by Andersson and Nordlund (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as well as the model proposed previously by Seidow et al. (9Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to the Nordlund model, Glu-266 residue is the proposed bidentate ligand of iron in helix 4 of the four-helical bundle of the diiron structure (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). His-165 is located in the first EXXH motif, and it is also one of the proposed iron ligands of this model (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Glu-214 is in the conserved LEEEA region of AOXs and is centrally located in the protein. Results of complementation for these four TAO mutants suggest that these residues are essential for TAO function. For further characterization of the effect of the mutations, these mutated forms of TAO were expressed in E. coli that possesses the normal cytochrome system. The SHAM-sensitive respiration of the transfectants conferred by TAO was measured after inhibition of the cytochrome-mediated oxygen consumption by KCN (1.0 mm). This TAO-dependent SHAM-sensitive respiration can be distinguished from any cytochrome bo activity inE. coli that is SHAM- and KCN-sensitive by the amount of inhibitor used in the inhibition studies (24Meunier B. Madgwick S.A. Reil E. Oettmeier W. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, sensitivity to SHAM coupled with resistance to cyanide has been considered to be the functional definition of AOXs (5Chaudhuri M. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Sakajo S. Minagawa N. Komiyama T. Yoshimoto A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Kumar A.M. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). E. coli cells expressing wild type TAO showed 45–55% of the respiration cyanide-resistant and SHAM-sensitive. In contrast, the mutated versions of TAO did not produce any SHAM-sensitive respiration, and the cells acted similarly to the wild type E. coli cells and respired by cyanide-sensitive pathway. These results provide strong evidence that His-165, Glu-214, Glu-266, and His-269 are essential for TAO activity. The LEEEA region has also been found to be highly conserved in all AOXs including TAO. From the primary sequence alignment of theA. thaliana IMMUTANS (Im), which is a plastid enzyme distantly related to AOXs, Berthold et al. (17Berthold D.A. Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) postulated that the first Glu of the LEEEA region (Glu-213 in TAO) is possibly involved in the binding of iron. Currently, it is not possible to conclude which of the three Glus is the true ligand of iron. Previously, we have mutated the last Glu (Glu-215 in TAO) to Ala, Leu, Asn, Gln, Asp, and His and assessed the effect of these mutations on TAO function (15Chaudhuri M. Ajayi W. Hill G.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that mutation of Glu-215 to Ala, Leu, Asn, and Gln results in the loss of the complementation ability of TAO to heme mutants of E. coli. The conservative substitution of Glu-215 to Asp and His reduced the growth of the E. coli auxotrophs by ∼80%. Thus, Glu-215 is essential for the activity of TAO. This residue has also been mutated to asparagine in S. guttatum AOX, and the protein was expressed inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, which does not have alternative oxidase activity (19Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the mutation produces a non-functional but properly targeted protein to the mitochondria, which also verifies the essentiality of this glutamate for the functional activity of AOX (19Albury M.S. Affourtit C. Moore A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30301-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we have further mutated E214A, the second glutamate of the LEEEA region and have found that this mutation drastically reduces the functional complementation ability as well as the ability to confer SHAM-sensitive respiration to the bacteria by TAO. Thus, this provides additional evidence that Glu-214 is also essential for the functional property of TAO. At the present time, we cannot tell from our experiments whether Glu-214 or Glu-215 could be the residue needed for iron binding. However, it is most likely that the conservation of the amino acid residues of this region is essential for maintenance of the structural integrity of the active site of TAO. Berthold (25Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the effect of mutation of Phe-215 and Met-218 inA. thaliana alternative oxidase, which are at 7 and 3 amino acids apart from the LEEEA region, respectively, showed partial resistance to SHAM. From this observation Berthold (25Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) speculated that these residues are possibly involved in SHAM binding as well as for quinone binding because SHAM is thought to be the competitive inhibitor of AOXs. Therefore, it could be anticipated that any alteration of this LEEEA region could possibly hinder the substrate binding or substrate accessibility to the active site. In the first proposed model of the active site of AOX by Siedowet al. (9Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Moore A.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), one of the two iron-binding motifs (EXXH) is located in this LEEEA region. In TAO, this region involves residues 215–218. His in this position is not conserved in all AOXs. In TAO and soybean AOX3, this residue is Ile; in H. anomola and Oryza sativa this is Ser, and inChlamydomonas species this residue is Lys (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To investigate whether His in this position has any effect on enzyme function, we have mutated Ile-218 in TAO to His. Our results demonstrated that I218H mutation did not show any marked difference in the functional complementation to E. coli heme mutant. However, the ability of this mutated version of TAO to confer cyanide-resistant, SHAM-sensitive respiration to E. coli was reduced about 20% in comparison to the wild type TAO. Because all the conserved amino acid residues within the proposed active site of TAO we tested showed dramatic reduction in the functional complementation ability, we wanted to test the effect of mutation of some non-conserved residues within this region on TAO function. These included amino acid residues Val-205, located in the interconnecting region between helices 2 and 3, Leu-243 present in the interconnecting region between helices 3 and 4, and Cys-261 and Val-271 in helix 4 in the four-helix model proposed by Nordlund et al. (16Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which were all mutated individually to Ala. Mutation of these four residues individually to Ala restored the functional complementation ability of TAO to E. coli heme mutants. The ability to confer SHAM-sensitive respiration to bacteria was reduced about 15–20% in comparison to wild type TAO. Mutation of V205A showed the least effect. All these results suggest that these regions, which consist of mostly conserved residues, are important for AOX function. Mutational analysis of many other conserved and non-conserved amino acid residues in this region and their effect on TAO function is needed for elucidation of the TAO active site structure. The level of expression of all mutated versions and of wild type TAO inE. coli was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using TAO monoclonal antibody as the probe. Results showed that none of the mutations have any effect on protein expression or the stability of the expressed protein in this system. The only variation has been found for mutation C261A, from which a truncated version of TAO protein (28 kDa) was detected on the immunoblot. The remarkable feature of the diiron protein like ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 is the stability of its three-dimensional fold (11Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The crystal structure analysis of several mutant forms of R2 protein revealed that metal contributes very little to the protein fold or the protein stability (10Logan D.T. Su X.D. Aberg A. Regnstrom K. Hajduk J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J. Loehr J.S. Sahlin M. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This could possibly explain our observation that mutation of several proposed iron ligands in TAO causes total loss of functional activity, whereas the amount of the expressed proteins remained unaltered. C261A mutation in TAO could have possibly altered the protein fold, and as a result, the protein was truncated from one end. However, this cleavage did not affect the functional property of TAO. Finally, to understand whether iron is needed for TAO functional activity, we expressed the recombinant TAO in E. coli from an inducible expression vector. ortho-Phenanthroline, a metal chelator, was added at the time of induction for the expression of the recombinant protein. Results showed that the amount of protein expression remained almost unaffected in comparison to the cells where OP was not added to the medium. However, the ability of the TAO to confer SHAM-sensitive respiration was reduced about 90–95%. Moreover, the effect of ortho-phenanthroline could be completely negated by addition of excess ferrous iron but not by any other metal ions such as CuSO4. These findings strongly suggest the necessity of iron for the activity of TAO. These results suggest that TAO is a diiron protein. The structure-function analysis of several other conserved and unique amino acid residues in TAO, purification of the recombinant protein, Mossbauer spectroscopic analysis, and crystal structure determination of this important enzyme will certainly be helpful to confirm the active site structure and hopefully to design successful drugs for African trypanosomiasis.

Previously, we identified SH2-Bβ as a potent activator of JAK2 (Rui, L., and Carter-Su, C. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 7172–7177). Here, we investigated whether the activation of JAK2 by SH2-Bβ is specific to JAK2 and SH2-Bβ or extends to other JAKs or other members of the SH2-Bβ family. When SH2-Bβ was overexpressed with JAK1 or JAK3, SH2-Bβ failed to increase their activity. However, SH2-Bβ bound to both and was tyrosyl-phosphorylated by JAK1. In contrast to SH2-Bβ, APS decreased tyrosyl phosphorylation of GH-stimulated JAK2 as well as Stat5B, a substrate of JAK2. APS also decreased tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1, but did not affect the activity or tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK3. Overexpressed APS bound to and was tyrosyl-phosphorylated by all three JAKs. Consistent with these data, in 3T3-F442A adipocytes, endogenous APS was tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to GH and interferon-γ. These results suggest that 1) SH2-Bβ specifically activates JAK2, 2) APS negatively regulates both JAK2 and JAK1, and 3) both SH2-Bβ and APS may serve as adapter proteins for all three JAKs independent of any role they have in JAK activity.

This family of receptors consists of more than 20 different proteins that are known to bind to at least 25 different ligands, including growth hormone (GH), prolactin, leptin, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, and most interleukins (1Ihle J.N.

Oxford University Press, New York1999: 445-480Google Scholar). Of these 25 ligands, more than two-thirds activate JAK2. JAK1 and Tyk2, like JAK2, are ubiquitously expressed and, in general, are activated by a similar, although more limited set of ligands compared with JAK2. In contrast, JAK3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is activated by a different set of ligands, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-7, which are not potent activators of JAK2 (2Smit L.S.

Mice deficient in JAK2 die by day 12 of embryogenesis from a lack of erythropoiesis (4Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S.

In contrast to JAK1- or JAK2-deficient mice, JAK3 knockout mice survive and develop normally in pathogen-free conditions. However, these mice exhibit severe defects in lymphoid development (7Nosaka T. van Deursen J.M. Tripp R.A. Thierfelder W.E. Witthuhn B.A. McMickle A.P. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N.

Upon ligand binding to cytokine receptors, JAKs phosphorylate themselves and their associated receptors, thereby providing multiple binding sites for signaling proteins containing SH2 or other phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Signaling proteins that bind to receptor·JAK complexes and undergo tyrosyl phosphorylation include STATs (13Darnell Jr., J.E.

Although activation of JAKs by cytokine receptor ligands is generally rapid and transient, constitutive activation of JAKs has been observed in a variety of cancers, indicating that regulation of JAKs is critical for controlling cell growth and proliferation. For example, leukemic cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (18Lacronique V. Boureux A. Valle V.D. Poirel H. Quang C.T. Mauchauffe M. Berthou C. Lessard M. Berger R. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Science. 1997; 278: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) were shown to have constitutively active JAK2, and specific inhibition of JAK2 in cells derived from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient blocked cell growth by inducing apoptosis (19Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Similarly, JAK1 and JAK3 were found to be constitutively active in cells from patients suffering from adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by human T cell leukemia/lymphotrophic virus type I (20Takemoto S. Mulloy J.C. Cereseto A. Migone T.S. Patel B.K. Matsuoka M. Yamaguchi K. Takatsuki K. Kamihira S. White J.D. Leonard W.J. Waldmann T. Franchini G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, specific inhibition of JAKs inhibits the growth of multiple breast cancer cell lines and induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (21Garcia R. Bowman T.L. Niu G. Yu H. Minton S. Muro-Cacho C.A. Cox C.E. Falcone R. Fairclough R. Parsons S. Laudano A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kraker A. Jove R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2499-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The critical role of JAKs in so many normal physiological responses and their potential role in some cancers make it vitally important to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which JAKs are regulated. Recently, our laboratory identified the SH2 domain-containing protein SH2-Bβ (22Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a potent activator of JAK2 (23Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Addition of GH stimulates the phosphorylation of JAK2, leading to the association of SH2-Bβ via its SH2 domain to one or more phosphorylated tyrosines in JAK2. This latter interaction substantially activates JAK2, thereby increasing the phosphorylation of JAK2 as well as of downstream targets of JAK2 such as Stat5B (23Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SH2-B is a member of a family of adapter proteins, which also includes APS and Lnk (24Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P.

The various isoforms of SH2-B (α, β, γ, and δ) also contain at least three proline-rich regions (22Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell.

Although we have shown SH2-Bβ to be a positive regulator of JAK2 (23Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), studies by others suggest that APS and Lnk may be negative regulators of some signaling pathways. Lnk has been shown to play a pivotal role in the regulation of B cell production, as Lnk knockout mice show overproduction of pre-B cells in the spleen and pro-B cells in bone marrow (29Takaki S. Sauer K. Iritani B.M. Chien S. Ebihara Y. Tsuji K. Takatsu K. Perlmutter R.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Overexpression of APS suppresses proliferation of NIH-3T3 cells as stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (30Yokouchi M. Wakioka T. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Ohtsuka S. Sasaki A. Ohtsubo M. Valius M. Inoue A. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To date, the effects of APS and Lnk on the kinase activity and tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAKs have not been examined. Furthermore, SH2-Bβ has not been examined as a regulator of JAKs other than JAK2. Because of the importance of the cytokine receptor family of ligands and the remarkable ability of SH2-Bβ to activate JAK2, we examined whether the activating ability of SH2-Bβ is specific to JAK2 or extends to other members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. We also examined whether the ability of SH2-Bβ to activate JAK2 is shared by APS. Finally, we examined whether SH2-Bβ or APS binds to JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3 and/or is tyrosyl-phosphorylated by any of these JAKs, thereby implicating SH2-Bβ or APS as a signaling molecule for these JAKs.

COS-7, 293T, and 3T3-F442A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin (supplemented DMEM), and 10% fetal calf serum (COS-7 cells) or 8% calf serum (293T and 3T3-F442A cells). Cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were assayed 36–48 h after transfection. Before stimulating transfected cells with hormone, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and treated with ligands at 37 °C. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were differentiated to adipocytes by treating confluent cells for 48 h with 2 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, and 10% fetal calf serum in supplemented DMEM for 48 h. Cells were treated for an additional 48 h with supplemented DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml insulin (42Sumantran V.N. Tsai M.L. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2016-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were maintained in supplemented DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum. Before assays, cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and treated with ligands at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described (43Rui L. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thirty (293T cells) to 48 (COS-7 cells) h after transfection, cells were rinsed three times with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell lysate) was incubated with the indicated antibody on ice for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose (14-μl packed volume) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mmEGTA) and boiled for 5 min in a 80:20 mixture of lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 5–12% gradient), followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibody and visualization with the ECL detection system. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (43Rui L. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). JAKs were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate αJAK using protein A-agarose. Bound proteins were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitates were washed once with 500 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 10 mm EDTA, followed by three washes with 500 μl of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in a 4:1 mixture of lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 5–12% gradient), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by autoradiography, followed by immunoblotting with the appropriate αJAK. We have shown previously that SH2-Bβ is a potent activator of JAK2 (23Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine whether the activation of JAK2 by SH2-Bβ is specific to JAK2 or shared by other members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases, we examined whether SH2-Bβ could also activate JAK1. Like JAK2, JAK1 is widely expressed and is activated by an overlapping set of ligands, including GH, leukemia inhibitory factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (2Smit L.S. Meyer D.J. Argetsinger L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Kostyo J.L. Handbook of Physiology. V. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 445-480Google Scholar). We also examined whether SH2-Bβ could activate JAK3, which is activated by ligands that are not potent activators of JAK2 such as IL-7 (3Aringer M. Cheng A. Nelson J.W. Chen M. Sudarshan C. Zhou Y.J. O'Shea J.J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Initially, we assessed the kinase activity of JAK3 using an in vitro kinase assay. For comparison, the experiment was performed concurrently with JAK2. cDNA encoding the appropriate JAK was transfected alone or with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged SH2-Bβ in COS-7 cells. The expressed JAK was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate αJAK and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose.32P-Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and the amount of immunoprecipitated JAK was determined by immunoblotting with the appropriate αJAK. As reported previously (23Rui L. Carter-Su C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), JAK2 was constitutively active when overexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 1,upper panel). Furthermore, its in vitro kinase activity was substantially increased by the coexpression of SH2-Bβ (lane 2, upper panel). JAK3 was also constitutively active when overexpressed in COS-7 cells (lane 3, upper panel). However, in contrast to JAK2, JAK3 was not activated by coexpression with SH2-Bβ (lane 4,upper panel). Similar results were obtained when JAK2 and JAK3 were expressed in 293T cells (data not shown). We next examined the ability of SH2-Bβ to increase the in vitro kinase activity of JAK1. cDNA encoding JAK1 (or JAK2 for comparison) was transfected into 293T cells alone or with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged SH2-Bβ. 293T cells were used to overexpress JAK1 because we had difficulty overexpressing JAK1 in COS-7 cells. Kinase assays with JAK1 were performed with [γ-32P]ATP as described for JAK3. However, JAK1 incorporated only a small amount of [γ-32P]ATP in vitro compared with JAK2 and JAK3, raising the possibility that our anti-JAK1 antibodies interfere with the in vitro kinase assay. We therefore probed JAK1 (and JAK2) with αPY to examine the effects of overexpressed SH2-Bβ on the tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1 (and JAK2). The tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAKs is thought to reflect their autophosphorylation. SH2-Bβ increased the tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2, upper panel) consistent with increased activity of JAK2. However, SH2-Bβ had no reproducible effect on the tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK1 (lane 4, upper panel), suggesting that SH2-Bβ has no effect on the activity of JAK1. SH2-Bβ binds to JAK2 (Fig. 3 A) as assessed by coprecipitation experiments using overexpressed or endogenous JAK2 and SH2-Bβ (22Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that overexpressed JAK2 tyrosyl-phosphorylates overexpressed SH2-Bβ both in vivoand in vitro and that endogenous SH2-Bβ is phosphorylated on tyrosines in 3T3-F442A cells in response to GH and IFN-γ, two ligands that activate JAK2 (22Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tyrosyl phosphorylation suggests that SH2-Bβ may also function as an adapter protein for ligands that activate JAK2 by recruiting proteins that bind phosphotyrosines to JAK2·SH2-Bβ complexes. To determine whether SH2-Bβ might also serve as a signaling protein for ligands that activate JAK1 and JAK3, even though SH2-Bβ does not appear to activate these JAKs, we examined whether either JAK1 or JAK3 associates with and/or phosphorylates SH2-Bβ. Myc-tagged SH2-Bβ was transiently overexpressed with JAK1 or JAK2 in 293T cells or with JAK3 in COS-7 cells. Myc-SH2-Bβ was immunoprecipitated with αMyc, and precipitated proteins were blotted with the appropriate αJAK. As reported previously (22Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SH2-Bβ coprecipitated with JAK2 (Fig.3 A, lane 2, upper panel). It also coprecipitated with JAK1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 2,upper panel) 2In Fig. 2 B, murine JAK1 cDNA with a C-terminal Myc tag (provided by Dr. R. D. Schreiber) was used. In Fig. 3 B, murine JAK1 cDNA lacking a Myc tag (provided by Drs. X. Yang and C. L. Cepko) was used to avoid directly precipitating JAK1 with αMyc. The bottom band obtained using the latter cDNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 2, upper panel; and lane 4) is thought to represent either a degradation product of JAK1 or a truncated form of JAK1 due to a second transcriptional start site encoded in the cDNA. and JAK3 (Fig. 3 C, lane 2, upper panel), suggesting that SH2-Bβ forms a complex with all three of these JAKs. To determine whether SH2-Bβ is tyrosyl-phosphorylated when overexpressed with JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3, the blots were reprobed with αPY. As shown in Fig. 3 A (lane 4), SH2-Bβ was strongly phosphorylated on tyrosines when coexpressed with JAK2. Interestingly, although SH2-Bβ did not seem to stimulate JAK1, SH2-Bβ was phosphorylated on tyrosines in cells overexpressing JAK1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). No phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was detected when cells were transfected with SH2-Bβ alone (data not shown), as reported previously (22Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with SH2-Bβ being phosphorylated on tyrosines by JAK1. In contrast, no tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ was detected in cells overexpressing JAK3 (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). Thus, the ability of SH2-Bβ to activate appears to be specific to JAK2. However, SH2-Bβ appears to bind to both JAK1 and JAK3 and to serve as a substrate of JAK1. These data suggest that SH2-Bβ may serve as an adapter protein for ligands that activate JAK1 as well as for ligands that activate JAK2 via binding of signaling molecules to phosphorylated tyrosines in SH2-Bβ and possibly to other binding motifs within SH2-Bβ. Although signaling proteins that bind preferentially to phosphorylated tyrosines would not be expected to be recruited to SH2-Bβ complexed to JAK3, SH2-Bβ may still serve as a signaling molecule for ligands that activate JAK3 by recruiting molecules that bind other motifs (e.g. pleckstrin homology and proline-rich regions) within SH2-Bβ to JAK3·SH2-Bβ complexes. Because SH2-Bβ activates some but not all JAKs and is tyro"

(1999) Glycobiology9, 1023–1027). In this study, we investigated the structure and binding of ChS-E oligosaccharides. Eleven oligosaccharides were isolated from ChS-E by gel filtration chromatography and anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography after hydrolysis with testicular hyaluronidase. Separately, seven oligosaccharides were custom synthesized using the transglycosylation reaction of testicular hyaluronidase. Structural analysis was performed by enzymatic digestions in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This library of 18 oligosaccharides was used as a source of model molecules to clarify the structural requirements for binding to type V collagen. Binding was analyzed by a biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance. The results indicated that to bind to type V collagen the oligosaccharides must have the following carbohydrate structures: 1) octasaccharide or larger in size; 2) a continuous sequence of three GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) units; 3) a GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S) unit or GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6S) unit at the reducing terminal; 4) a GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S) unit at the nonreducing terminal.

It is known that its carbohydrate chain, chondroitin sulfate (ChS),1 has various important biological activities in areas such as cell migration, recognition, and morphogenesis (1Poole A.R. Biochem.

Recently, greater attention has been directed toward the functions of ChS in the brain, optic nerves, and chondrocytes (6Tsuchida K. Shioi J. Yamada S. Boghosian G. Wu A. Cai H. Sugahara K.

ChS has many types of structural domains that are known to participate in specific physiological functions. However, the relationship between the biological function and structure of ChS domains is not yet fully understood. Recently, we used a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor to investigate the interaction of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with collagens and glycoproteins from the extracellular matrix (9Munakata H. Takagaki K. Majima M. Endo M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was found that chondroitin sulfate E (ChS-E) has specific affinity for type V collagen, and that a novel characteristic sequence included in ChS-E is probably involved in binding to type V collagen. ChS-E from squid cartilage consists mainly of the disaccharide units GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S), GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6S), and GlcAβ1–3GalNAc, where 4S and 6S represent 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively (10Suzuki S.

Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, since ChS-E has a variety of structures, it is likely that some specific feature of its structure is necessary for binding to type V collagen. However, the structural features within ChS-E that bind to type V collagen remain unclear. In the present work, we have prepared various oligosaccharides by testicular hyaluronidase digestion of squid cartilage ChS-E. However, not all of the expected oligosaccharides were obtained. Recently, the transglycosylation mechanism of testicular hyaluronidase, which is an endo-β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, has been investigated with the aim of performing enzymatic synthesis of GAG oligosaccharides (12Takagaki K.

Using this enzymatic reconstruction system, it was possible to custom synthesize chimeric GAG oligosaccharides with sequences of nonsulfated and monosulfated disaccharide units, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc, GlcAβ1–3GlcNAc, IdoAα1–3GalNAc, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc4S, and GlcAβ1–3GalNAc6S. Here, we newly synthesized various chimeric oligosaccharides with disulfated disaccharide units, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), at the internal position of the sugar chain and used them as model molecules to define the structural requirements needed to bind to type V collagen.

(Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Chimeric oligosaccharides were synthesized using the transglycosylation reaction of testicular hyaluronidase as described previously (22Takagaki K. Munakata H. Majima M. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Takagaki K. Munakata H. Kakizaki I. Majima M. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A typical transglycosylation reaction was carried out as follows. Briefly, 50 μg of one GAG (HA, Ch, Ch4S, Ch6S, or desulfated DS) as the donor, 20 nmol of a PA-oligosaccharide as the acceptor, and 5 units of testicular hyaluronidase dissolved in 50 μg of 0.15 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by immersion in a boiling water bath at 100 °C for 3 min. The resulting product was purified by HPLC, and its structure was confirmed by a method described previously (9Munakata H. Takagaki K. Majima M. Endo M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Suzuki S. Saito H. Yamagata T. Anno K. Seno N. Kawai Y. Furuhashi T J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using systematic combinations of the donor and acceptor molecules, we prepared many chimeric type GAG oligosaccharides consisting of different combinations of disaccharide units (22Takagaki K. Munakata H. Majima M. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,23Takagaki K. Munakata H. Kakizaki I. Majima M. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A high-performance liquid chromatograph (Hitachi L-6200, Hitachi) connected to a fluorescence detector (Hitachi F-1050) or a UV detector (Hitachi L-4200) was used. Fractionation of oligosaccharides derived from ChS-E was carried out with a Polyamine-II column (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC Co., Tokyo, Japan) using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 1000 mm over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 30 °C. The eluate was monitored by absorbance at 210 nm. Analysis of disaccharides was carried out with the same column using the same linear gradient of NaH2PO4 at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 45 °C. Eluates containing unsaturated disaccharides were monitored by absorbance at 232 nm (11Yoshida K. Miyauchi S. Kikuchi H. Tawada A. Tokuyasu K. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,24Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Eluates containing PA-disaccharides were monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. Fractionation and analysis of PA-oligosaccharides were carried out with a PALPAK Type S column (4.6 × 250 mm; Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) under the following conditions. Solution A containing 3% acetic acid, adjusted to pH 7.0 with triethylamine, and acetonitrile at a ratio of 20:80, and solution B containing the same agents at a ratio of 50:50, were prepared. The column was equilibrated with solution A, and the ratio of solution B to solution A was increased linearly to 100% over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 30 °C. The eluates were monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. Mass spectra were obtained on an API-100 triple-quadruple mass spectrometer (PE SCIEX, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source, as described previously (18Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Takagaki K. Munakata H. Nakamura W. Matsuya H. Majima M. Endo M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved in 0.5 mm ammonium acetate-acetonitrile (50:50) and injected at 2 μl/min with a micro-HPLC syringe pump (Pump 22; Harvard Apparatus). In negative-ion mode, scanning was done from m/z0 to 700 during the 1-min scan (six cycles). Binding of oligosaccharides to type V collagen was determined using a BIA core 2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Binding reactions caused a change in the surface plasmon resonance, which was detected optically and measured in resonance units. Immobilization of type V collagen on the sensor surface via primary amine groups was performed as described previously (9Munakata H. Takagaki K. Majima M. Endo M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amounts of type V collagen immobilized onto the sensor surface were controlled at about 3000 resonance units by changing the injection time. All experiments were carried out at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. Oligosaccharides in the running buffer were injected onto the sensor surface. Association was monitored for 10 s followed by a dissociation phase. To correct for refractive index change and nonspecific binding, the responses obtained from the surface of albumin as a blank control were subtracted from the type V collagen surface data. All responses were expressed relative to this baseline. The oligosaccharides were digested with chondroitinase AC-II (0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0) (25Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chondroitinase ABC (0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) (25Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and β-glucuronidase (0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5) (26Himeno M. Hashiguchi Y. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hexuronic acid was determined by the carbazole-sulfuric acid method (27Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). A commercial preparation of squid cartilage ChS-E was digested with testicular hyaluronidase, and the digest was subjected to fractionation by gel filtration using a Bio-Gel P-4 column. The oligosaccharides were monitored for hexuronic acid (Fig. 1). In this study, the fractions I (Fractions I) and II (Fraction II) expected to contain octasaccharides and hexasaccharides, on the basis of previous chromatographic data (14Majima M. Takagaki K. Igarashi S. Nakamura T. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for Ch6S, were pooled and further purified by HPLC on a Polyamine-II column. They were then subfractionated into five oligosaccharides (numbers 1–5) (Fig.2 A) and two oligosaccharides (numbers 6 and 7) (Fig. 2 B), respectively, and subjected to structural analyses as described below. Ion-spray mass analyses of the oligosaccharides (numbers 1–7) derived from ChS-E in the negative ion mode defined their molecular weights, from which the composition and number of sulfate residues present in each fraction were inferred. Representative ion-spray mass spectra of oligosaccharides numbers 1 and 7 are shown in Fig. 3. In oligosaccharide number 1, multiply charged ions [M-6H]6−, [M-5H]5−, and [M-4H]4− at m/z334.8, 401.9, and 502.8, respectively, were revealed (Fig.3 A). The molecular weight of oligosaccharide number 1 was computed to be 2015.2 ± 0.6 based on the presence of these ions. The formula for calculating molecular weights from m/zvalues of multiply charged ions has been reported previously (18Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconjugate J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, oligosaccharide number 1 was presumed to be an octasaccharide with six sulfate residues. In oligosaccharide number 7, multiply charged ions [M-5H]5−, [M-4H]4−, and [M-3H]3− at m/z310.3, 388.0, and 517.6, respectively, were revealed (Fig.3 B). The molecular weight of oligosaccharide number 7 was computed to be 1556.3 ± 0.9. Therefore, oligosaccharide number 7 was presumed to be a hexasaccharide with five sulfate residues. The assignments of the multiply charged ions afforded by each of the oligosaccharides (numbers 1–7) are summarized in TableI.Table IIon-spray mass analysis of the seven oligosaccharides isolated from ChS-EOligosaccharide numberm/zMolecular weightAssignment[M-6H]6−[M-5H]5−[M-4H]4−[M-3H]3−1334.8401.9502.82015.2 ± 0.6(HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)62334.1401.5503.92015.2 ± 0.6(HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)63348.0419.4522.42094.9 ± 0.6(HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)74348.0418.7525.72094.6 ± 0.4(HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)75361.6433.3543.92176.5 ± 0.8(HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)86310.4388.1517.51556.0 ± 0.6(HexA)3(HexNAc)3(OSO3H)57310.3388.0517.61556.3 ± 0.9(HexA)3(HexNAc)3(OSO3H)5 Open table in a new tab The disaccharide composition of the ChS-E before hydrolysis into oligosaccharides was determined by digestion with chondroitinase ABC and AC-II in conjunction with HPLC (data not shown). As a result, the digestion of ChS-E gave four products, ΔDi-0S, ΔDi-4S, ΔDi-6S, and ΔDi-diSE, in a molar ratio of 5.9:22.9:9.6:61.5. It was shown that ChS-E contains the structural disaccharide units GlcAβ-3GalNAc, GlcA β1–3GalNAc(4S), GlcA β1–3GalNAc(6S), and GlcA β1–3GalNAc(4S,6S). Disaccharide analysis of each oligosaccharide was then performed. To investigate the sequential arrangement of the representative disaccharide units in each oligosaccharide, aliquots of the oligosaccharides were used in two separate experiments. The first aliquot of the oligosaccharides was digested with chondroitinase AC-II, and then labeled with the fluorescent reagent PA. PA-labeled unsaturated and saturated disaccharides were analyzed by HPLC and detected by PA fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. Chondroitinase AC-II, which is a bacterial eliminase, should degrade the oligosaccharide to a saturated disaccharide unit derived from the nonreducing terminal and a number of unsaturated disaccharide units derived from the internal region and the reducing terminal. The results are summarized as a composition analysis in Table II. The second aliquot was labeled with PA at the reducing terminal of the oligosaccharides, and then digested with chondroitinase AC-II. PA-labeled unsaturated disaccharide units derived from the reducing terminal were analyzed by HPLC. The results are summarized in TableIII. This procedure not only gives the disaccharide composition but also gives information about the sequential arrangement of disaccharide units in the oligosaccharides.Table IIDisaccharide composition analysis of the isolated oligosaccharidesOligosaccharide numberCompositionPA-Di-0SPA-Di-4SPA-Di-6SPA-Di-diSEPA-ΔDi-0SPA-ΔDi-4SPA-ΔDi-6SPA-ΔDi-diSE% molar proportion2-aPercent recoveries were calculated based on the peak area in HPLC and were expressed in molar proportions of the disaccharides produced by digestion.1ND2-bND, not detected.NDND21.72.44.550.321.12NDND1.123.220.27.34.343.93NDNDND26.00.38.520.644.64ND0.30.325.1ND18.44.451.55NDND0.923.9ND1.70.972.66NDND0.232.70.21.132.633.27ND0.10.134.30.324.57.932.8Each oligosaccharide was digested completely with chondroitinase AC-II, and then labeled with the fluorescent reagent, PA.

HPLC analysis of the chondroitinase AC-II digest of number 1 after derivatization with PA showed PA derivatives of Di-diSE, ΔDi-6S, and ΔDi-diSE in a molar ratio of 1.0:2.3:1.0 (Table II). We assume that the saturated disaccharide unit Di-diSE was derived from the nonreducing terminal. HPLC analysis of the chondroitinase AC-II digest of oligosaccharide number 1 labeled with PA before digestion showed ΔDi-6S (Table III), which was derived from the reducing terminal. The sequential arrangement of the remaining two disaccharide units was determined by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (28Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase ABC split the octasaccharide into one saturated disaccharide derived from the nonreducing terminal, one unsaturated disaccharide derived from the second disaccharide unit from the nonreducing terminal, and one unsaturated tetrasaccharide derived from the reducing terminal. The unsaturated disaccharide unit generated upon digestion with chondroitinase ABC was ΔDi-6S (data not shown), suggesting that the structure of the second disaccharide unit from the nonreducing terminal of number 1 was GlcA β1–3GalNAc(6S). Hence, the following structure is proposed for oligosaccharide number 1: GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(6S)-GlcAGalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(6S). The average molecular weight of oligosaccharide number 2 was 2015.2, which corresponded to an octasaccharide with six sulfate residues, (HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)6. HPLC analysis of the chondroitinase AC-II digest of number 2 after derivatization with PA showed PA derivatives of Di-diSE, ΔDi-0S, and ΔDi-diSE in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.9:1.9 (Table II). We assume that the saturated disaccharide unit Di-diSE was derived from the nonreducing terminal. HPLC analysis of the chondroitinase AC-II digest of oligosaccharide number 2 labeled with PA before digestion showed ΔDi-0S (Table III), which was derived from the reducing terminal. Therefore, the remaining two disaccharide units, ΔDi-diSE, were located in the internal region. Hence, the following structure is proposed for oligosaccharide number 2: GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcAGalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc. The average molecular weights of oligosaccharides 3 and 4 were 2094.9 and 2094.6, which corresponded to octasaccharides with seven sulfate residues, (HexA)4(HexNAc)4(OSO3H)7. HPLC analysis of the chondroitinase AC-II digests after derivatization with PA showed PA derivatives of Di-diSE, ΔDi-6S, and ΔDi-diSE in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.8:1.7 in number 3, and DidiSE, ΔDi-4S, and ΔDi-diSE in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.7:2.1 in number 4 (Table II). HPLC analysis of chondroitinase AC-II digests labeled with PA before digestion showed ΔDi-6S in number 3 and ΔDi-4S in number 4 (Table III). Hence, the following structures are proposed for oligosaccharides numbers 3 and 4: GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcAGalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(6S) and GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(4S,6S)-GlcA-GalNAc(4S), respectively. The average molecular weight of oligosaccharide number 5 was 2176.5, which corresponded to an octasaccharide with eight sulfated residues, (HexA)4(HexNA)4(OSO3H)8.

Mutations in the Btk gene lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency in mice. Using a co-transfection approach, we present evidence here that Btk interacts physically with caveolin-1, a 22-kDa integral membrane protein, which is the principal structural and regulatory component of caveolae membranes. In addition, we found that native Bmx, another member of the Tec family kinases, is associated with endogenous caveolin-1 in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Second, in transient transfection assays, expression of caveolin-1 leads to a substantial reduction in the in vivotyrosine phosphorylation of both Btk and its constitutively active form, E41K. Furthermore, a caveolin-1 scaffolding peptide (amino acids 82–101) functionally suppressed the autokinase activity of purified recombinant Btk protein. Third, we demonstrate that mouse splenic B-lymphocytes express substantial amounts of caveolin-1. Interestingly, caveolin-1 was found to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 in these cells.

Btk phosphorylation and activation in response to engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) by antigen is a dynamic process whereby a variety of proteins interact with each other and recruit signaling molecules, resulting in physiological responses such as B cell proliferation and antibody production. Several important players that participate in the intracellular downstream signaling of Btk have been identified in recent years (2Yang W.C. Collete Y. Nunes J.A. Olive D.

Resistance to detergents at 4 °C, a light buoyant density, and richness in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and lipid-anchored membrane proteins are some of the major characteristics of caveolae (14Anderson R.G.W.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Caveolin, a 22–24-kDa integral membrane protein composed of cytoplasmic N and C termini and a central intramembrane domain, is thought to be a major structural component of caveolae (21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar), but is also found in the cytoplasm (22Li W.P. Liu P. Pilcher B.K. Anderson G.W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-amino acid juxtamembrane region, also called the scaffolding domain, in the N-terminal region of the protein (residues 82–101) has been shown to mediate the association of caveolin with the bulk of relevant signaling molecules (23Couet J.

Among these are G-proteins (α and βγ subunits), Ha-Ras, Fyn, Erk-2, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, protein kinase C isoforms, insulin and Neu (c-ErbB2) receptors, and Src family tyrosine kinases (24Smith R.M.

Binding to caveolin through the scaffolding domain is sufficient for inhibition of the in vitro kinase activity of c-Src or maintenance of the inactive conformation of G-proteins (35Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Thus, it is envisaged that caveolin may function as a negative regulator for many signaling proteins. For insulin receptor signaling, however, caveolin has an activating function instead (36Nystrom F.H. Chen H. Cong L.-N. Li Y. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 12: 2013-2024Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of the Btk amino acid sequence shows the presence of a potential caveolin-binding motif between residues 581 and 588 (W X F XXXX W) in the catalytic domain. Thus, the functional significance of abona fide caveolin-binding motif in this family of tyrosine kinases warrants functional characterization, particularly with respect to its role in signal transduction. In the present study, therefore, we set out to investigate whether Btk is capable of interaction with caveolin-1. Our results demonstrate that caveolin-1 interacts with wild type Btk, as well as the constitutively active mutant E41K. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that this interaction leads to the down-regulation of the in vivotyrosine phosphorylation of Btk. Altogether, these data may shed some light on the molecular mechanism(s) of Btk regulation, activation, and signaling. The protease inhibitor mixture was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals in tablet form. All phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Btk rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies have been described previously (37Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Brandén L.J. Bäckesjö C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K.

Monoclonal anti-V5 horseradish peroxidase antibody was from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 and Bmx were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The nonionic detergent n-octyl glucoside was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1000 units of penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies). HUVECs were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Transfections were carried out using the FuGENE 6 Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Splenic B cells from CBA mice were enriched using a high gradient magnetic separation column (Miltenyi Biotec). The spleen cells, which had been stained with anti-B220 antibody-coupled micromagnetic particles (Miltenyi Biotec), were retained on the separation column under a high gradient magnetic field; these cells were subsequently eluted from the column. The purity of splenic B cells was examined by flow cytometric analysis following staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse anti-CD19 antibodies. The purity of the cells was >92%. Btk-GFP, GFP-ΔPH, R28CBtk-GFP, Y551F, and K430E constructs have been described previously (37Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Brandén L.J. Bäckesjö C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K.

The cDNA of native Btk as well as that of the E41K mutant were cloned into the expression vector pSGT usingNotI and XhoI restriction sites, as described previously (39Mattsson P.T. Lappalainen I.

The recombinant proteins for Btk (wild type) and its truncated form Btk ΔSH1, lacking the catalytic domain, were purified from Sf9 and Escherichia coli cells, respectively, as previously described (39Mattsson P.T. Lappalainen I. Bäckesjö C.M. Brockmann E. Laurén S. Vihinen M. Smith C.I.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4170-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (amino acids 82–101) termed peptide 1 (DGIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR) and a scrambled version of it, peptide 2 (WGIDKAFFTTSTVTYKWFRY), were purchased from Sigma Genesis Ltd. Cells were routinely analyzed 48 h after transfection. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside, 1 mm vanadate, 100 μm molybdate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml of extraction buffer)). The pre-cleared lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody, and the resulting immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Immune complexes were then captured by centrifugation, washed extensively in lysis buffer, and solubilized with 2× sample buffer before loading onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Whole cell lysates of COS-7 cells transiently expressing caveolin-1 and precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 μg of each recombinant Btk and BtkΔSH1 proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. A polyclonal antibody against caveolin-1 was then added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotating shaker to allow association of Btk protein and caveolin-1. The immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using a slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads, extensively washed, and, after resuspension in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitated Btk was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then incubated in blocking buffer (5% dried milk in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20), probed with specific antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immune complexes were detected using the Supersignal® West Femto Chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Pierce). 100 ng of purified recombinant Btk protein was incubated with the caveolin-1 scaffolding peptides using concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 μm in a standard kinase reaction buffer. Briefly, reactions were performed in a 20-μl kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 200 μm cold ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by addition of 8 μl of 4× sample buffer (37Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Brandén L.J. Bäckesjö C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HUVECs were seeded overnight at 60% confluence onto culture slides coated with human fibronectin (Becton Dickinson). The following day, cells were transfected with the Btk/GFP construct and grown additionally for 48 h. The cells were washed several times with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked for 2 h in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin-C (Aurion, The Netherlands) and 0.1% Tween. Following incubation with a polyclonal antibody against caveolin-1, the cells were washed and stained further with a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG before processing of the slides for immunofluorescence. For lipid raft visualization, rhodamine-conjugated cholera toxin B (CT-B) (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was used for labeling ganglioside GM1, as previously described (40Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Purified splenic B cells from CBA mice were washed in serum-free medium and attached to 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane-coated coverslips (Sigma). Lipid raft aggregation or patching was induced following CT-B labeling by incubating the cells with anti-CT-B antibody (1/250 in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp) for 30 min on ice. After an additional 20-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and decorated with anti-caveolin-1 antibody. As secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit was used. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed as previously described (37Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Brandén L.J. Bäckesjö C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of the Tec family kinases showing the conserved caveolin-binding motif were performed using a Macintosh version of the ClustalX program as previously described (3Nore B.F.

The multiple sequence alignments have been refined using SeqVu (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia). Segments of the sequence alignments were chosen and viewed using FreeHand software (Macromedia). Caveolin-binding motifs are present in most Gα subunits and the kinase domain of many families of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (Src family kinases, protein kinase Cα, MAP kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor) (20Sargiacomo M.

We find that Btk contains a potential candidate caveolin-binding motif (W X F XXXX W) within its catalytic domain (Fig.1 A). Sequence alignment among all Tec family kinases clearly indicates the presence of a highly conserved caveolin-binding motif (Fig. 1 B).

Open table in a new tab To determine the role of the caveolin-binding motif in protein-protein interactions, we set out to co-express Btk and caveolin-1 in COS-7 cells. Results from this experiment showed unequivocally that Btk interacts with caveolin-1 because immunoprecipitates of Btk contained caveolin-1, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A,top panel). Furthermore, co-expression of caveolin-1 and the constitutively active form of Btk, E41K, also leads to a strong association between these two proteins (Fig. 2 A, top panel). Although it may appear from Fig. 2 A as if the E41K mutant of Btk is less efficient in binding caveolin-1, in other experiments this difference was not apparent (data not shown). Antibodies directed against caveolin-1 were also able to successfully capture Btk from the same lysates, confirming that the two proteins are indeed physically associated in vivo (data not shown). In addition, this interaction is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Btk, because both Y551F and the K430E mutants could readily associate with caveolin-1 (data not shown). Tyr-551 is located in the kinase domain of Btk and corresponds to Tyr-416 in chicken Src. Furthermore, it is conserved among all cytoplasmic PTKs and is crucial for the kinase activity of these proteins. Lys-430, on the other hand, corresponds to an invariant lysine residue among PTKs, which participates in the catalytic process. In previous work, wild type Btk and the gain-of-function mutant, E41K, have been shown to efficiently translocate to the cell surface and localize predominantly in areas referred to as membrane ruffles or lamellipodia, structures known to be caused by robust actin polymerization (37Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Brandén L.J. Bäckesjö C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This finding is of great interest, because caveolin has also been reported to be focally enriched in regions located close to the plasma membrane (43Feng X. Gaeta M.L. Madge L.A. Yang J.H. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8341-8349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the kinase domain contains a well conserved caveolin-1 binding motif (see Fig. 1 B), we set out to investigate whether it may also be responsible for the association of Btk and caveolin-1. To address that problem, we designed a pull-down assay based on the ability of exogenous recombinant Btk and its kinase domain-deleted version (BtkΔSH1) to capture caveolin-1 from whole cell extracts of caveolin-1 transfected COS-7 cells. Using this approach, we demonstrate here that only the wild type Btk was able to specifically bind to caveolin-1 (Fig. 2 B). In stark contrast, BtkΔSH1 failed to associate with caveolin-1, indicating that the kinase domain mediates interaction of Btk and caveolin-1. To explore further whether other Tec family members can also interact with caveolin-1, we have employed primary HUVECs by virtue of their ability to express high levels of Bmx and caveolin-1 endogenously (Fig.3, A and B). Whole lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Bmx and detected with anti-caveolin-1 monoclonal antibodies. We demonstrate here that caveolin-1 is present in the anti-Bmx immune complex (Fig. 3 C), but not in the immune complex precipitated with an irrelevant antibody or a preimmune serum. These results are consistent with our earlier findings involving transiently transfected COS-7 cells co-expressing Btk and caveolin-1 (this work). Although Bmx has been implicated in a number of intracellular signaling pathways including cytokine, heterotrimeric G-protein and integrin receptors (4Smith C.I.E. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Mohamed A.J. Nore B.F. Vihinen M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 44Mano H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the functional significance of the interactions between Bmx and caveolin-1 may shed some light on the overall molecular mechanism(s) behind signaling pathways involving Tec family kinases. To determine whether Btk can also co-localize with caveolin-1 in intact cells and confirm our biochemical findings, we performed confocal microscopic analysis on HUVECs transfected with Btk-GFP. Because these cells are known to abundantly express caveolin-1, which according to the current study interacts spontaneously with the endogenous Tec family member Bmx, they should represent an excellent model system for studies that, in particular, address translocation and targeting of Tec family kinases into caveolae microdomains. Indeed, as shown in Fig.4 C, Btk was found to co-localize with caveolin-1 with a complete overlap at the leading edge of the cells, specifically in areas corresponding to membrane ruffles.

Although many chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to internalize through clathrin-coated vesicles, a process that involves the binding of arrestins to the receptors, accumulating evidence has suggested the possible existence of other regulators. In a yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal domain of CXCR2 as a bait, the Hsc70-interacting protein (Hip) was identified to interact with CXCR2. Hip binds CXCR2 through its C-terminal domain binding to the C-terminal leucine-rich domain (KILAIHGLI) of CXCR2. Hip associates with CXCR2 or CXCR4 in intact cells, and agonist stimulation increases the association. Mutation of the Ile-Leu motif in the C-terminal domain of CXCR2 blocks the agonist-dependent association of the mutant receptor with Hip. Overexpression of a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) deletion mutant form of Hip (ΔTPR), which is unable to bind Hsc70 (Prapapanich, V., Chen, S., Nair, S. C., Rimerman, R. A., and Smith, D. F. (1996) Mol. Endocrinol. 10, 420–431), but retains the ability to bind CXCR2, does not affect CXCR2-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. However, overexpression of ΔTPR significantly attenuates the agonist-induced internalization of CXCR2 and CXCR4 and attenuates CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis. These findings open the possibility for regulation of chemokine receptor signaling and trafficking by protein chaperone molecules.

Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Like other members of the GPCR superfamily, the ability of chemokine receptors to transmit signals may be rapidly attenuated. This attenuation of signaling is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, including phosphorylation-dependent desensitization and internalization (7Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V.

After receptor internalization, the receptor may be dephosphorylated in the internal vesicles, recycled back to the cell surface, and resensitized to subsequent exposure to the ligand (10Fan G.H.

The CCR5 antagonist aminooxypentane-RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) has been shown to induce a potent inhibition of HIV-1 entry into target cells. This inhibition proved to be a direct result of its ability to promote CCR5 internalization and to facilitate its recycling back to the plasma membrane without dissociation of the ligand, thereby preventing HIV binding to CCR5 (11Signoret N.

Despite being extensively studied, the mechanisms underlying the trafficking of chemokine receptors are still not fully understood. Recent studies demonstrated that many chemokine receptors internalize through clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV), a process that involves the binding of arrestins to the phosphorylated receptors (9Orsini M.J.

However, as revealed by the studies of other GPCRs, even though arrestins bind clathrin in vitro with high affinity (21Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), arrestins are not constitutively associated with clathrin-coated vesicles (22Goodman O.B., Jr. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that truncation of the C-terminal serine-rich domain in CXCR2, which blocked arrestin binding to the mutant receptor, did not prevent the receptor internalization in certain cell types (23Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similar phenomena have been observed with other chemokine receptors, e.g. CXCR4 (8Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), as well as other GPCRs, e.g. type A cholecystokinin receptor (24Pohl M. Silvente-Poirot S.

Although arrestins and dynamin appear to play an important role in phosphorylation-dependent sequestration of GPCRs, the phosphorylation-independent sequestration suggests that other potential regulators may exist in the internalization processes. Because the C-terminal domain of chemokine receptors has been demonstrated to play a key role in receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization (7Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we established a yeast-two hybrid system to screen the intracellular proteins that interact with the C-terminal domain of CXCR2, a chemokine receptor that mediates the migration of neutrophils to inflammatory sites in response to Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR)-expressing CXC chemokines (1Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar, 25Ben-Baruch A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified to be potentially involved in the receptor signaling and trafficking. In the present study, we demonstrate that Hsc70-interacting protein (Hip) associates with the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4, and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) deletion mutant form of Hip, which is unable to bind Hsc70 but continues to bind CXCR2, attenuates the receptor internalization and the receptor-mediated chemotaxis. Wild-type CXCR2 in pRC/CMV, and the C-terminal domain of CXCR2 in PAS2 or in pGEX-KG were constructed previously (10Fan G.H. Yang W. Sai J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16960-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The wild-type and the mutant forms of Hip in pcDNA3.1 were constructed by amplifying the fragments using PCR and inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites. Yeast two-hybrid techniques were performed as described previously (10Fan G.H. Yang W. Sai J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16960-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For screening cDNA libraries, the bait plasmid PAS2/CXCR2 tail was transformed into yeast strain Y190 (CLONTECH) using a lithium acetate protocol (CLONTECH manual). After confirming expression of the bait protein, a human B lymphocyte library in PACT2 (26Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed into the strain harboring the bait plasmid. The transformants expressing both the bait and the prey proteins were selected on SD/-Leu/-Try/-His medium. Colonies capable of growing on the SD/-Leu/-Try/-His medium were then tested for β-galactosidase activity (LacZ+) using the filter lift assay. Clones that were consistently phenotypically His+ and LacZ+were further characterized. Approximately 2.6 × 106transformants were screened, and several of them were His+and LacZ+. One of the clones chosen for sequencing and characterization, based on its strong His+/LacZ+ phenotype, displayed sequence identity with Hip. A dry nitrocellulose filter was placed on the yeast colonies. The filter was then carefully lifted, transferred (colonies facing up) into liquid nitrogen, completely submerged for 10 s, and then allowed to thaw at room temperature. The filter was then placed on a Whatman filter paper soaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2SO4, pH 7.0) containing 50 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-galactopyranoside, with colonies face up until blue color appeared. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM), containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CXCR2, CXCR4, or Hip forms using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CXCR4 and Hip forms by electroporation. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were selected with 560 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) and evaluated for receptor expression using 125I-CXCL1 binding assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, number NEX-321). Bacteria transformed with plasmids encoding GST or GST fusion proteins were cultured overnight at 37 °C, then isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added and incubation was continued for another 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacteria were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and then sonicated on ice for 10 s. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with RIPA buffer, the purified GST- or GST fusion protein-bound beads were resuspended in RIPA buffer. Aliquots of the purified GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with HEK293 cell lysate at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 2 min), and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min and detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The following cell types were used in these experiments: 1) Human neutrophils, which endogenously express CXCR2, were isolated from fresh heparinized peripheral blood from single human donors as described previously (10Fan G.H. Yang W. Sai J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16960-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); 2) RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing CXCR2 were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding His-tagged wild-type Hip or ΔTPR; 3) HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type or the internalization-deficient mutant (I323A/L324A) of CXCR2 were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding His-tagged wild-type Hip or ΔTPR; 4) HEK293 cells transiently expressing myc-CXCR4 and wild-type Hip or ΔTPR. Cells were treated with carrier buffer (control) or agonists (100 ng/ml CXCL8 for CXCR2 and 100 nm CXCL12 for CXCR4) for 5 min unless indicated, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removal of the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 1 min), the cleared supernatant was collected and 10 μl of affinity-purified anti-CXCR2 antibody (26Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for overnight precipitation at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A/G was then added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was then collected by washing three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer. The final pellet was re-suspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. 20 μl of this preparation was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Co-precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion lens. HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 and transiently expressing His-tagged Hip were grown on coverslips. Cells were treated with carrier buffer or CXCL8 (100 ng/ml) for 5 min and fixed with methanol. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a mixture of a mouse monoclonal anti-CXCR2 antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-His antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed and incubated with a mixture of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse and a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min. Co-localization studies of FITC-labeled CXCR2 and rhodamine-labeled His-tagged Hip were performed using dual excitation (488, 568 nm) and emission (515–540 nm, FITC; 590–610 nm rhodamine) filter sets. Specificity of labeling and absence of signal crossover were established by examination of single-labeled samples. HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding His-tagged wild-type Hip or ΔTPR. Cells were treated with CXCL8 at 37 °C for 10 min then lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and phosphorylated MAPK (ERK1/ERK2) was detected by Western blotting using a phosphospecific MAPK antibody (SC-7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A 96-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe Inc.) was used for chemotaxis assays, and the lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with 400-μl aliquots of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin/DMEM (chemotaxis buffer) or CXCL1 diluted in the chemotaxis buffer (1–200 ng/ml). Polycarbonate membranes (10-μm pore size) were coated on both sides with 20 μg/μl human collagen type IV, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, then stored at 4 °C overnight. To prepare HEK293 cells for chemotaxis assay, cells were removed from the culture dish by trypsinization, washed with Hanks' solution, and incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C to allow time for restoration of receptors. The cells were washed with chemotaxis buffer and then loaded into the upper chamber in the chemotaxis buffer. The chamber was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2, then the membrane was removed, washed, fixed, and stained with a Diff-Quik kit. Cell chemotaxis was quantified by counting the number of migrating cells present in 10 microscope fields (20 × objective). The acid-wash technique (23Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used to determine the kinetics of CXCL8-induced internalization of CXCR2. HEK293 cells expressing CXCR2 were grown to confluence on 24-well plates, which were pre-coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma Chemical Co.,M r 30,000–70,000) for 1 h and washed once with distilled water before use. Cells were incubated at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 75 nCi/ml 125I-CXCL8 for 1 h. The medium was subsequently removed, 1 ml of ice-cold serum-free DMEM was added carefully into each well and aspirated, and then another 1-ml aliquot of ice-cold serum-free DMEM was added prior to incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time. The medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.2m acetic acid with 0.5 m NaCl for 6 min. After the incubation, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold serum-free DMEM, and lysed with 1 ml of 1% SDS with 0.1 nNaOH (lysis solution). The radioactive cell lysate was then counted on a γ-counter (Gamma 5500, Beckman). Total cell surface receptor binding was measured after incubation with 125I-CXCL8 medium followed by washing the cells with ice-cold serum-free DMEM. Nonspecific binding was measured by adding ice-cold 0.2 macetic acid with 0.5 m NaCl after incubation with125I-CXCL8 in binding medium. Calculation of the percentage of internalized receptor was performed as described before (23Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were transiently co-transfected with CXCR4 and pcDNA3.1, Hip, or ΔTPR. Cells (5 × 105/sample) were incubated in HEPES (20 mm)-buffered DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of CXCL12 (100 nm). Cells were then washed in ice-cold medium and incubated with a monoclonal c-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold medium followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed in FACScan equipped with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). In an attempt to isolate chemokine receptor-associated proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the C terminus (amino acids 311–355) of CXCR2 (Fig.1 A). Screening of a human B lymphocyte library fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain (27Harper J.M. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar) yielded several potential candidate genes that were both His+ and LacZ+. The prey cDNAs were recovered from yeast and transformed into bacteria. The cDNAs were then sequenced using primers complimentary to 5′- or 3′-ends of the inserts. Among them, one encoding Hip was chosen for further study based on its moderately strong LacZ+. The specificity of the interaction in yeast was tested by re-transforming PACT2/Hip along with the original bait PAS2/CXCR2 C terminus or PAS2 alone back into yeast strain Y190. The interaction between the receptor C terminus and Hip specifically allowed growth of the yeast on SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SD/-Leu/-Try/-His) (Fig.1 A, left panel). Deletion of the serine-rich domain (amino acids 331–355) in the receptor C terminus did not affect the interaction, suggesting that the binding domain resides in the region of amino acids 311–330. Neither the bait, PAS2/CXCR2 C terminus, nor the prey was able to activate transcription of the reporter genes in the presence of only empty prey or bait vectors, respectively (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Using the β-galactosidase assay, we observed that only the yeast co-transformed with PACT2/Hip and the PAS2/CXCR2-(311–355) or PAS2/CXCR2-(311–330) displayed LacZ+ (Fig.1 A, right panel). To confirm the specific biochemical interaction between the C terminus of CXCR2 and Hip, we used an in vitro binding assay to test for the direct interaction. GST or GST fusion proteins of the C terminus of wild-type or mutant forms of CXCR2 were incubated with the cell lysate of HEK293 cells, and associated Hip was detected by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that the GST fusion protein of the CXCR2 C terminus, but not the GST alone, associated with Hip. The binding of Hip to the mutant forms of CXCR2 C terminus, K322A/I333A/L324A, I326A/H327A, and G328A/L329A/I330A, was significantly reduced compared with the binding of Hip to wild-type CXCR2 C terminus, whereas other mutant forms bound a similar amount of Hip as the wild-type CXCR2 C terminus (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that the Hip binding site resides in the KILAIHGLI motif in the C terminus of CXCR2. To identify the CXCR2 binding site in the Hip protein, PCR-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare mutant Hip cDNAs for the production of truncated or internally deleted Hip proteins. Fig.2 A presents diagrams of the wild-type and mutant forms of Hip prepared. In addition to the N and C termini, three structurally distinctive regions were targeted for mutagenesis. These regions are (i) the TPR at approximately amino acids 100–200, which is required for Hsc/Hsp70 binding, (ii) a 50-amino acid region enriched in charged residues (+− +−), a second binding domain of Hsc/Hsp70, and (iii) a 33-amino acid stretch containing degenerate tandem repeats of the sequence glycine-glycine-methionine-proline (G). The His-tagged wild-type and mutant Hip cDNAs in pcDNA3.1 were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells, and the protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Fig. 2 B shows the expression of the His-tagged wild-type or mutant forms of Hip in HEK293 cells. To identify the CXCR2 binding domain in the sequence of Hip, the GST fusion protein of the CXCR2 C terminus was incubated with the cell lysate of HEK293 cells overexpressing the His-tagged wild-type or the mutant forms of Hip proteins. Co-precipitated wild-type or mutant Hip proteins were detected by Western blotting using a specific anti-His antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 C, only the C-terminal parts of Hip were bound to the GST fusion protein of CXCR2 C terminus. Truncation of the C-terminal 66 amino acids completely impaired the interaction, suggesting that the CXCR2 binding site resides in the extreme C-terminal domain of Hip. As expected, the TPR deletion mutant of Hip (ΔTPR) bound an almost equal amount of the GST fusion protein of CXCR2 C terminus (Fig. 2 C). We next examined whether a functional complex consisting of CXCR2 and Hip could be detected in RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing CXCR2 (generous gift from Dr. Ricardo M. Richardson). Immunoprecipitation of CXCR2 from RBL-2H3 cells revealed a basal association of the receptors with Hip, and CXCL8 (100 ng/ml) treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in the association of Hip with CXCR2, which peaked 5 min after agonist stimulation (Fig.3 A). Similar time-dependent association of CXCR2 with Hip was also observed in HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 (data not shown). In addition, the agonist-induced increase in the association of CXCR2 with Hip was also observed in human neutrophils in response to CXCL8 treatment for 5 min (Fig. 3 B). Although in the same time frame, about 50% of the receptors have been internalized (15Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that agonist-induced association of CXCR2 with Hip occurs in the internal vesicles, whereas the basal association suggests that a small proportion of CXCR2 associates with Hip on the cell membrane. To test this hypothesis, an internalization-deficient mutant of CXCR2 (I323A/L324A) (23Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used in the coimmunoprecipitation assay. As expected, in HEK293 cells stably expressing I323A/L324A, agonist stimulation did not induce an increase in the receptor/Hip association (Fig. 3 C). To test whether other chemokine receptors associate with Hip, HEK293 cells transiently expressing myc-tagged CXCR4 were treated with carrier buff"
https://openalex.org/W2116569143,"In vitro, pancreatic triglyceride lipase requires colipase to restore activity in the presence of inhibitors, like bile acids. Presumably, colipase performs the same function in vivo, but little data supports that notion. Other studies suggest that colipase or its proform, procolipase, may have additional functions in appetite regulation or in fat digestion during the newborn period when pancreatic triglyceride lipase is not expressed. To identify the physiological role of procolipase, we created a mouse model of procolipase deficiency. TheClps −/− mice appeared normal at birth, but unexpectedly 60% died within the first 2 weeks of life. The survivors had fat malabsorption as newborns and as adults, but only when fed a high fat diet. On a low fat diet, the Clps −/−mice did not have steatorrhea. The Clps −/−pups had impaired weight gain and weighed 30% less thanClps+/+ or Clps +/−littermates. After weaning, the Clps −/− mice had normal rate of weight gain, but they maintained a reduced body weight compared with normal littermates even on a low fat diet. Despite the reduced body weight, the Clps −/− mice had a normal body temperature. To maintain their weight gain in the presence of steatorrhea, the Clps −/− mice had hyperphagia on a high fat diet. Clps −/− mice had normal intake on a low fat diet. We conclude that, in addition to its critical role in fat digestion, procolipase has essential functions in postnatal development and in regulating body weight set point. In vitro, pancreatic triglyceride lipase requires colipase to restore activity in the presence of inhibitors, like bile acids. Presumably, colipase performs the same function in vivo, but little data supports that notion. Other studies suggest that colipase or its proform, procolipase, may have additional functions in appetite regulation or in fat digestion during the newborn period when pancreatic triglyceride lipase is not expressed. To identify the physiological role of procolipase, we created a mouse model of procolipase deficiency. TheClps −/− mice appeared normal at birth, but unexpectedly 60% died within the first 2 weeks of life. The survivors had fat malabsorption as newborns and as adults, but only when fed a high fat diet. On a low fat diet, the Clps −/−mice did not have steatorrhea. The Clps −/−pups had impaired weight gain and weighed 30% less thanClps+/+ or Clps +/−littermates. After weaning, the Clps −/− mice had normal rate of weight gain, but they maintained a reduced body weight compared with normal littermates even on a low fat diet. Despite the reduced body weight, the Clps −/− mice had a normal body temperature. To maintain their weight gain in the presence of steatorrhea, the Clps −/− mice had hyperphagia on a high fat diet. Clps −/− mice had normal intake on a low fat diet. We conclude that, in addition to its critical role in fat digestion, procolipase has essential functions in postnatal development and in regulating body weight set point. Obesity has become a major health problem in developed nations (1Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Hirsch J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar,2Kopelman P.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar). Increased body weight causes or exacerbates type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea and increases mortality. Although obesity probably has many causes, changes in body weight must be modulated by balancing energy intake and energy expenditure. In recent years, investigators have identified many regulators of appetite and fat storage (3Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte D., Jr. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4910) Google Scholar, 4Bray G. York D.A. Goodman H.M. Handbook of Physiology: The Endocrine Pancreas and Regulation of Metabolism. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2001: 1015-1056Google Scholar). Some of these have become targets for the development of drugs to treat obesity over the long term (5Bray G.A. Tartaglia L.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Still, there is a need to identify the regulators of metabolic pathways where pharmacological intervention can effectively and safely help those who have clinical obesity. Pancreatic colipase has properties that make it a feasible target for therapy against obesity. It may have roles in dietary fat absorption and in the regulation of voluntary fat intake. Pancreatic colipase is a low molecular weight, amphipathic protein with no known catalytic activity (6Borgstrom B. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Pancreatic Colipase. 1st Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 152-183Google Scholar). Yet, it may be essential for the efficient digestion of dietary fats. Many components commonly found in intestinal chyme, including bile salts, phospholipids, and dietary proteins, inhibit pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) 1PTLpancreatic triglyceride lipaseESembryonic stemPLRP2pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 the enzyme largely responsible for digesting dietary fats (7Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Pancreatic Lipase. 1st Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984: 84-150Google Scholar). In vitro, colipase restores activity to PTL in the presence of inhibitors. Consequently, many have presumed that efficient dietary fat digestion in animals depends on the function of colipase as well as on the catalytic activity of lipases (8Lowe M.E. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1524-1536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). pancreatic triglyceride lipase embryonic stem pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 A large body of evidence has accumulated to show that a peptide derived from newly secreted colipase may act as a feedback signal to inhibit dietary fat intake. Two observations demonstrate that the pancreas secretes colipase as a proform, procolipase. First, two forms of colipase have been isolated. They differ by the presence of an amino-terminal pentapeptide in one form that is absent in the other form. Second, the sequence from the cDNA encoding human colipase predicts the NH2-terminal pentapeptide (9Sternby B. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 786: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Borgstrom B. Wieloch T. Erlanson-Albertsson C. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Lowe M.E. Rosenblum J.L. McEwen P. Strauss A.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In vitro, limited trypsin digestion cleaves the pentapeptide from procolipase to produce colipase suggesting that a similar conversion takes place in the duodenum (12Wieloch T. Borgstrom B. Pieroni G. Pattus F. Verger R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). During studies of the cleaved pentapeptide, Erlanson-Albertsson (13Erlanson-Albertsson C. Nutr. Rev. 1992; 50: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) noticed that the peptide caused weight loss when injected into rabbits. Several groups expanded this observation to demonstrate that the pentapeptide, now named enterostatin, decreases voluntary dietary fat intake in a variety of animal species (13Erlanson-Albertsson C. Nutr. Rev. 1992; 50: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14York D.A. Lin L. Smith B.K. Chen J. Berthoud H-R. Seeley R.J. Neural and Metabloic Control of Macronutrient Intake. CRC Press, New York2000: 301-314Google Scholar). Importantly, animals given enterostatin lose weight over time. To address the physiological roles of procolipase, we created mice with a targeted null allele for the gene encoding procolipase and examined the effects of procolipase deficiency on survival, growth, and dietary fat absorption. Procolipase-deficient mice had decreased postnatal survival and weight gain, steatorrhea on high fat diets, and reduced body weight even in the absence of steatorrhea. These results show that procolipase functions in dietary fat digestion and in body weight regulation. All manipulations of DNA were done by standard methods (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We isolated a 17-kb genomic clone from a murine 129Sv genomic library using a full-length cDNA encoding rat procolipase as a probe. DNA blot of restriction digests and nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the clone contained 3 exons that encoded the entire mRNA for procolipase, 12 kb of 5′-flanking region and 1 kb of 3′-flanking region. To facilitate cloning into the targeting vector, we subcloned a 2.5-kb XbaI fragment, which contains exons 2 and 3, into pGEM-7z and subcloned a 2.0-kb NcoI fragment from the 5′-flanking region into pGEM-5z. The NcoI pGEM-5z was digested with SalI and SphI, the 5′-arm was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into pBluescript. The XbaI pGEM-9z was digested withSphI and blunt-ended with T4 polynucleotide polymerase. The product was digested with EcoRI, the 3′-arm isolated and cloned into the EcoRI and SmaI site of 5′-arm pBluescript. Finally, a PGK neo cassette was isolated from pNTK after digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and was ligated into the corresponding sites in the targeting vector construct (Fig. 1 A). The presence of each fragment and the orientation of the 5′- and 3′-arms was confirmed by restriction digest and by dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis. The resulting vector was linearized and introduced into RW-4 and TC1 embryonic stem (ES) cells by electroporation as previously described (16Muglia L.J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Majzoub J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2066-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We screened for targeted ES cells by DNA blot of genomic DNA isolated from G418-resistant clones and digested withEcoRI. The blot was hybridized to a probe derived from aXbaI-EcoRI fragment in the 3′-flanking region of the genomic clone and labeled by the random primer method. Positive clones were identified for both ES cell lines. One clone from each ES cell line was selected for blastocyst injections. Chimeric mice resulted from each injection. The chimeras were bred to Black Swiss mice and the offspring were screened for the targeted allele by a polymerase chain reaction with three primers: colipase upstream, 5′-CTTTAAAGGCTCTCTCCCTCACTTGGC-3′ (primer 1, Fig. 1 A); colipase downstream, 5′-TCAGGTGGAGTTCGGAGCTGTTCTCC-3′ (primer 2 Fig.1 A); and neo 5′-ATCGCCTTCTTGACGAGTTC-3′(primer 3, Fig. 1 A). These primers amplify a 310-bp band for the wild type allele and a 600-bp band for the null allele (Fig. 1 B). The genotype of positive offspring was confirmed by DNA blot of genomic DNA as above (Fig. 1 C). Germline transmission occurred with chimeras of both ES cell lines. Initially, mice derived from both ES cell lines were screened and found to have identical characteristics. The data presented in this paper was generated from mice resulting from the TC1 ES cells. The mice were of a mixed 129 × Black Swiss background. We isolated total RNA from pancreas, stomach, and duodenum of adult animals as described previously (17Kullman J. Gisi C. Lowe M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G746-G751PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated on denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to HyBond-N+ membranes according to the manufacturers instructions (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). A probe derived from the entire rat colipase cDNA was labeled by the random primer method and hybridized to the membrane with Ultrahyb (Ambion). After hybridization, the membrane was exposed in a PhosphorImager cassette and the bands detected with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To make protein extracts, the pancreas was removed from an adult mouse and immediately homogenized in 0.5% digitonin and 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 1 MiniComplete tablet per 10 ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and divided into aliquots. One was stored at −80 °C until processed and the other heated for 15 min at 65 °C to inactivate endogenous lipases. The protein content of the extracts was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot for PTL and colipase was done as previously described (18Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heat-inactivated samples were assayed for the presence of colipase as described (19Lowe M.E. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. Methods in Molecular Biology: Lipase and Phospholipase Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 59-70Google Scholar). Recombinant human PTL was used in these assays (20Yang Y. Lowe M. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The standard chow was PicoLabTM5053 and contained 11.9% of the energy as fat, 23.6% as protein, and 64.5% as carbohydrate. The high fat diet was from Bio-ServeTM and contained 56.7% of energy as fat, 15.5% as protein, and 27.8% as carbohydrate. The fat was derived from lard and corn oil in both diets. Ad libitum access to food and water was allowed. The mice were adapted to either diet for at least 1 week before samples were collected. Nursing mothers were feed standard 5053 chow. Where indicated the nursing mothers were also given a vitamin supplement (Critter Vites, Mardel Labs, Glendale Heights, IL) that contains both water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins. The vitamins were added to water bottles at a concentration of 1 g/liter and replaced daily (21Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P. Herz J. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The diet containing enterostatin was prepared as described earlier (22Rippe C. Berger K. Boiers C. Ricquier D. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E293-E300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of food consumption, age- and gender-matched animals of each genotype were housed individually in a cage with wire screen floors and no bedding. They were fed the test diet for 1 week prior to starting the experiment. Preweighed food was placed in Pyrex food cup attached to the cage floor with spring clips. The food was weighed daily for 1 week with careful accounting of any spillage and was replaced with a weighed portion of fresh food. The results were recorded as grams of food consumed per gram of mouse weight. Mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg zylaxine and scanned three times using a Lunar PIXImus densitometer connected to a computer as previously described (23Nagy T.R. Clair A.L. Obes. Res. 2000; 8: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Heads were excluded from all analyses. Body temperature was measured at ambient room temperature with a rectal thermistor. Adult mice were placed in a cage with a metabolic screen. They were given water but no food during a 4-h collection of feces. The collected stool was dried to a constant weight and the fats were extracted as described (24Lowe M. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To obtain stool from suckling animals, the perineum of 12-day-old mice was gently stroked with a cotton swab to stimulate defecation. Stool was collected and processed as described for the adults. Extracted fecal fats from 100 mg of dried feces were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform and 10 μl of each sample was spotted onto a Silica G TLC plate. A standard mixture containing 10 μg each of monoolien, 1,2-diolein, 1,2-diolein, and triolein was also spotted. The plate was developed and stained as described (25Bitman J. Wood D.L. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 1023-1034Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Bitman J. Wood D.L. Ruth J.M. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1981; 4: 1007-1021Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Before bleeding mice were fasted for 5 h. Blood was obtained from the retro-orbital venous plexus with a heparinized capillary tube. A core laboratory of the Nutrition Research Unit Center measured serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin. The data were analyzed by Student'st test or the Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test and by Kruskal-Wallis One Way analysis of Variance on Ranks followed by Dunn's method for pairwise multiple comparisons with the significance value for multiple comparisons set at 0.05. The SigmaStat statistical package was used for all calculations. The survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplein-Meier method. A log-rank test was used to compare the survival rates between the groups. We confirmed the presence of a null allele for procolipase by RNA blot and immunoblot analysis. Because procolipase is present in the rodent pancreas, stomach, and intestine, we performed RNA blot analysis on total RNA that was isolated from these tissues (27Hooper L.V. Wong M.H. Thelin A. Hansson L. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I. Science. 2001; 291: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 28Winzell S.M. Lowe M.E. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Riboprobes for procolipase-detected mRNA encoding procolipase in the pancreas, stomach, and small intestine of the Clps+/+ andClps +/− mice (Fig.2 A). In contrast, we detected no mRNA encoding procolipase in the samples fromClps −/− mice. Similarly, an anti-procolipase antibody identified a single, broad band with the same mobility as human procolipase in the samples from theClps+/+ and the Clps +/−mice, but did not detect procolipase in extracts fromClps −/− mice (Fig. 2 B). We also measured colipase function in pancreatic extracts that we heated to inactivate endogenous lipase activity. In the presence of added PTL and taurodeoxycholate, Clps+/+ extracts had 153,000 ± 13,000 units/mg protein and theClps +/− extracts had 86,000 ± 5500 units/mg protein (56%). No activity was present in the extract from the Clps −/− pancreas. The results of mRNA, protein, and function analyses confirm that we created procolipase-deficient mice. Out of 29 litters and 250 live births, the distribution of genotypes fromClps +/− parents was 28%Clps +/+, 46% Clps +/−, and 26% Clps −/−. Of these mice, only 102 male mice (51%) and 98 female mice (49%) survived to weaning. When we examined the genotype ratios of the surviving mice it was clear that the Clps −/− mice had a survival disadvantage (Fig. 3). The survival curves revealed that only 40% of the Clps −/− pups lived until weaning whereas more than 90% of the Clps +/+and Clps +/− pups survived. The majority of theClps −/− pups died between birth and 11 days and death was independent of the litter size. None of the pups had obvious deformities or malformations of major organs. All of the pups had milk in their stomachs in the first day of life indicating that they had started to feed. Similar death rates were seen inClps −/− pups derived from the other, independent ES clone (data not shown). We began investigating the mechanism behind the early neonatal deaths by determining if vitamin deficiency contributed to the death of theClps −/− mice as reported in pups with cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency (21Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P. Herz J. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To prevent vitamin deficiencies, we supplemented the mother's diet with vitamins from the time she was mated until the pups were weaned. After the pups were born we monitored their weight gain and survival. Vitamin supplementation did not change the survival rate of theClps −/− pups (Fig. 3) nor did it change their rate of weight gain (data not shown). The results argue against vitamin deficiencies as a mechanism for the early death ofClps −/− pups. We next examined the rate of weight gain in the suckling animals to ascertain if procolipase deficiency affected growth. The Clps −/− pups (0.33 g/days) gained weight at a significantly slower rate than theClps +/− and Clps +/+pups, which were indistinguishable from each other (0.50 and 0.51 g/days) (Fig. 4 A). By 20 days, the Clps −/− mice weighed 30% less than theClps +/− and Clps +/+mice. The decreased weight in the Clps −/− pups was apparent in the first day of life (Fig. 4 B). When we compared the weights of the surviving Clps −/−pups to those of the Clps −/− mice that eventually died, we found that they had identical weights at birth, but the non-survivors gained almost no weight over the next 4 days (Fig.4 B). Based on in vitro studies, we predicted that the Clps −/− adult mice would have steatorrhea and not gain weight as well as the other genotypes. Accordingly, we continued to record the weights of the mice after weaning. Because other lipases could partially compensate for the lack of PTL activity induced by procolipase deficiency, we weaned the mice to one of two diets containing either 12 or 57% of energy as fat. Presumably, the high fat diet would overwhelm any compensatory changes in the levels of other lipases. The slower rate of weight gain seen in the Clps −/− pups resolved after weaning and the Clps −/− mice had a rate of weight gain identical to that of the Clps +/+ andClps +/− mice. As a result, theClps −/− mice remained smaller than theClps +/+ and Clps +/− mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). At the end of the period, the Clps −/− mice were still 20–30% smaller than the wild type and heterozygous mice. Although the Clps −/− mice could maintain a normal rate of weight gain, they never recovered from the poor weight gain seen during the suckling period. To determine whether procolipase deficiency affects dietary fat absorption, we measured the amount of fat in the feces of suckling pups and of adult mice. The stools of the 12-day-old Clps −/− mice were looser and more yellow than the stools of the Clps+/+ andClps +/− mice. Fat analysis revealed that fat contributes 26% of the weight in the feces fromClps −/− mice whereas theClps +/+ mice had 3.6% (p = <0.001) and the Clps +/− had 4.4% (p = <0.001). The feces from adult mice on the low fat diet had the same appearance and contained 3% fat regardless of the genotype (Fig. 5). In contrast, Clps −/− mice on the high fat diet had yellow stools and fat comprised about 23% of the fecal dry weight in Clps −/− mice compared with 4.9% for Clps +/+ mice (p = <0.001) and to 5.5% for Clps +/− mice (p = <0.001). We next identified the lipid classes by thin layer chromatography. The extracted lipids were separated in a two-solvent, one-dimensional system and quantitatively stained with cupric acetate/phosphoric acid. The patterns were similar for the adult and suckling mice. On the 12% fat diet only fatty acids and variable, small amounts of a species migrating with cholesterol esters were detected in the feces from all genotypes indicating efficient digestion of dietary triglycerides (data not shown.) On the 56% fat diet, diglycerides and triglycerides comprised a much greater proportion of the lipids in the feces of theClps −/− mice, whereas fatty acids predominated in the feces of the Clps +/+ andClps +/− mice (Fig.6 B). Additionally, the feces of the Clps −/− mice contained prominent bands comigrating with cholesterol and cholesterol ester standards. Because the diet contains little cholesterol ester, we determined where retinyl palmitate migrates in the solvent system and found that it co-migrates with cholesterol ester. Thus, the fastest migrating band in theClps −/− mice may be retinyl esters or other lipid species that partition with the di- and triglycerides. The preserved rate of weight gain of theClps −/− mice in the face of steatorrhea suggested that they compensated for the energy loss by eating more. To determine whether the Clps −/− mice have hyperphagia, we directly measured food intake of each genotype. The mice were adapted to either the low or high fat diets for 3 weeks and to the metabolic cages for 3 days before starting the experiment. Eight-week-old male mice were monitored for 1 week. TheClps −/− mice weighed significantly less than the Clps+/+ andClps +/− mice, 19.6 ± 3.0versus 28.0 ± 3.2 g and 30.2 ± 2.4 g, respectively. On the low fat diet, the mice consumed similar amounts of food (Fig. 7 A). On the high fat diet, the Clps −/− mice consumed more food over the 1-week period, 19.1 ± 2.4 g compared with 14.9 ± 1.6 g for the Clps+/+ mice and 13.0 ± 2.0 g for the Clps +/− mice (p = 0.012 for Clps −/− versus Clps+/+ and p= 0.002 versus Clps +/−). When the food intake was normalized for body weight, differences between theClps −/− mice and the other two genotypes became even more apparent (Fig. 7 B). Based on body weight, the Clps −/− mice ate almost twice the high fat diet eaten by their Clps+/+ andClps +/− counterparts. We kept 5 female mice of each genotype on the high fat diet for a period of 3 months and performed body composition analysis by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. At this age, the Clps+/+ mice weighed 31.0 ± 0.29, theClps +/− mice weighed 30.9 ± 0.30, and theClps −/− mice weighed 23.5 ± 1.1, 25% reduced from normal weight (p = <0.001). TheClps −/− mice had significantly decreased body fat as a percentage of the sum of lean body and fat mass compared with the other two genotypes (p = 0.014). The percent body fat of the Clps −/− mice was 21.7 ± 2.6 and the values for Clps+/+ andClps +/− mice were 33.4 ± 3.1 and 30.0 ± 2.1, respectively. There was no difference in grams of lean body mass among the genotypes. The Clps −/− mice showed other changes after several weeks on the high fat diet. Their fur became sparse and oily. Tufts of fur were easily plucked from the coat by pulling on the fur. The upper face became devoid of hair and skin excoriations were present. These lesions presumably occurred from rubbing the area while grooming. No obvious eye changes were seen as reported in the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice. None of these changes were observed in Clps −/− mice on the 12% fat diet. To test whether procolipase deficiency altered metabolism, we measured the daytime rectal temperature and serum chemistries of Clps +/+ andClps −/− mice fed either the low or high fat diet (Table I). The body temperature did not vary between the two genotypes regardless of the diet. We did note differences in serum chemistries on both diets. TheClps −/− mice had higher cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride levels than did the Clps +/+mice. The cholesterol levels increased for both genotypes on the high fat diet, but the triglyceride level increased only for theClps +/+ mice. The amount of fat in the diet did not affect the serum triglyceride levels in theClps −/− mice. Serum glucose differed significantly in the Clps +/+ mice based on the diet, but the levels did not differ between the two genotypes on either diet. The insulin levels did not differ for any comparison.Table IBody temperature and serum measurements in Clps +/+ and Clps −/− miceLow fat dietHigh fat dietClps+/+Clps−/−Clps+/+Clps−/−Temperature37.2 ± 0.337.3 ± 0.337.3 ± 0.237.2 ± 0.4Cholesterol67.7 ± 12.11-ap = 0.003.1-bp = 0.001.117.7 ± 4.71-ap = 0.003.1-cp = 0.028.188.7 ± 38.51-bp = 0.001.166.7 ± 24.61-cp = 0.028.Triglyceride44.3 ± 8.41-dp = 0.033.1-ep = 0.002.21 ± 9.51-dp = 0.033.75.6 ± 5.01-ep = 0.002.1-fp < 0.001.26.7 ± 10.61-fp < 0.001.Glucose139.4 ± 27.81-gp = 0.011.148.9 ± 16.3177.0 ± 23.71-gp = 0.011.150.0 ± 24.2Insulin0.64 ± 0.30.51 ± 0.30.80 ± 0.40.50 ± 0.3Values are averages ± S.D. from 6 to 12 animals per measurement.1-a p = 0.003.1-b p = 0.001.1-c p = 0.028.1-d p = 0.033.1-e p = 0.002.1-f p < 0.001.1-g p = 0.011.

To test the role of enterostatin in adult mice, we feed male mice a low fat diet supplemented with enterostatin and monitored their weight gain and food intake over a 3-week period. At the start of the experiment the Clps +/+ mice weighed 28.6 ± 1.7 g and theClps −/− mice weighed 24.5 ± 1.2 g (p = <0.001). The Clps +/+ mice fed the diet without enterostatin gained 0.166 ± 0.04 g/day whereas those fed the diet with enterostatin gained 0.168 ± 0.03 g/day. The gain was similar in the Clps −/− mice, 0.150 ± 0.05 g/day without enterostatin and 0.138 ± 0.03 g/day with enterostatin (p = 0.122 compared with Clps+/+ mice). Similarly, there was no difference in the amount of food consumed. The Clps+/+ mice ate 77.4 ± 8.3 g total or 22.2 ± 7.0 g/g weight gained without enterostatin and consumed 78.9 ± 4.6 g or 23.2 ± 7.5 g/g weight gained with enterostatin. In comparison, theClps −/− mice ate 76.6 ± 2.9 g or 24.6 ± 3.5 g/g weight gained without enterostatin and 78.3 ± 6.2 g or 24.0 ± 4.8 g/g weight gained with enterostatin. These values showed no statistical differences. To determine the physiological function of procolipase in animals, we ablated the gene encoding procolipase thereby creating mice deficient in both enterostatin and colipase. Examination of these mice revealed several phenotypes. The Clps −/−mice have steatorrhea that begins in pups before PTL is expressed. They have decreased weight gain as newborns, but preserved rate of weight gain as adults even when fed a high fat diet. Over the observation period, the Clps −/− adults never recovered the weight from the poor weight gain as newborns and maintained their weight at a reduced percentage of normal weight. Finally, procolipase deficiency causes a survival disadvantage and 60% ofClps −/− pups died before w"

Gene expression profiling on oligonucleotide microarrays revealed reduced expression of the immediate early genes fos and fosB following stimulation of cells by Wnt-1. Further analysis demonstrated that serum or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activation of several immediate early genes including fos,fosB, junB, and egr1 was inhibited by Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling inhibited transcriptional activation driven by the serum response element without altering the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade or ternary complex formation at the fos serum response element promoter. The Wnt-mediated repression of c-Fos, FosB, and JunB expression was consistent with a decrease in their binding to an AP-1 promoter element and decreased target gene transcription. The expression offos, fosB, junB, andegr1 was also repressed in human colon tumors relative to patient matched normal tissue. By contrast, the fos family member fra-1 was up-regulated in the human colon tumors, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for the reduction infos and fosB expression. The results indicate that Wnt signaling can repress the expression of certain immediate early genes, and that this effect is consistent with changes in gene expression observed in human colorectal tumors.

Components of the Wnt signaling pathway are frequently mutated in human colon cancer where the most common genetic defect results in inactivation of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (reviewed in Ref. 1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in axin, another member of the Wnt signaling pathway, were detected in human colon and hepatocellular cancers (2Satoh S.

Oncogenic mutations in theβ-catenin gene that affect the amino-terminal region of the protein have also been identified in a wide range of human tumors including those derived from colonic and hepatic tissues (reviewed in Ref. 8Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The result of all of these mutational events is the stabilization of β-catenin, an effect that is also elicited by the treatment of cells with members of the Wnt family of secreted ligands (9Hinck L.

Consequently, unphosphorylated β-catenin is no longer recognized by components of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and thus accumulates throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (14Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I.

In the nucleus, β-catenin is known to interact with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and thereby regulate gene transcription (17Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D.

Several target genes that are directly regulated by the binding of β-catenin to TCF/LEF such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and matrilysin have already been identified (19He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C.

Recent evidence has shown a biochemical and biological interaction between β-catenin and retinoic acid receptors that results in the alteration of the gene expression profile in response to both Wnt and retinoic acid (22Easwaran V.

Several members of the Sox family of transcription factors have also been shown to interact directly with β-catenin and alter Wnt-responsive gene expression (25Zorn A.M. Barish G.D. Williams B.O. Lavender P. Klymkowsky M.W. Varmus H.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cross talk between β-catenin and other transcriptional complexes might also be achieved through the direct interaction of β-catenin with the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP or a member of the chromatin-remodeling complex Brg-1 (26Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Whichever mechanism is employed, inappropriate gene expression mediated by stabilized β-catenin could contribute to the progression of tumors driven by the Wnt pathway. In an effort to better understand some of the changes that take place in Wnt-mediated transformation, a screen was performed on mouse C57MG cells to identify target genes of the pathway. Unexpectedly, the expression of several immediate early genes including fosand fosB was repressed by Wnt-1. Additional experiments demonstrated that the activation of these immediate early genes by serum or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was also inhibited by Wnt signaling. The inhibition of these immediate early genes was observed in human colon tumors as was a marked increase in mRNA levels of the fos family member fra-1. The inhibition of certain immediate early genes by Wnt signaling might represent an early step in tumor progression that then leads to subsequent selection for increased expression of other family members. C57MG cells with tetracycline-repressible Wnt-1 expression were grown as described previously (23Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G.

Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 200 ng/ml of tetracycline for 48 h prior to treatment with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) or 100 ng/ml of TPA (Sigma) for the indicated times. Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissues using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit according to instructions by the manufacturer. An analysis of gene expression was performed using quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (23Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G.

A fold induction was obtained by using the ΔΔCt method in which all samples are first normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH) in each sample (29Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Relative normalized units were then compared between the experimental sample and its control. Mouse and human GAPDH primer and probe sequences have been described previously (23Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G. Wong T.A.

Protein equivalents were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Blots were incubated with 1:1000 anti-c-Fos or anti-FosB rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Geneka Biotechnology), 1 μg/ml of anti-Fra-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 1:1000 antiphospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, antiphospho-ERK, or antiphospho-Elk rabbit polyclonal antibodies (New England Biolabs) or 1 μg/ml of anti-ERK2 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Nuclear extracts were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using Geneka Biotechnology AP-1 family and SRE Nushift kits according to instructions by the manufacturer. Probes were generated by annealing forward and reverse oligonucleotides and performing a 5′ overhang fill-in reaction in the presence of α-[32P]ATP. Forward and reverse oligos are as follows: fos wild type SRE, 5′-ACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′ and 5′-ACGCAGATGTCCTAATATGGACATC-3′; fos mutant ternary complex factor, 5′-ACACAAAATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′; andcollagenase AP-1, 5′-ATAAAGCATGAGTCAGAC-3′ and 5′-AGGTGTCTGACTCATGCTTT-3′. Reactions were separated on 4% Tris-glycine gels overnight at 4 °C and subjected to analysis on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated expression plasmids, 0.2 μg of Renilla luciferase (pRL-tk), and 1 μg of 5× SRE luciferase reporter construct (Stratagene) using Effectene (Qiagen) transfection reagent according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Expression plasmids for β-catenin and Wnt-1 have been described elsewhere (30Porfiri E. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Hovanes K. Waterman M. Polakis P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal truncation of β-catenin encodes codons 90–781, and the carboxyl-terminal truncation encodes codons 1–710. Q61L mutant Ha-Ras expression vector was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity in 10 μl of lysate was analyzed using the Promega dual-luciferase reporter assay system and a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer. We performed a screen on C57MG mouse breast epithelial cells to identify genes whose expression is altered by the activation of the Wnt pathway.2 We identified two genes from the AP-1 family of transcription factors, fos and fosB, whose expression was decreased in the presence of Wnt-1. To further explore this finding, we examined the effect of Wnt signaling on the activation of AP-1 family transcription factors by serum stimulation of C57MG cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed a significant repression of serum-induced fos and fosB transcript levels in the presence of Wnt (Fig. 1 A). The Wnt-mediated inhibition was also observed at the level of protein expression for both c-Fos and FosB but not for another c-Fos family member, Fra-1 (Fig. 1 E). In multiple experiments, a consistent 50–90% reduction in serum-induced fos andfosB transcript and protein levels was observed in Wnt-treated cells compared with untreated controls. To determine whether this effect was specific for serum stimulation, we treated C57MG cells with other stimuli that have been reported to activatefos expression. We tested dibutyrl cAMP, forskolin, TPA, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6, but only TPA treatment resulted in the stimulation of fos expression in C57MG cells (data not shown). Similar to the results obtained with serum treatment, TPA-induced fos and fosB expression was again diminished in Wnt-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). Other AP-1 family transcription factors are activated following serum and TPA stimulation in different cell types. An analysis of transcript levels for all the family members following serum and TPA stimulation revealed that the expression of a third AP-1 family member,junB, was also reduced (Fig. 1 C), whereas the expression of the other family members remained unchanged in the presence of Wnt (data not shown). The rapid and transient activation ofjunB paralleled those observed for fos andfosB, suggesting that they may have a similar mechanism of activation. In contrast, the time course of activation ofc-jun and fra-1 was more delayed and sustained and not inhibited by Wnt treatment (data not shown). Both serum and TPA stimulation are known to activate transcription through SREs in the promoters of many target genes including fos,fosB, and junB (32Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Another immediate early gene, early growth regulated gene-1 (egr1), is rapidly and transiently activated through an SRE in response to various stimuli (33Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 34Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and its expression was also repressed by Wnt treatment of C57MG cells (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that Wnt interferes with the activation of a subset of genes whose expression is activated in response to SRE-mediated stimuli. Serum and TPA both activate SRE-driven promoters via the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. However, Wnt treatment did not inhibit the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, ERK, or the ternary complex factor Elk-1 as visualized by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies (Fig.2). Thus, the activation of the signaling pathway leading to the SRE promoter complex is intact, suggesting that the inhibition by Wnt occurs at the level of the promoter. Next, we examined the assembly of the SRE promoter complex. A ternary structure containing serum response factor (SRF) and ternary complex factor assembles at the SRE. Depending on the cell and promoter context, this complex can either assemble upon stimulation or is constitutively bound to the SRE (35Herrera R.E. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 36Malik R.K. Roe M.W. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the fos SRE oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that the complex is preformed prior to serum stimulation and remains unchanged following stimulation of C57MG cells (Fig.3). Furthermore, Wnt treatment was unable to alter the formation of this complex on the fos SRE, suggesting that Wnt-mediated inhibition occurred downstream of transcription factor binding to the SRE.Figure 3Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for SRE binding. C57MG cells were untreated or induced to express Wnt-1 for 48 h prior to serum stimulation for the indicated times. Nuclear extracts were incubated with labeled probes representingfos wild type SRE (wt SRE) or an SRE containing a mutated ternary complex factor (TCF) binding site (mTCF). Reactions were separated on 4% Tris-glycine gels and analyzed on a PhosphorImager. The mobilities of SRF complexes bound to an SRE probe containing or lacking a TCF binding site are indicated atright. The specificity of the SRF containing complexes were confirmed by mutation of the SRF binding site (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Wnt is able to directly inhibit SRE-activated transcription, we transfected COS-7 cells with a construct that expresses luciferase under the control of a multimerized fosSRE promoter. The luciferase reporter was activated when co-transfected with a construct expressing an activated mutant of Ha-Ras compared with a construct expressing green fluorescent protein (Fig.4). The addition of a plasmid encoding Wnt-1 was able to reduce Ha-Ras-activated SRE transcription by 50%. The SRE reporter construct contains only the core fos SRE sequence, suggesting that Wnt mediates its inhibitory effect on transactivation from the SRE itself and does not require additional promoter elements. The expression of a stabilized form of β-catenin, a key downstream mediator of Wnt signaling, also inhibited the Ha-Ras-activated SRE transactivation. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of β-catenin, both of which contribute to β-catenin-mediated transactivation (38van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J.

To assess the cell type specificity of the Wnt-mediated inhibition of immediate early gene activation, we examined five cell lines that are known to respond to Wnt stimulation. Whereas Wnt-3A inhibited the activation of fos in the cell lines COS-7, NIH3T3, and C57MG, inhibition was not observed in C3H10T1/2 or 293 cells (data not shown). This finding suggests that there might be a cell type-specific component necessary to mediate the inhibition by Wnt. To determine whether this inhibition of AP-1 family members occurs in human cancers, we examined human colorectal tumors, a cancer in which the Wnt pathway is activated in the vast majority of cases. We compared human colon tumors to matched normal colon samples from 12 different patients for immediate early gene transcript levels. For fos, 5 of 12 patients had a 50% or greater reduction in expression in tumors relative to normal tissue, whereas at least 9 of 12 sample pairs exhibited a 50% or greater reduction in the expression offosB, junB and egr1 (Fig.5 A). A previous report describing increased expression of c-junand fra-1 transcripts in response to ectopic overexpression of β-catenin in colorectal cancer cells and immortalized colonocytes prompted us to examine the expression levels of other AP-1 family members in human colon tumors (40Mann B. Gelos M. Siedow A. Hanski M.L. Gratchev A. Ilyas M. Bodmer W.F. Moyer M.P. Riecken E.O. Buhr H.J. Hanski C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Transcript levels ofc-jun, junD, fra-2, and several members of the atf family were unchanged in tumorversus normal colorectal tissue samples (data not shown). However, the expression of fra-1 was increased more than 2-fold in 10 of 12 of the colon tumor samples (Fig. 5 B). Although stimulation by Wnt-1 did not result in an increase infra-1 in any of the Wnt-responsive cultured cell lines, Fra-1 transcript and protein levels were already relatively high as observed with the C57MG cells (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Therefore, it was possible that Fra-1 might be able to compensate for the loss of c-Fos and FosB in the formation of the AP-1 heterodimer. Mobility shift assays using the collagenase AP-1 promoter element demonstrates that there is indeed a diminished c-Fos supershift in nuclear extracts of Wnt-treated C57MG cells (Fig.6 A). Furthermore, upon quantitation of supershifts performed on all the AP-1 family members, the relative contribution of FosB and JunB to the AP-1 complex was diminished, whereas that of Fra-1 and JunD was elevated in the extracts from Wnt-treated cells (Fig. 6 B and data not shown). These results suggest that although Fra-1 and JunD protein levels are unchanged, they might compensate for the loss of c-Fos and JunB, respectively, in the formation of the AP-1 complex in cells with an activated Wnt pathway. Altering the composition of the AP-1 heterodimer is thought to alter the specificity of gene activation. Through knockout and transgenic mice studies, collagenase and stromelysin have been identified as specific targets of c-Fos (41Gack S. Vallon R. Schaper J. Ruther U. Angel P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3094-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Consequently, in cells where the Wnt pathway is activated and fos expression is diminished, fos target gene activation should also be reduced. Inde"

The newest catenin, p120ctn, differs from the classical catenins and binds to the membrane-proximal domain of cadherins. Recently, a novel transcription factor Kaiso was found to interact with p120ctn, suggesting that p120ctnalso possesses a nuclear function. We isolated the Xenopushomolog of Kaiso, XKaiso, from a Xenopus stage 17 cDNA library. XKaiso contains an amino-terminal BTB/POZ domain and three carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers. The XKaiso transcript was present maternally and expressed throughout early embryonic development. XKaiso's spatial expression was defined via in situhybridization and was found localized to the brain, eye, ear, branchial arches, and spinal cord. Co-immunoprecipitation of Xenopusp120ctn and XKaiso demonstrated their mutual association, whereas related experiments employing differentially epitope-tagged XKaiso constructs suggest that XKaiso additionally self-associates. Finally, reporter assays employing a chimera of XKaiso fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain indicate that XKaiso is a transcriptional repressor. These data suggest that XKaiso functions throughout development and that its repressor functions may be most apparent in the context of neural tissues. The significance of the XKaiso-p120ctn interaction has yet to be determined, but it may include transducing information from cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts to transcriptional processes within the nucleus.

Recently, a nuclear transcription factor interacting with p120ctn was isolated through yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse cDNA library (37Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This protein, named Kaiso, was found to be a BTB/POZ (forBroad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bricà brac/poxviruses and zinc finger) protein (38Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 39Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D.

Immunofluorescence analysis of Kaiso showed it localized to the nucleus (37Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). More recently, Kaiso was shown to specifically bind nonmethylated DNA sequences and to bind other distinct DNA sequences in a methylation-dependent manner in mammalian cells (41Prokhortchouk A. Hendrich B. Jorgensen H. Ruzov A. Wilm M. Georgiev G. Bird A. Prokhortchouk E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). 2J. M. Daniel, C. M. Spring, H. C. Crawford, A. B. Reynolds, and A. Baig, submitted for publication.2J. M. Daniel, C. M. Spring, H. C. Crawford, A. B. Reynolds, and A. Baig, submitted for publication. This work also indicated that Kaiso's binding to DNA targets occurs via its zinc finger domain and suggested the further association of co-repressors such as the histone deacetylase complex and/or components of methyl-CpG binding complexes in effecting transcriptional repression and/or gene silencing. While Kaiso interacts with p120ctn, Kaiso does not bind the related Armadillo domain-containing protein β-catenin (37Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), indicating that Kaiso in complex with p120ctnhas a nuclear function distinct from that of LEF/TCF when associated with β-catenin upon Wnt signaling, a view further supported by exogenous expression studies of p120ctn carried out in developing Xenopus embryos (26Geis K. Aberle H. Kuhl M. Kemler R. Wedlich D. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 207: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Paulson A.F. Fang X. Ji H. Reynolds A.B. McCrea P.D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The BTB/POZ proteins are generally divided into two groups, actin-binding proteins and DNA-binding proteins (39Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear BTB/POZ members have been characterized in mammalian cells and invertebrates such as Drosophila. Some mammalian BTB/POZ proteins have been found to be oncogenic. For example, the BCL6 gene is rearranged in human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (43Kerckaert J.P. Deweindt C. Tilly H. Quief S. Lecocq G. Bastard C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 44Ye B.H. Lista F. Lo Coco F. Knowles D.M. Offit K. Chaganti R.S. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1993; 262: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein is fused to the retinoic acid receptor α in translocations associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (45Chen Z. Guidez F. Rousselot P. Agadir A. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Degos L. Zelent A. Waxman S. Chomienne C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Drosophila BTB/POZ proteins have been found in turn to be important in development. For example, Tramtrack is a repressor of pair-rule segmentation genes such asftz, eve, runt, and odd(46Brown J.L. Wu C. Development. 1993; 117: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is required for cell fate determination in theDrosophila eye (47Xiong W.C. Montell C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Another BTB/POZ protein, Broad-Complex, is involved in Drosophila metamorphosis (48Emery I.F. Bedian V. Guild G.M. Development. 1994; 120: 3275-3287PubMed Google Scholar, 49von Kalm L. Crossgrove K. Von Seggern D. Guild G.M. Beckendorf S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). AXenopus BTB/POZ zinc finger protein, Champignon, has been recently isolated and shown to interfere with gastrulation movements when exogenously expressed during embryonic development (50Goto T. Hasegawa K. Kinoshita T. Kubota H.Y. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To better understand the nuclear function of p120ctnduring development, we isolated the Xenopus homolog of Kaiso, XKaiso, from a neurula stage Xenopus cDNA library (51Kintner C.R. Melton D.A. Development. 1987; 99: 311-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XKaiso was found to be highly homologous with Kaiso especially within the BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the XKaiso transcript was determined via RT-PCR analysis and in situ hybridization, respectively, revealing localized expression in neuronal tissues. XKaiso specifically associated with Xenopus p120ctn(Xp120ctn), 3M. Ciesiolka, A. Vanlandschoot, K. Staes, K. Vlemı̀nckx, and F. van Roy, manuscript in preparation.3M. Ciesiolka, A. Vanlandschoot, K. Staes, K. Vlemı̀nckx, and F. van Roy, manuscript in preparation. whereas co-immunoprecipitation experiments employing differentially epitope-tagged XKaiso constructs additionally suggested the existence of XKaiso homodimers and/or higher order oligomers. XKaiso behaved as a transcriptional repressor when assayed in the context of a chimeric fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD), a characteristic shared with other members of the BTB/POZ zinc finger family. This study represents the first characterization of XKaiso, a direct binding partner of Xp120ctn, in a developmental context. Experiments are under way to determine the function of XKaiso and the XKaiso-Xp120ctn complex. We employed standard hybridization screening methods to obtain the full-length XKaiso cDNA from a Xenopus stage 17 embryo cDNA library constructed in the λgt10 vector (51Kintner C.R. Melton D.A. Development. 1987; 99: 311-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The random primed probe (Random Primers DNA Labeling System; Invitrogen) was generated by PCR amplification (50 °C and 25 cycles) using the Xenopuslibrary as template and a mouse Kaiso primer set (5′-GCTACAGACATTCAGTAC-3′, 5′-TTGTTCTGAGGAGGAGTA-3′), corresponding to coding regions within the BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains, respectively (37Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 12–16 h according to published procedures (52Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed 3–5 times in 2× SSC (20× SSC: 17.5% NaCl, 8.8% sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for a total of 20 min and washed once in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min. Positive clones were further identified by PCR (55 °C and 30 cycles) with λgt10-specific primers using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Clones were sequenced at the institutional core sequencing facility, and a full-length cDNA was generated from the cDNA library by PCR (55 °C and 30 cycles) with the Xenopus Kaiso-specific primers that were designed based on the above known coding sequence. The product was then gel-purified using a GeneClean kit (Bio 101) and sequenced. The XKaiso sequence is available from GenBank™ under accession numberAF420316. Xenopus eggs were obtained and fertilized using standard methods (53Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor2000Google Scholar). Embryos were dejellied by treating with 2% cysteine HCl (pH 8.0) for 5 min before the first cleavage stage and were rinsed and incubated in 0.1× MMR (10× MMR: 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). Embryo stages were determined by observation under a standard binocular dissecting microscope (model SMZ-U; Nikon) based on the normal table of Xenopus laevis development (54Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin): A Systematical and Chronological Survey of the Development from the Fertilized Egg till the End of Metamorphosis. North-Holland Pub. Co., Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). mRNA or plasmid DNA constructs were microinjected into the animal hemisphere of two blastomeres in 2–4 cell stage embryos incubated in 5% Ficoll, 0.3× MMR (pH 7.4). The Ficoll solution was replaced with 0.1× MMR (pH 7.4) 1 h after the injection. Embryos were injected using borosilicate glass capillary tubes (0.75 mm in diameter; Sutter) drawn out using a P-30 pulling instrument (Sutter) and bevelled by a K. T. Brown Type Micropipette beveller (Sutter). The total volume of DNA or RNA injected ranged from 20 to 40 nl (total doses from 250 to 500 pg) as manipulated by the NA-1 oil-driven microinjector (Sutter). XKaiso was differentially tagged on its amino terminus with three hemagglutinin (HA) or sixmyc epitopes. A XKaiso full-length cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: for HA tag, 5′-GCTCTAGAAATGGAGACAAAAAAGCTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGTACGATTCTGGTAT-3′; for myc tag, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGAGACAAAAAAGCTG and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGTACGATTCTGGTAT-3′. The resulting products were cloned in frame within the vectors pCS2+3HA or pCS2+MT (55Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H.

A XKaiso construct with carboxyl-terminal triplet HA epitopes (XKaiso/pCS2+C-3HA) was generated by PCR (using primers 5′-AAGGCCTATGGAGACAAAAAAGCTG-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCTGTACGATTCTGGTATTAC-3′) and subcloned in frame into pCS2+C-3HA at the StuI site. A XKaiso frameshifted construct (XKaisoFS) was engineered by SacI restriction digestion of the XKaiso cDNA coding sequence at base pair 131, T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) removal of the 3′-overhangs, and T4 DNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) blunt end religation of the preexisting insert within the pCS2+3HA vector. A cDNA encoding a carboxyl-terminal fragment of aXenopus p120ctn-like protein was cloned by screening a yeast two-hybrid library of X. laevis oocytes using a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of Xenopus N-cadherin as a bait.3 This p120ctn-like cDNA was completed by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (GenBankTM accession number AF150744) and turned out to be a true Xenopus ortholog of human p120ctn isoform 1AΔD (57Keirsebilck A.

Because it is the longer of two Xenopus isoforms isolated, it was designated Xp120ctniso1. A derivative construct having six carboxyl-terminal myc epitopes (Xp120iso1/pCS2+C-MT) was generated by PCR (using primers 5′-GAATTCGATGGATGAGCCAGAG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCACACGCTGATCTTC-3′) and subcloned in frame into pCS2+C-MT at the EcoRI site.

The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR: for XKaiso, 5′-TCCCCCGGGGATGGAGACAAAAAAGCTG-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGCTAGTACGATTCTGGTATTAC-3′; for Xp120ctniso1, 5′-GGAATTCATGGATGAGCCAGAGTCT-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTAGACACGCTGATCTTCAG-3′; for Xarvcf1A, 5′-GGAATTCATGCCTGCCGAACTCCAA-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTAGACCCAGGAGTCAAC-3′. The GAL4BD-fused XKaiso, Xp120ctniso1, and Xarvcf1A were then PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCS2+ (55Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 56Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) to generate GAL4XKaiso/pCS2+, GAL4Xp120iso1/pCS2+, and GAL4Xarvcf1A/pCS2+, respectively. The PCR primers used were as follows: for GAL4BDXKaiso, 5′-AAGGCCTATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCTCCCGGGCTAGTACGATT-3′; for GAL4BDXp120ctniso1, 5′-AAGGCCTATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCTGAATTCTTAGACACGCTG-3′; for GAL4BDXarvcf1A, 5′-AAGGCCTATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCTGAATTCTTAGACCCAGGA-3′. PCR was conducted using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the insert sequence of each construct was verified by sequencing at the institutional core sequencing facility. All DNA constructs were transcribedin vitro into capped mRNA using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by filtration through Quick Spin Columns, Sephadex G-50 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The concentration and integrity of the mRNA were determined by measuring the optical density (OD260/280) and mobility on standard RNA formaldehyde agarose gels (52Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Embryos were coinjected with 500 pg each of mRNA of epitope-tagged XKaiso and Xp120ctn, XKaiso, and Xarvcf1B or with differentially tagged XKaisos. The injected embryos were harvested at stage 9, and whole embryo lysates were prepared by pipetting with a prechilled TX buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 50 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml iodoacetamide, and 40 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone). Yolk proteins and cellular debris were cleared from lysates by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, 4 °C for 15 min. The lysates was incubated with anti-HA (12CA5) or anti-myc (9E10) monoclonal antibodies at 1:1,000 dilution by rotation at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Protein A- and G-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) were then added and incubated for an additional 1 h. The resulting immunocomplexes were precipitated at 14,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 s. The precipitates were washed in prechilled TX buffer and resuspended in an SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). The resuspension was boiled for 5 min in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were then electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with anti-HA (1:4,000 dilution) or anti-myc antibodies (1:4,000 dilution), followed by a second incubation with goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:3,000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). The signal was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from frog eggs and embryos using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To detect transcripts by PCR, cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), employing random hexamers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RT-PCR assays were semiquantitative. The linear range for each primer set was determined by removing 5-μl aliquots from the PCR tube at five-cycle intervals and comparing band intensities of the products resolved on agarose gels. The PCR conditions and primers used were as follows: for XKaiso transcripts, 50 °C, 30 cycles, 5′-ATCTCCATCGAAACCTGGC-3′, 5′-TTTTCCCAGGAATGGACG-3′; for ornithine decarboxylase, 55 °C, 25 cycles, 5′-GGAGCTGCAAGTTGGAGA-3′, 5′-CTCAGTTGCCAGTGTGGTC-3′. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were prepared using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). XKaiso/pCRII was digested with NotI (sense linearization) or SpeI (antisense linearization) and then treated with SP6 and T7 polymerase to produce the sense and antisense probes, respectively. Eggs and embryos of different stages were collected from albino frogs and processed using the published protocol (53Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor2000Google Scholar). Embryos were coinjected with 250 pg of mRNA of different GAL4 fusion constructs and 250 pg of luciferase reporter plasmid, p17X4TKlucSV40pA (a generous gift from Drs. Zafar Nawaz and Ming Tsai, Baylor College of Medicine), containing a minimal thymidine kinase promoter under the control of four GAL4 binding sites. The injected embryos at the early gastrula stage (stages 10 and 11) were harvested into three separate groups of five for each assay. The collected embryos were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Uninjected embryo lysates were used to measure base-line activity. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. To isolate the Xenopushomolog of Kaiso, XKaiso, a screen was undertaken of aXenopus stage 17 embryo cDNA library using the mouse Kaiso coding region to design primers for generating the hybridization probe (described under “Experimental Procedures”). A full-length cDNA was isolated that showed overall 53% identity and 66% amino acid similarity compared with murine Kaiso (Fig.1). XKaiso contains an amino-terminal BTB/POZ domain, generally involved in protein-protein interactions, and a carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain containing three Cys-2-His-2 zinc fingers, shown in murine Kaiso1 and other family members to bind DNA (39Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). The BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains of XKaiso show 87 and 90% amino acid identity, respectively, to mouse Kaiso, suggesting that we have isolated the Xenopus ortholog. To determine the temporal expression patterns of XKaiso, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed on total RNAs isolated from Xenopus eggs and embryos of different developmental stages. As shown in Fig.2, the XKaiso transcript was present maternally and expressed throughout early embryonic development. The XKaiso transcript was not detectable via Northern blotting using 20 μg of total RNA of varying Xenopus embryonic stages and a32P-labeled random primed probe (data not shown). The low expression levels of XKaiso were further suggested by our inability to detect the XKaiso protein using an anti-XKaiso polyclonal antibody that effectively resolved exogenously expressed XKaiso. In all events, XKaiso's RT-PCR temporal expression and whole-mount in situpatterns (Figs. 2 and 3) indicate that XKaiso mRNA is continually present from the egg to early tadpole stages of embryonic development.Figure 3Whole-mount in situhybridization analys"

In this study, we have analyzed the mechanism underlying N. gonorrhoeae-induced CEACAM up-regulation in epithelial cells. Epithelial cells represent the first barrier for the microbial pathogen. We therefore characterized CEACAM expression in primary human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells and found that CEACAM1–3 (L, S) and CEACAM1–4 (L, S) splice variants mediate an increased Opa52-dependent gonoccocal binding to HOSE cells. Up-regulation of these CEACAM molecules in HOSE cells is a direct process that takes place within 2 h postinfection and depends on close contact between microbial pathogen and HOSE cells.N. gonorrhoeae-triggered CEACAM1 up-regulation involves activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which translocates as a p50/p65 heterodimer into the nucleus, and an NF-κB-specific inhibitory peptide inhibited CEACAM1-receptor up-regulation in N. gonorrhoeae-infected HOSE cells. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides did not induce NF-κB and CEACAM up-regulation, which corresponds to our findings that HOSE cells do not express toll-like receptor 4.

The Opa proteins are a family of functionally and antigenically diverse outer membrane proteins. The gonococcal chromosome contains up to 11 unlinked alleles encoding distinct Opa variants (1Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Each variant is independently regulated by phase variation, resulting in a heterogeneous population of bacteria expressing no, one, or several Opa variants (2Stern A. Brown M. Nickel P. Meyer T.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Bacteria recovered from natural infections and following inoculation of human volunteers with Opa− bacteria are mostly Opa+, suggesting an important role for the Opa adhesins during infection (3Swanson J.

Using recombinant Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, we have previously characterized the receptor specificities of all Opa variants of the MS11 strain of N. gonorrhoeae (1Kupsch E.M.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These and other studies have revealed that a minority of Opa proteins can targetNeisseria species to heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors (6Chen T. Belland R.J. Wilson J. Swanson J. J. Exp.

Most Opa variants characterized to date interact with the family of human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecules (5Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol.

Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whereas some Opa proteins may interact with both heparan sulfate proteoglycan and CEACAM receptors (12Chen T. Grunert F. Medina-Marino A. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1557-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Virji M. Evans D. Hadfield A. Grunert F. Teixeira A.M. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 538-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), each variant appears to mediate host cell invasion only via either one or the other receptor class. These different binding specificities may have important implications for the pathogenic process ofNeisseria, since the distribution pattern of each CEACAM receptor should influence the cellular tropism of neisserial strains expressing different Opa variants in vivo. In addition, very different cellular processes have been linked to individual CEA family members (17Thompson J.A. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. J. Clin. Lab.

All of these receptors can mediate gonococcal invasion when recombinantly expressed in a CEACAM-negative epithelial cell line (5Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol.

Grunert F. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each CEACAM receptor consists of an immunoglobulin variable-like domain followed by a variable number of IgC2 constant-like domains (17Thompson J.A. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 344-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). CEA, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked to the cell surface, whereas CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 are inserted into the cellular membrane via a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain (24Hefta L.J. Schrewe H. Thompson J.A. Oikawa S. Nakazato H. Shively J.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2397-2403PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zimmermann W. Weber B. Ortlieb B. Rudert F. Schempp W. Fiebig H.H.

A. 1987; 84: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that each receptor is highly glycosylated, binding is a protein-protein interaction with Opa proteins recognizing CEACAM residues exposed on the GFCC′ face of the amino-terminal domain (28Billker O. Popp A. Gray-Owen S.D. Meyer T.F. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 258-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several different splice variants of CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 exist. All contain the N-terminal domain but differ in the number of extracellular IgC-like domains and the length of their cytoplasmic domains (29Barnett T.R. Drake L. Pickle II W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Nagel G. Grunert F. Kuijpers W.T. Watt S.M. Thompson J. Zimmermann W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CEACAM receptors mediate intercellular adhesion via both homotypic (CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6) and/or heterotypic (CEA-CEACAM6 and CEACAM6-CEACAM8) interactions (31Benchimol S. Fuks A. Jothy S. Beauchemin N. Shirota K. Stanners C.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 327-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 32Oikawa S. Inuzuka C. Kuroki M. Arakawa F. Matsuoka Y. Kosaki G. Nakazato H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7995-8001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the N domain is directly involved in the cell adhesion phenomena. CEACAM1 and CEACAM6 are also involved in the adherence of activated neutrophils to cytokine-activated endothelial cells, both directly through their ability to present the sialylated Lewisxantigen to E-selectin and indirectly by the CEACAM6-stimulated activation of CD18 integrins (18Kuijpers T.W. Hoogerwerf M. van der Laan L.J. Nagel G. van der Schoot C.E. Grunert F. Roos D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The role of CEACAM receptors is not, however, restricted to simple anchorage to adjacent cells, since various receptors can influence cell cycle control and cellular differentiation. For example, CEACAM1 expression inhibits the proliferation of mouse colonic carcinoma cells both in vitroand in vivo. This effect was abrogated by deleting the receptor's cytoplasmic domain, suggesting an important role for CEACAM1-mediated signaling in this event (33Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hsieh J.T. Luo W. Song W. Wang Y. Kleinerman D.I. Van N.T. Lin S.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar). Such a growth-inhibitory effect is consistent with clinical observations that CEACAM1 expression is down-regulated in various colonic carcinomas (35Neumaier M. Paululat S. Chan A. Matthaes P. Wagener C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10744-10748Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar,36Kleinerman D.I. Troncoso P. Lin S.H. Pisters L.L. Sherwood E.R. Brooks T. von Eschenbach A.C. Hsieh J.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1215-1220PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these features imply an important role for members of the CEACAM receptor family as sensory and regulatory molecules in cell-cell adhesion events (37Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM6 are expressed by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and can mediate gonococcal binding and opsonin-independent phagocytosis by these phagocytes (10Virji M. Makepeace K.D.J. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Chen T. Gotschlich E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This interaction appears to play a central role in the pathogenic process, since a urethral exudate consisting primarily of PMNs associated with both intracellular and extracellularly attached gonococci is the hallmark of gonorrhea. CEACAM receptors expressed by other cells also appear to play an important role during other stages of neisserial infection. Polarized T84 epithelial cells express CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6 on their apical surface, and Opa binding to these receptors mediates bacterial uptake, cellular transcytosis, and release at the basolateral surface (39Wang J. Gray-Owen S.D. Knorre A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous findings that N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis appear in the subepithelial layers following thein vitro infection of organ cultures (40McGee Z.A. Stephens D.S. Hoffman L.H. Schlech W.F. Horn R.G. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5 Suppl. 4: 708-714Crossref Google Scholar). We could previously show that N. gonorrhoeaeinduces directly CEACAM1 receptor expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (41Muenzner P. Naumann M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24331-24340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the endothelial cell model, expression of CEACAM1 was induced by LPS via a toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4)-dependent activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This increased expression of CEACAM1 correlates with an increased adherence and invasion of different Opa-expressing bacteria into these cells in vitro (5Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A.

We were therefore interested in determining whether gonococci were also capable of inducing their cellular receptor in epithelial cells that form the first mechanical barrier and primary site of infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that N. gonorrhoeae infection stimulates directly CEACAM1 receptor expression in human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells. We are able to show that up-regulation of CEACAM1 expression in HOSE cells is not due to an autocrine loop via TNFα. As in HUVECs, CEACAM1 expression is regulated through activation of NF-κB. However, in contrast to HUVECs, up-regulation of CEACAM1 in HOSE cells is an LPS/TLR-4-independent event that critically depends on a direct interaction of gonococci with HOSE cells. The newly expressed CEACAM1 receptor allows gonococci to establish a tight, Opa-dependent anchorage to the epithelia and may lead to bacterial uptake into the target cells. Primary HOSE cells that had been isolated and immortalized as previously described (42Tsao S.W. Mok S.C. Fey E.G. Fletcher J.A. Wan T.S.K. Chew E-C. Muto M.G. Knapp R.C. Berkowitz R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were grown in M199 and MCDB-104 medium (1:1) (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Epithelial cells were grown to form a confluent monolayer and then seeded to new flasks or into wells containing glass coverslips to obtain a confluence of about 60%. HUVECs were obtained from human umbilical vein by chymotrypsin digestion as described previously (43Dehio C. Meyer M. Berger J. Schwarz H. Lanz C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110 (abstr.): 2141-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cultured in low serum endothelial growth medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany), and used between passages 4 and 5. Human PMNs were isolated from venous blood of healthy donors as described previously (44Brandt E. Van Damme J. Flad H.-D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The construction of stably transfected HeLa cell lines expressing CEA and CEACAM1 was described previously (45Berling B. Kolbinger F. Thompson J.A. Brombacher F. Buchegger F. von Kleist S. Zimmerman W. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6534-6539PubMed Google Scholar). The strains of N. gonorrhoeaeMS11 expressing defined recombinant Opa variants were described previously (1Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Strains N309 and N313 invariantly synthesize the CEACAM-binding Opa proteins Opa52 and Opa57, respectively. Strain N303 expresses the heparan sulfate-binding Opa50. In these strains, the cloned opa genes were expressed in the genetic background of the MS11 derivative N279, which lacks pili and carries a deletion in the epithelial cell invasion-associated opaC30 locus. N280 is a piliated variant of N279 (Opa−, P+) (1Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Daily subculture of all strains was carried out using a binocular microscope to select for desired Opa phenotypes, and Opa protein expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using the monoclonal antibody 4B12C11 (46Achtman M. Neibert M. Crowe B.A. Strittmatter W. Kusecek B. Weyse E. Walsh M.J. Slawig B. Morelli G. Moll A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 507-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) for the detection of Opa proteins. For infection experiments, HOSE cells were seeded into 75-cm2 flasks to obtain cultures at about 70% confluence at the time of infection. One night before infection, the medium was changed to M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Gonococci were harvested from fresh overnight cultures into M199 medium containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum to obtain a culture density of 108colony-forming units/ml and then used to infect the cells at a multiplicity of infection of 30 bacteria/cell for the indicated periods. For immunofluorescence analysis, HOSE cells were infected as outlined above, except that cells were initially seeded onto 12-mm glass coverslips, and the samples were fixed after the final washing step postinfection by incubating in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 200 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. To determine levels of gonococcal adherence and invasion, the gonococci were stained for immunofluorescence and then analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy as described previously (15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 39Wang J. Gray-Owen S.D. Knorre A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The visualization of bacterial interactions with the CEACAM1 receptor was also analyzed by confocal laser microscopy using the anti-CEACAM mouse monoclonal antibody D14HD11. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dianova) were used as secondary antibodies. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin was used to visualize cellular actin. To quantitate total cell-associated bacteria in plating assays, cells were infected in 24-well plates. After the infection periods indicated, monolayers were washed three times with 1 ml of medium and lysed with 1% saponin in M199 for 10 min. Gonococci were suspended by vigorous pipetting, and colony-forming units in the lysates were determined by plating of serial dilutions. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against human carcinoembryonic antigen (A0115) and control rabbit immunoglobulins (X0936) were purchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark), and immunoglobulins were purified over a protein G column. To block CEACAM receptors, cells were incubated with purified specific or control immunoglobulins at 20 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C before infection. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with TNFα (BD PharMingen, San Diego) or with LPS prepared from E. coliserotype O111:B4 by phenol extraction (Sigma). Suspensions of LPS were prepared by sonication in endotoxin-free water (Invitrogen) to disperse any aggregates formed and were then diluted to the indicated final concentration in supplemented medium. HOSE cells were analyzed using a FACS-Calibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and the Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson). The CEACAM-specific, mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4/3/17 (anti-CEACAM1/CEA), 9A6 (anti-CEACAM6), and COL1 (anti-CEA/CEACAM3) were used for primary labeling and were described previously (47Jantscheff P.

Cancer. 1993; 55: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The background fluorescence was determined using isotype-matched mouse IgG as a negative control. CEACAM1 protein expression in response to exposure to bacterial strains, TNFα, or other stimuli was determined by immunoblot analysis of total cellular protein essentially as described before (15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in each sample was determined by colorimetric Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp.). Western blot analysis was performed using the CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody TEC-11 (50Draberova L. Cerna H. Brodska H. Boubelik M. Watt S.M. Stanners C.P. Daraber P. Immunology. 2000; 101: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); the CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEA, and CEACAM6 cross-specific monoclonal antibody D14HD11; the CEACAM6-specific antibody 9A6 (Immunotech, Marseille, France); the CEACAM1 and CEA cross-specific antibody 4/3/17; and the CEA and CEACAM3 cross-specific antibody COL1. Bound antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To test for Iκβα degradation, cytosolic fractions obtained from HOSE cells exposed to various stimuli were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an Iκβα−specific polyclonal antibody that does not cross-react with other Iκβ family members (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Coomassie Blue-stained gels were generally used as a control to assure that equal protein amounts were applied (data not shown). Cytokines were assayed in the supernatants ofNeisseria-infected HOSE cells at different time points. TNFα ELISAs were performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions (ELISA BIOSOURCE Europe S.A.). NF-κB SN50 (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc.) is a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits the translocation of active NF-κB complex into the nucleus. To confirm the role of NF-κB in CEACAM expression, cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml of this peptide for 30 min at 37 °C before TNFα or the bacteria was added. Total RNA was isolated from HOSE cells that had been treated with various stimuli, as indicated, using either the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) or the Qiagen RNeasy Kit, as outlined by the manufacturers, and then treated further with RNase-free DNase I. Equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using Superscript IIRT (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. As a control for chromosomal DNA contamination, RNA was used directly for PCR amplification. Subsequent amplification of CEACAM1 was carried out using CEACAM1-specific primers for 30 cycles at 56 °C annealing temperature. The differential amplification of CEACAM1 splice variants was performed using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 °C. The primers used were 5′ (ACAGTCAAGACGATCATAGT) and 3′ (ATCTTGTTAGGTGGGTCATT), resulting in amplified fragments in the DNA sequence as previously described (51Kammerer R. Hahn S. Singer B.B. Luo J.S. von Kleist S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To detect Toll-like receptor expression, PCR amplification of the cDNA template was performed using Taq polymerase for 28 cycles at 95 °C for 40 s, 54 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR primers used for TLR-2 were GCCAAAGTCTCTTGATTGATTCC and TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG, and those used for TLR-4 were TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAG and GAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC (52Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J.

Primers specific for the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene β-actin were also included within the reaction mixture to provide an internal control that allowed samples to be equally loaded. In each case, PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. After the indicated periods of infection, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using the nonionic detergent method described previously (53Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays for the detection of the active NF-κB complex were performed with an Igκ oligonucleotide that had been labeled using the large fragment DNA polymerase (Klenow) in the presence of [α-32P]deoxy-ATP.

https://openalex.org/W2102659668,"Previously we reported that type V collagen synthesized by Schwann cells inhibits the outgrowth of axons from rat embryo dorsal root ganglion neurons but promotes Schwann cell migration (Chernousov, M. A., Stahl, R. C., and Carey, D. J. (2001) J. Neurosci. 21, 6125–6135). Analysis of Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on dishes coated with various type V collagen domains revealed that Schwann cells adhered effectively only to the non-collagenous N-terminal domain (NTD) of the α4(V) collagen chain. Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD induced actin cytoskeleton assembly, tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of the Erk1/Erk2 protein kinases. Adhesion to α4(V)-NTD is cell type-specific because rat fibroblasts failed to adhere to dishes coated with this polypeptide. Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on α4(V)-NTD was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin (IC50∼30 ng/ml) but not by chondroitin sulfate. Analysis of the heparin binding activities of a series of recombinant α4(V)-NTD fragments and deletion mutants identified a highly basic region (not present in other type V collagen NTD) as the site responsible for high affinity heparin binding. Schwann cells adhered poorly to dishes coated with α4(V)-NTD that lacked the heparin binding site and failed to spread or assemble organized actin-cytoskeletal structures. Soluble α4(V)-NTD polypeptide that contained the heparin binding site inhibited spreading of Schwann cells on dishes coated with α4(V)-NTD. Affinity chromatography of Schwann cell detergent extracts on a column of immobilized α4(V)-NTD resulted in the isolation of syndecan-3, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Together, these results suggest that Schwann cells bind to collagen type V via syndecan-3-dependent binding to a novel high affinity heparin binding site in the α4(V)-NTD. Previously we reported that type V collagen synthesized by Schwann cells inhibits the outgrowth of axons from rat embryo dorsal root ganglion neurons but promotes Schwann cell migration (Chernousov, M.

Interactions of Schwann cells and neurons with extracellular matrix (ECM) 1ECMextracellular matrixNTDN-terminal domain 1ECMextracellular matrixNTDN-terminal domain are critical for many aspects of peripheral nervous system development and function. Cell-ECM interactions regulate such processes as Schwann cell and axonal migration (1Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J.

Neurosci. 1986; 8: 182-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cellular interactions with ECM are mediated by cell surface receptors that bind specific ECM proteins. The most extensively characterized ECM receptors are the integrins, a family of transmembrane heterodimeric proteins that also bind and regulate cytoplasmic signaling and cytoskeletal complexes (6Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar, 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Other ECM receptors including membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (8Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and the collagen-binding discoidin domain receptors (9Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T.

Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). This is a highly dynamic period of nerve development that is characterized by axonal and Schwann cell migration and Schwann cell proliferation. At this time, Schwann cells also elaborate extensive membrane processes that progressively divide axon bundles and eventually segregate individual nerve fibers (11Webster H.d. Martin J.R. O'Connell M.F. Dev. Biol. 1973; 32: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As nerve development proceeds, changes in ECM structure and composition and ECM receptor expression occur. The most striking alteration is the appearance of the laminin-rich basal lamina structures that encase individual Schwann cells. Schwann cell contact with basal lamina-type ECM is required for myelin assembly (4Carey D.J. Todd M.S. Rafferty M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2224-2263Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and promotes the formation of stable axon-Schwann cell functional units. Our laboratory identified a novel type V collagen subunit, α4(V), that is expressed abundantly by premyelinating Schwann cells during the period of active Schwann cell migration (12Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Collagen type V molecules are synthesized by Schwann cells as heterotrimers that contain α1(V), α2(V), and α4(V) chains. In addition to the collagen triple helical domains, the α1(V) and α4(V) subunits contain non-collagenous N-terminal domains (NTD) that are retained in at least some mature collagen trimers secreted by Schwann cells. α4(V) collagen expression is reduced in terminally differentiated Schwann cells but is induced in response to nerve injury (13Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The α4(V) chain displays a high affinity for heparan sulfate and was isolated initially in a search for Schwann cell syndecan-3-binding proteins (14Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Syndecan-3 is a member of a family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that have been implicated in cell adhesion (8Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Syndecan-3 is expressed by Schwann cells in a temporal pattern that is essentially identical to that of α4(V) collagen (15Carey D.J.

Collagen type V purified from conditioned medium of Schwann cells exhibits distinct adhesive activities for Schwann cells and neurons. Schwann cell type V collagen molecules inhibit axonal migration through a mechanism that is dependent on the collagen triple helical domain (3Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Schwann cell collagen type V promotes Schwann cell migration via a mechanism that appears to depend on an interaction with the non-collagenous NTD. The goal of the current study was to characterize the interaction between Schwann cells and collagen type V. The results presented demonstrate heparan sulfate-dependent binding of Schwann cells to a high affinity heparin binding region of the α4(V)-NTD. Schwann cells were cultured from neonatal rat sciatic nerves as described previously (17Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For routine culture the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 μm forskolin on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. For the experiments reported in this study Schwann cells were used at the third or fourth passage. Expression and purification of recombinant rat α1(V)-NTD has been described previously (3Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat α4(V)-NTD cDNA, corresponding to amino acids 29–269 of the published sequence (12Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was cloned into the pET30a+ plasmid vector (Novagen). The plasmid was used to transform competent Escherichia coliBL21plysS cells. The recombinant His-tagged protein was purified using His-Bind affinity resin (Novagen). To express α4(V)-NTD fragments the cDNA sequence of interest was generated by PCR using appropriate primers with NTD cDNA as the template. These were cloned into the pET30a+ vector and expressed and purified as described above. A construct containing a deletion of the central basic region was produced by overlapping PCR using cDNA sequences that had been engineered to contain 20 base pairs of overlapping sequence as templates. All expression constructs were sequenced to verify the coding sequence and reading frame. Recombinant protein was assayed by SDS gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblot analysis with anti-His tag antibodies. To test the Schwann cell adhesion activity of the recombinant NTD constructs the proteins were used to coat the wells of 24-well plates (2 μg/cm2). The proteins were diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated in the wells at 37 °C for 18 h. The solution was removed, and the plates were blocked with a solution of 1% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at 37 °C for one hour. The blocking solution was removed, and the wells were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution. Schwann cells were removed from the dishes by trypsinization. Trypsin activity was inhibited by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The Schwann cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in serum-free medium containing 250 ng/ml heregulin peptide, and added to the protein-coated wells. The plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. In some experiments inhibitor compounds (glycosaminoglycans or recombinant proteins) were added to the culture medium at the time of plating. Cell attachment and spreading were assessed by phase-contrast microscopy of unfixed cells. For quantitative adhesion assays absorbance of crystal violet-stained formaldehyde-fixed cells was measured as described previously (3Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant NTD and NTD fragments were subjected to heparin affinity chromatography on prepacked HiTrap-Heparin HP columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The columns were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The proteins were diluted in equilibration buffer, and 100 μg of each protein was applied to the column. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4 (5 ml total) followed by a linear gradient of 0–2m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (30 ml total) and then 2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (5 ml total). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were quantitated with a laser scanning densitometer. Purified recombinant α4(V)-NTD was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. Detergent extracts of cultured Schwann cells were applied to the NTD column. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and then eluted with buffer containing 5 mm EDTA followed by 1 mNaCl. Aliquots of the column fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Antibodies used in these experiments were affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat syndecan-3 (15Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J.

Schwann cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with fluorescein-phalloidin (Molecular Probes), anti-vinculin (clone hVIN-1, Sigma),or anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies, as described previously (17Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).

Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-phosphoErk1/Erk2 (clone MAPK-YT, Sigma). The bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence that was detected and quantitated by means of a Roche Molecular Biochemicals Lumi-Imager. We demonstrated previously that Schwann cells adhere to and migrate on dishes coated with collagen type V purified from Schwann cell-conditioned medium (3Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify sites in collagen type V that mediate adhesive interactions with Schwann cells, neonatal rat Schwann cells were plated on dishes coated with various domains of type V collagen. Schwann cells plated on dishes coated with recombinant α4(V)-NTD attached rapidly and produced numerous processes (Fig.1 A). In contrast, Schwann cells initially adhered to but failed to spread on dishes coated with α1(V)-NTD (Fig. 1 B) or the collagen triple helical domain (Fig. 1 C) produced by pepsin digestion. The difference in activity between α1(V)-NTD and α4(V)-NTD was especially apparent when the Schwann cells were stained with fluorescein-phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Schwann cells plated on α4(V)-NTD produced numerous actin-containing processes (Fig. 1 D), whereas cells plated on α1(V)-NTD failed to extend processes or assemble an organized actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1 E). Schwann cells plated on α1(V)-NTD were similar in appearance to cells plated on bovine serum albumin-coated dishes (Fig. 1 F). When Schwann cell adhesion to NTD-coated dishes was quantitated by crystal violet staining of fixed cells, α4(V)-NTD exhibited significantly higher adhesive activity than α1(V)-NTD (Fig. 1 I). The adhesive preference displayed by Schwann cells was distinct from that of fibroblasts, which attached avidly and spread on dishes coated with pepsinized collagen type V but not α4(V)-NTD (Fig. 1, Gand H). Schwann cells that adhered to α4(V)-NTD-coated dishes contained organized cytoskeletal structures that included vinculin-containing focal adhesion-like structures (Fig.2 A), peripheral foci of phosphotyrosine staining (Fig. 2 B), and actin-rich filopodia (Fig. 2 C). Activation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to α4(V)-NTD adhesion was assayed by immunoblot analysis. For comparison, Schwann cells plated on collagen type IV and the non-physiological substrate poly-l-lysine were also examined. Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD or collagen type IV resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of bands at ∼125 and ∼200 kDa. These phosphorylated bands were not seen in Schwann cells adhering to poly-l-lysine (Fig. 2 D). Similarly, Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD or collagen type IV (but not poly-l-lysine) resulted in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 2 E). These results demonstrate that α4(V)-NTD produces a physiological adhesive response in Schwann cells. The α4(V) collagen chain is characterized by an unusually high affinity for the glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate (12Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, α4(V)-NTD bound to a heparin affinity column and required a sodium chloride concentration of 1 m to be eluted, demonstrating that high affinity heparin binding is a characteristic of the α4(V)-NTD. α1(V)-NTD, in contrast, bound to the heparin column but was eluted at a significantly lower NaCl concentration than α4(V)-NTD. These results suggest that Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD might be mediated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This conclusion was supported by the observation that Schwann cell adhesion and spreading on α4(V)-NTD-coated dishes was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin (Fig. 3, B–D). Inhibition by heparin was dose-dependent with half-maximal inhibition achieved at a concentration of ∼30 ng/ml. In contrast, the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate failed to inhibit Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD even at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig.3 D). The highly sulfated polysaccharide dextran sulfate inhibited Schwann cell adhesion to NTD, but it did so less effectively than heparin (Fig. 3 D), suggesting a role for sulfation in mediating the glycosaminoglycan-NTD interaction. A likely candidate for the high affinity heparin binding site within the α4(V)-NTD is a highly basic region of the primary sequence in which 16 of 23 amino acids are arginine or lysine (Fig.4 B). This sequence contains 4 repeats of the heparin binding consensus sequence BBXB (B is a basic amino acid) (18Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This basic sequence, which is not present in the α1(V)-NTD, is located near the center of the α4(V)-NTD adjacent to a region that shows a high degree of sequence similarity between the α1(V) and α4(V) chains (Fig. 4 A). A series of recombinant α4(V)-NTD fragments were expressed in bacteria (Fig. 4 A). Heparin binding activity was assessed by heparin affinity chromatography. N-terminal (29–268) or C-terminal (226–369, 246–369) fragments of the α4(V)-NTD that contained the central basic region bound to the heparin column and were eluted at a NaCl concentration of 1 m or greater (Fig. 4, Cand D), reflecting high affinity binding to heparin. Deletion of the basic segment from the N-terminal or C-terminal fragments dramatically reduced (29–245) or abolished (269–369) heparin binding activity. The importance of the basic segment was confirmed by producing a deletion construct that spanned the α4(V)-NTD but lacked the central basic region (Δ246–268). This protein bound to the heparin column but was eluted at a lower NaCl concentration than the full-length NTD protein that contained this segment (Fig. 4, C and D). To assess the importance of the high affinity heparin binding site in Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD, Schwann cells were plated on dishes coated with full-length α4(V)-NTD or the protein that lacked the central basic region (Δ246–268). Schwann cells adhered initially to the Δ246–268 construct, but Schwann cell spreading and process extension were markedly diminished compared with what was observed on full-length α4(V)-NTD (Fig.5, A and B). Staining of the cells with fluorescein-phalloidin revealed a significant decrease in the production of actin-containing processes and actin cytoskeleton organization in cells plated on Δ246–268 (Fig. 5, E and F). When Schwann cell adhesion was quantitated by crystal violet staining of fixed cells, significantly reduced adhesion was observed to dishes coated with the Δ246–268 protein compared with full-length α4(V)-NTD (Fig. 1 I). Further evidence for an important role of the high affinity heparin binding site was provided by determining the effects of soluble α4(V)-NTD fragments on Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD-coated dishes. Schwann cell spreading on α4(V)-NTD was almost completely inhibited by addition to the medium of the 246–369 NTD fragment (Fig.5 F), which contains the C-terminal portion of the α4(V)-NTD including the high affinity heparin binding site. In contrast, the 269–369 NTD fragment, which is identical to the 246–369 fragment except for a lack of the high affinity heparin binding site, had no effect on Schwann cell spreading on α4(V)-NTD-coated dishes (Fig. 5 G). The 269–369 NTD fragment was devoid of Schwann cell adhesive activity when it was used to coat culture dishes (data not shown). To identify Schwann cell proteins that bind to α4(V)-NTD, detergent extracts of Schwann cells were subjected to affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized α4(V)-NTD. Unbound and bound proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-3, identified as an immunoreactive high molecular weight smear, bound avidly to the α4(V)-NTD affinity column and was eluted by 1 m NaCl, consistent with charge-dependent binding characteristic of protein-glycosaminoglycan interactions. Syndecan-3 did not bind to unconjugated Sepharose beads (data not shown). α1β1 is a major collagen-binding integrin expressed by Schwann cells (3Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stewart H.J. Turner D. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 914-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Neither the α1 nor the β1 integrin subunits bound to immobilized α4(V)-NTD, although they were readily detected by immunoblot analysis of Schwann cell detergent extracts (data not shown). The ECM of the developing peripheral nervous system is biochemically and structurally complex, and it contains a number of proteins that are capable of interacting with other matrix proteins and with cells (10Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated a particular peripheral nerve ECM protein, collagen type V, which displays a surprising and somewhat unexpected range of functional activities. Collagen type V molecules are synthesized and secreted by premyelinating Schwann cells (12Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These collagen molecules are heterotrimers of α1(V), α2(V), and α4(V) subunits that are incorporated into fibrillar ECM structures where they co-localize with collagen type I molecules. The α1(V) and α4(V) subunits contain non-collagenous N-terminal domains. In contrast to what occurs for the fibrillar type I and type III collagen molecules, these non-collagenous domains are retained in at least some of the mature collagen trimers (12Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In an earlier study we demonstrated that collagen type V trimers purified from Schwann cells (which contained the α1(V) and α4(V) N-terminal domains) promoted the migration of Schwann cells but strongly inhibited the outgrowth of axons from embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons (3Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The triple helical domain of the collagen molecule was shown to account for the axon outgrowth-inhibiting activity but not the Schwann cell adhesive activity. In the present study, we have extended these observations and demonstrate that the α4(V)-NTD contains a novel heparan sulfate binding site that mediates Schwann cell adhesion. The heparin binding motif identified within the α4N(V)-NTD corresponds to a linear segment of the primary protein sequence that is extremely rich in basic amino acid residues. This segment contains four repeats of the consensus heparin binding sequence BBXB (18Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although many heparin-binding proteins have been shown to contain this consensus sequence, this appears to be the first extracellular protein shown to possess closely spaced multiple repeats of this motif. Analysis of heparin binding activities of synthetic peptides has shown that peptides with multiple repeats of this basic motif display significantly higher binding affinity for heparin than peptides with single copies (20Verrecchio A. Germann M.W. Schick B.P. Kung B. Twardowski T. San Antonio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings appear to explain the unusually high affinity of the α4(V)-NTD for heparin and heparan sulfate. Despite similarities in amino acid sequences, this high affinity heparin binding motif is not present in the α1(V)-NTD. This is consistent with the marked difference in Schwann cell adhesive activity of the two domains. Other heparin binding sites have been identified in collagen molecules (21San Antonio J. Slover J. Lawler J. Karnovsky M. Lander A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4746-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) including collagen type V (22Delacoux F. Fichard A. Geourjon C. Garrone R. Rugggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15069-15076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Some of these are present in the collagen triple helical domains. The functions of these binding sites are not known, but the affinity for heparin is significantly lower than that of the α4(V)-NTD site described here. When Schwann cell detergent extracts were fractionated on an α4(V)-NTD affinity column the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-3 bound to the column and was displaced by elution with a high concentration of sodium chloride. This suggests that Schwann cells bind to the α4(V)-NTD by means of heparan sulfate chains that are covalently attached to this proteoglycan. Further evidence for an important role of heparan sulfate binding in Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD comes from several observations. Schwann cell adhesion to α4(V)-NTD was strongly inhibited by soluble heparin, which presumably acts as a competitive inhibitor of cell-associated heparan sulfates. This inhibition was specific for glycosaminoglycans of the heparin/heparan sulfate family because another sulfated glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin sulfate) had no effect even at high concentrations. Furthermore, a recombinant α4(V)-NTD polypeptide that lacked the high affinity heparin binding site exhibited significantly lower adhesive activity for Schwann cells and failed to elicit formation of actin-containing processes. Finally, an α4(V)-NTD fragment that contained the heparin binding region was an effective inhibitor of Schwann cell spreading on α4(V)-NTD, whereas a fragment that lacked the heparin binding sequence but was otherwise identical had no effect. Transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including members of the syndecan family, have been shown to function as cell adhesion receptors (8Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1, for example, can mediate cell adhesion to fibronectin (23Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and to collagen (24Sanderson R.D. Sneed T.B. Young L.A. Sullivan G.L. Lander A.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3902-3911PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion and spreading of certain cells on fibronectin appears to depend on the cooperative activities of α5β1 integrins and syndecan-4, which bind to distinct fibronectin domains (25Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 112: 3415-3420Crossref Google Scholar). Fibronectin-dependent engagement of both α5β1 integrins and syndecan-4 has been shown to be required for assembly of focal adhesions and actin-containing stress fibers (26Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate-mediated adhesion of Schwann cells to α4(V)-NTD promotes actin cytoskeleton assembly and production of actin-containing processes. Association of syndecans with the actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated previously (27Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Tucker B. Bendt K.A. Cizmeci-Smith G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Carey D.J. Bendt K.M. Stahl R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Overexpression of syndecan-1 in Schwann cells increases cell spreading on syndecan-1 binding substrates (e.g. fibronectin) and enhances actin cytoskeleton assembly (27Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Clustering of cell surface syndecan-1 induces co-localization with underlying actin filaments (28Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Tucker B. Bendt K.A. Cizmeci-Smith G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This association is not observed for syndecan-1 molecules that lack the central portion of the cytoplasmic domain (29Carey D.J. Bendt K.M. Stahl R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4, which is expressed by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, is localized to focal contacts (30Woods A. Couchman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), regions of tight adhesion of cells to ECM, and sites for cytoskeleton-membrane binding and signal transduction. The mechanism of syndecan-actin filament association is not known. Syndecans contain short but highly conserved C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. There is no evidence for direct binding of syndecans to actin. The C-terminal tetrapeptide sequence of syndecans, which is conserved in all known syndecan sequences, binds certain PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as syntenin (31Grootjans J.J. Zimmerman P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and CASK (32Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chisti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The precise function of these proteins is not known, but they are thought to function as membrane scaffold proteins that bind signaling and structural proteins to the plasma membrane. Syndecans have also been implicated in adhesion-dependent signaling (25Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 112: 3415-3420Crossref Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 binds protein kinase C; binding appears to increase the catalytic activity of the kinase (33Oh E.-S. Woods A. Couchman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Oh E.-S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-40629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase C has been implicated in regulation of focal adhesion assembly and actin cytoskeleton organization. High level expression of the α4(V) collagen chain is highly restricted and occurs in developing peripheral nerves during the late gestational and early postnatal periods (12Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During this time the premyelinating Schwann cells and axons undergo a complex morphological transformation in which bundles of “naked” axons are invaded and progressively segregated by Schwann cell processes. This highly dynamic process is dependent on extensive migration of Schwann cells and movement of Schwann cell processes. The results presented here suggest that interactions of Schwann cells with the α4(V)-NTD play a role in promoting Schwann cell morphological plasticity through interactions with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors. This interaction is not needed to maintain the stable and highly ordered structure that characterizes the mature peripheral nervous system because α4(V) collagen expression declines significantly when development is completed. Expression of this collagen chain is rapidly up-regulated, however, following peripheral nerve denervation (13Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that α4(V) collagen might participate in peripheral nerve regeneration. It is believed that the inability of the central nervous system to regenerate following injury, in contrast to the peripheral nervous system, is a consequence of the molecular environment. α4(V) collagen, which is expressed in the peripheral but not the central nervous system, displays functional properties that suggest an important role in this process."

A considerable number of pivotal modification reactions commence already during the translocation of the extending polypeptide across the ER and facilitate ultimately the folding of the protein into a native conformation (for review see Ref.1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). Examples are signal sequence cleavage from the nascent polypeptide chain (2von Heijne G. J. Mol.

J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and transient interactions of the folding polypeptide with a set of ER resident accessory proteins, such as molecular chaperones (5Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the lumen of the ER, proteins assume their secondary and tertiary structures and, in the case of multisubunit polypeptides, assemble their individual subunits into heterodimeric, homodimeric, or larger order complexes (7Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Essentially only correctly folded and assembled proteins can egress the ER and continue their further journey along the secretory pathway. The conformational status of newly synthesized polypeptides is monitored in the lumen of the ER by an efficient quality control mechanism (8Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Proteins that fail to acquire a correct three-dimensional structure are retained in the ER and ultimately degraded, presumably in the cytosol by the ER-associated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (9Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence points to the possible existence of a monitoring system that operates beyond the ER. A naturally occurring mutant of intestinal sucrase-isomaltase (10Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or a temperature-sensitive mutant of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (11Chen S.S. Huang A.S. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 210-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) exit the ER but are blocked in a pre-Golgi compartment instead of transported further to their final destination, the cell surface. The acquisition of a protein to a configuration similar to that of the mature and biologically active species does not always constitute an absolute requirement for its transport along the secretory pathway to the final destination. Nevertheless, retarded transport kinetics and impaired function are frequently the consequences of altered protein folding as has been demonstrated for some mutants of the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus (12Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and deletion mutants of intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (13Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S.

Presumably, for some proteins only correct folding of particular subdomains is adequate for their mobility along the secretory pathway. It is conceivable that the structural features of the protein critically determine whether or not a protein is retained in the ER by binding specific chaperones if it did not fulfill particular folding criteria. Several proteins possess proregions or propeptides at the N-terminal end, which undergo cleavage during or after maturation of the precursor polypeptide. Cleavage of these propeptides is associated in many cases with biological activation of the final mature form of the protein (15Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) as in the cases of zymogens, neuropeptides, and prohormones (16Steiner D.F. Docherty K. Carroll R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An important function of propeptides is that of an intramolecular chaperone that regulates and affects the folding of the precursor protein. A well-studied example is subtilisin. The propeptide of this protein comprises 77 amino acids and is critically important for the folding of the remaining 275 amino acids that constitute the mature and active protein (17Zhu X.L. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Human small intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH, EC 3.2.1.23–62), an important component of the brush-border membrane, comprises a relatively large proregion (LPHα) that accounts for about 45% of the precursor molecule (prepro-LPH, 1927 amino acids) (18Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and a brush-border mature polypeptide, LPHβ. Initial studies have demonstrated that LPH is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide precursor, prepro-LPH, that undergoes two sequential intracellular cleavage steps: the first in the ER to pro-LPH (215-kDa) and the second, following terminal glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus, to a 160-kDa LPH (19Skovbjerg H. Danielsen E.M. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 798: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J.

Based on sequence analyses of various biosynthetic forms of LPH, recent studies have provided an unequivocal evidence for the existence of an additional cleavage step occurring extracellularly in the intestinal lumen (22Jacob R. Radebach I. Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial cleavage step of complex-glycosylated pro-LPH takes place at residues Arg734/Leu735, implicates a trypsin-like protease, and generates an LPH polypeptide encompassing residues 735–1927 (23Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that was denoted LPHβinitial (24Yeh K.Y. Yeh M. Holt P.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G379-G384PubMed Google Scholar). The LPHβinitial molecule is subsequently targeted to the brush-border membrane where a final digestion by luminal trypsin occurs at Arg868/Ala869, which eliminates a peptide stretch from residues Leu735 to Arg868 yielding LPHβfinal (22Jacob R. Radebach I. Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Sterchi E.E. Naim H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Wuthrich M. Grunberg J. Hahn D. Jacob R. Radebach I. Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This form is the polypeptide that exerts its enzymatic function as a β-galactosidase in the small intestine. The cleavage of pro-LPH to LPHβinitial and its potential implications on the function and trafficking on this form has been studied in heterologous transfection systems. Meanwhile it has become clear that uncleaved pro-LPH is a transport-competent (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a correctly sorted (26Grunberg J. Luginbuhl U. Sterchi E.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an enzymatically active molecule (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hence cleavage of pro-LPH in intestinal cells is neither required for activation of the enzyme, nor is it implicated in the transport and sorting events. LPHβinitial contains all the information needed for apical sorting of pro-LPH, whereas LPHα is devoid of sorting signals despite striking sequence homologies shared with LPHβinitial (18Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, the LPHα profragment is devoid of catalytic activity, because the lactase and phlorizin hydrolase activities have been assigned to glutamates 1271 and 1747 of LPHβfinal, respectively (28Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, moreover, the activities of the precursor pro-LPH and LPHβfinal are identical (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for lactose or phlorizin hydrolysis. Based on the initial concepts that pro-LPH is immediately cleaved at the Arg868/Ala869 site a cDNA clone encoding the polypeptide Ala869-Phe1927, LPHβfinal, was expressed individually in the absence of the profragment, and its biosynthetic and structural features were analyzed. It was shown that the polypeptide generated was an enzymatically inactive protein, and most of it was retained as a mannose-rich glycosylated indicative of a predominant ER localization. This has lead to the hypothesis that the profragment LPHα functions as an intramolecular chaperone that is implicated in the folding of the LPHβ domain in the ER (29Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intestinal form of LPHα is neither N- nor O-glycosylated, despite the presence of five potential N-glycosylation sites, and is rich in cysteine and hydrophobic amino acid residues. These features have suggested that LPHα folds rapidly into a tight and rigid globular domain in which carbohydrate attachment sites are no longer accessible to glycosyltransferases. In this paper we investigate the folding features of LPHβ and LPHβinitial and the putative role of LPHα as an intramolecular chaperone. Additionally, in view of the new constellation that the initial cleavage occurs at Arg734/Leu735 rather than at Arg868-Ala869, it became important to determine the role of the polypeptide stretch Leu735-Arg868in the processing and folding within the pro-LPH species.

For immunoprecipitation of human LPH mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) of hybridoma HBB 1/909 (20Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and MLac 2, MLac 6, and MLac 8 (31Maiuri L. Raia V. Potter J. Swallow D. Ho M.W. Fiocca R. Finzi G. Cornaggia M. Capella C. Quaroni A. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used. The antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. Hans-Peter Hauri (Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland), Dr. Erwin Sterchi (University of Bern, Switzerland), and Dr. Dallas Swallow (Medical Research Council, London, UK). LPHα was precipitated with the polyclonal antibody V496 directed against the N-terminal part of the prodomain (30Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-BiP and anti-calnexin antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. Neil Bulleid, University of Manchester, UK. LPHβinitialwas cloned in two steps. First, the cDNA encoding the signal sequence of pro-LPH, LPHsignal, was amplified by PCR as described before (30Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second part of the cDNA comprising the last 20 nucleotides of the LPH signal sequence (nucleotides 52–71) and nucleotides 2203–3572 of LPHβinitial was synthesized by PCR using LPHcDNA as template and the oligonucleotides LPHsig/beta (GTT TTT CAT GCT GGG GGT CAC TGT TGC AGT TTG TAT CCC T) and cLPH3600 (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both DNA fragments were then fused by assembly PCR and cloned with the 3′-EcoRI/HindIII fragment of LPH cDNA into the unique EcoRI site of the pJB20 expression vector (27Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a three-way ligation. The resulting construct denoted pJB20-LPHβinitial was sequenced and found to contain the signal sequence of pro-LPH fused in-frame to the cDNA beginning with nucleotide 2203. For the generation of a CFP fusion protein the EcoRI/ScaI fragment of pJB20-LPHβinitial was subcloned into theEcoRI/SmaI-digested pECFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) to generate pLPHβinitial-CFP. The profragment of pro-LPH, LPHα, extending to nucleotide 2202 was first amplified from the LPHcDNA template by PCR with the primer pair LPH1 (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)/cLPHα (AAT CTA GAG CCT CCT TAT CCC CCA G), which inserts a stop codon at position 2203 in the LPHαcDNA. This DNA fragment was inserted into the unique EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The resulting construct, pcDNA3-LPHα, was confirmed by sequencing. LPHα and YFP were fused by PCR amplification of LPHα using full-length LPHcDNA as template with the primer pair LPH1HindIII (AAA AGC TTC CTA GAA AAT GGA GCT G)/cLPHαSalI (CCT CGT CGA CCT CCT TAT CCC CCA GGG) and ligation of the PCR product into the HindIII/SalI sites of pEYFP-N1. The generated plasmid was confirmed by sequencing and named pLPHα-YFP. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with DNA by using DEAE-dextran essentially as described previously (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pJB20-LPHβinitial, pcDNA3-LPHα, or a mixture of both plasmids, pLPHα-YFP and pLPHβinitial-CFP, were used. 48 h after transfection, the cells were biosynthetically labeled. Here, the cells were preincubated with 5 ml of methionine-free MEM for 1 h after which time the medium was changed and replaced by a similar medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine. Labeling was performed for 1 h followed by a chase with non-labeled methionine for 4 h. After labeling, the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% TX-100 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell extracts were centrifuged to remove cell debris while the supernatant was retained for the subsequent immunoprecipitation. After 1 h of preclearing with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the immunoprecipitation was performed with polyclonal anti-LPHα (V496) or a mixture of mAb anti-LPH (MLac 2, MLac 6, and MLac 8) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose as described previously (13Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10630-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For assessment of the interaction of the various LPHβinitial forms with BiP or calnexin, the cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-BiP or mAb anti-calnexin (32Jacob R. Bulleid N.J. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18678-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in 1% SDS for 10 min followed by 10-fold dilution of SDS using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Thereafter the samples were immunoprecipitated with a mixture of anti-LPH antibodies directed against native and denatured forms of the protein. The immunoprecipitates were further processed on SDS-PAGE. LPHβinitialwas immunoprecipitated from transient transfected COS-1 cells labeled with [35S]methionine for 6 h. The immunoprecipitates were treated with 50 μg/ml trypsin for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The vector pcDNA3-LPHα containing the profragment of human pro-LPH was linearized with ApaI. Transcription was initiated with T7-RNA polymerase and carried out essentially as described before (32Jacob R. Bulleid N.J. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18678-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the mixture was extracted once with phenol/chloroform and twice with chloroform. After ethanol precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water. Translation of the newly synthesized RNA was performed in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The reaction mixture comprised 18 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of 1 mm amino acids (minus methionine), 15 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine, and 3 μl of transcribed RNA. Where indicated, the samples were supplemented with 1 μl of nuclease-treated microsomal membranes. Translations were performed in the absence or presence of 2 or 6 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG) at 30 °C for 60 min. Microsomal membranes were isolated as described by Bulleid and Freedman (33Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by mixing with 5 vol. of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, SDS (2% w/v), glycerol (10% w/v), and bromphenol blue) in the presence of 50 mmdithiothreitol for reducing conditions and for non-reducing conditions in the presence of 100 mm iodoacetamide and boiled for 5 min. After electrophoresis, gels were processed for autoradiography and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Confocal images of living cells were acquired 2 days after transfection on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with a ×63 water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems) (34Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Dual color CFP and YFP images were obtained by sequential scans with the 458- and 514-nm excitation lines of an argon laser and the optimal emission wavelength for CFP or YFP, respectively. Lactase activity was measured according to Dahlqvist (35Dahlqvist A. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 22: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) using lactose as substrate. LPHβinitialwas immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of transiently transfected COS-1 cells. For each determination of the lactase activity, the lysate equivalent to fourteen 100-mm-diameter dishes of confluent cells was utilized. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently assayed for lactase activity essentially as described (25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F (endo F/GF) was performed as previously described (21Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase treatment of immunoprecipitates was performed in 20 mm sodium citrate, 20 mm Tris-malate buffer (pH 6.0) and protease inhibitors for 2 h at 37 °C essentially as described by Jacob et al. (27Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the initial cleavage product, LPHβinitial(Leu735-Phe1927) was fused to the signal sequence of pro-LPH to allow translocation across the ER membrane (Fig.1). Expression of this hybrid form in COS-1 cells and assessment of its glycosylation pattern using endo H sensitivity revealed a strongly labeled 150-kDa mannose-rich polypeptide (LPHβinitial/h) in addition to a 175-kDa endo H-resistant complex protein (LPHβinitial/c). The proportions of these two forms at steady state demonstrated a predominant presence of the mannose-rich protein with ∼70% of the total LPHβinitial protein. When LPHβfinalwas expressed individually the amount of complex-glycosylated LPHβfinal was substantially reduced (30Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting a role of the Leu735-Arg866 stretch in the processing of LPHβinitial. Nevertheless, the processing of mannose-rich LPHβinitial (LPHβinitial/h) to the complex-glycosylated form (LPHβinitial/c) was markedly less efficient in comparison with that of wild type pro-LPH (Fig. 2 A) pointing to an altered folding pattern of LPHβ in the absence of the profragment. The enzymatic activity of lactase has been assigned to residues Glu1273 and Glu1749 within the LPHβinitial domain (36Zecca L. Mesonero J.E. Stutz A. Poiree J.C. Giudicelli J. Cursio R. Gloor S.M. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Individual expression of this domain is associated with a drastic reduction in the lactase activity (Table I) reminiscent of a misfolded structure of LPHβinitial at least at or in the vicinity of the catalytic site. However, the partial conversion of LPHβinitial from a mannose-rich polypeptide into a complex-glycosylated protein suggests that a proportion of the LPHβinitial protein has acquired a correct conformation albeit at a slower rate. Alternatively, minimal folding requirements of LPHβinitial were fulfilled permitting the partially folded protein to egress the ER. We wanted therefore to determine whether slowing down the processing rate of LPHβinitialand prolonging its residence time in the ER influences the structural features of LPHβinitial and its biological activity. For this purpose, cells transfected with the cDNA encoding LPHβinitial were labeled biosynthetically at 20 °C. Fig. 2 B shows that the mannose-rich polypeptide was converted to a complex-glycosylated protein after 8 h of chase. Interestingly, this protein was now as enzymatically active as its wild type pro-LPH counterpart (Ref. 25Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). We next compared the fate of LPHβinitial under the two different labeling temperatures by employing a pulse-chase protocol. Here, a dramatic difference in the turnover rates was observed. Although LPHβinitial was gradually degraded with increasing chase periods at 37 °C, longer chase periods of up to 24 h at 20 °C have resulted in an efficient conversion of mannose-rich LPHβinitial/h to a meanwhile predominantly labeled complex-glycosylated LPHβinitial/c.Figure 2Biosynthesis and transport kinetics of LPH βinitial in COS-1 cells. A, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pJB20-LPHβinitial, biosynthetically labeled for 6 h followed by immunoprecipitation of LPHβinitial. The immunoprecipitates were divided into three aliquots and treated with endo H, endo F/GF, or not treated. The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 1 h at 37 °C followed by different chase times at 20 °C or 37 °C. Cells were lysed, and the immunopr"
https://openalex.org/W2161260377,"Hsp90 plays critical roles in the proper functioning of a wide array of eukaryotic signal transducers such as steroid receptors and tyrosine kinases. Hap1 is a naturally occurring substrate of Hsp90 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hap1 transcriptional activity is precisely and stringently controlled by heme. Previous biochemical studies suggest that in the absence of heme, Hap1 is bound to Hsp90 and other proteins, forming a higher order complex termed HMC (high molecular weight complex), and is repressed. Heme promotes the disruption of the HMC and activates Hap1, permitting Hap1 to bind to DNA with high affinity and to stimulate transcription. By lowering the expression levels of wild-type Hsp90, using a highly specific Hsp90 inhibitor, and by examining the effects of various Hsp90 mutants on Hap1, we show that Hsp90 is critical for Hap1 activation by heme. Furthermore, we show that many Hsp90 mutants exert differential effects on Hap1 and steroid receptors. Notably, mutant G313N weakens Hsp90 steroid receptor interaction but strongly enhances Hsp90-Hap1 interaction and increases Hap1 resistance to protease digestion. Additionally, we found that a heme-independent Hap1 mutant still depends on Hsp90 for high activity. These experiments together suggest that Hsp90 promotes Hap1 activation by inducing or maintaining Hap1 in a transcriptionally active conformation.

The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is a highly conserved stress-induced protein that is ubiquitously expressed in almost all cells at a high level (1Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

It is highly probable that Hsp90 promotes the actions of diverse substrates by different mechanisms. Even among nuclear hormone receptors, the modes of Hsp90 action are quite different. Although Hsp90 forms stable complexes with steroid receptors, it does not form complexes with vitamin receptors, but it is important for the activity of vitamin receptors (4Dalman F.C.

Birkhauser, Boston1998: 1-18Crossref Google Scholar) have suggested that Hsp90 probably plays a common dual role in steroid signaling-maintaining receptors in a repressed state in the absence of ligand and promoting ligand activation by keeping the receptors in a high ligand binding affinity conformation. Genetic studies (8Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 9Picard D. Freedman L.P. Molecular Biology of Steroid and Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Birkhauser, Boston1998: 1-18Crossref Google Scholar) in yeast have provided valuable insights into the function of Hsp90 in steroid signaling. However, this approach is somewhat compromised by the fact that many of these previously studied proteins, such as steroid receptors and tyrosine kinases, are not naturally occurring in yeast. Thus, the events observed in yeast may not exactly reflect the bona fide functions of Hsp90. Therefore, it is necessary to study the role of Hsp90 in signaling pathways with natural yeast substrates. Recent studies (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Louvion J.F. Abbas-Terki T. Picard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3071-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have identified a few natural substrates of Hsp90 in yeast including the heme activator protein Hap1 and Ste11 of the pheromone-signaling pathway. In particular, Hap1 is a versatile transcriptional regulator whose activity is precisely and stringently controlled by heme concentrations (12Zhang L. Hach A. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hap1 mediates the effect of oxygen on gene expression in yeast. In response to heme, Hap1 binds to upstream activation sequences (UASs) 1UASupstream activation sequenceRPMrepression moduleHRMheme-responsive motifGRglucocorticoid receptor of numerous genes encoding functions required for respiration and for controlling oxidative damage and activates transcription of these genes (13Pfeifer K.

Biol. 1988; 204: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Hap1 also activates the transcription of the ROX1gene encoding the Rox1 repressor, which represses the transcription of genes encoding anaerobic-specific functions such as ANB1(15Zitomer R.S.

Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RPMs and HRMs are two distinct classes of Hap1 elements essential for heme regulation (17Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Hon T. Hach A. Lee H.C. Chen T. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RPMs mediate Hap1 repression in the absence of heme; the deletion or disruption of any one of RPMs causes Hap1 to gain high levels of activity even in the absence of heme (17Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HRMs, particularly HRM7, bind to heme and mediate the activation of Hap1 in response to heme (17Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Hon T. Hach A. Lee H.C. Chen T. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, heme regulation of Hap1 appears to involve certain cellular proteins including the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the absence of heme, Hap1 is bound by Hsp90, Ydj1, and other proteins, forming a high molecular weight complex termed HMC (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Hach A. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 4 °C, the HMC is able to bind DNA with low affinity in vitro as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When heme binds to Hap1, the HMC is disrupted, and Hap1 binds DNA with high affinity to activate transcription (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Hach A. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Zhang L. Guarente L.

In this report, to test rigorously the functional importance of Hsp90 in heme regulation of Hap1 and to decipher the molecular mechanism by which Hsp90 promotes heme regulation, we carried out extensive functional and biochemical analyses of the effects of various Hsp90 mutants on Hap1 activity and on Hap1 heme responsiveness. We found that Hsp90 is critical for heme activation of Hap1. Defective Hsp90 function greatly diminishes Hap1 activation by heme. However, individual Hsp90 mutants exert different effects on Hap1 activity and on Hap1-Hsp90 interaction compared with those exerted on the activities of steroid receptors and on Hsp90-steroid receptor interaction. Our data also suggest that a heme-independent LexA-Hap1 mutant protein is still Hsp90-dependent. These results support the idea that Hsp90 promotes Hap1 activation by inducing or maintaining Hap1 in a transcriptionally active conformation. Yeast strains used were W303Δhem1 (MATα can1–100 ade2–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 hem1-Δ100), HU1-GRGZΔhem1 (MATα can1–100 ade2–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 hsc82::LEU2 hsp82::LEU2 hem1-Δ100 pGAL1-HSP82), and LEPHsp82Δhem1 (MATα can1–100 ade2–1 his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ura3–1 hsc82::LEU2 hsp82::LEU2 pLEP1HSP82 hem1-Δ100) derived from Trp-303, HU1-GRGZ, and LEPHsp82 (6Bohen S.P.

Expression plasmids for wild-type Hsp82 and mutants (A576T/R579K, T525I, E431K, and G313N) are as described previously (6Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for wild-type Hsp82 and mutants G170D, A41V, E381K, A587T, G313S, and T101I are as described previously (25Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell.

Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Strains expressing only a mutant Hsp90 protein were created by plasmid shuffling. The Δhem1 strain was generated as described previously (26Haldi M. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17107-17112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Haldi M.L. Guarente L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The UAS1/CYC1-lacZ reporter plasmid has been described previously (28Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To measure β-galactosidase levels from the Hap1-driven reporter gene at various heme concentrations, yeast cells were transformed with the UAS1/CYC1-TATA (CYC1)-lacZ reporter plasmid. Cells were grown in synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose with limiting amounts of heme precursor δ-aminolevulinate (2 μg/ml) to an optical density (A) of approximately 1.0 and diluted 2-fold in medium containing various concentrations of heme analogue, deuteroporphyrin (dpIX). Cells were then grown for 7 h and harvested for determination of β-galactosidase activity as described previously (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Hon T. Hach A. Lee H.C. Chen T. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase levels from the LexA operator-lacZ reporter (29Pina B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the basal reporter pLG178 (30Guarente L. Lalonde B. Gifford P. Alani E. Cell. 1984; 36: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) were similarly measured. β-Galactosidase levels from the GR-driven reporter gene at various deoxycorti-costerone concentrations were measured as described previously (25Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared according to previously established protocols (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to A = 0.8, harvested, and resuspended in three packed cell volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin). Cells bearing theGAL1-driven HAP1 expression vector (28Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were induced by 2% galactose for 5–6 h prior to collection as described previously (17Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were then permeabilized by agitation with four packed cell volumes of glass beads, and extracts were collected. Protein concentrations were subsequently determined by Bradford assay. DNA binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume with 5% glycerol, 4 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 ng/μl of heme, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 3 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 10 μmZnOAc2, and 300 μg/ml of BSA as described previously (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,18Hon T. Hach A. Lee H.C. Chen T. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 0.01 pmol of labeled DNA and 20 μg of protein extracts were used in each reaction. The Hap1 antibody was included in reaction mixtures as described previously (31Zhang L. Bermingham M.O. Turcotte B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2851-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and then loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels in one-third of Tris borate/EDTA for gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. Radioactivity of the interested bands was visualized and quantified by using the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). Whole cell extracts were first separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Hap1 and Hsp90 were detected by using antibodies against glutathione S-transferase-Hap1 (residues 1–171) (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and Hsp90 (24Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by a chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (17Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Hon T. Hach A. Lee H.C. Chen T. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts prepared from cells expressing Hap1 and wild-type Hsp90 or mutants were incubated with elastase or other proteases for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were then stopped by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel-loading dye and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis. For DNA pull-down assays, extracts prepared from cells expressing Hap1 and wild-type or mutant Hsp82 were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (DYNAL) prebound with the biotinylated Hap1 binding site under the same condition as that for electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described above. The beads were extensively washed and boiled in SDS gel-loading buffer to release the bound proteins (32Reddy S.V. Alcantara O. Boldt D.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsp90 is encoded by two functionally equivalent and independent genes, HSC82, which is constitutively expressed at a high level and induced only 2–3-fold by stress, and HSP82, which is constitutively expressed at a low level and strongly induced by stress (2Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Hsp82 and Hsc82 share a 97.6% identity. Previously, we have shown that these Hsp90 proteins are components of the high order Hap1 complex, HMC, formed in the absence of heme (10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility here that the interaction of Hsp90 with Hap1 is an artifact and to ascertain whether and how this interaction is important for heme regulation, we examined the effects of defective Hsp90 function on Hap1 activity. First, we examined the effect of low levels of Hsp90 on Hap1 activity at a range of heme concentrations in a strain carrying deletions of the wild-typeHSC82 and HSP82 genes and expressing Hsp90 from the inducible GAL1 promoter (Fig.1 A). Low Hsp90 expression levels were achieved by culturing cells in the presence of 1% galactose and 1% glucose. Wild-type expression levels were achieved by culturing cells in the presence of 2% galactose (8Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When Hsp82 and Hsc82 are under the control of their natural promoters, Hap1 activity is not reduced by the presence of glucose (17Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Guarente L. Lalonde B. Gifford P. Alani E. Cell. 1984; 36: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). At heme concentrations that permit Hap1 activation, Hap1 activity was greatly reduced in cells (1% galactose) expressing low levels of Hsp90 compared with cells (2% galactose) expressing high levels of Hsp90 (Fig. 1 A). However, Hap1 remained repressed in the absence of heme. We confirmed Hsp90 protein levels in these cells by Western blotting (see Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, in wild-type cells in which Hsc82 and Hsp82 are expressed from their own promoters, Hap1 activity was somewhat higher in cells grown in medium containing 1% glucose and 1% galactose than in cells grown in medium containing 2% galactose (Fig. 1 C). This finding shows that the difference in the galactose/glucose ratio of media did not contribute to the reduction of Hap1 activity caused by low Hsp90 expression levels. Similar results were obtained when we measured Hap1 activity in a strain that expresses a low level of Hsp90 in normal medium due to a mutant promoter (24Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the LEP-HSP82 expression plasmid (data not shown). To provide an independent method for inhibiting Hsp90 function, we employed an Hsp90-specific inhibitor in wild-type cells (Fig.1 D). Macbecin I (33Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is one of the ansamycin antibiotics. This family of inhibitors includes geldanamycin, which is more commonly used in mammalian cells, and Macbecin I, which is more effective in yeast. Both bind to Hsp90 with a high degree of specificity and inhibit its activity (34Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar, 35Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). They are frequently used to identify specific substrates of Hsp90 (35Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 36Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Macbecin I greatly reduced Hap1 activity (Fig. 1 D) at heme concentrations that normally activate Hap1, but did not affect Hap1 repression in the absence of heme. The effect of Macbecin I on Hap1 is similar to its effect on steroid receptors and on the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (33Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that Hsp90 function is critical for Hap1 activation by heme. To further ascertain the role of Hsp90 in heme regulation of Hap1 and to gain insights into the mode of Hsp90 action, we examined the effects of three sets of Hsp90 mutants (6Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) on Hap1 activity. The first set includes four mutants with point mutations in Hsp90, A576T/R579K, E431K, T525I, and G313N (6Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The second set of mutants examined include three deletion mutants, 1–704, 1–685, and Δ211–259 (7Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The third set of mutants includes six mutants with point mutations, G170D, A41V, E381K, A587T, G313S, and T101I (25Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). G170D is a classical temperature-sensitive mutant that appears to be near wild type at 25 °C or at lower temperatures but completely loses its activity at 34 °C or at higher temperatures (25Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of these mutants on Hap1 activity at various heme concentrations in cells expressing wild-type or mutant Hsp90 alone (Fig. 2, A–D). The first set of mutants exerts varying effects on glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor, but G313N greatly reduced the activities of these receptors (6Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas T525I moderately reduced GR activity (38Bohen S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our data (Fig.2 A) show that G313N greatly reduced the extent of Hap1 activation by heme. At heme concentrations that permit Hap1 activation, Hap1 activity in cells expressing G313N was much lower than that in cells expressing wild-type Hsp90. T525I, A576T/R579K, and E431K had no significant effect beyond the variations that can be contributed to standard deviations (Fig. 2 A). The second set of mutants does not have a significant effect on GR, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor (7Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Curiously, we found that mutant Δ211–259 enhanced Hap1 activity, whereas mutants 1–685 and 1–704 appeared to slightly reduce Hap1 activity (Fig. 2 B). The difference between GR and Hap1 became more apparent when the third set of Hsp90 mutants was analyzed (Fig. 2, C–E). At permissive temperatures, GR activity is most severely diminished by G313S, whereas it is moderately diminished by T101I and A587T (see Fig.2 C and Table I) (25Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). By contrast, Hap1 activity was greatly diminished by A587T and T101I and was moderately reduced by G313S (Fig. 2 D and Table I).

As expected, G170D had little effect on Hap1 activity at 28 °C (Fig. 2 D) but strongly reduced Hap1 activity at 34 °C at all tested heme concentrations, which permit Hap1 activation (Fig. 2 E).

Here, we analyzed the oligomerization of the AQP3 aquaglyceroporin, which presents a mixed selectivity for water, glycerol, and urea. At first, based on transcript detection by reverse transcription-PCR from human erythroid tissues and membrane expression detected by flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrated that AQP3 is expressed on human and rat but not on mouse red blood cells. Then, the quaternary structure of AQP3 was determined using as models human red blood cell membranes, which carry both AQP1 and AQP3, and two heterologous expression systems:Xenopus laevis oocyte, for density and size estimation of aquaporins, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, which expressed a non-glycosylated form of AQP3. By velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradient after non-denaturing detergent solubilization, AQP3 was essentially found as mono- and dimeric species in conditions under which AQP1 preserved its tetrameric structure. Freeze-fracture studies on oocyte plasma membranes gave a size of AQP3 particles in favor of a dimeric or trimeric structure. Finally, by cross-linking experiments with red blood cell membranes, AQP3 is visible as different oligomeric structures, including a tetrameric one.

The latter approach has been used extensively to study the structural and functional properties of some other members of the MIP family and has confirmed the tetrameric form of strict aquaporins (15Kamsteeg E.J.

Although all proteins of the MIP family might have a similar quaternary structure due to their general topology, the low identity of some segments and the difference of selectivity observed between aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins suggest that they could not share the same organization. In fact, whereas the tetrameric organization has been demonstrated for most of the strict aquaporins by biochemical and biophysical approaches, only the quaternary structure of GlpF (for which the results are unclear) has been studied. By freeze-fracture structure studies and velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients, GlpF appeared to be monomeric in Xenopus laevis oocyte (25Lagrée V. Froger A. Deschamps S. Pellerin I.

In contrast, cross-linking experiments (27Manley D.M. McComb M.E. Perreault H. Donald L.J. Duckworth H.W. O'Neil J.D.

For this purpose, we used velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradient of AQP3 solubilized from the native system, human erythrocytes, which possess both AQP1 (tetrameric) and AQP3, or from heterologous systems (Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast and X. laevisoocyte). Indeed, in a previous work, we (29Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) underlined the presence of AQP3 in human red blood cell (RBC) membranes by immunological and functional studies. In this study, we confirmed these findings by identification of the transcripts in human fetal liver, bone marrow, and reticulocytes and by immunological analysis by flow cytometry with specific antibodies. In addition, freeze-fracture experiments were performed to compare the size of human AQP1 (hAQP1) and rat AQP3 (rAQP3) expressed in X. laevis oocyte membrane and to determine the degree of oligomerization of these molecules according to Eskandari et al. (30Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking using disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was also carried out to further analyze the oligomerization state of hAQP3 on RBCs.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies (29Roudier N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have shown by biochemical and functional approaches that the AQP3 protein is present on human RBC membranes. Our present studies, including nested reverse transcription-PCR from human erythroid tissues (reticulocytes, bone marrow, fetal liver), flow cytometry, and immunoblot analysis, indicate that the AQP3 transcript is present in erythroid tissues and confirmed that the AQP3 protein is present on the human RBCs. These findings contradict those of Yanget al. (38Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and might be explained by a difference in either the antibodies used or in sample preparation (RBC permeabilization). AQP3 was also present on rat RBCs but was absent from mouse RBCs as shown here by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis with the anti-rAQP3 antibody. This antibody, however, was able to detect AQP3 in kidney homogenate from both rat and mouse. The absence of AQP3 in mouse RBCs was also observed by Yang et al. (38Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

Yeager M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). An important issue related to these studies is to determine whether there is a possible link between the membrane organization and the selectivity of MIP proteins and more specifically whether or not aquaglyceroporins and glycerol facilitators are also tetrameric. Some studies have been done on GlpF by all three methods described before to answer this question. After solubilization in non-denaturing detergent and velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradient, GlpF was found to be monomeric when expressed in oocyte membranes (25Lagrée V. Froger A. Deschamps S.

In freeze-fracture studies, the sizes of IMPs of oocyte membranes expressing GlpF were found to be smaller than those found for AQPcic, 5.8 versus 8 nm, also suggesting a monomeric form of GlpF in oocyte membranes (46Bron P. Lagree V. Froger A. Rolland J.P. Hubert J.F. Delamarche C. Deschamps S. Pellerin I. Thomas D. Haase W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). By contrast, the projection map of GlpF crystals showed that the protein is present as tetramers (28Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar).Here, we attempted for the first time to determine the membranous organization of the AQP3 aquaglyceroporin that possesses a mixed selectivity (water/solutes). We used the human RBC membranes, which bring the advantage to possess both AQP1 and AQP3 in their native states, and also two heterologous systems: yeast, expressing a non-glycosylated form of AQP3, and oocyte, used for size estimation of AQP3 by freeze-fracture. We first studied the migration of these proteins in a sucrose gradient after treatment with denaturing and non-denaturing detergents. The observation of monomeric and dimeric forms for AQP3 in all membranes led us to consider two possibilities: (i) AQP3 is present in monomeric and dimeric forms in membranes and (ii) AQP3 resides in tri- and/or tetrameric forms in membranes but shows a higher sensitivity to non-denaturing detergents than AQP1. Our results show that important differences of sensitivity to non-denaturing detergents exist between AQP1 and AQP3. Interestingly, a recent study by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis showed that variation of the ionic strength can change the oligomeric state of GlpF and that Mg2+ stabilizes its tetramer assembly (47Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, our results present some similarities with the results obtained on GlpF regarding the various oligomerization state of AQP3, which may vary according to the analytical technique used, notably the low ionic condition that favors monomer formation.Freeze-fracture studies have already been used to estimate the IMP diameter into plasma membranes where aquaporins were expressed (12Verbavatz J.M.

Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Further analysis by freeze-fracture studies on oocyte plasma membranes revealed only a small difference between the IMP size of AQP3 and AQP1, thus suggesting an oligomeric state of AQP3. However, it is difficult to determine which oligomeric state of AQP3 predominates into oocyte plasma membrane due to the weak precision concerning the evaluation of the thickness of the platine-carbon layer. The mean size of a dimer and trimer of 3-nm-diameter units (size of AQP1 monomer (12Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)) are 4.5 and 6.0, respectively (46Bron P. Lagree V. Froger A. Rolland J.P. Hubert J.F. Delamarche C. Deschamps S. Pellerin I. Thomas D. Haase W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The addition of a small layer of platine-carbon (0.75 nm) is compatible with a trimeric structure, whereas a more consequent replica (1.5 nm) should be in favor of a dimeric structure. The diameter size of the tetrameric AQP1 in our study (8.2) means that, with our apparatus, the platinum thickness is probably small, around 0.85 nm according to the mean diameter of 6.5 nm from a theoretical tetrameric complex (44Walz T. Typke D. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If we assume that AQP3 is a tetramer in membranes, the difference in the diameter of the particles seen by freeze-fracture could be due either to a difference in the shape of the tetramer, which is perhaps more compact with tight monomers, or to a more important embedding of AQP3 in lipid bilayer as proposed by van Hoek et al. (37van Hoek A.N. Yang B. Kirmiz S. Brown D. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) comparing aquaporin sizes in Chinese hamster ovary, or to both. We must also keep in mind that injecting exogenous cRNA in X. laeviscould sometimes lead to the expression of endogenous proteins (49Schreiber R. Greger R. Nitschke R. Kunzelmann K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), resulting in underestimation of the AQP3 IMP density and perhaps of their size (37van Hoek A.N. Yang B. Kirmiz S.

As observed, dimers, trimers, and tetramers were stabilized by DSS treatment, whereas AQP1 seemed to be unaffected by the DSS treatment, confirming different quaternary structures of AQP1 and AQP3. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that AQP3 exists in multiple oligomeric forms composed of weakly associated monomers. Analysis of channel and transport proteins favor oligomeric structures (50Unwin N.

Since the discovery of the first water channel, aquaporin-1 (AQP1),1 which selectively transports water, others members of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family have been identified. Among them, some are also permeable to small solutes such as urea and glycerol, and these were named aquaglyceroporins. In mammals, the first one to be characterized was AQP3 (1Ishibashi K. Sasaki S.

Nicotine, through interaction with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, possesses the ability to modulate neurotransmitter systems through numerous mechanisms that define this critical balance. We examined the modulatory role of nicotine in primary mixed cortical neuronal-glial cultures on activity-dependent caspase cleavage of a glutamate receptor, GluR1. We find that GluR1, but not GluR2 or GluR3, is a substrate for agonist (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid)-initiated rapid proteolytic cleavage at aspartic acid 865 through the activation of caspase 8-like activity that is independent of membrane fusion and is not coincident with apoptosis. Dose-dependent nicotine preconditioning for 24 h antagonizes agonist-initiated caspase cleavage of GluR1 through a mechanism that is coincident with desensitization of both nAChRα4β2 and nAChRα7 receptors and the delayed activation of a caspase 8-like activity.

Disruption of this regulation can have severe pathophysiological consequences including neuronal death through excitotoxicity, as associated with stroke, trauma, and numerous severe neurodegenerative disorders (1.Choi D.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2.Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). GluRs are assembled from multiple cDNA products to form receptors of distinct function, which fall into three pharmacologically defined groups (2.Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Although the activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subclass is central to the establishment of long-term potentiation, and its sustained activation appears responsible for imparting the majority of excitotoxicity (2.Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Sucher N.J. Awobuluyi M. Choi Y.B. Lipton S.A. Trends Pharmacol.

This study examines AMPA-GluRs, in which channel permeability to calcium is dependent upon subunit composition. For example, inclusion of GluR2 imparts calcium impermeability, whereas receptors composed of GluR 1, 3, and/or 4 permit calcium entry. Consequently, altering the ratio of GluRs with varied subunit composition or modifying their subcellular location contributes significantly to the temporal and spatial regulation of NMDA receptors and glutamate neurotransmission. glutamate receptor energy of activation γ-aminobutyric acid fluoromethylketone N-methyl-d-aspartic acid α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid caspase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid neuronal AChRα3 and AChRβ4 subunits glutamate receptor energy of activation γ-aminobutyric acid fluoromethylketone N-methyl-d-aspartic acid α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid caspase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid neuronal AChRα3 and AChRβ4 subunits Another ligand-activated ionotropic neurotransmitter system that can contribute to modifying the function of GluRs is the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). These fast-ionotropic ligand-activated channels (4.MacDermott A.B. Role L.W. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 443-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 5.Role L.W. Berg D.K.

The expression of two nAChR subtypes is prevalent in the mammalian brain. First, receptors composed of nAChRα4 and nAChRβ2 subunits are distinguished by high-affinity [3H]nicotine or [3H]cytisine binding (7.Pabreza L.A. Dhawan S. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 9-12PubMed Google Scholar). It is this receptor subclass in which up-regulation occurs in response to chronic nicotine administration (8.Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar), as in smoking, and in which expression correlates with the establishment of tolerance, a correlate of addiction (9.Crawley J.N. Belknap J.K. Collins A. Crabbe J.C. Frankel W. Henderson N. Hitzemann R.J. Maxson S.C. Miner L.L. Silva A.J. Wehner J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Paylor R. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1997; 132: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). A second nAChR subtype composed of nAChRα7 subunits binds α-bungarotoxin with high affinity and rapidly desensitizes to nicotine. However, while open, this receptor exhibits an unusually large Ca+2:Na+permeability ratio of ∼10:1 by comparison with the 3:1 ratio for NMDA receptors (4.MacDermott A.B. Role L.W. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 443-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 6.Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This can have significant consequences on subcellular processes including signal transduction and the release of signaling molecules including arachidonic acid (10.Vijayaraghavan S. Huang B. Blumenthal E.M. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3679-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, nicotine has been suggested to modulate the regulation of caspase (Csp) activation, including Csp8 function (11.Garrido R. Mattson M.P. Hennig B. Toborek M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, due to the mechanisms of desensitization and inactivation of nAChRs, even if the receptor number is increased and there is abundant agonist (e.g. nicotine) present, signaling through this receptor system may actually be decreased. Therefore nicotine imparts multiple effects on neuronal function ranging from cognitive enhancement to neuroprotection against toxins (12.Maggio R. Riva M. Vaglini F. Fornai F. Molteni R. Armogida M.

Neurons use a variety of mechanisms to control AMPA-class GluRs expression. For example, during periods of sustained synaptic activity GluRs, in particular GluR1, are observed to change in subcellular distribution as reflected by the accumulation of this subunit at some sites of activity and by the redistribution or possibly degradation from others (17.Carroll R.C. Lissin D.V. von Zastrow M. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 18.Lissin D.V. Carroll R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. J.

Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The mechanisms implicated in subcellular redistribution of GluRs are complex and include altered phosphorylation and rates of endocytosis or exocytosis and interaction with cytoskeleton-binding proteins including 4.1N and SAP97 (20.Swope S.L. Moss S.I. Raymond L.A. Huganir R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 49-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J.

Notably, most of the sites that are important for regulation through these mechanisms, including proteolysis (e.g. Ref. 25.Bi X. Chen J. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 781: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are located in the relatively short C-terminal intracellular region of the receptor subunit. The most rapid way to regulate the concentration of cellular proteins is through selective proteolysis (26.Schimke R.T. Doyle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1970; 39: 929-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). AMPA-GluRs are subject to this mechanism, particularly in the presence of elevated free intracellular calcium, which can activate calpains, which have numerous cellular substrates including GluR1 (25.Bi X. Chen J. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 781: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the limited proteolytic cleavage of GluR1 may include other proteases. Recently, members of the cysteine protease family, caspases, have been reported (27.Glazner G.W. Chan S.L. Lu C. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to cleave certain GluR subunits, especially GluR4, following trophic factor withdrawal or upon induction of cell death through apoptosis. Although the activation of caspase cascades is most commonly associated with cell death, under more restricted conditions certain caspases might also perform limited substrate cleavage, which has the regulatory importance of contributing to proper cellular function. For example, the conditional activation of Csp1 converts pro-interleukin 1β to the active cytokine that is released from the cell (28.Villa P. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Therefore, a less recognized role for caspases might be in regulating processes related to normal neuronal responses and function. In this study we report that GluR1 is a substrate for AMPA-initiated activity-dependent limited caspase cleavage and demonstrate that nicotine preconditioning of primary mixed cortical neuronal-glial cultures modulates this proteolytic activation. Site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro assays demonstrate that GluR1 is cleaved through a Csp8-like protease at residue 865 in the distal C terminus. Preconditioning of cultures with nicotine alters the activation of the Csp8-like proteolytic cascade as measured using cell-permeable fluorescent substrates, and this correlates with reduced AMPA-initiated caspase cleavage of GluR1. The use of various agonists and antagonists of nAChRs suggest that this mechanism of reducing Csp8 activation requires the coincident desensitization and/or inactivation of both nAChRα7 and nAChRα4β2 receptor subtypes. The modulation by nicotine of activity-dependent cleavage of GluR1 has several implications regarding the action of this compound on the molecular processes underlying GluR excitatory neurotransmission and the modulation of neurological disease. All reagents were obtained from RBI/Sigma. Drugs were dissolved in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) or Me2SO at 100–1000×. Caspase inhibitors and substrates were obtained from Calbiochem or Enzyme Systems Products. Recombinant caspases 3 and 8 and the calpain inhibitor PD150-606 were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals or Calbiochem. Murine primary cortical cultures composed of mixed neuronal and glial cells were prepared from E15 CD1 mice (Charles River) and maintained for 13–15 days as described previously (15.Carlson N.G.

For experiments using varied temperature, the medium was buffered with 10 mm HEPES, the culture dishes wrapped in Parafilm, and the dishes placed in contact with water heated to the indicated temperature using circulating water baths. Cultures were equilibrated for 10–15 min before the addition of drugs. Degradation and Arrhenius activation were calculated as described elsewhere (29.Hough R. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Briefly, neurons were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed and harvested by scraping in a cold protease mixture (4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm EDTA and 10 mmbenzamidine) prepared in water. SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing dithiothreitol was added to this mixture immediately, and the cells were further scraped into a microcentrifuge tube and boiled in a dry heating block for 10 min. Upon gel fractionation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose utilizing a semi-dry blot apparatus, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were to the C terminus of GluR1 (Chemicon), E11 (GluR1 (31.Rogers S.W. Hughes T.E. Hollmann M. Gasic G.P. Deneris E.S. Heinemann S. J.

The blots were washed in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 and incubated in the presence of peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and detected on film using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.). Films were scanned, and relative band intensities were determined by densitometry. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (31.Rogers S.W. Hughes T.E. Hollmann M. Gasic G.P.

Constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (University of Utah DNA sequencing core facility). The CalPhos transfection kit from CLONTECH was used according to manufacturer's instructions to introduce expression plasmid cDNAs (2 μg of GluR (GluR1:pcDNA1/AMP; see Ref. 31.Rogers S.W. Hughes T.E.

Cells were used at 24–48 h post-transfection. To measure caspase cleavage of GluR1 or GluR3 in vitro, HEK cells were transfected with the respective GluR cDNA and 48 h later were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Chaps, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were subjected to Dounce homogenization and cleared by centrifugation. To each replicate 100-μl sample of cell lysate was added a 25-μl aliquot of either recombinant Csp8 or Csp3 (25 units/assay), respectively. The tube was sealed and placed at 37 °C for the period indicated, whereupon a 10-μl sample was removed and mixed with 10 μl of SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. For microscopic visualization of caspase activation in cultured neurons, cells were loaded with cell-permeable Csp8 peptide substrate (Z-IETD-AFC), which fluoresces blue upon cleavage. Cultures were washed with Hanks' solution, incubated in the presence of Hanks' solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, and supplemented to 10 μmwith the cell-permeable caspase-substrate peptides indicated (stock solution of 1:1000 dissolved in Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed again, AMPA (100 μm) or kainic acid (100 μm) was added, and at the desired times thereafter (optimized in trial experiments) fluorescence was automatically recorded at 1-min intervals. The appearance of fluorescence in individually identified neuronal cells was quantitated using Image Pro-Plus software. Activity-dependent subcellular redistribution of GluR1 occurs following the exposure of neurons to glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists (17.Carroll R.C. Lissin D.V. von Zastrow M. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 18.Lissin D.V. Carroll R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the addition of a nonlethal, nonapoptotic (15.Carlson N.G. Bacchi A. Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16.Carlson N.G. Wieggel W.A. Chen J. Bacchi A. Rogers S.W. Gahring L.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3963-3968PubMed Google Scholar), dose of AMPA (100 μm) or kainic acid (100 μm, not shown) for 1 h to our murine primary cortical neuronal-glial cultures was accompanied by the rapid loss of GluR1 C-terminal immunoreactivity as measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Immunoreactivity to GluR2 or GluR3 from the same culture samples was unaffected (Fig. 1A). GluR1 degradation was inhibited by co-application of CNQX but was unaffected by the presence of tetrodotoxin, nifedipine, or the calpain inhibitor, PD 150–606 (not shown). Although degradation was complete in all experiments by ∼90 min, some GluR1 remained suggesting that a pool of this subunit protein was unaffected. This pool is likely to be intracellular because parallel immunocytochemical examination (using the same anti-C-terminal GluR1 antibody) of cultures treated with AMPA for 1 h revealed a change from normally diffuse immunoreactivity to a punctate distribution suggestive of an intracellular-endosomal pattern (Fig. 1B). Examination of GluR1 degradation using an antibody prepared to the extracellular domain (24.Sans N. Racca C. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. McCallum J. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to reveal an equivalent change in GluR1 expression over the same time period, albeit a change of ∼1 kDa in migration on gels was observed consistent with removal of the C-terminal region (not shown). Because the C terminus of GluR1 harbors numerous sequences important to the subcellular distribution and function of this receptor (17.Carroll R.C. Lissin D.V. von Zastrow M. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 19.Shi S.H. Hayashi Y. Petralia R.S. Zaman S.H. Wenthold R.J. Svoboda K. Malinow R. Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 32.Ruberti F. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined further the nature of this presumed proteolytic event. Varying temperature can be used to measure several parameters pertaining to cellular and proteolytic mechanisms. Endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of proteins are particularly sensitive to reduced temperatures because membranes fail to fuse as temperatures go below 16 °C (e.g. see Ref. 29.Hough R. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This has the effect of producing a dramatic and steep reduction in the degradation rate as delivery systems stop working at lower temperatures. Other proteolytic mechanisms that do not require membrane fusion, such as the ATP-ubiquitin-dependent proteasome and other cytoplasmic or extracellular proteases, are also affected by reduced temperature. In this case, however, the protease enzymatic rate is slowed according to its Q10, a constant that reflects the effect of a 10 °C change on the enzymatic function. We examined these parameters by measuring the rate of agonist-dependent proteolysis of GluR1 at 37, 26, 16, and 6 °C, respectively (Fig. 1C). An average of three experiments revealed that the rate of AMPA-initiated GluR1 degradation decreased ∼5-fold over the 31 °C temperature range for an average Q10 of 1.57 ± 0.17. An additional benefit of making this measurement is that the energy of activation (Ea) for the rate-limiting step of degradation can be calculated through plotting the reaction Arrhenius plot (29.Hough R. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Arrhenius plot derived from these data (Fig. 1C, insert) is best fit by a straight line (R2 = 0.95). This result is consistent with a proteolytic mechanism that does not require membrane fusion because no Arrhenius “break” in the plot was observed as for other transmembrane receptor proteins (see Ref. 29.Hough R. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) including the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is degraded to completion in the lysosome following endocytosis (33.Libby P. Goldberg A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 107: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34.Libby P. Bursztajn S. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1980; 19: 481-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The apparent Ea for the rate-limiting step of AMPA-initiated GluR1 proteolysis as calculated from the Arrhenius plot is 8.4 kcal/mol. This is substantially less than the energy of activation for ATP-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation, which is 27 ± 5 kcal/mol (29.Hough R. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because most ATP-independent proteases exhibit an Ea of between 9 and 15 kcal/mol (29.Hough R. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the latter possibility is favored, although the possibility that an AMPA-initiated step prior to proteolysis is rate-limiting to GluR1 cleavage cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, these results suggest that the mechanism of AMPA-initiated proteolysis of GluR1 is independent of endosome formation and lysosomal proteolysis and probably does not involve an ATP-ubiquitin proteasome. This result also further supports the possibility that the GluR1 punctate endosome-lysosome-like pattern of immunostaining revealed in cultured neurons following AMPA addition reflects a pre-existing internal protein pool, which is not necessarily degraded by the AMPA-initiated protease system measured in these experiments. Although multiple proteases could act upon GluR1, including calpains (25.Bi X. Chen J. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 781: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35.Bi X. Bi R. Baudry M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 144: 203-217PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that caspases could mediate AMPA-initiated limited cleavage. Inspection of the GluR1 cytoplasmic C-terminal sequence reveals a putative caspase 8 cleavage sequence (residues 862–865 (VSQD) (see Ref. 36.Stennicke H.R. Renatus M. Meldal M. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2A) that is 12 amino acids N-terminal to the C-terminal GluR1 immunogen sequence. To determine whether GluR1 is a substrate for cleavage by Csp8 at this site, crude membrane fractions were prepared (see “Materials and Methods”) from HEK293 cells that were transfected for 48 h with the CMV-pcDNA1/Amp expression vector encoding either rat GluR1 or rat GluR3 (30.Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31.Rogers S.W. Hughes T.E. Hollmann M. Gasic G.P. Deneris E.S. Heinemann S. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2713-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for use as substrates for proteolysis in vitro using recombinant Csp8 or Csp3. As shown in Fig. 2B, Csp8 cleaved GluR1 but not GluR3, and neither GluR was a substrate for recombinant Csp3. To determine whether cleavage of GluR1 occurred at residues 862–865 (VSQD), this site was removed through conversion of the aspartic acid (Asp865) to alanine (D865A) by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref.30.Gahring L. Carlson N.G. Meyer E.L. Rogers S.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the above experiment was repeated. As shown in Fig. 2C, the introduction of a single mutation in GluR1 at D865A reduced recombinant Csp8 cleavage in vitro from ∼75% of the total wild-type GluR1 pool to less than 13% for the total GluR1D865A pool. The background degradation of GluR1D865A is likely related to either nonspecific proteolysis or Csp8 cleavage at another less susceptible cleavage site(s), or possibly to the activation of other proteolytic systems by recombinant Csp8 following its addition to this crude membrane extract. Notably, the presence of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm EDTA had no effect on the proteolytic rates (not shown), which precludes calpains and serine proteases, respectively, from contributing to the in vitro degradation measurement. Nevertheless, the majority of GluR1 degradation is attributable to the added recombinant Csp8 in vitro and cleavage by this protease is predominantly at GluR1-Asp865. We next used cultured neurons to examine whether inhibitors of caspases could affect AMPA-initiated GluR1 degradation. For these experiments, cell-permeable inhibitors of various caspases were used as follows. Primary cortical neuronal cultures were incubated in the presence of cell-permeable caspase peptide inhibitors (e.g. Z-VAD-FMK, a broad-range inhibitor of caspase activity); Z-IETD-FMK, an inhibitor of Csp8; and others, as follows) before adding AMPA and harvesting neurons thereafter for Western blot analysis of GluR1 degradation. Because caspase inhibitors suffer from two experimental concerns, the relative intracellular concentration that can be achieved by incubation and the often relatively poorly characterized target specificity of the respective peptides (37.Garcia-Calvo M.

Following a defined number of population doublings, these cells gradually lose the ability to proliferate. There is some cell death, and the process eventually results in a population of cells that is viable but is nonreplicating (1Hayflick L. Moorehead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). This process has been termed replicative senescence (2Campisi J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 703-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 3Cristofalo V.J. Volker C. Francis M.K.F. Tresini M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1998; 8: 43-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and has provided an important model for the study of the biology of aging. A compilation of the published changes that occur during replicative senescence has been published (3Cristofalo V.J. Volker C. Francis M.K.F. Tresini M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1998; 8: 43-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Included in these changes are alterations in size, morphology, gene expression, the regulation and timing of the cell cycle, and the turnover of the extracellular matrix. The expression of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, interstitial collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase 1) and stromelysin-1, are increased in senescent fibroblasts compared with early passage cells (4West M.D. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Millis A.J. McCue H.M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. Exp. Gerontol. 1992; 27: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), leading to a shift in the relative ratio of collagenase to collagen production between early passage and senescent cells such that there is a relative overproduction of collagenase (6Khorramizadeh M.R. Tredget E.E. Telasky C. Shen Q. Ghahary A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 194: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The observation that there is a relative overproduction of collagenase in aging cells has led to the proposal that senescent cells display a matrix-degrading phenotype. During aging in vivo, there is a shift in the fibroblast from a matrix synthesizing to a matrix-degrading phenotype, resulting in an elevated proteolytic environment, which may contribute to age related loss of tissue function (7Ashcroft G.S.

Despite the potential importance of increased collagenase expression during aging and the identification of changes in transcription of the collagenase gene during replicative senescence (9Imai S. Fujino T. Nishibayashi S. Manabe T. Takano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7182-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no definitive data regarding the mechanisms that underlie the age-related increase in collagenase production are available. Previous studies in our laboratories have shown that inhibition of the intracellular enzyme phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase in WI-38 fibroblast cells results in an increased expression of collagenase (10Tresini M. Mawal-Dewan M. Cristofalo V.J. Sell C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme PI 3-kinase is a key component of an intracellular signal pathway that regulates longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (11Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). This pathway involves the homologs of the insulin and IGF-I receptors (Daf-2); PI 3-kinase (Age-1) (12Kimura A.D.

Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). In mammals, the activity of forkhead transcription factors can also be regulated by insulin/IGF-I receptor signaling acting through PI 3-kinase and the serine/threonine kinase Akt-1/PKBα, referred to here as Akt. Three members of the forkhead transcription factor family most closely related to Daf-16 (FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX) have been shown to be directly phosphorylated by Akt (16Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X.

This phosphorylation serves to negatively regulate the activity of these transcription factors, reducing their ability to enhance transcription from target promoters and promoting nuclear exclusion (19Biggs III, W.H.

In this study, we have examined the regulation of collagenase gene expression at the level of the promoter to identify the basis for the increased expression of collagenase during replicative senescence. We find that the collagenase promoter can be regulated by the activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt in both early passage and senescent WI-38 fibroblasts. The effect of Akt on collagenase gene expression may be mediated by members of the forkhead family of transcription factors. All cell culture materials were purchased from Mediatech Inc. with the exception of the keratinocyte serum-free medium, which was purchased from Life Sciences Inc. Antibodies to Akt and phospho-Akt were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (UBI) and Cell Signaling, respectively. The Akt kinase assay kit was produced by UBI. The chemical inhibitors LY294002, PD58029, and wortmannin were purchased from BIOMOL. Detection reagents and secondary antibodies for Western blot analyses were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Plasmids and reagents for luciferase measurements were purchased from Promega. Expression plasmids for Akt including the active form (Akt-myr) and the dominant negative form (Akt K179M) contained in SR α were provided by Dr. Philip Tschilis (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The expression plasmid containing an activated Ras cDNA (valine 12 mutation, RasV12) in pBabe was provided by Dr. Scott Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Expression plasmids for FKHRL1 wild type (FKHRL1) and triple mutation (Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315) (FKHRL1-TM) and the synthetic promoter construct containing the forkhead response element driving the expression of the luciferase cDNA were provided by Dr. Mark Greenberg (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). The expression plasmids containing the active (p110-CAAX) and wild type PI 3K (p110) were provided by Dr. Marcus Thelen (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). The luciferase constructs containing 3470 bp of the collagenase promoter (pGL3470) and a deletion mutant of this construct (pGL3470Δ) were provided by Dr. Judith Campisi (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA). Stock cultures of WI-38 fetal human diploid fibroblasts were grown in minimum essential medium, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as previously described (21Cristofalo V.J. Chapentier R. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1980; 6: 117-121Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 23Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Cultures were considered to be at the end of their replicative lifespan when they were unable to complete one population doubling during a 4-week period that included 3 consecutive weeks of re-feeding with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. WI-38 cells at early passage were less than 30 population doublings, and those at the end of their replicative lifespan were greater than 95% lifespan completed. This translates to a population doubling of 58–65, depending upon the subline. Cultures were made quiescent by culturing in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 72 h before FBS stimulation. In experiments involving LY294002 (50 μm), PD58029 (25 μm), or rapamycin (10 nm), cells were incubated with each respective inhibitor for 24 h. The packaging cell line used for retroviral production and subsequent infection of WI-38 cells was the Phoenix cell line provided by Dr. Gary Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Transient transfections were performed as follows. WI-38 cells were seeded at 1 × 104/cm2. 24 h after seeding, cultures were transfected with both a control plasmid, pRLCMV (containing the luciferase enzyme derived from Renilla reniformis under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter) and the plasmid of interest using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the incubation period described in individual experiments, cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using a lysis buffer provided by Promega. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega dual luciferase assay system, according to the manufacturer's protocols. Transfection efficiency was normalized to the control luciferase plasmid, pRLCMV, that can be measured in the same assay mix. Thus, the highly sensitive luciferase measurement can be used for both experimental and internal control measurements. Western blot analysis was performed as follows. Total cellular protein was isolated by scraping cells into lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for separation. Following transfer to nitrocellulose filters, total protein was visualized by staining the filters with Ponceau S Red to assure equal loading of the samples. Western analysis was carried out using antibodies that recognize Akt (UBI), the phosphorylated form of Akt (Cell Signaling), and β actin (Sigma). Western blots were carried out using 5% dry milk as a blocking reagent in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, containing 0.5% Tween 20. Bound antibody complexes were visualized using the Amersham ECL Western protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Enzymatic assays for the activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt were carried out using an Akt assay kit available from UBI following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed as for Western blotting followed by immunoprecipitation of the Akt enzyme using the antibody provided by UBI. (The effectiveness of the immunoprecipitation reaction was verified by Western blotting.) Activity of the Akt enzyme was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitated proteins with a synthetic peptide substrate (RPRAATF), which is based upon the Akt phosphorylation site of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and [γ-32P]ATP in reaction buffer. The entire reaction was spotted onto glass fiber discs and washed extensively with phosphoric acid, followed by a wash with ethanol/ether. Filters were then dried and incorporated radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. Total RNA was isolated following the guanidinium isothiocyanate method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). Northern analysis was carried out using 10 μg of total RNA in glyoxal agarose gels. Size fractionated RNA was transferred to Nytran filters electrophoretically in 1× Tris acetate EDTA buffer (TAE). Probes were labeled by random priming and hybridization was carried out using a solution of 7% SDS, 0.25m Na3PO4, 5.6 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm EDTA. Washing was carried out under standard conditions. Previous studies in our laboratory indicate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase causes an increase in the steady state level of collagenase mRNA in early passage WI-38 human fibroblasts (10Tresini M. Mawal-Dewan M. Cristofalo V.J. Sell C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether transcription of the collagenase gene was affected by an inhibition of PI 3-kinase in early passage WI-38 cells, a plasmid construct containing a 3.4-kb fragment of the collagenase promoter (pGL3470; Ref. 25Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H. Tam E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) driving the expression of the firefly luciferase cDNA was introduced into early passage WI-38 cells in a transient transfection system. The cells were then exposed to inhibitors of PI 3-kinase or an inhibitor of MEK. The activity of the collagenase promoter, as measured by luciferase activity, was increased in the presence of two separate inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, LY 294002 and wortmannin. An inhibitor of MEK (PD98059) actually decreased the activity of the collagenase promoter, but the effect was not statistically significant (Fig.1 A). To confirm the results obtained using the chemical inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, expression constructs that contained a cDNA encoding either an active (p110-CAAX in Fig. 1) or a wild type (p110) form of the 110-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase (26Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were introduced into the WI-38 cells along with the collagenase promoter reporter plasmid, pGL3470. The wild type form of the p110 subunit acts as a dominant negative because it competes with the activated p85/p110 holoenzyme for substrates. Consistent with the results obtained using the chemical inhibitors, the constitutively active form of p110 (p110-CAAX) had no effect on the collagenase promoter, whereas the wild type p110 subunit increased the activity of the collagenase promoter (Fig. 1 B). Introduction of an activated form of Ras also had no effect on collagenase promoter activity. These results, taken together with the lack of an effect on collagenase promoter activity by the addition of the MEK inhibitor (Fig.1 A), indicate that fluctuations in mitogen-activated protein kinase have little influence on the collagenase promoter. Among its many effects, activation of PI 3-kinase leads to an increase in the activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (27Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar). Because Akt is known to affect the activity of a number of transcription factors including CREB, this enzyme is a possible mediator of PI 3-kinase-dependent regulation of the collagenase promoter. To assess the role of Akt in the regulation of the collagenase promoter, we introduced both an active (Akt-myr) and a dominant negative (Akt K179M) form of the enzyme into early passage WI-38 cells in the presence of the collagenase promoter-luciferase reporter construct. The activity of the collagenase promoter was measured in a transient transfection assay. The introduction of a dominant negative form of Akt increased the activity of the collagenase promoter (Fig.1 C). Greater collagenase promoter activity was obtained as greater quantities of the dominant negative Akt construct were introduced into the WI-38 cells (Fig. 1 C). The fact that a dominant negative form of Akt increases collagenase promoter activity is consistent with the published effect of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (10Tresini M. Mawal-Dewan M. Cristofalo V.J. Sell C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that an inactivate form of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase increased the activity of the collagenase promoter (Fig.1 B). Increased collagenase promoter activity in the presence of a dominant negative form of Akt implies that Akt activation plays a negative role in the regulation of the collagenase promoter,i.e. activation of Akt leads to a reduction in transcription. The forkhead transcription factors are part of a large family of winged helix/loop helix transcription factors for which the symbol Fox (Forkhead box) has been proposed to indicate the presence of the characteristic winged helix domain (28Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). Several members of this superfamily of transcription factors are negatively regulated by insulin/IGF signaling through the action of Akt (16Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4574-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This negative regulation has been linked to the phosphorylation of specific sites in the three forkhead family members (FKHR1, FKHRL1, and AFX), which are the closest mammalian homologs of the C. elegans transcription factor Daf-16 (28Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). These sites exist within consensus sites for Akt phosphorylationRXRXX(S/T) (29Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Because the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 is the most ubiquitously expressed of the three Daf-16 homologs (30Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we chose to examine the possibility that this isoform can mediate the effect of Akt on the collagenase promoter. The FKHRL1 isoform may play a role during apoptosis, and activation of Akt decreases FKHRL1 transcriptional activity (31Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5428) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that changes in forkhead activity contributes to the increased expression of collagenase during replicative senescence, the activity of the collagenase promoter was measured in early passage and senescent WI-38 fibroblasts in the presence or absence of an expression construct that contains the FKHRL1 cDNA (Fig. 2). The introduction of the wild type FKHRL1 increases the activity of the collagenase promoter in both early passage and senescent WI-38 cells. A triple mutant of FKHRL1 (FKHRL1-TM) in which the three Akt phosphorylation sites had been converted to alanine (T32A, S253A, S315A) activated the collagenase promoter more effectively than the wild type FKHRL1 (Fig.2). The activity of a synthetic forkhead promoter (FHRE) that contains three insulin response element sequences driving the expression of the firefly luciferase cDNA (31Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5428) Google Scholar) was also examined in the early passage and senescent WI-38 cells. This promoter is activated by introduction of the FKHRL1 protein (31Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5428) Google Scholar). Included as a control in this experiment was a deletion mutant of the collagenase promoter (pGL3470Δ). The activity of this promoter does not increased in senescent cells compared with early passage cells (data not shown), 2J. Campisi, personal communication. so it was used as a control for comparison of the collagenase promoter activity between early passage and senescent cultures. In Fig. 2, the luciferase activity has been normalized relative to the pGL 3470Δ (which was given a value of 1 in both early passage and senescent cells) to allow a direct comparison of promoter activity between early passage and senescent cultures, but it is important to note that the absolute value of the promoter activity of the pGL3470Δ collagenase promoter construct did not vary by more than 10% between early passage and senescent cultures in our assays. Interestingly, the activity of the pGL3470Δ collagenase promoter construct was not affected by PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002. The FHRE promoter had very low activity in early passage cells but the activity was enhanced by the co-transfection of FKRL1-TM (Fig. 2). Consistent with an increase in forkhead-mediated transcription in the senescent cells, the FHRE promoter has much higher activity in the senescent cells (Fig. 2) when it is introduced into the senescent cells alone, but the activity of the FRE could be induced in the early passage cells through treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 2 C). The activity of the FHRE promoter increased in the senescent cells when the FKHRL1 constructs (wild type or triple mutant) were co-transfected, but the increase was not as dramatic as in the early passage cells. The results of multiple experiments indicate that the collagenase promoter shows a 2–3-fold increase in activity in senescent cells compared with early passage WI-38 cells and the activity of the FHRE promoter shows a 3–4-fold increase in senescent cells compared with early passage cells (Fig. 2). To verify that the increase in collagenase promoter activity seen in senescent cells is dependent upon forkhead transcription factors, a series of co-transfections were performed that included the pGL3470 construct and increasing concentrations of a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contains the forkhead binding site contained in the Fas ligand promoter (TTAAATAAATA) (30Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The inclusion of this oligonucleotide decreased the activity of the collagenase promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Again, we would emphasize that the differences between the early passage and senescent cells in terms of both collagenase and FHRE promoters have been consistent in multiple experiments. These results indicate that the activity of both the collagenase promoter and a synthetic forkhead-responsive promoter are increased in senescent cells. To understand the molecular mechanism that underlies the increase in forkhead promoter activity observed in the senescent cells, we examined the activity of Akt in both senescent and early passage cells. The activity of Akt has been reported to increase following mitogenic stimulation of serum-deprived mouse fibroblast cells (27Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar), and this activation is dependent upon site-specific phosphorylation mediated in part by the action of the serine/threonine kinase PDK1 (32Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 33Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at both serine 473 in the C-terminal region and threonine 308 in the catalytic region of Akt is required for activation (34Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Upon activation, Akt translocates to the nucleus in BALB/c 3T3 cells (35Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that Akt can phosphorylate several transcription factors including CREB (36Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) and members of the forkhead family (16Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 17Kops G.J. De de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 18Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5428) Google Scholar). Given these observations, decreased Akt expression or defects in either activation or nuclear translocation of Akt could explain the increase in collagenase expression observed in senescent fibroblasts. We first examined activation of Akt by measuring both enzyme activity and site-specific phosphorylation of the protein. In both early passage and senescent cells, serum stimulation increased cytoplasmic Akt activity (Fig.3 A). This increase in Akt activity was accompanied by increased phosphorylation at serine 473 (Fig. 3 B). From these results, we conclude that Akt activation is similar in early passage and senescent cells. The nuclear abundance of active Akt was examined using a phosphospecific antibody to detect the active form of the enzyme. In the cytoplasmic extracts of both early passage and senescent cells, the phosphorylated (active) form of Akt increased following serum stimulation. However, examination of nuclear extracts revealed that only early passage cells exhibited an increase in the amount of active Akt in the nucleus. In the senescent cells, there was very little active Akt in nuclear extracts following serum stimulation (data not shown). This suggests a failure to translocate active Akt to the nucleus in senescent cells. As a control, we examined the nuclear abundance of activated, phosphorylated Erk, which has been reported to decrease in senescent cells relative to early passage cells (37Kim Jr., K. Nose K. Shibanuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20685-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Lim I.K Won Hong K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that the amount of the active form of Akt is lower in the nucleus of senescent cells implies that the increased expression of collagenase is mediated, in part, by a relative decrease in Akt activity. This leads to the prediction that an increase in Akt activity in senescent cells should decrease collagenase mRNA levels in the senescent fibroblasts. To test this prediction, the active form of Akt, Akt-myr, was introduced into near senescent fibroblasts to determine whether the forced activation of Akt can affect collagenase expression in senescent cells. Following infection with retrovirus particles and the time required for neomycin selection, the cultures expressing the active Akt enzyme were greater than 90% life-span completed. At this time in the life-span of these cultures, the expression of collagenase is increased relative to early passage cells (4West M.D. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the senescent cultures that express the active form of Akt had lower levels of collagenase mRNA than control cultures that were infected with the retroviral construct without a cDNA insert in three separate experiments and a representative Northern blot is presented in Fig. 4. Densitometric analysis of these Northern blots indicates that the level of collagenase mRNA is decreased by 66% (1.38± 0.28versus 0.46 ± 0.007 p = 0.05). These results indicate that forced activation of Akt can decrease collagenase mRNA levels in senescent fibroblasts.Figure 4Forced expression of an active form of Akt suppresses collagenase expression in senescent WI-38 fibroblasts. Panel A contains a Northern blot analysis using total RNA samples derived from senescent WI-38 cultures that had been infected with either an empty retroviral vector (Vector) or a retroviral vector containing the active form of Akt (Akt-myr). Cultures of WI-38 fibroblasts that had nearly exhausted their replicative potential (80% lifespan completed) were transduced with a retroviral vector that contains an active form of Akt, Akt-myr. This cDNA contains a potential farnesylation site (CAAX) at the 3′ end. As a control, WI-38 cells were also transduced with an empty retroviral vector. Cultures were then subjected to selection with neomycin to eliminate cells in the culture that had not been infected with the retrovirus. Increased levels of Akt were observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells expressing the active Akt by immunofluorescent antibody staining (data not shown). Following 2 weeks of selection, total mRNA was isolated from these cultures and subjected to a Northern blot analysis for levels of collagenase mRNA. The levels of collagenase mRNA were examined as were the levels of β actin as a control for sample loading. Densitometric analysis of three separate experiments indicates that the relative level of collagenase mRNA falls from 1.38 ± 0.28 in the vector control cultures to 0.46 ± 0.007 in the cultures expression the active form of Akt. Panel B contains a Northern blot containing a series of total RNA samples derived from WI-38 cultures at increasing population doubling values. All RNA samples were collected 7 days after seeding using a standard seeding density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2. The level of collagenase in these samples was determined to ensure that this message increases in the strain of WI-38 cells used for these experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results presented in this study indicate that there is an increase in forkhead activity in senescent human fibroblasts. This interpretation is supported by the observations that (i) inhibition of Akt in early passage cells increases collagenase promoter activity, (ii) activation of Akt in senescent cells decreases collagenase mRNA levels, (iii) a forkhead-responsive promoter shows strong activity in senescent cells, and (iv) the collagenase promoter is strongly activated by the expression of a mutant form of one of the forkhead isoforms, FKHRL1. This mutation eliminates three consensus phosphorylation sites for Akt within the FKHRL1 protein, rendering it unresponsive to Akt (31Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5428) Google Scholar). We postulate that the activated from of Akt is not present in the nucleus of senescent cells, similar to the recent reports that the phosphorylated form of ERK does not translocate to the nucleus of senescent cells (37Kim Jr., K. Nose K. Shibanuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20685-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Lim I.K Won Hong K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This lack of ERK translocation may underlie the decreased fos expression observed in senescent cells (39Seshadri T. Campisi J. Science. 1990; 247: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In the case of Akt, a decrease in the nuclear form of the activated form may partially account for the increase in collagenase expression that occurs during replicative senescence. A model describing the possible regulation of the collagenase gene in senescent cells is provided in Fig. 5. Several of the Fox transcription factors are negatively regulated following phosphorylation by Akt including FKHR, AFX, and FKHRL1 (40Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 41Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Our results indicate that FKHRL1 and perhaps other forkhead family members are involved in the regulation of gene expression during replicative senescence. Specifically, the results obtained in this study suggest that the collagenase promoter is activated, at least in part, by an increase in the activity of a forkhead protein during replicative senescence. This interpretation is supported by data presented in Fig. 2 A. If the increased activity of the collagenase promoter in senescent cells is the result of an increase in the activity of forkhead transcription factors, then the introduction of forkhead or Akt should have a less dramatic effect on the activity of the collagenase promoter in the senescent cells than in the early passage cells. As seen in Fig. 2 A, the introduction of the FKHRL1-TM into senescent cells has much less effect on the wild type collagenase promoter in the senescent cells than in the early passage cells. These results suggest that the presence of active forkhead transcription factors in the senescent cells dampens the effects of the exogenous FKHRL1 on the collagenase promoter. It seems likely that the increased activity of FKHRL1 or other forkhead transcription factors mediate increases in the expression of several genes during replicative senescence and thus may contribute to the altered pattern of gene expression that occurs during replicative senescence. It is very possible that only specific forkhead transcription factors are activated during replicative senescence. For example, the introduction of FRHK into early passage WI-38 cells had little effect on the collagenase promoter (data not shown). This indicates that not all forkhead transcription factors can regulate the collagenase promoter and that the increased expression of collagenase may result from the selective activation of one or more forkhead proteins during replicative senescence. Whether forkhead proteins bind directly to the collagenase promoter or regulate this promoter via protein-protein interactions is not clear. The region of the collagenase promoter deleted in the pGL3470Δ construct is centered around bp −3100 and contains an ATAAAGC sequence. This provides a potential forkhead binding site based on the forkhead binding site consensus sequence ATAAACA, leaving open the possibility that FKHRL1 or another forkhead protein binds directly to the collagenase promoter to regulate transcription. In summary, our results indicate that increased activity of forkhead transcription factors plays a role in replicative senescence and mediates increased collagenase expression during senescence."

Among the genes whose expression was deficient in mi/miCMCs, the transactivation mechanism of the mMCP-6 gene has been studied most intensively (18Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The expression of mMCP-6 gene was deficient not only in mi/mi CMCs but also in CMCs derived from other mutants at the mi locus. The tg/tgCMCs that lack MITF did not express the mMCP-6 gene (27Ito A. Morii E. Kim D.K. Kataoka T.R. Jippo T. Maeyama K. Nojima H. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Themiew/miew andmice/mice CMCs, in which the basic domain and the Zip domain of MITF were deleted, respectively, also did not express the mMCP-6 gene (28Morii E. Ogihara H. Kim D.K. Ito A. Oboki K.

Fisher D.E. Lamoreux M.L. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2001; 98: 2577-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the normal (+) MITF was essential for the expression of the mMCP-6 gene. The +-MITF bound the three motifs in the promoter region of the mMCP-6 gene (18Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation of each of these three motifs reduced the magnitude of transactivation by +-MITF. Among them, the GACCTG motif appeared to play the most important role since the magnitude of reduction was greatest after the mutation of the GACCTG motif (18Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the GACCTG motif was partly overlapped by the binding motif recognized by another transcription factor, polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein (PEBP2). PEBP2 interacted with +-MITF and showed functional synergy in the transcription of mMCP-6 gene (26Ogihara H. Kanno T. Morii E. Kim D.K. Lee Y.M. Sato M. Kim W.Y. Nomura S. Ito Y. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we searched the factor that cooperated with +-MITF using the yeast two-hybrid screen and found theMyc-associated zinc-finger protein-related factor (MAZR) as a protein that interacted with +-MITF. MAZR possesses the broad-complex-tramtrack-bric-a-brac (BTB) domain and the zinc-finger domain (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The overexpression of dominant negative MAZR reduced the expression of the mMCP-6 gene in mastocytoma cells. MAZR showed functional synergy with +-MITF for transcription of the mMCP-6 gene. MAZR appeared to play roles in the normal phenotype expression of mast cells in association with +-MITF. The bait plasmid pGBKT7-MITF was constructed by inserting a portion of MITF cDNA, which was deleted in the N-terminal 161 residues, into pGBKT7 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system 3 (CLONTECH) using pGBKT7-MITF as bait and a mouse lymphoma cell cDNA library (CLONTECH). Approximately 2 × 108Hf7c yeast transformants were screened for His autotrophy. β-galactosidase assay was used for isolating positive clones. The isolated clones were sequenced in both directions with ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). CMCs were obtained by culturing spleen cells of +/+ mice as described previously (17Morii E. Jippo T. Tsujimura T. Hashimoto K. Kim D.K. Lee Y.M. Ogihara H. Tsujino K. Kim H.M. Kitamura Y.

NIH/3T3 cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The DNA fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of MAZR was obtained by PCR from the reverse-transcribed product of CMCs. The used primers were 5′-ATGGAGCGGGTCAACGACGCTTCTTGCGGT and 5′-TCACTTCCCTTCAGGCCCCATGGGCTGCTG. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplified fragment was also subcloned into pGEX-3X glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-expressing vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and into pEF-BOS expression vector kindly provided by Dr. S. Nagata of Osaka University (32Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 185322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Various fragments of MAZR were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript or pEF-BOS. The expression plasmid containing MAZR fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the expression plasmid containing MAZR fused with FLAG epitope tag were described before (30Kobayashi A.

The expression plasmid and the pBluescript containing normal or mutant MITFs, the expression plasmid containing Myc-tagged normal or mutant MITFs, and the GST-expressing plasmid containing +-MITF were also described previously (19Ogihara H.

Each RNA sample was prepared from 1.0 × 107 CMCs, MST cells, and Jurkat cells by the lithium chloride-urea method (35Auffray C. Rougenon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed using the full-length MAZR (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K.

After hybridization at 42 °C, blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mmol/liter NaCl and 15 mmol/liter trisodium citrate, pH 7.4) and subjected to autoradiography. The expression plasmid containing +-MITF and the expression plasmid containing MAZR fused with GFP were cotransfected to NIH/3T3 cells using TransFast Transfection Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were fixed with 100% methanol and permiated by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-MITF antibody (Ab). Immunoreacted cells were detected with anti-rabbit IgG Ab conjugated with rhodamine (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The cells expressing +-MITF were detected with the red filter, and the cells expressing MAZR fused with GFP were detected with the green filter. The specimens were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The Myc-tagged normal or mutant MITF was coexpressed with FLAG-tagged MAZR in 293T cells using TransFast Transfection Reagent (Promega). The nuclear or whole cell extract was obtained by the method described previously (38Takebayashi K. Chida K. Tsukamoto I. Morii E. Munakata H. Arnheiter H. Kuroki T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear or whole cell extract was incubated with LIP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 1 h with gentle rocking and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatants were transferred into new tubes and incubated with protein G-Sepharose and anti-Myc monoclonal Ab (9E10, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) or anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma) for 1 h in LIP buffer. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with LIP buffer, resuspended in loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Myc monoclonal Ab. The 35S-labeled normal or mutant MITF protein was synthesized using the reticulocyte lysate system (TNT system, Promega). The 35S-labeled normal or mutant MAZR protein was also synthesized. For the binding assays, the35S-labeled normal or mutant MITF protein was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with GST-MAZR or GST alone immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The 35S-labeled normal or mutant MAZR protein was also incubated with GST-+-MITF or GST alone immobilized on beads. The beads were washed four times. Proteins retained on the beads were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The transfection to MST cells and to Jurkat cells were performed by electroporation. The reporter plasmid that contained the promoter region of the mMCP-6 gene starting from nucleotide (nt) −171 or nt −151 and the reporter plasmid with the minimal mMCP-6 promoter starting from nt −61 were described previously (26Ogihara H. Kanno T. Morii E. Kim D.K. Lee Y.M. Sato M. Kim W.Y. Nomura S. Ito Y. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid mutated at the MITF-binding GACCTG motif in the mMCP-6 promoter and the reporter plasmid possessing the tetrameric fragment between nt −171 and −151 upstream from the minimal mMCP-6 promoter were also described previously (26Ogihara H. Kanno T. Morii E. Kim D.K. Lee Y.M. Sato M. Kim W.Y. Nomura S. Ito Y. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pEF-BOS expression plasmid containing +-MITF, mutant MITFs, MAZR, or mutant MAZRs was used as the effector plasmid. In luciferase assays, 5 μg of a reporter, 2 μg of effector plasmids, and 1 μg of an expression vector containing the β-galactosidase gene were cotransfected to Jurkat cells. The expression vector containing the β-galactosidase gene was used as an internal control. When two kinds of effector plasmids were used, equal amounts of both plasmids were transfected. In some experiments, 5 μg of a reporter, 2 μg of the expression plasmid containing +-MITF, 2 or 4 μg of the expression plasmid containing the dominant negative form of MAZR and 1 μg of an expression vector containing the β-galactosidase gene were cotransfected to MST cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection and lysed with 0.1 mol/liter potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100. Soluble extracts were then assayed for luciferase activity with a luminometer LB96P (Berthold GmbH, Wildbad, Germany) and for β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity was normalized by the β-galactosidase activity and the total protein concentration as described previously (18Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The normalized value was divided by the value obtained without effector plasmids, and the divided value was expressed as the relative luciferase activity. We searched for proteins that were associated with +-MITF by yeast two-hybrid screening. The full-length +-MITF was not suitable as bait, since the full-length +-MITF fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain was a strong transactivator of reporter genes. We deleted the transactivation domain and obtained the new construct, truncating the N-terminal 161 amino acids (aa) of MITF (MITF-(162–419). MITF-(162–419) contained the bHLH-Zip domain. MITF-(162–419) fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain was used as bait. Positive transformants were selected for His autotrophy and β-galactosidase assay. We isolated eighteen positive cDNA clones. Four of the 18 clones encoded the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9, and one of the 18 clones encoded protein kinase C-interacting protein. UBC9 and protein kinase C-interacting protein were previously shown to associate with MITF (39Xu U. Gong L. Haddad M.M. Biscof O. Campisi J. Yeh E.T.H. Medrano E.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,40Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.N. Arudchandran R. Rivela J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). One of the other clones was found to encode a part of cDNA of a transcription factor, MAZR. MAZR consisted of 641 aa and contains a BTB domain in the N terminus (aa 1–145) and seven zinc-finger domains in the C terminus (aa 288–641) (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By Northern blotting, the expression of the MAZR gene was detected in CMCs and MST mastocytoma cells, but was hardly detectable in Jurkat T cells (Fig.1). The interaction of MAZR to +-MITF was confirmed by two experiments. First, MAZR fused with GFP was coexpressed with +-MITF in NIH/3T3 cells, and their subcellular localization was examined. The +-MITF and MAZR were colocalized in the nucleus of NIH/3T3 cells (Fig.2 A). Next, the co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Myc-tagged +-MITF and FLAG-tagged MAZR were coexpressed in 293T cells, and their nuclear extract was analyzed. The immunoprecipitated product with anti-FLAG Ab contained Myc-tagged +-MITF (Fig. 2 B). To identify the region of +-MITF that was required for the interaction with MAZR, we carried out in vitro binding experiments. Various mutants of MITF were constructed (Fig.3 A). The mi-MITF deletes one arginine in the basic domain. MITF-(1–298) possesses the Zip domain, but deletes the C-terminal region downstream of the Zip domain. MITF-(1–260) deletes the Zip domain. The35S-labeled normal or mutant MITF was subjected to coprecipitation with GST or GST-MAZR fusion protein that was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The complex of +-MITF and GST-MAZR was detected, but that of +-MITF and GST was not (Fig. 3 B). Themi-MITF and MITF-(1–298) bound GST-MAZR-coated beads but not GST-coated beads (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, MITF-(1–260), which lacked the Zip domain, did not bind GST-MAZR-coated beads (Fig.3 B). The region required for the interaction with MAZR was also examined by a co-immunoprecipitation study. Myc-tagged +-MITF, Myc-taggedmi-MITF, and Myc-tagged MITF-(1–260) were coexpressed with FLAG-tagged MAZR in 293T cells, and their whole cell lysate was analyzed. The immunoprecipitated product with anti-FLAG Ab contained Myc-tagged +-MITF or Myc-tagged mi-MITF, but did not contain Myc-tagged MITF-(1–260) that lacked the Zip domain (Fig.3 C). Next, the region of MAZR necessary for the interaction with MITF was examined by in vitro binding experiments. MAZR deleting the zinc-finger domain (MAZR-(1–288)), MAZR deleting the BTB domain (MAZR-(145–641)), and MAZR containing the zinc-finger domain alone (MAZR-(288–641)) were constructed (Fig.4 A). MAZR, MAZR-(145–641), and MAZR-(288–641) bound GST-+-MITF-coated beads but not GST-coated beads (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, MAZR-(1–288) that lacked the zinc-finger domain did not bind GST-+-MITF-coated beads (Fig.4 B). Since the +-MITF strongly transactivated the mMCP-6 promoter in mast cells (18Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of MAZR on the function of +-MITF was examined. To examine whether the endogenous MAZR increased the amount of mMCP-6 mRNA, we used a dominant negative MAZR. The dominant negative MAZR is a mutant that possesses only a part of the zinc-finger domain (aa 409–496). We overexpressed the dominant negative MAZR in MST cells that expressed both mMCP-6 and MAZR mRNAs. After 6 days of culture, the expression of mMCP-6 gene was examined by Northern blotting. The overexpression of dominant negative MAZR significantly reduced the amount of mMCP-6 mRNA (Fig.5 A). Next, we cotransfected the dominant negative MAZR to MST cells with the reporter plasmid containing the promoter region of the mMCP-6 gene. This reporter plasmid possessed the GACCTG motif to which +-MITF bound. When various amounts of dominant negative MAZR were cotransfected, the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). The functional synergy between +-MITF and MAZR was examined. To remove the possible involvement of endogenous MITF and MAZR, we used Jurkat cells that expressed neither MITF (19Ogihara H. Morii E. Kim D.K. Oboki K. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2001; 97: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) nor MAZR. The expression plasmid containing +-MITF cDNA and that containing MAZR cDNA were cotransfected to Jurkat cells with the reporter plasmid used in Fig.5 B. The transfection of the plasmid containing +-MITF cDNA alone and the transfection of the plasmid containing MAZR cDNA alone did not increase the luciferase activity. In contrast, the simultaneous transfection of these plasmids increased the luciferase activity ∼40-fold (Fig.6). Various mutants of MITF were cotransfected with MAZR. The synergy with MAZR was not observed when mi-MITF or MITF-(1–260) deleting the Zip domain was cotransfected (Fig.7). Next, various mutants of MAZR were cotransfected with +-MITF. MAZR-(145–641) and MAZR-(288–641) showed the synergy with +-MITF, but MAZR-(1–288) deleting the zinc-finger domain did not (Fig. 7). Then, we examined the DNA element that was necessary for the synergy between MAZR and +-MITF. The +-MITF bound the GACCTG motif in the mMCP-6 promoter but not the mutated GTCCAG motif (Fig. 8 A) (18Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation or deletion of the GACCTG motif abolished the synergy (Fig.8 B). The tetrameric fragments between nt −171 and −151 were cloned into the plasmid with the minimal mMCP-6 promoter starting from nt −61. A significant synergy between +-MITF and MAZR was observed in the reporter plasmid containing the tetrameric fragments but not in the reporter plasmid containing the minimal mMCP-6 promoter alone (Fig. 8 C). No synergy was observed in the reporter plasmid that contained the tetrameric fragments mutated at the GACCTG motif (Fig. 8 C). MAZR was isolated as a protein that interacted with +-MITF by yeast two-hybrid screening. MAZR was first cloned as the protein interacting with Bach2, which is a transcription factor possessing both the BTB domain and the b-Zip domain (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MAZR transactivates the c-myc gene in B cells and is important for the development of B cells in association with Bach2 (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In mast cells, MAZR transactivated the mMCP-6 gene in cooperation with +-MITF. MAZR may show synergy with +-MITF in the transcription of other genes in mast cells. MAZR appeared to play some roles in the normal phenotype expression of mast cells in association with +-MITF. The deletion of the zinc-finger domain of MAZR abolished the physical interaction and functional synergy with +-MITF. This suggested that the zinc-finger domain of MAZR was essential for the interaction with +-MITF. The Zip domain of MITF mediated the physical interaction and functional synergy with MAZR. The Zip domain of cAMP-response element-binding protein interacted with the zinc-finger domain of YY1 (41Zhou Q. Gedrich R.W. Engel D.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present result may be another example of such interactions. The MITF encoded by the mutant mice allele deletes the Zip domain (3Steingrimsson E. Moore K.J. Lamoreux M.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Zimring D.C. Skow L.C. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The mMCP-6 gene was not expressed in mast cells of mice/mice genotype (28Morii E. Ogihara H. Kim D.K. Ito A. Oboki K. Lee Y.M. Jippo T. Maeyama K. Nomura S. Lamoreux M.L. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2001; 97: 2038-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the Zip domain of MITF mediated the interaction with MAZR, the loss of expression of the mMCP-6 gene might be attributable to the abolishment of synergy between MITF and MAZR inmice/mice mast cells. The MITF encoded by the mutant miew allele (miew -MITF) deletes most of the portion of the basic domain (3Steingrimsson E. Moore K.J. Lamoreux M.L. Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Zimring D.C. Skow L.C. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The mMCP-6 gene was also not expressed in mast cells of the miew/miew genotype (29Morii E. Ogihara H. Oboki K. Kataoka T.R. Maeyama K. Fisher D.E. Lamoreux M.L. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2001; 98: 2577-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since the basic domain of MITF mediates the DNA binding (4Hemesath T.J. Streingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnhheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Gene. Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), the loss of expression of the mMCP-6 gene might be attributable to the deficient DNA binding of the complex ofmiew -MITF and MAZR inmiew/miew mast cells. MAZR recognizes the G-rich motif of DNA (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The consensus binding sequence of MAZR is (G/C)GGGGGGGG(A/C)C (30Kobayashi A. Yamagiwa H. Hoshino H. Muto A. Sato K. Morita M. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1733-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the promoter region of the mMCP-6 gene, there was a sequence GTGGTGGGGAC between nt −138 and −128, in which nine of 11 nucleotides were matched to the MAZR-consensus sequence. However, this sequence was not essential for the synergy between +-MITF and MAZR, since the synergy was observed in the reporter plasmid containing the fragment between nt −171 and −151 alone upstream of the minimal mMCP-6 promoter. No G-rich motif was found in the fragment between nt −171 and −151 or in the minimal mMCP-6 promoter. The G-rich motif appeared dispensable for the synergy between MAZR and +-MITF. Instead, the GACCTG motif between nt −166 and −161, to which +-MITF bound, was required for the synergy, since the mutation at the GACCTG motif abolished it. The binding of +-MITF to the GACCTG motif activated the mMCP-6 promoter, and binding of MAZR to +-MITF might further enhance the promoter activity. PEBP2 showed synergy with +-MITF for the transcription of the mMCP-6 gene (26Ogihara H. Kanno T. Morii E. Kim D.K. Lee Y.M. Sato M. Kim W.Y. Nomura S. Ito Y. Kitamura Y.

The formation of the triple complex consisting of +-MITF, PEBP2, and MAZR might be possible. The triple complex might efficiently enhance the transcription of the mMCP-6 gene in mast cells. Taken together, MAZR interacted with +-MITF and synergistically transactivated the mMCP-6 promoter. MAZR appeared important for the normal phenotypic expression of mast cells. We thank Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W2020111263,"In Escherichia coli, the homodimeric Krebs cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (EcIDH) is regulated by reversible phosphorylation of a sequestered active site serine. The phosphorylation cycle is catalyzed by a bifunctional protein, IDH kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P). To better understand the nature of the interaction between EcIDH and IDH-K/P, we have examined the ability of an IDH homologue from Bacillus subtilis (BsIDH) to serve as a substrate for the kinase and phosphatase activities. BsIDH exhibits extensive sequence and structural similarities with EcIDH, particularly around the phosphorylated serine. Our previous crystallographic analysis revealed that the active site architecture of these two proteins is almost completely conserved. We now expand the comparison to include a number of biochemical properties. Both IDHs display nearly equivalent steady-state kinetic parameters for the dehydrogenase reaction. Both proteins are also phosphorylated by IDH-K/P in the same ratio (1 mole of phosphate per mole of monomer), and this stoichiometric phosphorylation correlates with an equivalent inhibition of IDH activity. Furthermore, tandem electrospray mass spectrometry demonstrates that BsIDH, like EcIDH, is phosphorylated on the corresponding active site serine residue (Ser-104). Despite the high degree of sequence, functional, and structural congruence between these two proteins, BsIDH is surprisingly a much poorer substrate of IDH-K/P than is EcIDH, with Michaelis constants for the kinase and phosphatase activities elevated by 60- and 3,450-fold, respectively. These drastically disparate values might result from restricted access to the active site cavity and/or from the lack of a potential docking site for IDH-K/P.

Crystallographic studies revealed that the phosphorylation site, Ser-113, is buried within the active site crevice (4Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingham V. Helmers N.H.

The IDH phosphorylation cycle is catalyzed by IDH kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P), a bifunctional enzyme encoded by aceK (12LaPorte D.C.

LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16095-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of affinity labeling and analyses of the effects of site-directed and random mutagenesis of aceK suggest that all three activities are located in the same active site (15Miller S.P.

Our working model proposes that the phosphatase reaction results from the kinase back reaction tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis (15Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16LaPorte D.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). One of our goals is to understand the structural basis for the recognition of EcIDH by IDH-K/P. As an approach to this problem, we have employed the isocitrate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsIDH) as a substrate analogue for IDH-K/P. Although BsIDH does not appear to be phosphorylated in vivo, 2A. L. Sonenshein, personal communication. it maintains extensive sequence and structural similarity with EcIDH (19Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structural congruence includes the active site, where almost all of the residues implicated in ligand binding and catalysis are conserved (19Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we extend the comparative analysis between BsIDH and EcIDH to include the dehydrogenase reaction, along with a quantitative examination of the effect of phosphorylation on IDH activity. We also demonstrate that BsIDH is phosphorylated once per monomer and on the corresponding active site serine. Despite the similarities revealed by these experiments, BsIDH is a strikingly poor substrate of IDH-K/P. These data are interpreted in light of our recently solved crystal structure of BsIDH (19Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). EcIDH was overexpressed from the multicopy plasmid pSML1, atet R derivative of pTK509 (13LaPorte D.C. Thorsness P.E. Koshland D.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that had been transformed into E. coli strain ST2010R (15Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). BsIDH was overexpressed from plasmid pKM14 that had been transformed into theE. coli icd-deletion strain KME44 (19Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). EcIDH was purified by a modification of the method employed in Garnak and Reeves (20Garnak M. Reeves H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7915-7920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were disrupted in a French press (12,600 psi) instead of a sonicator, and a gel filtration column (Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution, 2.5 × 130 cm, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used as the final step instead of Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) chromatography. BsIDH was purified in a manner similar to that employed for EcIDH except that the initial protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate steps were omitted. Instead, lysed cells were centrifuged at 46,000 ×g for 90 min at 4 °C to remove debris and directly applied to a pre-equilibrated DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 48 cm, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). IDH-K/P was overexpressed in E. coli strain ST2010R harboring the plasmid pEKL1 as described previously (15Miller S.P. Karschnia E.J. Ikeda T.P. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was then purified via DEAE-Sepharose and IDH-Sepharose chromatographies as published elsewhere (12LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both phospho-EcIDH and phospho-BsIDH were prepared in vitrousing purified IDH-K/P and ATP. Phospho-IDHs were then separated from IDH-K/P, dephospho-IDH, Pi, and any remaining nucleotides by applying the reaction mixture to a column composed of a top layer of Bio-Gel P6 resin (Bio-Rad) and a bottom layer of Affi-Gel Blue resin, as outlined previously (21LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All proteins were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined by the Peterson protocol (23Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), a variation of the Lowry method (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. EcIDH and BsIDH activities were measured by monitoring the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH at 37 °C in an ISS K-2 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 459 nm, respectively. The standard reaction (500 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and variable concentrations of NADP+ andd-isocitrate (prepared with equimolar MgCl2). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 8 ng of either EcIDH or BsIDH, and the increase in fluorescence intensity (F.I.) was followed over the course of 1.5 min. Initial rates were determined via linear regression of the change in F.I. with time. The correlation between intensity and micromolars of NADPH was determined by measuring the F.I. for a known amount of NADPH generated by the complete conversion of NADP+ in the presence of excessd-isocitrate and IDH. NADP+ concentrations were ascertained spectrophotometrically by measuring A 259 with a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m−1cm−1 and a path length of 1 cm. d-isocitrate concentrations were determined by completely converting isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the presence of excess NADP+ and then by measuring the amount of NADPH produced. The resulting NADPH concentration is equimolar with α-ketoglutarate and was determined by measuring A 340 with a molar extinction coefficient of 6,220 m−1 cm−1 and a path length of 1 cm. For calculation of kinetic constants, the concentration ofd-isocitrate was varied at several fixed concentrations of NADP+. The average initial velocity was obtained from at least three measurements for each pair of substrate concentration. The data were graphed as Lineweaver-Burk plots, and linear regression was then employed to construct slope and intercept replots (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). These replots were linear and were subsequently used to calculate the values of the kinetic parameters. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation and the effect on IDH activity were ascertained by simultaneously quantitating the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into IDH and by measuring the resulting decrease in IDH activity, as described previously (21LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The standard reaction (350 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼300 cpm/pmol, prepared with equimolar MgCl2), and 2.0 μm of either EcIDH or BsIDH. Duplicate reactions for each IDH were initiated by adding IDH-K/P (441 ng for EcIDH or 2,674 ng for BsIDH) and incubated at 37 °C. At every time point indicated in Fig. 1, a 50-μl aliquot of each reaction was removed, terminated with 10 μl of 120 mmEDTA, and placed on ice. The production of [32P]phospho-IDH was monitored by precipitating the protein from 20 μl of each terminated sample onto filter paper with trichloroacetic acid and then measuring the amount of radioactivity following extensive washing of the filter paper squares, as outlined elsewhere (21LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). IDH activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the production of NADPH at A 340 at 37 °C. The dehydrogenase assay contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm NADP+, 0.5 mmd,l-isocitrate, and 5 mmMgCl2. Five μg of purified dephospho-BsIDH or phospho-BsIDH were electrophoresed on a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean III system using 12.5% acrylamide gels of 1.5-mm thickness and then silver-stained with the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit. Protein bands were excised, destained, and digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (625 μg/band, Promega) according to a protocol adapted from Shevchenko et al. (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Extracted, dehydrated peptides were subsequently reconstituted in 15 μl of 4% acetonitrile, 0.2% acetic acid just prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Tryptic peptides were separated on a reverse-phase capillary HPLC system (Magic 2002, Michrome BioResources) employing a C18 column (0.075 × 70 mm, 5-μm particle diameter, 200-Å pore size) with mobile phases of 2% acetonitrile, 0.2% acetic acid (solution A) and 97.8% acetonitrile, 0.2% acetic acid (solution B). The flow rate was set to run at 450 nl/min over 60 min. The HPLC was connected on-line to an LCQ Classic electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) for direct measurement of peptides as they eluted from the column. The instrument was programmed to automatically switch to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) mode and acquire collision-induced dissociation spectra if the intensity of the parent ion peaks exceeded a preset threshold. During the MS/MS phase, charged peptides isolated in the ion trap are bombarded with neutral argon, xenon, or helium molecules (27Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Biotechnology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar); helium gas was used in the LCQ Classic. This collision induces relatively mild fragmentation, with multiply charged species fragmenting more easily than singly charged ones (28DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Fragmentation occurring along the peptide backbone generates two classes of daughter ions: b n ions are those produced by cleavage from the C terminus but which retain charge on the N terminus; y n ions are those produced by cleavage from the N terminus but which retain charge on the C terminus. Therefore, b-type ions include N-terminal amino acids, whereas y-type ions include C-terminal amino acids (27Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Biotechnology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar, 29Biemann K. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 16: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were initially identified by constructing a “data base” consisting of BsIDH and then searching this minimized data base with the program SEAQUEST (30Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar, 31Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). The user interface permitted us to add a theoretical phosphate moiety to every serine, threonine, and tyrosine in the amino acid sequence. The program was then able to consider every peptide as both modified and unmodified, compare the theoretical tandem mass spectra with actual fragmentation patterns, and calculate a correlation coefficient. The MS/MS scans selected by SEAQUEST were then visualized with the Qual Browser software from ThermoFinnigan and manually scrutinized for the presence of the expected b n and y n daughter ions. IDH kinase activity was measured by monitoring the transfer of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP to IDH at 37 °C, as described previously (21LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (saturating, ∼1 × 107cpm/assay, prepared with equimolar MgCl2) and variable concentrations of either EcIDH or BsIDH. The reactions, performed in triplicate for each concentration, were initiated by the addition of IDH-K/P (8.4 ng for EcIDH or 42 ng for BsIDH) and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The production of [32P]phospho-IDH was quantitated by acid-precipitating the protein onto filter paper and then measuring the amount of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. IDH phosphatase activity was measured by monitoring the release of [32P]phosphate from [32P]phospho-IDH at 37 °C, as described previously (21LaPorte D.C. Koshland D.E., Jr. Nature. 1983; 305: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The standard reaction (50 μl) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP (saturating, prepared with equimolar MgCl2) and variable concentrations of either [32P]phospho-EcIDH or [32P]phospho-BsIDH (∼5 × 104cpm/assay). The reactions, performed in triplicate for each concentration, were initiated by the addition of IDH-K/P (4.2 ng for phospho-EcIDH or 1,300 ng for phospho-BsIDH) and then incubated for 20 min. at 37 °C. The amount of [32P]phosphate released was quantitated in the supernatant following acid precipitation of the protein with trichloroacetic acid. Kinetic constants were obtained by linear regression of Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data. BsIDH is structurally similar to EcIDH, making this protein a good candidate for a substrate analogue of E. coliIDH-K/P. It is particularly noteworthy that almost all of the residues implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in the two IDHs are conserved and occupy virtually identical positions in three-dimensional space (19Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This conservation includes Ser-113, a residue that plays a dual role as a contributor to isocitrate binding and as the site of phosphorylation in EcIDH. To further characterize the extent of conservation between EcIDH and BsIDH, we examined the initial velocity kinetics of their respective dehydrogenase activities. Measurements of the initial velocities of BsIDH and EcIDH both produced intersecting patterns on Lineweaver-Burk plots (data not shown), indicative of a sequential (ordered or random) mechanism. Both enzymes displayed nearly equivalent maximum velocities and Michaelis constants for d-isocitrate and NADP+ (Table I). The only significant difference between these proteins was the observation that the apparent dissociation and Michaelis constants for each substrate are nearly identical for EcIDH but not for BsIDH. However, the precise significance of this disparity is uncertain since EcIDH appears to act via a steady-state random bi ter mechanism (32Dean A.M. Koshland D.E., Jr. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9302-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and such mechanisms are governed by extremely complex rate laws (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Thus, despite this minor difference, the kinetic behaviors of EcIDH and BsIDH are quite similar, as would be predicted from the extensive sequence and structural congruence between them.Table IKinetic constants for BsIDH and EcIDHEnzymeD-IsocitrateNADP+K m1-aKm = Michaelis constant.

Open table in a new tab The data shown are the average ± S.E. obtained from at least three independent experiments. The second step in our comparative analysis between BsIDH and EcIDH was to ascertain whether BsIDH could be phosphorylated in vitro by IDH-K/P. Preliminary experiments combining the purified proteins with [γ−32P]ATP and examining the reaction mixture via SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography demonstrated that BsIDH could indeed could be phosphorylated (data not shown). We subsequently determined the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation reaction and its effect on dehydrogenase activity. This was accomplished with a time course experiment in which the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into either BsIDH or EcIDH was monitored along with any corresponding decrease in IDH activity. As shown in Fig. 1, stoichiometric phosphorylation resulted in essentially complete inhibition of dehydrogenase activity for both BsIDH as well as EcIDH. These data imply that, in each enzyme, there is only one phosphate group per subunit and that this phosphate is responsible for the loss of IDH activity. Mass spectrometry was employed to determine whether BsIDH was phosphorylated on Ser-104, the residue homologous to the phosphorylation site in EcIDH, Ser-113. Both dephospho-BsIDH and phospho-BsIDH were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and the resulting peptides were analyzed via LC/ESI/MS/MS (liquid chromatography connected on-line to an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer operating in tandem mode). Data for dephospho-BsIDH were examined first. The tryptic peptide containing the putative phosphorylation site, 104-SLNVALR-110, has a predicted unprotonated monoisotopic mass of 771.47 Da (m/z 772.47 and m/z 386.74 for the singly and doubly charged species, respectively). A peptide with these features eluted from the column at 21.83 min, and the MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged ion is shown in Fig.2 A. As indicated on the figure and in Table II, five of seven theoretically possible b n ions (singly charged) and six of seven theoretically possible y n ions (singly charged) were observed.

Open table in a new tab With this result in hand, data for phospho-BsIDH were analyzed next. If the peptide contained a phosphate group, then its predicted unprotonated monoisotopic mass would be 851.43 Da (m/z 852.43 and m/z 426.72 for the singly and doubly charged species, respectively). A peptide with these features eluted from the HPLC column at 15.98 min, and the MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of the doubly charged species is shown in Fig. 2 B. As indicated on the figure and in Table II, five of seven theoretically possible b n ions (singly charged) and six of seven theoretically possible y n ions (singly charged) were present. Close inspection reveals that each of the b n ions was ∼80 Da (mass of the phosphate moiety) greater than the corresponding b n ions from the dephospho-peptide. This, along with the parent ion at m/z 426.7, verifies the sequence of this peptide as pSLNVALR. Further confirmation is provided by a second series of singly charged b n ions, denoted b nΔ (33Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), that were 98 Da (mass of H3PO4) less than the corresponding b n ions. It has been documented that in ion trap MS/MS, phosphoserine loses H3PO4 via β-elimination to produce dehydroalanine. This 98-Da loss is the unequivocal fingerprint of a phosphopeptide, particularly one containing a phosphoserine (28DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The sequences and structures of EcIDH and BsIDH are extremely similar, as are their dehydrogenase kinetics. Furthermore, both proteins were phosphorylated by E. coli IDH-K/P once per monomer and on corresponding residues. We finally examined the kinetics of the IDH kinase and phosphatase reactions. Despite the extensive congruence between these proteins, the Michaelis constant"

We therefore examined a 3′-flanking segment of the CD40L gene, which contained a putative NF-κB/Relcis-element, for its ability to enhance CD40L promoter function. This segment augmented CD40L promoter activity in an orientation-independent manner in CD4 T-lineage cells but not in human B cell or monocyte cell lines. Mapping of CD4 T-lineage cell nuclei identified a DNase I-hypersensitive site in the flanking region near the NF-κB/Rel sequence, suggesting a transcriptional regulatory role. This was further supported by truncation analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, which indicated that the CD40L 3′-flanking NF-κB/Relcis-element was critical for enhancer function. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that thecis-element preferentially bound the p50 form of the NF-κB1 gene contained in human T cell nuclear protein extracts. This binding also appeared to occur in vivo in CD4 T cells based on chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using NF-κB p50-specific antiserum.

Full T cell activation requires coordinate engagement of the αβ-T cell receptor-CD3 complex and the costimulatory molecule CD28, leading to an increased concentration of free intracellular calcium, [Ca2+] i, and the activation of small GTP-binding proteins, such as Ras, and protein kinase C isoenzymes (8Acuto O.

These events lead to an increase in the activity of transcription factors implicated in cytokine and TNF ligand gene transcription including NF-κB/Rel, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and leucine zipper (Fos/Jun, CREB/ATF, and Maf) families of proteins (9Crabtree G.R.

T cell activation has been mimicked through direct intracellular activation of [Ca2+] i - and Ras/protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathways by the combination of calcium ionophore, such as ionomycin, and phorbol esters, such as phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (13Truneh A.

Although the molecular events leading to CD40L expression appear to be similar to those eliciting expression of other cytokines (TNF and IL-2), transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding CD40L remains poorly understood. Previous studies suggest that both the IL-2 and TNF genes contain enhancer-like segments that include functional NF-κB/Rel cis-activating elements important for their transcriptional activation. The 5′-flanking region of the human IL-2 gene consists of an inner core promoter immediately upstream of the 5′ transcription start site and an adjacent 275-bp segment, located between bp −52 and −326 with respect to the transcription start site. This adjacent region behaves as a classic enhancer (i.e. it increases the activity of the core IL-2 promoter and does so in an orientation-independent manner) (17Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This enhancer contains most of the cis-activating elements known to be required for optimal IL-2 gene transcription, including binding sites for NF-κB/Rel, NFAT, and leucine zipper proteins (11Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). A transcriptional enhancer active in mononuclear phagocyte cells has also been identified in the 3′-flanking region of the human TNF gene (18Seiler-Tuyns A. Dufour N. Spertini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21714-21718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This region includes a NF-κB/Rel binding site that may contribute to increased TNF promoter activity (19Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, it is not known if this TNF 3′-flanking enhancer segment is active in T-lineage cells. Multiple putative NF-κB/Rel cis-elements have been identified in the TNF gene's 5′-flanking region and appear to be important for TNF expression by mononuclear phagocytes (20Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the NF-κB site of the IL-2 gene, the NF-κB/Rel elements in the TNF promoter do not appear to regulate gene expression in T cells (21Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kwiatkowski D. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4045-4052PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, the concerted binding of NFAT and leucine zipper proteins to the 5′-flanking region of the TNF gene appears to be essential for expression in activated CD4 T cells (21Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kwiatkowski D. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4045-4052PubMed Google Scholar). Like the TNF and IL-2 genes, CD40L gene transcription in activated T cells requires the cooperative binding of NFAT and leucine zipper proteins to the 5′-flanking region (22Schubert L.A. King G. Cron R.Q. Lewis D.B. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Tsytsykova A.V. Tsitsikov E.N. Geha R.S. J.

Commun. 2000; 279: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A putative NF-κB/Relcis-element, GGGATTTCCA, has been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the CD40L gene based on sequence analysis (25Shimadzu M. Nunoi H. Terasaki H. Ninomiya R. Iwata M. Kanegasaka S. Matsuda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and has recently been reported to enhance promoter activity, possibly by binding NF-κB p65 (26Srahna M. Remacle J.E. Annamalai K. Pype K. Huylebroek D. Boogaerts M.A. Vandenberghe P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2001; 125: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a CD28 response element has also been identified in the CD40L promoter, identifying a role for CD28 engagement in the regulation of the CD40L promoter in CD4 T-lineage cells (27Parra E. Mustelin T. Dohlsten M. Mercola D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2437-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, no enhancer elements contributing to CD40L gene transcription by T cells or other cells have been described. Here, we show that the human CD40L gene contains a T cell-specific, NF-κB/Rel protein-dependent, classical enhancer in its 3′-flanking region that may be important in the regulation of CD40L transcription. Human CD4 T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of normal adult donors were either used directly (freshly isolated cells) or primed by in vitro treatment with mitogen (concanavalin A (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)) and recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukin; Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (28Cron R.Q.

Total cellular RNA was isolated (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from CD4 T cells after 3 h of culture with or without activating stimuli (1.5 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) plus 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma)). Random hexamer-primed reverse transcription (2 μg of total RNA/sample) was performed using the reagents contained in a TaqMan Gold RT-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Two μl of each reverse transcription reaction was submitted to real time quantitative PCR in an ABI Prism 5700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplifications were performed in 96-well plates using oligonucleotide primers for transcript amplification of human CD40L (sense, 5′-CCAGGTGCTTCGGTGTTTGT-3′; antisense, 5′-ATGGCTCACTTGGCTTGGAT-3′) (6Gauchat J.F. Aubry J.P. Mazzei G. Life P. Jomotte T. Elson G.

Nature. 1983; 302: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (proprietary primers purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For all primer sets, the reverse-transcribed samples were amplified in triplicate using the reagents contained in a SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence signals were detected during each of 40 cycles (denaturing 15 s at 95 °C, annealing/extension 1 min at 60 °C), as determined by binding of SYBR green to double-stranded DNA products (34Jinquan T. Quan S. Jacobi H.H. Reimert C.M. Millner A. Hansen J.B. Thygesen C. Ryder L.P. Madsen H.O. Malling H.J. Poulsen L.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 21-24PubMed Google Scholar). Denaturing curves of CD40L, IL-2, and GAPDH products, performed at the end of the PCR, confirmed the homogeneity of the DNA products. A standard curve was included in each plate, consisting of serial dilutions of a reverse-transcribed sample of activated adult CD4 T cell RNA amplified for CD40L, IL-2, and GAPDH transcripts. The cycle threshold (Ct) value is the calculated PCR cycle at which products first become detectable and is inversely related to the abundance of transcripts in the initial RNA sample (34Jinquan T. Quan S. Jacobi H.H. Reimert C.M. Millner A. Hansen J.B. Thygesen C. Ryder L.P. Madsen H.O. Malling H.J. Poulsen L.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 21-24PubMed Google Scholar). This value was determined using software included as part of the ABI Prism 5700 Sequence Detector System, following the manufacturer's instructions. The Ct values for GAPDH transcripts in the stimulated and unstimulated RNA samples were used as a control, and results were normalized to GAPDH. Comparable GAPDH cycle threshold values indicated that the amount of mRNA reverse transcribed and potentially amplifiable by PCR was similar in unstimulated and stimulated samples. The human CD40L gene sequence has been previously published (35Seyama K. Kira S. Ishidoh K. Souma S. Miyakawa T. Kominami E. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 1284-bp 3′-flanking region of the CD40L gene analyzed in this study is shown in Fig. 1 A. Maps of the firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs, all derived from the pGL2 basic vector (Promega), are shown in Fig. 1 B. To simplify the nomenclature, these constructs are named based on their CD40L promoter and 3′-flanking segments, omitting reference to the intervening luciferase reporter gene. pCD40L was created by subcloning a 1.3-kb HindIII/HindIII fragment containing the human CD40L promoter 5′-flanking segment from the construct gp39-luc (22Schubert L.A.

The pIL-2, pIL-4, and pIL-13 constructs directed by the 5′-flanking segments of the human IL-2 (0.6-kb), IL-4 (0.6-kb), and IL-13 (1.1-kb) genes, respectively, were similarly derived from pGL2-Basic, as previously described (22Schubert L.A.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3316-3326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSV40, in which the luciferase cDNA is directed by a 0.2-kb segment of the SV40 large T antigen promoter, was purchased (pGL2 Promoter Vector; Promega). The 1284-bp segment of the human CD40L gene's 3′-flanking region (3′FL) was subcloned into pCD40L at adjacent BamHI and SalI cloning sites, located 1 kb 3′ of the luciferase gene, creating pCD40L.3′FL (Fig. 2 B). Subcloning used a naturally occurring 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ SalI site generated by PCR using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) and a human CD40L genomic λ phage clone as template. This 1284-bp segment begins 103 bp 3′ of the CD40L termination codon and ends 401 bp after the final residue of exon 5 (Fig. 1, Aand B (35)). Constructs containing the entire 1284-bp 3′-flanking segment or truncations of this region are numbered using the first residue of the BamHI site as position 1. A similar approach was used to produce a construct containing the 3′ segment in the reverse orientation (pCD40L.R3′FL). An endogenous PstI site was utilized to generate truncations of the full-length segment. Both the 5′ (BamHI/PstI site (bp 1–808)) and the 3′ (PstI/SalI site (bp 809–1284)) fragments were subcloned into the pBS/KS cloning vector (Stratagene). This was followed by secondary subcloning into pCD40L using BamHI and a polylinker-derived SalI site (5′ fragment) or a polylinker-derived BamHI and SalI site. The construct containing the 5′ fragment (pCD40L.3′FL:1–808) or the 3′ fragment (pCD40L.3′FL.809–1284) retained their original orientation with respect to the CD40L promoter. The 1284-bp CD40L 3′-flanking segment was also subcloned at the BamHI/SalI site 3′ of the luciferase cDNA segment in pIL-2, pIL-13, and pSV40 constructs to create pIL-2.3′FL, pIL-13.3′FL, and pSV40.3′FL, respectively. All PCR generated segments were sequenced to ensure that no polymerase-induced mutations occurred. In some experiments, transfection efficiency was assessed by co-transfection of aRenilla luciferase (Promega) reporter gene construct, in which expression was driven by either the human β-actin promoter (pβ-actin-RL, a gift of M.

A, luciferase activity in CD4 T cells transiently transfected with pGL2-based reporter gene constructs directed by either no promoter segment (pGL2), the 1.3 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the human CD40L gene (pCD40L), or 0.6 kb of the human IL-2 gene 5′-flanking region (pIL-2). Following transfection, CD4 T cells were either stimulated with ionomycin and PMA (Ionomycin + PMA) or with medium alone (Unstimulated) for 6 h prior to assaying for luciferase activity. B, CD40L and IL-2 mRNA levels, normalized against GAPDH, in CD4 T cells after 3 h of stimulation with ionomycin and PMA as determined by real time PCR. For each transcript type, the accumulation of product with each cycle of PCR and the Ct value are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a commercial kit (QuikChange; Stratagene) to introduce dinucleotide substitution mutations into the NF-κB/Rel site of the 3′-flanking segment of the pCD40L.3′FL from the wild type sequence of GGGAATTTTCCA to GTTAATTTCCA (pCD40L.3′FL.mut1) or to GTTAATTTAAC (pCD40L.3′FL.mut2). All mutated constructs were sequenced on both strands to verify these mutations and to confirm that no other alterations were introduced. Ten μg of firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmid DNA in complete RPMI medium was used for transient transfection by electroporation. The conditions used for the electroporation of primary CD4 T cells have been described (22Schubert L.A. King G. Cron R.Q. Lewis D.B. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Biol.

Jurkat cells (1.0 × 107cells/condition) were transiently transfected by electroporation at 260 V and 960 microfarads using a Genepulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). Electroporation conditions for 8.1.6 Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cells (2.5 × 107 cells/condition) were 210 V and 960 microfarads, and for U937 human monocyte-like cells (2.5 × 107 cells/condition), conditions were 250 V and 960 microfarads. Following electroporation, cells were incubated for 20–24 h at 37 °C, harvested, and plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 viable cells/well, in 96-well U bottom microtiter plates (Corning Glass). Cells were left untreated or stimulated with ionomycin (1.5 μm; Calbiochem) plus PMA (25 ng/ml; Sigma) or with the combination of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against CD3-ε (mAb 64.1 (38Williams J.M.

Cells were harvested and analyzed for firefly luciferase activity as previously described (28Cron R.Q. Bort S.J. Wang Y. Brunvand M.W. Lewis D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 860-870PubMed Google Scholar). For Jurkat cell lysates, a Monolight 1500 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI) was used. Primary human CD4 T cells have a relatively low transfection efficiency following electroporation (40Cron R.Q. Schubert L.A. Lewis D.B. Hughes C.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), so a more sensitive luminometer, Berthold model LB9507, was used. For the data presented, at least one experiment was carried out in which either 0.1 μg of pβ-actin-RL was included with transfections of Jurkat thymoma cells or 0.5 μg of pRL-null was included with transfections of primary human CD4 T cells. Cell lysates isolated from these cells were assayed sequentially for firefly andRenilla luciferase activity using the reagents of the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). Renilla activity between samples varied less than 10% in these experiments. Therefore, the data for firefly luciferase activity are presented without correction for transfection efficiency. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as previously described (29Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) from CD4 T cells activated by incubation for 2 h with CD3 and CD28 mAb, and their protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a commercial kit (Pierce). For EMSAs, SDS-PAGE-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides (purchased from Invitrogen) were used as either 32P-labeled probes or as unlabeled competitors. For each oligonucleotide, only the coding strand sequence is shown, with the NF-κB binding sites underlined and mutated residues indicated in boldface type (see Table I). The CD40L 3′-flanking NF-κB oligonucleotide, 5′-TGGAGGGAATTTTCCCAACC-3′ (+941 to +960 bp of the 1284-bp 3′-flanking segment (Fig. 1 A)), was radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed. Competitors consisted of either the wild type CD40L 3′-flanking NF-κB oligonucleotide and derivatives containing either a single dinucleotide substitution mutation, 5′-TGGAGTTAATTTTCCCAACC-3′ (single mutant), or two dinucleotide mutations, 5′-TGGAGTTAATTTTAA CAACC-3′ (double mutant), or a 5′-flanking CD40L gene oligonucleotide containing a putative NF-κB element, 5′-GGTAGGGATTTCCACAGCTG-3′ (bp −1203 to −1187 bp with respect to the transcription start site (22Schubert L.A.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), using 1 μg of nuclear protein and 1.0 × 104 cpm of probe per reaction. Where indicated, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were preincubated with nuclear protein prior to the addition of probe. In some experiments, nuclear protein was preincubated with 1.0 μl of supershifting antisera specific for individual NF-κB/Rel family proteins or with a commercial supershifting mAb reactive with NFATc2 (NFAT1, NFATp) (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). The panel of NF-κB/Rel-specific antisera (generously provided by Dr. N. R.

https://openalex.org/W1965622670,"Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP) is a cytosolic protein of unknown function that catalyzes intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholines in vitro. Using stably transfected CHO cells, we explored the influence of PC-TP on apolipoprotein A-I- and high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3)-mediated lipid efflux. In proportion to its cellular level of expression, PC-TP accelerated apolipoprotein A-I-mediated phospholipid and cholesterol efflux as pre-β-HDL particles. PC-TP increased rates of efflux of both lipids by >2-fold but did not affect mRNA levels or the activity of ATP-binding cassette A1, a plasma membrane protein that regulates apolipoprotein A-I-mediated lipid efflux. Overexpression of PC-TP was associated with only slight increases in HDL3-mediated phospholipid efflux and no changes in cholesterol efflux. In scavenger receptor BI-overexpressing cells, PC-TP expression minimally influenced apolipoprotein A-I- or HDL3-mediated lipid efflux. PC-TP did not affect cellular phospholipid compositions, phosphatidylcholine contents, or phosphatidylcholine synthetic rates. These findings suggest that a physiological function of PC-TP is to replenish the plasma membrane with phosphatidylcholines that are removed during pre-β-HDL particle formation due to the activity of ATP-binding cassette A1."

In the case of the extracellular matrix (ECM),1it appears that depriving cells of anchorage and/or appropriate survival signals by disrupting the signals mediated by ECM-integrin interactions induces a pathway of apoptosis for which some signaling components have been identified (1Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This pathway seems to be initiated with the loss of phosphorylation of the integrin-associated signaling molecule focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) (1Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 2Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 124: 1383-1390Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The downstream signals to which pp125FAK has been linked include the caspase family of cell death proteases. Caspases, which are considered the executioners of cell death in apoptosis, are thought to orchestrate cell disintegration through a cascade of caspase activation. This family of aspartate proteases seems to be involved in apoptotic pathways regulated by the ECM, because caspase inhibitors prevent apoptosis triggered by an altered matrix, loss of the ECM, or disruption of pp125FAK function (2Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J.

Furthermore, caspase 3 has recently been shown to cleave pp125FAK as part of the mechanism that leads to apoptosis (5Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 6Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Other signals implicated in apoptosis triggered by an altered matrix or disruption of ECM-integrin signaling pathways include the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene c-myc, which are known mediators of apoptosis in other pathways (7Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). In general, activation of p53 and c-Myc corresponds to the apoptotic phenotype, and conversely, inactivation of p53 and c-Myc corresponds to cell survival. In the case of apoptosis regulated by the ECM, p53 may either play a direct role (3Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 124: 1383-1390Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar) or only modulate the kinetics of this pathway (8McGill G. Shimamura A. Bates R.C. Savage R.E. Fisher D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). c-Myc, which in some apoptotic pathways modulates p53 function, is involved in apoptosis triggered by disruption of integrin signals, because during c-Myc-induced apoptosis there is targeted proteolysis of pp125FAK, which can be suppressed by integrin signaling (9Crouch D.H. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2689-2696PubMed Google Scholar). The protein encoded by the p53 response gene, the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p21 (10Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22673-22676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), has also been implicated in integrin-ECM-mediated apoptosis. However, we now document an interesting and new alternative pathway of apoptosis that is regulated by the alternatively spliced V region and the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin (FN) and leads to transcriptionally dependent decreases in p53 and c-Myc in primary, nontransformed cells. Furthermore, the decreases in p53 and c-Myc are in part driving this mechanism, because transfection with eitherp53 or c-myc rescues the apoptotic phenotype, and p53-deficient and c-myc antisense conditions trigger a faster rate of apoptosis. Primary cultures of human fibroblasts were obtained, cultured, and tested for apoptosis as previously described (11Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30906-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). P53-deficient and wild-type mouse fibroblasts were provided by Dr. Caroline Damsky (1Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and maintained in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone) prior to experimentation. Four recombinant FN protein fragments were tested in these experiments. These fragments, described elsewhere (2Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), either included (V+) or excluded (V−) the alternatively spliced V region and contained either an unmutated (H+) or a mutated, nonfunctional, high-affinity, heparin-binding domain (H−). For Western blot analysis, cells were incubated with the V+H− fragment, the V+H+ fragment, or control serum-free medium as indicated for each figure. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared using 100 μl/well TNE buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm sodium chloride in Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mmEDTA) containing various protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm sodium molybdate, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were adjusted for protein concentration using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and then analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose by standard methods. Blots were then probed with primary antibodies and developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence-Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Primary antibodies included mouse anti-human c-Myc (Ab-1, OP10) and mouse anti-human p53 (Ab-1, OP03), both from Oncogene Research; mouse anti-human p21 (F-5, SC-6246) and mouse anti-human c-Myc (C33, SC42), both from Santa Cruz, Biotechnology; and mouse anti-human Bcl2 (clone 124, M0887) from DAKO. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to the c-mycproto-oncogene was used to inhibit c-Myc protein expression in primary cells prior to treatment with the V+H− protein. Antisense (5′-CACGTTGAGGGGCAT-3′) and non-sense (5′-AGTGGCGGAGACTCT-3′) c-myc oligonucleotides (12Yufang S. Glynn J.M. Guilbert L.J. Cotter T.G. Bissonnette R.P. Green D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) were synthesized, purified, and analyzed by the University of California San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center. Cells were transfected for 24 and 48 h with Oligofectin reagent (Invitrogen) and 2 μmoligonucleotides, then treated for various times with the V+H− protein as indicated in the figure legends. For c-Myc and p53 Northern blot analysis, cells were incubated with the V+H− protein, control V+H+ protein, or control medium for various time intervals. After incubation, total RNA was isolated from cells using the QIAshredder and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA was then separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes by capillary blotting. The quality of the RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining before and after transfer. RNA was fixed to the membrane by exposure to UV light for 2 min. Membranes were prehybridized in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) at 68 °C for 20 min. They were then hybridized at 68 °C for 1–1.5 h in the same solution containing 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and denatured radiolabeled cDNA probes for human c-myc (a 2.5-kbEcoRI/HindIII fragment) (13Favera R.D.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3257-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). cDNA probes were radiolabeled using a random primer kit (Promega) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and separated from free nucleotide using NuctrapTM push columns (Stratagene). Specific radioactivities of the individual probes were ∼109 cpm/mg. Hybridized filters were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and then in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min and finally exposed to radiographic film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 1–2 days. To normalize the blots for differences in RNA loading and/or transfer to the membranes, the blots were stripped and rehybridized with a 1.3-kb glutaraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe (15Fort P.

To normalize for different transfection efficiencies, a plasmid containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the actin promoter was cotransfected into the cells. After electroporation, cells were treated with the recombinant FN proteins V+H− and V+H+ or with control medium for different times. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100). CAT assays were performed as described previously (16Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-446Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA) using a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, model 2010). CAT activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity and compared for all treatments from triplicate experiments. Cells that were 60–80% confluent in 96-well tissue culture plates were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of DNA (as indicated in each figure legend) in 50 μl of serum-free medium or with vector control, using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency in these primary cells is ∼30–35% as measured using a green fluorescent protein vector (pEGFP, CLONTECH). Transfected cells were then rinsed, fresh serum-free medium plus the FN protein (V+H−) was added to the test wells, and apoptosis was assessed. pCMV-jun (as described previously (20Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1988; 12B: 1687-1699Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar)) was used to construct cmv-c-myc, c-jun was removed, and human c-myc (2.5 kb) was inserted withHindIII. The apoptotic population was assessed in primary human fibroblasts transfected with c-myc, p53, c-myc antisense, c-myc non-sense, p21, C-p21, or vector control and in p53−/− and wild-type mouse fibroblasts using a flow cytometric assay (21Hamel W. Dazin P. Israel M. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treated and control cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum, 3% enzyme-free phosphate-buffered saline-based cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Cells were kept on ice until 10–15 min before the addition of Hoechst 33342 stain. After equilibration to room temperature, 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 was added to the cell suspension. Detection of Hoechst 33342 staining was done after 6 min using a dual laser Triple Vantage S.E. cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). In primary human fibroblasts (11Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30906-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we initially observed that a recombinant fragment of FN containing the alternatively spliced V region and a mutation in the high-affinity heparin-binding domain (2Kapila Y.L. Niu J. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18932-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) induced apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 1,a–c). This apoptotic pathway is proteoglycan- and caspase-mediated and is associated with changes in pp125FAKphosphorylation (11Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol.

On examining p53 and c-Myc function, we found surprising results, namely that p53 and c-Myc protein (Fig.1 d) and RNA levels (Fig.2 a) were down-regulated as part of this apoptotic mechanism. However, levels of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, remained unchanged under the same conditions (Fig. 1 d), illustrating the specificity of the p53 and c-Myc response. In addition, when cells were treated with the control FN protein V+H+ or control medium, no apoptosis was triggered, and p53 and c-Myc levels remained unchanged (Figs. 1 and2). Time course experiments demonstrated that the drop in c-Myc levels preceded that of p53, because the c-Myc signal began its downward trend at 30 min, whereas the p53 signal started to decline at 45 min (data not shown).Figure 2Correspondence between down-regulation of c-Myc and p53 proteins and RNA levels by the V+H− FN fragment. a, RNA levels for c-Myc and p53 were analyzed by Northern blots at 3 and 7 h using standard methods. Blots were probed with denatured radiolabeled cDNA probes for human c-myc or humanp53. Blots were normalized for differences in RNA loading and/or transfer to the membranes by stripping and rehybridizing with a 1.3-kb GAPDH cDNA probe. Results are expressed as the ratio of the c-Myc or p53 mRNA to the GAPDH mRNA signal. b, CAT reporter assays were used to assess the activity of the p53, c-myc, and control RSV promoters. Representative experiments are presented for both Northern blots and promoter assays. Values represent means and S.D. for three experiments.

After transfection with thep53 or c-myc promoters, promoter activity declined (Fig. 2 b) mirroring the decline in the corresponding protein and RNA species and illustrating the transcriptional down-regulation of p53 and c-Myc in this pathway. However, RSV promoter activity was not down-regulated under the same conditions, further illustrating the specificity of the p53 and c-Myc response. Suspecting that the decrease in p53 and c-Myc was driving the FN fragment-mediated apoptotic pathway, we transfected primary human fibroblasts with p53, c-myc, or vector controls to determine whether ectopic expression of p53 or c-Myc could rescue the apoptotic phenotype. Indeed, transfection with eitherp53 or c-myc, but not the control vector, rescued cells from FN fragment-mediated apoptosis (Fig.3, a–c). Cell shape changes for the c-myc- and p53-transfected cells demonstrated a more well spread phenotype, characteristic of live cells, whereas the vector-transfected cells demonstrated cell membrane blebbing and a rounded phenotype associated with apoptosis (Fig.3 a). The c-myc-transfected cell population showed a 10.8% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 14% upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The p53-transfected cell population showed a 9.5% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 10.8% upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The vector-transfected control cell population showed a 5.1% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 15% upon treatment with the V+H−protein. Thus, the c-myc- and p53-transfected cells showed a 1.3-fold (14/10.8%) and 1.1-fold (10.8/9.5%) increase in apoptosis, respectively, compared with the 2.9-fold (15/5.1%) increase in apoptosis in the vector- transfected cells (Fig.3 b). This is approximately a 2.5-fold difference. Although, the rescue from apoptosis was not complete with c-myc andp53 transfection (and with other treatments; Fig.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6), this likely represents an incompletely transfected cell population; transfection efficiency is ∼30–35% in these primary cells (data not shown). The fold changes in apoptosis following transfection with c-myc, p53, and vector control were computed for an average of 3 experiments and graphically illustrated (Fig. 3 c). Confirmatory Western immunoblots indicate the higher expression levels for p53 and c-Myc achieved in the respective transfected cells (Fig. 3 d). The relatively unchanged levels of p53 protein in the c-myc-transfected cells suggest that c-Myc may not be directly upstream of p53 or in its direct regulatory pathway. To determine whether it is the down-regulation of the p53 signal that is required to mediate this mechanism, p53-deficient mouse fibroblasts (p53−/−) and wild-type (p53+/+) controls were treated with the apoptosis-inducing FN fragment and examined for their rate of apoptosis. The p53-deficient cells underwent a faster rate of apoptosis than their p53+/+ counterpart controls (Fig. 4,a, c, and d). Cell shape changes for the primary mouse fibroblasts demonstrated a more well spread phenotype, characteristic of live cells, whereas the p53−/−fibroblasts demonstrated cell membrane blebbing and a rounded phenotype, associated with apoptosis (Fig. 4 a). The wild-type fibroblasts showed a 3.3% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 5% at 1.5 h and 5.8% at 3 h upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The p53−/− fibroblasts showed a 3.6% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 12% at 1.5 h and 14.2% at 3 h upon treatment with the V+H−, a 3.3- and 3.9-fold increase in apoptosis at 1.5 h and 3 h, respectively, compared with the 1.5- and 1.8-fold increase in apoptosis in the wild-type fibroblasts at the same respective time points (Fig.4 c). This is approximately a 2-fold difference. The fold changes in apoptosis for the p53−/− and wild-type fibroblasts were computed for an average of three experiments and illustrated graphically (Fig. 4 d). Western immunoblots confirmed the absence of p53 in the p53−/− cells and the decrease in p53 and c-Myc proteins in the normal mouse fibroblasts after treatment with the V+H− fragment (Fig.4 b). In p53−/− cells, c-Myc protein levels did not change appreciably or were only slightly decreased in response to the V+H− treatment, suggesting that although c-Myc may not be in a direct regulatory pathway with p53, it may be influenced by p53 status in this apoptotic mechanism. The requirement for down-regulation of c-Myc in this apoptotic pathway was also investigated by using antisense strategies. In this case, c-myc antisense-treated human fibroblasts underwent a more rapid rate of apoptosis than control non-sense oligonucleotide-treated or control-transfected cells upon addition of the V+H− fragment (Fig.5, a, c, and d), further confirming that it is in part the depressed levels of c-Myc that mediate this mechanism. Cell shape changes for the non-sense-treated cells demonstrated a more well spread phenotype, characteristic of live cells, whereas the c-mycantisense-treated cells demonstrated cell membrane blebbing and a rounded phenotype (Fig. 5 a). The antisense-treated cells showed a 1.4% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 3.9% at 1 h and 7.9% at 3 h upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The non-sense-treated cells showed a 2% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 2.8% at 1 h and 5.9% at 3 h upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The control-transfected cells showed a 3.3% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 5.4% at 1 h and 8% at 3 h upon treatment with the V+H− protein. Thus, the antisense-treated cells showed a 2.8- and 5.6-fold increase in apoptosis at 1 and 3 h, respectively, compared with the 1.4- and 2.95-fold increase in apoptosis in the non-sense-treated cells at the same respective time points. Similarly, the transfected controls showed a 1.6- and 2.4-fold increase in apoptosis. Therefore, both of the controls showed an ∼2-fold lower level of apoptosis than the antisense-treated cells (Fig. 5 c). The fold changes in apoptosis for antisense-, non-sense-, and control-transfected cells were computed for an average of three experiments and illustrated graphically (Fig. 5 d). Fig. 5 b illustrates the effect of the oligonucleotides on c-Myc expression. Taken together, these data suggest that down-regulation of either p53 or c-Myc may be sufficient for induction of apoptosis by the FN fragment because loss of either p53 or c-Myc function was sufficient to induce a faster rate of apoptosis. Consistent with the changes in p53, levels of a downstream signal, cyclin-dependent kinase p21, were depressed in tandem (Fig. 1 d). Ectopic expression of full-length p21, but not its C-terminal form (C-p21) (22Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), rescued the apoptotic phenotype induced by the V+H− fragment (Fig.6, a–c). Thep21-transfected cells demonstrated the more well spread phenotype characteristic of live cells, whereas the C-p21-transfected and untransfected control cells demonstrated a rounded and cell membrane blebbing phenotype (Fig.6 a). The p21-transfected cell population showed a 2.4% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 4.8% upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The C-p21-transfected cell population showed a 2.2% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 9.7% upon treatment with the V+H− protein. The untransfected cell population showed a 2.7% base-line level of apoptosis, which increased to 11.3% upon treatment with the V+H−protein. Thus, the p21-transfected cells showed only a 2-fold increase in apoptosis, compared with the 4.2- and 4.4-fold increase in the untransfected control and C-p21-transfected cells, respectively. Therefore, the p21-transfected cells showed approximately a 2-fold lower level of apoptosis than the controls (Fig. 6 b). The fold changes in apoptosis forp21- and C-p21-transfected cells, and untransfected cells were computed for an average of three experiments and illustrated graphically (Fig. 6 c). Western immunoblot results confirmed the increased expression levels of p21 in thep21-transfected cells and the more gradual decline of p21 protein in these same cells upon treatment with the FN fragment (Fig.6 d). The decline in p21 was not surprising given that p53 acts as a transcriptional activator of p21. In addition, p53 protein levels remained unchanged after p21 transfection, again suggesting that p53 lies upstream of p21 in this pathway. Although a great deal is known about how the p53 protein interacts with other proteins to control transcription, little is known about the factors that control p53 transcription itself. However, our data shed light on how p53 transcription can be regulated by ECM-generated signals and specifically by the heparin-binding domain and alternatively spliced V region of FN. Our combined data suggest an alternative regulatory pathway for p53, c-Myc, and p21 as part of an apoptotic pathway initiated by the interactions of an altered ECM ligand with cell surface receptors. Proteoglycan and integrin receptors (11Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Johnson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30906-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) 2Y. Kapila, S. Wang, and P. Dazin, manuscript in preparation. then trigger an apoptotic signaling pathway that leads to decreases in pp125FAK phosphorylation, activation of a caspase cascade, and depression of downstream signals that include c-Myc, p53, and p21. Others (23Wu M. Arsura M. Bellas B. Fitzgerald M.J. Lee H. Schauer S.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have reported that a drop in c-Myc levels leads to apoptosis of B lymphoma cells. We report on a unique mechanism of regulation of c-Myc, p53, and p21 in human primary cells by specific domains of FN in the context of apoptosis. The impact of the present findings, when viewed in the context of our other in vivo, in vitro, and clinical data, affords a greater level of significance. In other ongoing studies in our laboratory, we have focused on a 40-kDa proteolytic FN fragment (Invitrogen) that is comparable with the V+H−recombinant FN protein examined here because it contains the heparin-binding domain and part of the V region (CS-1 site). Thus, at least one of the two FN regions, the heparin-binding domain or V region, is compromised in these two fragments. To further explain, the similarities in the 40-kDa fragment and the V+H− protein lie in the fact that they are both missing some part of either the heparin-binding domain or the V region of FN. The importance of this fact relates to our findings suggesting that at least two receptors, the α4β1 integrin and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, are involved in regulating apoptosis by interacting with these two FN domains. Our hypothesis is that if one of these domains is partially missing or nonfunctional, then these two receptors can no longer engage these domains normally and necessary survival cues are no longer initiated; this, in turn, activates a cell death pathway or apoptosis. Furthermore, we have discovered that this 40-kDa fragment not only is found in vivo and associated with inflammation 3Q. Huynh, S. Wang, E. Tafolla, S. Gansky, S, Kapila, G.C. Armitage, and Y. L. Kapila, manuscript submitted for publication. but also triggers apoptosis in these same human primary fibroblasts, specifically and dose-dependently. Furthermore, this 40-kDa FN fragment, identified in inflammatory fluids from periodontally diseased sites, was found to be highly associated with the disease status of the sites. Prevotella intermedia, a known periodontal pathogen, produces a chymotrypsin-like proteinase that can cleave FN (24Homer K.A. Manji F. Beighton D. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1992; 19: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and thus generate this same chymotryptic 40-kDa fragment. Thus, one possibility is that FN fragments signal cells that their ECM has undergone dissolution secondary to inflammation. These signals may lead to apoptosis of the cellular components of inflamed tissues and thus contribute to the overall degradation of tissues under these conditions. Indeed, other studies have confirmed the presence of higher levels of FN fragmentation in the more advanced stages of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and periodontal disease (25Carsons S. Lavietes B.B. Diamond H.S. Kinney S.G. Arthritis Rheum. 1985; 28: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Clemmensen I. Andersen R.B.

Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1448-1452PubMed Google Scholar), and some of these FN fragments can themselves produce tissue destruction in vitro (31Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (32Homandberg G.A. Meyer R. Williams J.M. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 1378-1382PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that p53 may be important in the regulation of inflammatory pathways (33Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and not just in apoptotic, survival, and cell cycle pathways. Future studies will be needed to decipher the potential intersection of ECM/integrin/proteoglycan/pp125FAK signals with p53/c-Myc/p21 signals and to directly demonstrate the role of these FN fragments as proapoptotic molecules within in vivo model systems.
