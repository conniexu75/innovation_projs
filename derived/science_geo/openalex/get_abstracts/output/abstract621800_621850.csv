Here, we show that template-free Cas9 editing is predictable and capable of precise repair to a predicted genotype, enabling correction of disease-associated mutations in humans. We constructed a library of 2,000 Cas9 guide RNAs paired with DNA target sites and trained inDelphi, a machine learning model that predicts genotypes and frequencies of 1- to 60-base-pair deletions and 1-base-pair insertions with high accuracy (r = 0.87) in five human and mouse cell lines. inDelphi predicts that 5–11% of Cas9 guide RNAs targeting the human genome are ‘precise-50’, yielding a single genotype comprising greater than or equal to 50% of all major editing products. We experimentally confirmed precise-50 insertions and deletions in 195 human disease-relevant alleles, including correction in primary patient-derived fibroblasts of pathogenic alleles to wild-type genotype for Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome and Menkes disease. This study establishes an approach for precise, template-free genome editing. The authors use a machine-learning algorithm to predict the spectrum of CRISPR–Cas9-nuclease-mediated DNA repair outcomes at human genomic target sites."
https://openalex.org/W2899973458,"Inspired by the period-four oscillation in flash-induced oxygen evolution of photosystem II discovered by Joliot in 1969, Kok performed additional experiments and proposed a five-state kinetic model for photosynthetic oxygen evolution, known as Kok’s S-state clock or cycle1,2. The model comprises four (meta)stable intermediates (S0, S1, S2 and S3) and one transient S4 state, which precedes dioxygen formation occurring in a concerted reaction from two water-derived oxygens bound at an oxo-bridged tetra manganese calcium (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex3–7. This reaction is coupled to the two-step reduction and protonation of the mobile plastoquinone QB at the acceptor side of PSII. Here, using serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and simultaneous X-ray emission spectroscopy with multi-flash visible laser excitation at room temperature, we visualize all (meta)stable states of Kok’s cycle as high-resolution structures (2.04–2.08 Å). In addition, we report structures of two transient states at 150 and 400 µs, revealing notable structural changes including the binding of one additional ‘water’, Ox, during the S2→S3 state transition. Our results suggest that one water ligand to calcium (W3) is directly involved in substrate delivery. The binding of the additional oxygen Ox in the S3 state between Ca and Mn1 supports O–O bond formation mechanisms involving O5 as one substrate, where Ox is either the other substrate oxygen or is perfectly positioned to refill the O5 position during O2 release. Thus, our results exclude peroxo-bond formation in the S3 state, and the nucleophilic attack of W3 onto W2 is unlikely. Crystallography and spectroscopy are used to solve high-resolution structures of the intermediates of Kok’s S-state clock in photosystem II."
https://openalex.org/W2900171085,"Genetic regulators and environmental stimuli modulate T cell activation in autoimmunity and cancer. The enzyme co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is involved in the production of monoamine neurotransmitters, the generation of nitric oxide, and pain1,2. Here we uncover a link between these processes, identifying a fundamental role for BH4 in T cell biology. We find that genetic inactivation of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of BH4) and inhibition of sepiapterin reductase (the terminal enzyme in the synthetic pathway for BH4) severely impair the proliferation of mature mouse and human T cells. BH4 production in activated T cells is linked to alterations in iron metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In vivo blockade of BH4 synthesis abrogates T-cell-mediated autoimmunity and allergic inflammation, and enhancing BH4 levels through GCH1 overexpression augments responses by CD4- and CD8-expressing T cells, increasing their antitumour activity in vivo. Administration of BH4 to mice markedly reduces tumour growth and expands the population of intratumoral effector T cells. Kynurenine—a tryptophan metabolite that blocks antitumour immunity—inhibits T cell proliferation in a manner that can be rescued by BH4. Finally, we report the development of a potent SPR antagonist for possible clinical use. Our data uncover GCH1, SPR and their downstream metabolite BH4 as critical regulators of T cell biology that can be readily manipulated to either block autoimmunity or enhance anticancer immunity. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an enzyme co-factor that is involved in the nervous system; it is shown here to also function in T cell activation and proliferation, with roles in autoimmunity, allergic inflammation and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2900440811,"Dopamine modulates medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity to mediate diverse behavioural functions1,2; however, the precise circuit computations remain unknown. One potentially unifying model by which dopamine may underlie a diversity of functions is by modulating the signal-to-noise ratio in subpopulations of mPFC neurons3–6, where neural activity conveying sensory information (signal) is amplified relative to spontaneous firing (noise). Here we demonstrate that dopamine increases the signal-to-noise ratio of responses to aversive stimuli in mPFC neurons projecting to the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG). Using an electrochemical approach, we reveal the precise time course of pinch-evoked dopamine release in the mPFC, and show that mPFC dopamine biases behavioural responses to aversive stimuli. Activation of mPFC–dPAG neurons is sufficient to drive place avoidance and defensive behaviours. mPFC–dPAG neurons display robust shock-induced excitations, as visualized by single-cell, projection-defined microendoscopic calcium imaging. Finally, photostimulation of dopamine terminals in the mPFC reveals an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio in mPFC–dPAG responses to aversive stimuli. Together, these data highlight how dopamine in the mPFC can selectively route sensory information to specific downstream circuits, representing a potential circuit mechanism for valence processing. Dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex modulates behavioural responses to aversive stimuli by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of neurons projecting to the dorsal periaqueductal grey."
https://openalex.org/W2899927300,"Background The anti-programmed death receptor-1 (anti–PD-1) pembrolizumab is approved as first-line monotherapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) with PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor expression ≥50%. Most studies comparing PD-L1 results by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay type have been conducted by prespecified and, in most cases, highly experienced, trained pathologists; however, knowledge is limited regarding the current use and concordance of PD-L1 assays in the real-world clinical setting. Our aim was to study the distribution of PD-L1 tumor expression by IHC assay type among patients with mNSCLC in US oncology practices. Methods This retrospective observational study utilized de-identified, longitudinal data from a large US electronic medical record database. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with histologically/cytologically confirmed initial diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent NSCLC from October 2015 through December 2017. We determined PD-L1 testing trends and distribution of PD-L1 tumor expression (percentage of tumor cells staining for PD-L1) by IHC assay type. Results The 12,574 eligible patients (mean age, 69 years) included 6,620 (53%) men and 86% with positive smoking history. Of 4,868 evaluable tests, 3,799 (78%), 195 (4%), 165 (3%), and 709 (15%) used the Agilent 22C3 pharmDx, Agilent 28–8 pharmDx, Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) Assay, and laboratory-developed tests (LDTs, including SP263), respectively. The percentages of tests scoring PD-L1 tumor expression of ≥50% were 33%, 32%, 10%, and 23%, respectively. Measured PD-L1 tumor expression varied across the four assay types (χ2 p < 0.001) and across three assay types excluding SP142 (p < 0.001), with no significant difference between 22C3 and 28–8 assays (p = 0.96). The PD-L1 testing rate increased from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 71% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Conclusions In the real-world clinical setting, we observed that measured PD-L1 tumor expression is concordant using the 22C3 and 28–8 assays; however, the SP142 assay and LDTs appear discordant and could underestimate high PD-L1 positivity. Further study is needed to evaluate the association between PD-L1 tumor expression and response to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2952714160,"Despite their wide-spread use, only limited information is available on the comparative test-retest reliability of task-based functional and resting state magnetic resonance imaging measures of blood oxygen level dependence (tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling. This information is critical to designing properly powered longitudinal studies. Here we comprehensively quantified and compared the test-retest reliability and reproducibility performance of 8 commonly applied fMRI tasks, 6 rs-fMRI metrics and CBF in 30 healthy volunteers. We find large variability in test-retest reliability performance across the different tb-fMRI paradigms and rs-fMRI metrics, ranging from poor to excellent. A larger extent of activation in tb-fMRI is linked to higher between-subject reliability of the respective task suggesting that differences in the amount of activation may be used as a first reliability estimate of novel tb-fMRI paradigms. For rs-fMRI, a good reliability of local activity estimates is paralleled by poor performance of global connectivity metrics. Evaluated CBF measures provide in general a good to excellent test-reliability matching or surpassing the best performing tb-fMRI and rs-fMRI metrics. This comprehensive effort allows for direct comparisons of test-retest reliability between the evaluated MRI domains and measures to aid the design of future tb-fMRI, rs-fMRI and CBF studies."

https://openalex.org/W2900243945,"Objectives To evaluate the effect of a 20-week school-based physical activity intervention program on academic performance and selective attention among disadvantaged South African primary school children. Design Cluster randomized control trial. Methods The study cohort included 663 children from eight primary schools, aged 8–13 years. Data assessment took place between February 2015 and May 2016 following the implementation of a 20-week school-based physical activity program. The d2 test was employed to assess selective attention, while the averaged end-of-year school results (math, life skills, home language, and additional language) were used as an indicator of academic performance. Physical fitness was assessed using the 20-m shuttle run test (VO2 max) and grip strength tests. We controlled for cluster effects, baseline scores in selective attention or academic performance, and potential confounders, such as children’s age, gender, socioeconomic status, self-reported physical activity (as determined by a pre-tested questionnaire), body mass index, hemoglobin (as a proxy for anemia, as measured by blood sampling), and soil-transmitted helminth infections (as assessed by the Kato-Katz technique). Results Our multivariate analysis suggested that the physical activity intervention had a positive effect on academic performance (p = 0.032), while no effect was found on selective attention (concentration performance; p = 0.469; error percentage; p = 0.237). After controlling for potential confounders, the physical activity condition contributed to the maintenance of academic performance, whereas a decrease was observed in learners in the control condition. Furthermore, physically active and fit children tend to have better concentration performance (CP) than their less fit peers (self-reported activity; p<0.016, grip strength; p<0.009, VO2 max p>0.021). Conclusion A 20-week physical activity intervention contributes to the maintenance of academic performance among socioeconomically deprived school children in South Africa. School administrators should ensure that their school staff implements physical activity lessons, which are a compulsory component of the school by the curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W2900318781,"Background HIV self-testing (HIVST) may increase HIV testing uptake, facilitating earlier treatment for key populations like MSM who experience barriers accessing clinic-based HIV testing. HIVST usability among African MSM has not been explored. Methods We assessed usability of oral fluid (OF) and fingerstick (FS; blood) HIVST kits during three phases among MSM with differing degrees of HIVST familiarity in Mpumalanga, South Africa. In 2015, 24 HIVST-naïve MSM conducted counselor-observed OF and FS HIVST after brief demonstration. In 2016 and 2017, 45 and 64 MSM with experience using HIVST in a pilot study chose one HIVST to conduct with a counselor-observer present. In addition to written, the latter group had access to video instructions. We assessed frequency of user errors and reported test use ease, changes in error frequency by phase, and covariates associated with correct usage using log-Poisson and Gaussian generalized estimating equations. Results Among OF users (n = 57), 15–30% committed errors in each phase; however, observers consistently rated participants as able to test alone. Among FS users (n = 100), observers noted frequent errors, most commonly related to blood collection and delivery. We found suggestive evidence (not reaching statistical significance) that user errors decreased, with 37.5%, to 28.1%, and 18.2% committing errors in phases I, II, and III, respectively (p-value:0.08), however observer concerns remained constant. Ease and confidence using HIVST increased with HIV testing experience. Participants using three HIVST were more likely (RR:1.92, 95% CI:1.32, 2.80) to report ease compared to those without prior HIVST experience. Never testers (RR:0.66, 95% CI:0.44–0.99) reported less ease performing HIVST compared to participants testing in the past six months. Conclusions MSM were able to perform the OF test. Fingerstick test performance was less consistent; however preference for fingerstick was strong and performance may improve with exposure and instructional resources. Continued efforts to provide accessible instructions are paramount."
https://openalex.org/W2899819879,"The aim of the present study is to analyze the viability of anti-EGFR anchored immunonanoparticle (INP) bearing Paclitaxel (PTX) to specifically bind the EGFR protein on the TNBC cells. The NP was prepared by nanoprecipitation and characterized the particle size, charge, entrapment of drug and release of it. The anti-EGFR anchored and the integrity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Cytotoxicity and NPs cellular uptake was analyzed with MDA-MB-468 type cancer cells and the EGFR expression was confirmed by PCR, qualitatively and quantitatively. The in-vivo antitumor activity of INP was determined by using athymic mice model and targeting efficiency was measured by calculating the PTX accumulation in the tumor plasma. The prepared INP with the size of 336.3 nm and the charge of -3.48 mV showed sustained drug release upto 48 h. The INP showed significant reduction of cancer cell viability of 10.6% for 48 h with 93 fold higher PTX accumulation in the tumor plasma compared with NPs. Based on these reports, we recommend that anti-EGFR anchored PTX loaded NP may have the ability to target the TNBC cells and improve the therapeutic action and subsidize the side effects of PTX for the treatment of TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2899950455,"Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), a key member of the TGF-β superfamily, plays critical roles in various medical conditions. Recently, GDF11 was found to suppress the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway and protect against inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the role of GDF11 in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We demonstrated that GDF11 treatment antagonized TNF-α-induced inflammation in macrophages. Moreover, GDF11 inhibited the development of arthritis in the collagen-induced arthritis and collagen antibody-induced arthritis models. Local gene transfer of GDF11 via adeno-associated virus exerted therapeutic effects, while local knockdown of GDF11 exaggerated inflammation in our collagen-induced arthritis model, as detected by expression levels of inflammatory biomarkers and the destruction of joint structures. Additionally, the results from both in vitro experiments and luciferase reporter gene mouse experiments implied that the NF-κB pathway might play a critical role in the therapeutic effect of GDF11 in RA. This study presents GDF11 as a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis, including RA.-Li, W., Wang, W., Liu, L., Qu, R., Chen, X., Qiu, C., Li, J., Hayball, J., Liu, L., Chen, J., Wang, X., Pan, X., Zhao, Y. GDF11 antagonizes TNF-α-induced inflammation and protects against the development of inflammatory arthritis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2899897185,"Aim Metabolic risk factors are poorly documented for the first generation of young adults who have lived with HIV since childhood. We compared their metabolic profile with that of adults of same age from the general population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from two populations: (1) COVERTE (ANRS-CO19), a French national cohort of 18 to 30-year-old patients HIV-infected since childhood, and (2) ENNS, a national cross-sectional population-based household survey on nutrition. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and HDL-, LDL- and total cholesterol were measured in both studies. Direct standardization on overweight and education level and logistic regression were used to compare the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities between the two populations. Results Data from 268 patients from COVERTE and 245 subjects from ENNS were analyzed. Tobacco use was similar in both groups. HIV-infected patients had increased mean waist-to-hip ratio and triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol ratio and decreased mean HDL-cholesterol as compared to their counterparts from the general population in both genders. In HIV-infected patients, metabolic syndrome was identified in 13.2% of men (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.1–19.2) and 10.4% (95% CI: 5.4–15.3) of women versus 10.6% (95%CI: 1.5–19.7) and 1.7% (95%CI: 0–4.1) in subjects from the general population, respectively. Conclusion Young adults infected with HIV since childhood had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia and metabolically detrimental fat distribution than adults of same age of the general population, supporting close monitoring for cardiometabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2899828419,"We provide an estimate of the effect of refugees' length of waiting time in the Danish asylum system on their subsequent employment using administrative data. In contrast to previous studies, we take into account that refugees' labor market integration is delayed since their labor market access is restricted during the asylum-seeking phase. We find that an additional year of waiting time decreases subsequent employment by 3.2 percentage points on average. This effect is mostly driven by the delay in the labor market engagement among refugees. Waiting time may have an effect on subsequent employment that is additional to the delay effect, and this could be either positive or negative depending on the nature of the conditions under which asylum seekers live while waiting for their cases to be processed. We find that this additional effect is positive and statistically significant until observable individual characteristics are included, at which point it becomes small in magnitude and no longer significant."
https://openalex.org/W2900223118,"Purpose As most of patients with Myasthenia Gravis have limitations in their physical functioning, many experience changes in psychological states and often have depression. The objective of the current study was to examine the roles of communication with medical professionals, patients’ loneliness, and patients’ depression, in relation to their effects on the patients’ quality of life. Methods For 120 patients with MG of 18 years and older, demographic variables, along with communication with medical professionals, loneliness, depression, and quality of life were measured. Results As a result, people suffering from MG experienced lower quality of life when their career has changed due to the illness. At the same time, depression was a significant predictor of their quality of life, both in physical and mental domains. Conclusions The implications for clinical settings and the suggestions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2900005178,"Climate change is expected to impact animals that are heavily reliant on environmental factors, such as sea turtles, since the incubation of their eggs, hatching success and sex ratio are influenced by the environment in which eggs incubate. As climate change progresses it is therefore important to understand how climatic conditions influence their reproductive output and the ramifications to population stability. Here, we examined the influences of five climatic variables (air temperature, accumulated and average precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed) at different temporal scales on hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) hatchling production at ten nesting beaches within two regions of Brazil (five nesting beaches in Rio Grande do Norte and five in Bahia). Air temperature and accumulated precipitation were the main climatic drivers of hawksbill hatching success (number of eggs hatched within a nest) across Brazil and in Rio Grande do Norte, while air temperature and average precipitation were the main climatic drivers of hatching success at Bahia. Solar radiation was the main climatic driver of emergence success (number of hatchlings that emerged from total hatched eggs within a nest) at both regions. Warmer temperatures and higher solar radiation had negative effects on hatchling production, while wetter conditions had a positive effect. Conservative and extreme climate scenarios show air temperatures are projected to increase at this site, while precipitation projections vary between scenarios and regions throughout the 21st century. We predicted hatching success of undisturbed nests (no recorded depredation or storm-related impacts) will decrease in Brazil by 2100 as a result of how this population is influenced by local climate. This study shows the determining effects of different climate variables and their combinations on an important and critically endangered marine species."
https://openalex.org/W2900024009,"The last several decades have witnessed a shift in the way in which news is delivered and consumed by users. With the growth and advancements in mobile technologies, the Internet, and Web 2.0 technologies users are not only consumers of news, but also producers of online content. This has resulted in a novel and highly participatory cyber-physical news awareness ecosystem that fosters digital activism, in which volunteers contribute content to online communities. While studies have examined the various components of this news awareness ecosystem, little is still known about how news media coverage (and in particular digital media) impacts digital activism. In order to address this challenge and develop a greater understanding of it, this paper focuses on a specific form of digital activism, that of the production of digital geographical content through crowdsourcing efforts. Using refugee camps from around the world as a case study, we examine the relationship between news coverage (via Google news), search trends (via Google trends) and user edit contribution patterns in OpenStreetMap, a prominent geospatial data crowdsourcing platform. In addition, we compare and contrast these patterns with user edit patterns in Wikipedia, a well-known non-geospatial crowdsourcing platform. Using Google news and Google trends to derive a measure of thematic public awareness, our findings indicate that digital activism bursts tend to take place during periods of sustained build-up of public awareness deficit or surplus. These findings are in line with two prominent mass communication theories: agenda setting and corrective action, and suggest the emergence of a novel stimulus-awareness-activism framework in today's participatory digital age. Moreover, these findings further complement existing research examining the motivational factors that drive users to contribute to online collaborative communities. This paper brings us one step closer to understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive digital activism in particular in the geospatial domain."
https://openalex.org/W2900083712,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play important roles in tissue regeneration, and multi-lineage differentiation and immunomodulation are two major characteristics of MSCs that are utilized in stem cell therapy. MSCs in vivo have a markedly different three-dimensional (3D) niche compared to the traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture in vitro. A 3D scaffold is predicted to provide an artificial 3D environment similar to the in vivo environment. Significant changes in MSC differentiation are shown to be occurred when under 3D culture. However, the immunomodulatory characteristics of MSCs under 3D culture remain unknown. In this study, 3D culture systems were constructed using different substrates to evaluate the common immunomodulatory characteristics of MSCs. Compared to the MSCs under 2D culture, the MSCs under 3D culture, which had higher stemness and maintained cell phenotype, showed altered immunophenotypic pattern. Gene expression profile analysis at mRNA and protein level detected by gene chip and protein chip, respectively, further revealed the difference between 3D cultured MSCs and 2D cultured MSCs, which was mainly concentrated in the immunoregulation related aspects. Moreover, the immunoregulatory role of 3D culture was confirmed by our immunosuppressive experiments. These findings demonstrated that the immunomodulatory capacities of MSCs were enhanced by the 3D geometry of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2950654818,"Aedes albopictus tends to proliferate in small, often man-made bodies of water, largely present in urban private areas. For this reason, education and community participation are considered crucial for source reduction and mosquito control. In the current study, we identify mosquito breeding habitat and evaluate the effectiveness of resident education. Since 2010 several outbreaks of West Nile virus infection occurred in Greece however urban population has no previous experience with mosquito–borne disease related to Aedes species, such as Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya. After the introduction of Ae. albopictus in Greece, urban areas have been considered to be at risk of epidemic arboviral outbreaks and identifying effective control strategies is imperative. Our study examines the relationship between mosquito breeding sources and socioeconomic or demographic characteristics of different households in a Greek municipality and evaluates efficacy of resident education. The results revealed that only a minority of residents knew where mosquitoes breed (18.6%) and only 46% felt that residents had any responsibility for managing breeding habitat. Our findings strongly suggest that only the presence of scientific staff inspecting possible habitats in their properties, could be enough to stimulate practices towards source reduction. However, educational interventions alone with printed education material cannot enhance significant community participation and source reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2899745379,"Background Preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) are major health problems during pregnancy affecting both mother and child. Defective placental development and failure of trophoblast differentiation during pregnancy are important aspects in the pathogenesis of both syndromes. Recent studies have shown that autophagy is involved in the trophoblast survival capacity. As vitamin D has a central role in many cellular processes, we studied the relation of vitamin D and autophagy in those processes of preeclampsia and IUGR. Methods Serum and placental samples from four groups of cases; normal term, IUGR, early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia, were analyzed for 25(OH)D vitamin D, sFLT1, PGF, LGALS13 in serum and vitamin D receptor (VDR), MAP1LC3B and BECN1 in placental tissues. Results There was a significant difference in the sFLT1/PGF ratio in preeclamptic cases compared to controls and IUGR. There was a significant difference between these groups in the MAP1LC3B/BECN1 ratio as marker of the trophoblast survival capacity with a significantly reduced ratio in villous trophoblast of early-onset preeclampsia. Maternal vitamin D deficiency was found in all pathological pregnancies combined with significantly reduced staining levels of placental VDR in IUGR. Finally, there was a strong and significant negative correlation between the survival capacity (MAP1LC3B/BECN1) and both maternal vitamin D and placental VDR in the preeclampsia groups. Conclusion Vitamin D and intracellular VDR are strongly related to the trophoblast survival capacity in preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2900365052,"The effect of obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities on bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis are well established. However, the association between metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and BMD remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate whether different obesity phenotypes in MHO were associated with BMD in a cross-sectional study.All eligible adults receiving a health examination at the Tri-Service General Hospital from 2010 to 2016 were included. They were categorized based on body mass index (BMI) or percentage body fat (PBF). The associations between BMI or PBF and BMD were analyzed by adjusting for pertinent covariables.Males with normal weight and overweight and females with underweight and normal weight were associated with reduced BMD (β = 0.221, 95%CI = -0.354, -0.088; β = -0.155, 95%CI = -0.286, -0.023) (β = -0.736, 95%CI = -1.043, 0.429; β = -0.340, 95%CI = -0.567, -0.112), respectively. Females in Q1 had close to significant associations with reduced BMD (β = -0.253, 95%CI = -0.465, -0.041). Normal weight, overweight, Q2, and Q3 had stronger prediction of low BMD with ORs of 0.402 (95%CI = 0.204-0.791), 0.539 (95%CI = 0.321-0.905), 0.694 (95%CI = 0.490-0.982), and 0.466 (95%CI = 0.342-0.636), respectively. The relationship remained significant in male population that PBF was associated with reduced BMD with ORs of 0.435 (95%CI = 0.203, 0.935), 0.494 (95%CI = 0.247, 0.991), 0.268 (95%CI = 0.120, 0.597) in Q1, Q2, Q3 respectively.Increased PBF had a significant association with low BMD in the MHO population. Obesity defined by PBF might be a useful indicator for low BMD. The association between body fat and bone health deserves further investigation regarding the potential pathophysiological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2900023005,"A high-quality diet is associated with a reduced of risk of chronic disease and all-cause mortality. In this study, we assessed changes in diet quality and the associated economic burden in the Canadian population between 2004 and 2015. We used a prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach. We first calculated the diet quality using the Healthy Eating Index-Canada-2010 (HEI-C-2010) and 24-hour recall data from the Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) on nutrition (CCHS 2004 cycle 2.2 and the CCHS-NU 2015). We then retrieved relative risks of HEI-2010 quintiles for chronic diseases from meta-analyses. Based on the proportions of the population following diets of varying qualities and these relative risks, we computed the population-attributable fractions and attributable costs (direct health care and indirect costs) by survey year (2004 and 2015) as well as by age and sex group. Costs were estimated in 2017 Canadian dollars for comparison purposes. We observed that on average the diet quality of Canadians improved between 2004 and 2015: the proportion of the Canadian population that did not eat a diet of high quality decreased from 83% to 76%. This improvement in diet quality translated in a decrease in economic burden of $133 million, down from $13.21 billion in 2004 to $13.08 billion in 2015. The economic burden decreased by $219 million among males but increased by $86 million among females. It also decreased among people under the age of 65 years ($333 million) but increased among those over 65 years ($ 200 million). Our findings suggest that, despite some temporal improvements, the diet of the majority of Canadians is of poor quality resulting in a high attributable economic burden. Policy and decision makers are encouraged to expand nutrition programs and policies and to specifically target the elderly in order to prevent chronic diseases and reduce health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W2899530177,"Pneumococcal carriage is the precursor for development of pneumococcal disease, and is also responsible for transmission of the organism from person-to-person. Individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are more likely to develop invasive disease with S. pneumoniae compared to their healthy counterparts and the presentation of disease in the former is usually abrupt and severe. In Africa, little is known about the pneumococcus in relation to people with SCD Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The aim of the study was to investigate the epidemiology of pneumococcal carriage among SCD patients including the carriage prevalence, risk factors, serotypes and antibiotic resistance.This was a cross sectional study involving 402 SCD patients recruited from Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and Princess Marie Louis Hospital in Accra from October 2016 to March 2017. The study subjects included 202 children of the age groups: ≤5 years (94), >5-9 years (75), ≥10-13 years (33) and 200 adults of the age groups: 14-20 years (46), 21-40 years (112), 41-60 years (25), ≤ 61 years (17). Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from the study participants as well as epidemiological data on demographic, household and clinical features. The NP specimens were cultured for S. pneumoniae and the isolates were serotyped by latex agglutination. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the isolates were done by the disc diffusion test and E-test.Prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage among children and adult SCD patients enrolled in the study were 79/202 (39.1%; 95% CI: 32.3 to 46.2) and 20/200 (10.0%; 95% CI: 6.2 to 15.0) respectively. Risk factors associated with pneumococcal carriage were age (OR = 1.137; 95% CI: 1.036-1.248; p = 0.007) and runny nose (OR = 5.371; 95% CI: 1.760-16.390; p = 0.003). Overall, twenty-six pneumococcal serotypes were isolated from the study participants and the predominant serotype was 6B (10.6%), followed by 23B (8.2%). Among the children, serotype coverage of the 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, which is currently used in Ghana was 32.4%. Prevalence of penicillin resistance among the pneumococcal isolates was 37.4% (37/99) and all the penicillin-resistant isolates exhibited intermediate penicillin resistance with the exception of one isolate that showed full resistance and was susceptible to ceftriaxone. Prevalence of resistance to the other antibiotics ranged from 2.5% (levofloxacin) to 85% (cotrimoxazole). Multidrug resistance occurred among 34.3% (34/99) of the pneumococcal isolates.Pneumococcal carriage was four-fold higher in SCD children than adults and was characterized by predominance of non-vaccine serotypes and considerable level of multidrug resistance, though penicillin, cefotaxime and levofloxacin resistance appeared to be very low."
https://openalex.org/W2900199586,"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligately intracellular bacterium that establishes infection in mononuclear phagocytes through largely undefined reprogramming strategies including modulation of host gene transcription. In this study, we demonstrate that the E. chaffeensis effector TRP47 enters the host cell nucleus and binds regulatory regions of host genes relevant to infection. TRP47 was observed in the nucleus of E. chaffeensis-infected host cells, and nuclear localization was dependent on a variant MYND-binding domain. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that TRP47 directly binds host DNA via its tandem repeat domain. Utilizing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) with E. chaffeensis-infected cells, TRP47 was found to bind at multiple sites in the human genome (n = 2,051 at p < 10−30). Ontology analysis identified genes involved in functions such as immune response, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. TRP47-bound genes included RNA-coding genes, many of these linked to cell proliferation or apoptosis. Comparison of TRP47 binding sites with those of previously-identified E. chaffeensis nucleomodulins identified multiple genes and gene functional categories in common including intracellular transport, cell signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Further, motif analysis followed by EMSA with synthetic oligonucleotides containing discovered motifs revealed a conserved TRP47 DNA-binding motif. This study reveals that TRP47 is a nucleomodulin that enters the nucleus via a MYND-binding domain and appears to play a role in host cell reprogramming by regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2900397328,"Purpose Chordae rupture is one of the main lesions observed in traumatic heart events that might lead to severe tricuspid valve (TV) regurgitation. TV regurgitation following chordae rupture is often well tolerated with few or no symptoms for most patients. However, early repair of the TV is of great importance, as it might prevent further exacerbation of the regurgitation due to remodeling responses. To understand how TV regurgitation develops following this acute event, we investigated the changes on TV geometry, mechanics, and function of ex-vivo porcine hearts following chordae rupture. Methods Sonomicrometry techniques were employed in an ex-vivo heart apparatus to identify how the annulus geometry alters throughout the cardiac cycle after chordae rupture, leading to the development of TV regurgitation. Results We observed that the TV annulus significantly dilated (~9% in area) immediately after chordae rupture. The annulus area and circumference ranged from 11.4 ± 2.8 to 13.3 ± 2.9 cm2 and from 12.5 ± 1.5 to 13.5 ± 1.3 cm, respectively, during the cardiac cycle for the intact heart. After chordae rupture, the annulus area and circumference were larger and ranged from 12.3 ± 3.0 to 14.4 ± 2.9 cm2 and from 13.0 ± 1.5 to 14.0 ± 1.2 cm, respectively. Conclusions In our ex-vivo study, we showed for the first time that the TV annulus dilates immediately after chordae rupture. Consequently, secondary TV regurgitation may be developed because of such changes in the annulus geometry. In addition, the TV leaflet and the right ventricle myocardium are subjected to a different mechanical environment, potentially causing further negative remodeling responses and exacerbating the detrimental outcomes of chordae rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2899808531,"SUMOylation is a significant post-translational modification (PTM) by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO). Increasing evidence shows SUMOylation regulates GPCR signaling; however, very few GPCRs have been shown to be SUMOylation targets to date. In this study, we identified M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR), a member of the GPCRs, as a new SUMO substrate. When the mAChR was activated by the agonist carbachol, the colocalization of the M1 mAChR and SUMO-1 protein markedly decreased in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. SUMOylation of the M1 mAChR played an important role in increasing the ligand-binding affinity to M1 mAChR, signaling efficiencies, and receptor endocytosis. Through the site-directed mutagenesis approach, K327 was identified as the SUMOylation site of the M1 mAChR. Mutation of the consensus SUMOylation site of the M1 mAChR reduces not only the colocalization of SUMO-1, but also the ligandbinding affinity and signal transduction. The function of M1 mAChR was regulated by SUMOylation through the stabilization of active-state conformation revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. Our results provide evidence that M1 SUMOylation is an important PTM involved in regulation of the affinity for agonists and for activation of signaling pathways.—Xu, J., Tan, P., Li, H., Cui, Y., Qiu, Y., Wang, H., Zhang, X., Li, J., Zhu, L., Zhou, W., Chen, H.

https://openalex.org/W2899833982,"Agricultural grasslands are often cultivated as mixtures of grasses and legumes, and an extensive body of literature is available regarding interspecific interactions, and how these relate to yield and agronomic performance. However, knowledge of the impact of intraspecific diversity on grassland functioning is scarce. We investigated these effects during a 4-year field trial established with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). We simulated different levels of intraspecific functional diversity by sowing single cultivars or by combining cultivars with contrasting growth habits, in monospecific or bispecific settings (i.e. perennial ryegrass whether or not in combination with red clover). Replicate field plots were established for seven seed compositions. We determined yield parameters and monitored differences in genetic diversity in the ryegrass component among seed compositions, and temporal changes in the genetic composition and genetic diversity at the within plot level. The composition of cultivars of both species affected the yield and species abundance. In general, the presence of clover had a positive effect on the yield. The cultivar composition of the ryegrass component had a significant effect on the yield, both in monoculture, and in combination with clover. For the genetic analyses, we validated empirically that genotyping-by-sequencing of pooled samples (pool-GBS) is a suitable method for accurate measurement of population allele frequencies, and obtained a dataset of 22,324 SNPs with complete data. We present a method to investigate the temporal dynamics of cultivars in seed mixtures grown under field conditions, and show how cultivar abundances vary during subsequent years. We screened the SNP panel for outlier loci, putatively under selection during the cultivation period, but none were detected."

In addition to studying the use of simpler semiological tools, such as Amsler and Ishihara, in the screening of these cases. Methods Thirty patients with ethambutol were recruited from the reference service of tuberculosis treatment at the Federal University of Espírito Santo from May 2015 to July 2016. After clinical history, the following parameters were analyzed; best corrected visual acuity, biomicroscopy, tonometry, photomotor reflex testing, Ishihara test, Amsler’s grid test, color digital retinography and optical coherence tomography with CIRRUS HD-OCT (Humphrey-Zeiss) every 2 months during treatment with ethambutol. They were divided into two groups according to the treatment: (1) standard group, two months of ethambutol; (2) extended group, nine to twelve months of ethambutol. Results There was a significant reduction in OCT thickness between the pre and post treatment times in ten eyes of the extended group, mean reduction of 7,8 microns and in seven eyes of the standard group, with an average of 5.57 microns. During the study, a significant reduction of retinal thickness was observed in both groups at two months of treatment, and the delta percentage was higher in those patients who presented reduction of visual acuity and / or change in the Ishihara test. Conclusion There was a significant reduction in the thickness of the nerve fiber layer by OCT in the patients studied, being more pronounced in those submitted to the extended treatment regimen. This reduction was observed two months after the start of therapy, and was more significant in the cases that presented changes in the Ishihara test."
https://openalex.org/W2899898708,"Does the presence of a robot co-worker influence the performance of humans around it? Studies of motor contagions during human-robot interactions have examined either how the observation of a robot affects a human’s movement velocity, or how it affects the human’s movement variance, but never both together. Performance however, has to be measured considering both task speed (or frequency) as well as task accuracy. Here we examine an empirical repetitive industrial task in which a human participant and a humanoid robot work near each other. We systematically varied the robot behavior, and observed whether and how the performance of a human participant is affected by the presence of the robot. To investigate the effect of physical form, we added conditions where the robot co-worker torso and head were covered, and only the moving arm was visible to the human participants. Finally, we compared these behaviors with a human co-worker, and examined how the observed behavioral affects scale with experience of robots. Our results show that human task frequency, but not task accuracy, is affected by the observation of a humanoid robot co-worker, provided the robot’s head and torso are visible."
https://openalex.org/W2900428670,"The availability of small, lightweight tracking devices enhances our ability to study birds during mobile phases of their lives. Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor, a model species of wild songbird, are well-studied during their breeding season; but our understanding of their biology at other times of the year, when they are not tied to the fixed location of a nest, is more limited. We developed a lightweight radio tag with no battery (solar nanotag) to study the movements of small animals, and we deployed it to explore the behavior of Tree Swallows after the end of their summer breeding season. We tagged 32 breeding adult swallows and 36 juveniles and monitored their presence and absence at the breeding site during the post-fledging period. Although our observations are based on very small sample sizes, the tags revealed previously unknown patterns in Tree Swallow behavior during the post-breeding season. Some Tree Swallow fledglings continued to visit the site repeatedly in the months following the nesting season, with the latest detection occurring on September 30th; by contrast, all adults had permanently departed by the end of July. These results inform future hypotheses about post-breeding movements in Tree Swallows. But, more generally, the detection of tagged swallows on their distant wintering grounds, seven months after tagging, indicates the potential of studying small passerine movements throughout their entire lifetimes, and suggests a rich array of applications for these “Life Tags” to study the movements of small animals world-wide."
https://openalex.org/W2899648010,"In this paper we investigate the changes in the functional connectivity intensity, and some related properties, in healthy people, across the life span and at resting state. For the explicit computation of the functional connectivity we exploit a recently proposed model, that bases not only on the correlations data provided by the acquisition equipment, but also on different parameters, such as the anatomical distances between nodes and their degrees. The leading purpose of the paper is to show that the proposed approach is able to recover the main aspects of resting state condition known from the available literature, as well as to suggest new insights, perspectives and speculations from a neurobiological point of view. Our study involves 133 subjects, both males and females of different ages, with no evidence of neurological diseases or systemic disorders. First, we show how the model applies to the sample, where the subjects are grouped into 28 different groups (14 of males and 14 of females), according to their age. This leads to the construction of two graphs (one for males and one for females), that can be realistically interpreted as representative of the neural network during the resting state. Second, following the idea that the brain network is better understood by focusing on specific nodes having a kind of centrality, we refine the two output graphs by introducing a new metric that favours the selection of nodes having higher degrees. As a third step, we extensively comment and discuss the obtained results. In particular, it is remarkable that, despite a great overlapping exists between the outcomes concerning males and females, some intriguing differences appear. This motivates a deeper local investigation, which represents the fourth part of the paper, carried out through a thorough statistical analysis. As a result, we are enabled to support that, for two special age groups, a few links contribute in differentiating the behaviour of males and females. In addition, we performed an average-based comparison between the proposed model and the traditional statistical correlation-based approach, then discussing and commenting the main outlined discrepancies."
https://openalex.org/W2899964126,"Crop genetic engineering involves transformation in which transgenic plants are regenerated through tissue culture manipulations that can elicit somaclonal variation due to mutations, translocations, and/or epigenetic alterations. Here, we report on alterations in the transcriptome in a panel of transgenic potato plants engineered to be herbicide resistant. Using an inbred diploid potato clone (DMRH S5 28–5), ten single-insert transgenic lines derived from independent Agrobacterium-mediated transformation events were selected for herbicide resistance using an allelic variant of acetolactate synthase (mALS1). Expression abundances of the single-copy mALS1 transgene varied in individual transgenic lines was correlated with the level of phenotypic herbicide resistance, suggesting the importance of transgene expression in transgenic performance. Using RNA-sequencing, differentially expressed genes were identified with the proportion of genes up-regulated significantly higher than down-regulated genes in the panel, suggesting a differential impact of the plant transformation on gene expression activation compared to repression. Not only were transcription factors among the differentially expressed genes but specific transcription factor binding sites were also enriched in promoter regions of differentially expressed genes in transgenic lines, linking transcriptomic variation with specific transcription factor activity. Collectively, these results provide an improved understanding of transcriptomic variability caused by plant transformation."

A significant deletion (131 bp) was detected in all the C genome homoeologues which reconfirmed a major structural divergence between the A and C genomes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the Cp genome is more closely related to the polyploid species than is the Cv genome. Two haplotypes of Pgk1 gene were obtained from most of the AB genome tetraploids. Both types of the barbata group showed a close relationship with the As genome diploid species, supporting the hypothesis that both the A and B genomes are derived from an As genome. Two haplotypes were also detected in A. agadiriana, which showed close relationships with the As genome diploid and the Ac genome diploid, respectively, emphasizing the important role of the Ac genome in the evolution of A. agadiriana. Three homoeologues of the Pgk1 gene were detected in five hexaploid accessions. The homoeologues that might represent the D genome were tightly clustered with the tetraploids A. maroccana and A. murphyi, but did not show a close relationship with any extant diploid species."
https://openalex.org/W2899991956,"Habitat loss, wind energy development, and the disease white-nose syndrome are major threats contributing to declines in bat populations in North America. In the southeastern US in particular, the recent arrival of white-nose syndrome and changes in landscape composition and configuration have driven shifts in bat species populations and distributions. Effective management strategies which address these large-scale, community-level threats require landscape-scale analyses. Our objective was to model the relationship between ecoregional and landscape factors and occupancy by all bat species in South Carolina, USA, during summer. We conducted acoustic surveys from mid-May through July 2015 and 2016 and evaluated temporally dynamic occupancy models for eight bat species or species groups at the 100 km2 level. We found significant effects of landscape factors such as ecoregion and forest edge density for three species, but habitat condition effects were not statistically significant for five other species. Thus, for some species, site-use analyses may be more appropriate than larger scale occupancy analyses. However, our occupancy predictions generally matched statewide historical distributions for all species, suggesting our approach could be useful for monitoring landscape-level trends in bat species. Thus, while our scale of study was likely too coarse for assessing fine-scale habitat associations for all bat species, our findings can improve future monitoring efforts, inform conservation priorities, and guide subsequent landscape-scale studies for bat species and community-level responses to global change."
https://openalex.org/W2949544495,"Schlechtendalia chinensis, a gall-inducing aphid, has two host plants in its life cycle. Its wintering host is a moss (typically Plagiomnium maximoviczii) and its main host is Rhus chinensis (Sumac), on which it forms galls during the summer. This study investigated bacteria associated with S. chinensis living on the two different host plants by sequencing 16S rRNAs. A total of 183 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from 50 genera were identified from aphids living on moss, whereas 182 OTUs from 49 genera were found from aphids living in Sumac galls. The most abundant bacterial genus among identified OTUs from aphids feeding on both hosts was Buchnera. Despite similar numbers of OTUs, the composition of bacterial taxa showed significant differences between aphids living on moss and those living on R. chinensis. Specifically, there were 12 OTUs from 5 genera (family) unique to aphids living on moss, and 11 OTUs from 4 genera (family) unique to aphids feeding in galls on R. chinensis. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) also revealed that bacteria from moss-residing aphids clustered differently from aphids collected from galls. Our results provide a foundation for future analyses on the roles of symbiotic bacteria in plant-aphid interactions in general, and how gall-specific symbionts differ in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W4242062710,"Transport injuries commonly result in significant disease burden, leading to physical disability, mental health deterioration and reduced quality of life. Analyzing the patterns of healthcare service utilization after transport injuries can provide an insight into the health of the affected parties, allow improved health system resource planning, and provide a baseline against which any future system-level interventions can be evaluated. Therefore, this research aims to use time series of service utilization provided by a compensation agency to identify groups of claimants with similar utilization patterns, describe such patterns, and characterize the groups in terms of demographic, accident type and injury type.To achieve this aim, we have proposed an analytical framework that utilizes latent variables to describe the utilization patterns over time and group the claimants into clusters based on their service utilization time series. To perform the clustering without dismissing the temporal dimension of the time series, we have used a well-established statistical approach known as the mixture of hidden Markov models (MHMM). Ensuing the clustering, we have applied multinomial logistic regression to provide a description of the clusters against demographic, injury and accident covariates.We have tested our model with data on psychology service utilization from one of the main compensation agencies for transport accidents in Australia, and found that three clear clusters of service utilization can be evinced from the data. These three clusters correspond to claimants who have tended to use the services 1) only briefly after the accident; 2) for an intermediate period of time and in moderate amounts; and 3) for a sustained period of time, and intensely. The size of these clusters is approximately 67%, 27% and 6% of the number of claimants, respectively. The multinomial logistic regression analysis has showed that claimants who were 30 to 60-year-old at the time of accident, were witnesses, and who suffered a soft tissue injury were more likely to be part of the intermediate cluster than the majority cluster. Conversely, claimants who suffered more severe injuries such as a brain head injury or anon-limb fracture injury and who started their service utilization later were more likely to be part of the sustained cluster.This research has showed that clustering of service utilization time series is an effective approach for identifying the main user groups and utilization patterns of a healthcare service. In addition, using logistic regression to describe the clusters in terms of demographic, injury and accident covariates has helped identify the salient attributes of the claimants in each cluster. This finding is very important for the compensation agency and potentially other authorities as it provides a baseline to improve need understanding, resource planning and service provision."
https://openalex.org/W2899710363,"Conflicting results have been obtained regarding the association between X-ray repair cross complementation group 1 (XRCC1) and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, associations between HCC and three polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) were evaluated using a meta-analysis approach. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang standard database were systematically searched to identify all relevant case-control studies published through March 2018. A total of 32 case-control studies, including 13 that evaluated Arg194Trp, 14 that evaluated Arg280His, and 26 that evaluated Arg399Gln, were analyzed. In the entire study population, XRCC1 Arg399Gln was significantly associated not only with overall risk of HCC (homozygous model, OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.40–1.85, P < 0.05; recessive model, OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.23–1.59, P < 0.05) but also with the risk of HCC in Chinese patients (homozygous model, OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.53–2.08, P < 0.05; recessive model, OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.27–1.70, P < 0.05). Limiting the analysis to studies demonstrating Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the results were consistent and robust. Similarly, a significant association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln and HCC risk was found in healthy controls in the general population but not in hospital controls. Trial sequential analysis (TSA), false-positive report probabilities (FPRP), and combined genotype analysis revealed that XRCC1 Arg399Gln is mainly associated with susceptibility to liver cancer. However, there was no association between Arg194Trp or Arg280His and the risk of HCC. These results, indicating that the Arg399Gln polymorphism of XRCC1 is associated with the risk of HCC in the Chinese population, provide a basis for the development of improved detection and treatment approaches."

Yunnan, China is home to China's only mainland tropical rainforests, and 20% of China's total biodiversity. Despite restoration measures and establishment of new protected areas, this region is still experiencing biodiversity loss due to inadequate management and monitoring. We evaluate restoration success of China's tropical forests in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (XSBN-NNR), Yunnan, China using dung beetles as an indicator taxon. We sampled across a land-use gradient of human alteration: protected forest, restored forest, community owned forest, and rubber plantation. We collected 3,748 dung beetles from 21 species over a 3 month period. Multivariate analyses revealed unique assemblages in each land-use category, but with restored forest most similar to protected areas, suggesting restoration success in this region. Community forests were more diverse than plantations, suggesting that community forests may be a valuable and practical conservation tool in this region. Most species were generalists, although some had dietary and habitat preferences. Furthermore, dietary niche breadths were, on average, higher in disturbed areas, suggesting that disturbance may result in dietary changes. We show that restoration of tropical forests appears to be successful for a key ecological and biological indicator group- dung beetles. Furthermore, community-owned forests appear to be valuable and practical method of maintaining ecosystem health and biodiversity in the region. Future management in this region would likely benefit from encouragement to maintain community-owned forests, economic incentives for restoring farmland to forest, and increased environmental monitoring across the land-use gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2900072418,"Episodic memory is a critical capacity that involves remembering past events along with their spatial and temporal contexts. Relatively little is known about the relations between spatial and temporal information in long-term memory in children or adults. The present research examined the influence of the mental timeline (linear horizontal display extending from the left to right direction for English speakers) on memory for events and their spatial and temporal features in 7-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds and young adults (N = 146). During encoding, participants studied triplets of objects, varying on two dimensions of the mental timeline: linearity (whether objects were presented in linear succession or not) and direction (whether objects were presented from left-to-right or right-to-left). After a delay, during retrieval, participants were tested on their memory for individual objects, and either the spatial location or temporal order of the objects. We found that overall accuracy for spatial location was higher than accuracy for temporal order, and there was a parallel developmental trajectory for both these aspects of memory. Across age groups we found that memory for temporal order, but not spatial location, was influenced by linearity and direction (i.e., match to mental timeline). Thus, in both children and adults the spatiotemporal mental timeline supported memory for temporal order, converging with predictions generated within domains of language and thought and enhancing our understanding of how space and time are represented in the mind."

We sequenced exon 11 of PNLIPRP2 in a cohort of 256 subjects with chronic pancreatitis (152 alcoholic and 104 non-alcoholic) and 200 controls of Hungarian origin. We observed no significant difference in the distribution of the truncation variant between patients and controls.

Our study aims to adapt the RC-QOL into Chinese and to assess its reliability, validity and responsiveness in Chinese patients with RC disorders.First, we developed the Chinese version of RC-QOL (C-RC-QOL) through a five-step procedure. Next, the recruited patients gave three rounds of responses to the C-RC-QOL, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Oxford Shoulder Score scales (OSS). Then, we calculated the Cronbach's alpha, standard error of measurement (SEM), minimally detectable change (MDC), intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM) to evaluate the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the C-RC-QOL respectively. The unidimensionality of each subscale was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) of the residuals.Overall, 124 patients with RC disorders successfully completed the first two rounds of the scales, and 108 patients completed the last round of the scales. Good or excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.953) was found in the overall scale and subscales of the C-RC-QOL, and good or excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.854) was found as well. The SEM and MDC values of the C-RC-QOL were 4.6 and 12.8 respectively. Moderate, good or excellent correlations (r = 0.452-0.839) were obtained between the physical subscales of the C-RC-QOL and the OSS, as well as the physical subscales of the SF-36; similar results were obtained between the emotion subscale of the C-RC-QOL and the mental subscales of the SF-36 (r = 0.490-0.733), which, illustrated the good validity of the C-RC-QOL. In addition, high responsiveness was observed in the overall scale and subscales of the C-RC-QOL (ES = 1.77, SRM = 1.98). The unidimensionality of five subscales was respected according to PCA of the residuals.The C-RC-QOL scale is reliable, valid and responsive for the evaluation of Chinese-speaking patients with RC disorders and it would be an effective instrument."

Whether Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) function is impaired and may underlie the hyperTG phenotype observed in type 2 diabetes is not yet established. To elucidate the mechanism underlying impaired TG homeostasis in insulin resistance state we studied the effect of insulin on GPIHBP1 protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) under flow conditions. Next, we assessed visceral adipose tissue GPIHBP1 protein expression in type 2 diabetes Lepr db/db mouse model as well as in subjects with ranging levels of insulin resistance. We report that insulin reduces the expression of GPIHBP1 protein in HMVECs. Furthermore, GPIHBP1 protein expression in visceral adipose tissue in Lepr db/db mice is significantly reduced as is the active monomeric form of GPIHBP1 as compared to Leprdb/m mice. A similar decrease in GPIHBP1 protein was observed in subjects with increased body weight. GPIHBP1 protein expression was negatively associated with insulin and HOMA-IR. In conclusion, our data suggest that decreased GPIHBP1 availability in insulin resistant state may hamper peripheral lipolysis capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2899638763,"Moral licensing, equivalently called ""self-licensing"", is the instrumental use of a Good Act to cover up a Bad Act. This paper's thesis is that ""instrumental apology"" i.e., bad-faith apology, is a case of moral licensing. A decision maker may issue an apology (Good Act) after committing a Bad Act, but if the decision maker uses the apology instrumentally, he or she is using the apology to justify the Bad Act. Hence, the apology is insincere. Sincerity is the fine line between a good-faith apology or, more generally, a Good Act, on one hand, and an instrumental apology or, more generally, moral licensing, on the other. In this light, moral licensing should be separated from genuine apology that attains moral equilibrium, which is called in the literature moral ""self-regulation' and ""conscience accounting."" According to Kantian ethics, not just the consequences of an act matter, but also the sincerity with which the act was conducted. This pits Kant against the utilitarian view, which downplays intentions and focuses on consequences. We take Kant to the lab. Participants play a modified ultimatum game, where proposers in some treatments have the option of issuing apology messages and responders have both costly and costless options for rewarding or punishing proposers. We introduce different treatments of the apology message to allow responders to form doubts about the sincerity of the apology messages. Our results support the Kantian position: responders, once they become suspicious of the sincerity of the proposers' apology, exhibit ""insincerity aversion"" and punish proposers."
https://openalex.org/W2899682519,"Spraying insecticide is a common practice in the control against pest insects. However, little attention has been paid to the biocidal radius of droplets. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the biocidal radiuses of abamectin, thiamethoxam and sulfoxaflor droplets controlling against wheat aphid (Sitobion avenae). The mortality of S. avenae showed a droplet density dependent process that can be described by an exponential model. Calculated mortality limit (A2) varied with the concentration of insecticides. Although similar LD50 values were observed in abamectin (13.77 ng aphid−1) and sulfoxaflor (14.52 ng aphid−1) against S. avenae, sulfoxaflor had a larger biocidal radius (r50) than abamectin due to its translocation ability at the same concentration. And sulfoxaflor had a relatively larger biocidal radius than thiamethoxam (LD50 = 68.42 ng aphid−1) because it is more toxic to S. avenae. The ratio of r50/VMD was introduced to estimate the potential of droplets. Droplets generated by the air atomizing nozzle (VMD = 43 μm) had higher value of r50/VMD than the centrifugal atomizing nozzle (VMD = 153 μm). Our results indicated that the mortality limit can be reached at a concentration of an insecticide. The biocidal radius of a droplet is different from its actual size. The LD50 and translocation ability of insecticides contributed to their biocidal radius. Ratio of r50/VMD is an indicator of droplets’ insecticidal potential. Smaller droplets generated by the air atomizing nozzle have higher insecticidal potential."
https://openalex.org/W2899884373,"The prion hypothesis proposes a causal relationship between the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) molecular entity and the disease transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Variations in the conformation of PrPSc are associated with different forms of TSE and different risks to animal and human health. Since the discovery of atypical forms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003, scientists have progressed the molecular characterisation of the associated PrPSc in order to better understand these risks, both in cattle as the natural host and following experimental transmission to other species. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry based assay for molecular characterisation of bovine proteinase K (PK) treated PrPSc (PrPres) by quantitative identification of its N-terminal amino acid profiles (N-TAAPs) and tryptic peptides. We have applied the assay to classical, H-type and L-type BSE prions purified from cattle, transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the bovine (Tg110 and Tg1896) or ovine (TgEM16) prion protein gene, and sheep brain. We determined that, for classical BSE in cattle, the G96 N-terminal cleavage site dominated, while the range of cleavage sites was wider following transmission to Tg mice and sheep. For L-BSE in cattle and Tg bovinised mice, a C-terminal shift was identified in the N-TAAP distribution compared to classical BSE, consistent with observations by Western blot (WB). For L-BSE transmitted to sheep, both N-TAAP and tryptic peptide profiles were found to be changed compared to cattle, but less so following transmission to Tg ovinised mice. Relative abundances of aglycosyl peptides were found to be significantly different between the atypical BSE forms in cattle as well as in other hosts. The enhanced resolution provided by molecular analysis of PrPres using mass spectrometry has improved insight into the molecular changes following transmission of atypical BSE to other species."
https://openalex.org/W2900192701,"Clinical trials are necessary in order to develop treatments for diseases; however, they can often be costly, time consuming, and demanding to the patients. This paper summarizes several common methods used for optimal design that can be used to address these issues. In addition, we introduce a novel method for optimizing experiment designs applied to HIV 2-LTR clinical trials. Our method employs Bayesian techniques to optimize the experiment outcome by maximizing the Expected Kullback-Leibler Divergence (EKLD) between the a priori knowledge of system parameters before the experiment and the a posteriori knowledge of the system parameters after the experiment. We show that our method is robust and performs equally well if not better than traditional optimal experiment design techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2900426420,"Large cancer genome studies continue to reveal new players in treatment response and tumorigenesis. The discrimination of functional alterations from the abundance of passenger genetic alterations still poses challenges and determines DNA sequence variant selection procedures. Here we evaluate variant selection strategies that select homozygous variants and rare SNPs and assess its value in detecting tumor cells with DNA repair defects.To this end we employed a panel of 29 patient-derived head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, of which a subset harbors DNA repair defects. Mitomycin C (MMC) sensitivity was used as functional endpoint of DNA crosslink repair deficiency. 556 genes including the Fanconi anemia (FA) and homologous recombination (HR) genes, whose products strongly determine MMC response, were capture-sequenced.We show a strong association between MMC sensitivity, thus loss of DNA repair function, and the presence of homozygous and rare SNPs in the relevant FA/HR genes. Excluding such selection criteria impedes the discrimination of crosslink repair status by mutation analysis. Applied to all KEGG pathways, we find that the association with MMC sensitivity is strongest in the KEGG FA pathway, therefore also demonstrating the value of such selection strategies for exploratory analyses. Variant analyses in 56 clinical samples demonstrate that homozygous variants occur more frequently in tumor suppressor genes than oncogenes further supporting the role of a homozygosity criterion to improve gene function association or tumor suppressor gene identification studies.Together our data show that the detection of relevant genes or of repair pathway defected tumor cells can be improved by the consideration of allele zygosity and SNP allele frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2951534192,"The transcription factor NKX2.1, expressed at high levels in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), is a master regulator of cortical interneuron progenitor development. To identify gene candidates with expression profiles similar to NKX2.1, previous transcriptome analysis of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived MGE-like progenitors revealed SFTA3 as the strongest candidate. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of hESC-derived NKX2.1-positive progenitors and transcriptome data available from the Allen Institute for Brain Science revealed comparable expression patterns for NKX2.1 and SFTA3 during interneuron differentiation in vitro and demonstrated high SFTA3 expression in the human MGE. Although SFTA3 has been well studied in the lung, the possible role of this surfactant protein in the MGE during embryonic development remains unexamined. To determine if SFTA3 plays a role in MGE specification, SFTA3-/- and NKX2.1 -/- hESC lines were generated using custom designed CRISPRs. We show that NKX2.1 KOs have a significantly diminished capacity to differentiate into MGE interneuron subtypes. SFTA3 KOs also demonstrated a somewhat reduced ability to differentiate down the MGE-like lineage, although not as severe relative to NKX2.1 deficiency. These results suggest NKX2.1 and SFTA3 are co-regulated genes, and that deletion of SFTA3 does not lead to a major change in the specification of MGE derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2899542596,"Background Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is often used to help to guide resuscitation of critically ill patients. The standard gold technique for ScvO2 measurement is the co-oximetry (Co-oximetry_ScvO2), which is usually incorporated in most recent blood gas analyzers. However, in some hospitals, those machines are not available and only calculated ScvO2 (Calc_ScvO2) is provided. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the agreement between Co-oximetry_ScvO2 and Calc_ScvO2 in a general population of critically ill patients and septic shock patients. Methods A total of 100 patients with a central venous catheter were included in the study. One hundred central venous blood samples were collected and analyzed using the same point-of-care blood gas analyzer, which provides both the calculated and measured ScvO2 values. Bland and Altman plot, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient were used to assess the agreement between Co-oximetry_ScvO2 and Calc_ScvO2. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent explanatory variables of the difference between Co-oximetry_ScvO2 and Calc_ScvO2. Results In all population, Bland and Altman’s analysis showed poor agreement (+4.5 [-7.1, +16.1]%) between the two techniques. The ICC was 0.754 [(95% CI: 0.393–0.880), P< 0.001], and the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, after categorizing the two variables into two groups using a cutoff value of 70%, was 0.470 (P <0.001). In septic shock patients (49%), Bland and Altman’s analysis also showed poor agreement (+5.6 [–6.7 to 17.8]%). The ICC was 0.720 [95% CI: 0.222–0.881], and the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was 0.501 (P <0.001). Four independent variables (PcvO2, Co-oximetry_ScvO2, venous pH, and Hb) were found to be associated with the difference between the measured and calculated ScvO2 (adjusted R2 = 0.8, P<0.001), with PcvO2 being the main independent explanatory variable because of its highest absolute standardized coefficient. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) of PcvO2 to predict Co-oximetry_ScvO2 ≥ 70% was 0.911 [95% CI: 0.837–0.959], in all patients, and 0.903 [95% CI: 0.784–0.969], in septic shock patients. The best cutoff value was ≥ 36 mmHg (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 83%), in all patients, and ≥ 35 mmHg (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 71%) in septic shock patients. Conclusions The discrepancy between the measured and calculated ScvO2 is clinically not acceptable. We do not recommend the use of calculated ScvO2 to guide resuscitation in critically ill patients. In situations where the Co-oximetry technique is not available, relying on PcvO2 to predict the measured ScvO2 value above or below 70% could be an option."
https://openalex.org/W2899630897,"The increasing interest in exploring the human genome and identifying genetic risk factors contributing to the susceptibility to and outcome of diseases has supported the rapid development of genome-wide techniques. However, the large amount of obtained data requires extensive bioinformatics analysis. In this work, we established an approach combining amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), AFLP in silico and next generation sequencing (NGS) methods to map the malignant genome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. We compared the unique DNA fingerprints of patients generated by the AFLP technique approach with those of healthy donors to identify AFLP markers associated with the disease and/or the response to treatment with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Among the statistically significant AFLP markers selected for NGS analysis and virtual fingerprinting, we identified the sequences of three fragments in the region of DNA repeat element OldhAT1, LINE L1M7, LTR MER90, and satellite ALR/Alpha among repetitive elements, which may indicate a role of these non-coding repetitive sequences in hematological malignancy. SNPs leading to the presence/absence of these fragments were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. When evaluating the results of AFLP analysis for some fragments, we faced the frequently discussed size homoplasy, resulting in co-migration of non-identical AFLP fragments that may originate from an insertion/deletion, SNP, somatic mutation anywhere in the genome, or combination thereof. The AFLP-AFLP in silico-NGS procedure represents a smart alternative to microarrays and relatively expensive and bioinformatically challenging whole-genome sequencing to detect the association of variable regions of the human genome with diseases."
