https://openalex.org/W2052367587,"Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide of glucose commonly found at high concentrations in anhydrobiotic organisms. In the presence of trehalose, dry dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) had a transition temperature similar to that of the fully hydrated lipid, whereas DPPC dried without trehalose had a transition temperature about 30 degrees Kelvin higher. Results obtained with infrared spectroscopy indicate that trehalose and DPPC interact by hydrogen bonding between the OH groups in the carbohydrate and the polar head groups of DPPC. These and previous results show that this hydrogen bonding alters the spacing of the polar head groups and may thereby decrease van der Waals interactions in the hydrocarbon chains of the DPPC. This interaction between trehalose and DPPC is specific to trehalose. Hence this specificity may be an important factor in the ability of this molecule to stabilize dry membranes in anhydrobiotic organisms."

Mixing and diffusion processes near these reefs and headlands are quite different from these processes in the open sea, and classical advection-diffusion models that were developed for the open sea are not valid near shore. Topographically generated fronts affect the distribution of sediments, and they aggregate waterborne eggs, larvae, and plankton. This aggregation influences the distribution and density of benthic assemblages and of pelagic secondary and tertiary predators."

Paleoseismic data and historical information indicate that this event was the ""San Juan Capistrano"" earthquake of 8 December 1812, with a magnitude of 7.5. The discovery that at least 12 kilometers of the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault ruptured in 1812, only 44 years before the great January 1857 rupture, demonstrates that intervals between large earthquakes on this part of the fault are highly variable. This variability increases the uncertainty of forecasting destructive earthquakes on the basis of past behavior and accentuates the need for a more fundamental knowledge of San Andreas fault dynamics."

Heterozygosity remains fixed in allopolyploids because of nonsegregation of parental chromosomes. Two allotetraploid species of the fern genus Asplenium show allozyme polymorphisms at loci that are polymorphic in their diploid progenitors, indicating that each has originated more than once and implicating continued gene flow from diploids to tetraploids."
https://openalex.org/W1969051191,"Three different classes of numerical models successfully predicted the occurrence of the El Niño of 1986-87 at lead times of 3 to 9 months. Although the magnitude and timing of predicted ocean surface temperatures were not perfect, these results suggest that routine prediction of moderate to large El Niño events is feasible. The key to the success of the models lies in recognizing or simulating the low-frequency, large-scale changes in the tropical ocean-atmosphere system that give rise to El Niño events."
https://openalex.org/W2034681001,"A new Silurian (Llandoverian) biota from Wisconsin with a significant soft-bodied and lightly sclerotized component is dominated by arthropods and worms. The fauna includes the earliest well-preserved xiphosure, a possible marine uniramian, three new arthropods of uncertain affinity, and possibly the first Paleozoic leech. This may be only the second locality to yield a conodont animal. Lack of a normal shelly fauna suggests an unusual environment. The discovery adds significantly to the few such exceptionally preserved faunas known from Lower Paleozoic rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2042163846,"The black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii), a commercially important shallow-water gastropod common off White Point, Southern California, is found frequently at subtidal hydrothermal vents within mats of filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Foraging vent abalones actively consume the bacteria and confine their nightly feeding forays to bacterial mats surrounding the vents. The growth of abalones consuming the sulfur bacteria exceeds that of control individuals consuming microalgae and is comparable to reported growth rates of abalones consuming macroalgae. Thus, off White Point, the black abalone may derive a portion of its nutrition from the subsidy of geothermal energy."
https://openalex.org/W2017604360,"The cleistogamous species Collomia grandiflora produces dimorphic cross-incompatible flowers on a single plant. The open or chasmogamous flower has smaller, flask-shaped stigmatic papillae, larger pollen grains, longer styles, and faster pollen tube growth rates down the style than the closed or cleistogamous flower. In intermorph crosses, pollen tube growth rates are greatly decreased and fertilization does not occur."
https://openalex.org/W2040142057,"A relation among activity, composition, and structure was determined for a working catalyst by means of a stainless-steel reactor cell of novel design that permitted operation at temperatures and pressures similar to those in industrial reactors. Molybdenum K-edge x-ray absorption spectra were used to probe the structural environment of molybdenum in CoMoS/[unknown]-alumina catalysts while hydro-desulfurization of benzothiophene was proceeding at high temperature and pressure. For catalyst samples with different contents of cobalt, radial structure functions obtained from extended x-ray absorption fine structure data presented the same features as those obtained from the spectra of MoS(2)/[unknown]-alumina reference samples. Moreover, Mo-S and Mo-Mo coordination numbers were maximum for the sample with an atomic ratio of Co to (Co + Mo) of 0.33; this sample was also the most active catalyst tested."
https://openalex.org/W2018314516,"The Rp1 gene of maize determines resistance to the leaf rust pathogen Puccinia sorghi. X-ray treatment of heterozygous (Rp1 Oy/rp1 oy) maize embryos generated seedlings with yellow sectors lacking. Rp1. Yellow sectored seedlings inoculated with rust spores gave rust pustule formation in yellow (Rp1-lacking) sectors and hypersensitive resistance in green tissues, thereby demonstrating that the Rp1 gene product is cellautonomous in its action. In cases where the hypersensitive reaction was initiated in green (Rp1) tissue next to a yellow sector, the hypersensitive response appeared to be propagated poorly, if at all, through Rp1-lacking cells."
