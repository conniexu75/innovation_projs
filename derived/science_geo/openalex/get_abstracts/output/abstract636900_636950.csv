https://openalex.org/W2963308200,"Breastfeeding within one hour of birth is a critical component of newborn care and is estimated to avert 22% of neonatal mortality globally. Understanding the determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) is essential for designing targeted and effective breastfeeding promotion programmes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding among Bangladeshi women.This paper analyses the data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2014. Analysis was based on responses of women who had at least one live birth in the two years preceding the survey (n = 3,162) collected using a structured questionnaire. The primary outcome was breastfeeding initiation within one hour of birth ascertained by women's self-report. Explanatory variables included woman's age, education, religion, household wealth, place of residence and place of delivery, birth order, child's size, antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC) and skin-to-skin contact. Associations between variables were assessed by simple and multivariable logistic regressions.Of the 3,162 recently delivered mothers, 51% initiated breastfeeding within one hour of delivery. Prevalence of EIBF varied significantly between different types of mode of delivery, among different geographical regions and among women who had PNC with their newborn. Women who had caesarean section (C-section) were less likely to initiate breastfeeding early after birth than women who had normal vaginal delivery (NVD) (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.23 0.43; p value < 0.001). Women who had received PNC with their newborns within one hour of delivery were more likely to breastfeed their babies within one hour of birth compared to those who did not (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.26 2.07; p value < 0.001). Mother's age, education, religion, household wealth index, place of residence and place of delivery, birth order, number of antenatal visits, child's size and skin-to-skin contact were not significantly associated with EIBF.Findings from this study suggest that investing more effort in ensuring immediate PNC of mother-newborn pair can increase EIBF. Solutions should be explored to increase EIBF among mothers who undergo C-section as C-section is rising rapidly in Bangladesh. Further research is needed to explore the regional differences in the country, including specific cultural practices that influence EIBF."
https://openalex.org/W2963032502,"""Why are neurotypicals so pig-ignorant about autism?"" an autistic person wrote on the Curtin Autism Research Group's on-line portal as a response to a call for research questions. Co-produced with an autistic researcher, knowledge about and attitudes towards autism were analysed from 1,054 completed surveys, representing the Australian neurotypical adult population. The majority, 81.5% of participants had a high level of knowledge and 81.3% of participants had a strong positive attitude towards autism. Neither age, nor education level had an impact on attitudes. However, attitudes were influenced by knowledge about 'Societal Views and Ideas'; 'What it Could be Like to Have Autism'; and the demographic variables 'Knowing and having spent time around someone with autism'; and gender (women having more positive attitudes than men). Thus, targeted interventions, geared more towards men than women, to increase knowledge about autism could further improve attitudes and increase acceptance of the autistic community."
https://openalex.org/W2963428513,"Phosphate (Pi) transporters play critical roles in Pi acquisition and homeostasis. However, little is known about these transporters in oilseed rape. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to characterize the members of the PHT1 gene family in allotetraploid Brassica napus and to analyze their expression profiles in response to environmental stresses. In total, 49 PHT1 family members were identified in B. napus, including 27 genes in the A subgenome and 22 in the C subgenome. Most of the PHT1 proteins were predicted to localize to the plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the members of the PHT1 gene family can be divided into seven clades, with the introns/exons and protein motifs conserved in each clade. Collinearity analysis revealed that most of the BnaPHT1 genes shared syntenic relationships with PHT1 members in Arabidopsis thaliana, B. rapa, and B. oleracea, and that whole-genome duplication (polyploidy) played a major driving force for BnaPHT1 evolution in addition to segmental duplication. Transcript abundance analysis showed that a broad range of expression patterns of individual BnaPHT1 genes occurred in response to phosphorus (P) deficiency. In addition, the expression levels of BnaPHT1 genes can be regulated by different nutrient stresses, including nitrogen (N), potassium (K), sulfur (S) and iron (Fe) stresses. Moveover, salt and drought stresses can regulate the transcript abundances of BnaPHT1s, as well as phytohormones including auxin and cytokinin. Gene coexpression analysis based on the RNA-seq data implied that BnaPHT1s might cooperate with each other as well as with other genes to regulate nutrient homeostasis in B. napus. Further analysis of the promoters revealed that GT-1, DRE and P1BS elements are widely distributed within the promoter regions of BnaPHT1 genes. Our results indicate that BnaPHT1s might be involved in cross-talk for sensing the external status of P, N, K, S and Fe, as well as salt and drought stresses. Moreover, these processes might be mediated by phytohormones. Our findings provide the first step in the complex genetic dissection of the Pi transport system in plants and implicate multiple transcriptional regulation, which probably refers to new roles of PHT1 genes in B. napus."
https://openalex.org/W2964297082,"The goal of this work was to study the phenotypic susceptibility and resistance determinants of N. gonorrhoeae isolates to beta-lactam antimicrobials (benzylpenicillin and ceftriaxone). A total of 522 clinical isolates collected in Russia in 2015–2017 were analysed for susceptibility using the agar dilution method. DNA loci involved in antimicrobial resistance were identified using DNA microarray analysis and sequencing. Resistance to benzylpenicillin remained high, with 7.7% of isolates resistant (MICpen > 1 mg/L) and 47.5% of isolates showing intermediate susceptibility (MICpen = 0.12–1 mg/L). The most frequent resistance determinant (72.4% isolates) was the Asp345 insertion in penA, both as a single mutation and in combination with other mutations, particularly with the substitution Leu421Pro in ponA (39.0%). Mutations affecting the influx and efflux of drugs were also found, including amino acid substitutions in PorB (26.8% isolates) and delA in the promoter region of mtrR (22.8%). The accumulation of mutations in chromosomal genes (penA, pon, porA, and mtrR) led to a stepwise increase in MICpen to values characteristic of intermediate resistance. The presence of blaTEM plasmids was found in 25 isolates (4.8%), resulting in a strong increase in resistance to penicillin (MICpen > 16 mg/L) compared with the chromosomal mutations; 23 plasmids were of the African type with TEM-1 beta-lactamase, and two plasmids were of the Toronto/Rio type with TEM-135 beta-lactamase. Only three isolates were found with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, with MICcef = 0.12–0.25 mg/L. Sequencing of penA did not reveal mutations associated with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, and the gene structure was non-mosaic. The majority of isolates (21 of 25) carrying the blaTEM plasmid also contained the conjugative plasmid with tetM (resistance to tetracyclines), consistent with previously reported data that the presence of the conjugative plasmid facilitates the transfer of other plasmids associated with antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2963161180,"Considerable upscaling of malaria control efforts have taken place over the last 15 years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country with the second highest malaria case load after Nigeria. Malaria control interventions have been strengthened in line with the Millenium Development Goals. We analysed the effects of these interventions on malaria cases at health facility level, using a retrospective trend analysis of malaria cases between 2005 and 2014. Data were collected from outpatient and laboratory registers based on a sample of 175 health facilities that represents all eco-epidemiological malaria settings across the country.We applied a time series analysis to assess trends of suspected and confirmed malaria cases, by health province and for different age groups. A linear panel regression model controlled for non-malaria outpatient cases, rain fall, nightlight intensity, health province and time fixed effects, was used to examine the relationship between the interventions and malaria case occurrences, as well as test positivity rates.Overall, recorded suspected and confirmed malaria cases in the DRC have increased. The sharp increase in confirmed cases from 2010 coincides with the introduction of the new treatment policy and the resulting scale-up of diagnostic testing. Controlling for confounding factors, the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was significantly associated with the number of tested and confirmed cases. The test positivity rate fluctuated around 40% without showing any trend.The sharp increase in confirmed malaria cases from 2010 is unlikely to be due to a resurgence of malaria, but is clearly associated with improved diagnostic availability, mainly the introduction of RDTs. Before that, a great part of malaria cases were treated based on clinical suspicion. This finding points to a better detection of cases that potentially contributed to improved case management. Furthermore, the expansion of diagnostic testing along with the increase in confirmed cases implies that before 2010, cases were underreported, and that the accuracy of routine data to describe malaria incidence has improved."
https://openalex.org/W2963349561,"Background The efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis has been established at long-term follow-up with the majority of recurrences shown to occur within the first year. Overall costs of antibiotics are significantly lower compared with appendectomy at short-term follow-up, but long-term durability of these cost savings is unclear. The study objective was to compare the long-term overall costs of antibiotic therapy versus appendectomy in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in the APPAC (APPendicitis ACuta) trial at 5 years. Methods and findings This multicentre, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial randomly assigned 530 adult patients with CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis to appendectomy or antibiotic treatment at six Finnish hospitals. All major costs during the 5-year follow-up were recorded, whether generated by the initial visit and subsequent treatment or possible recurrent appendicitis. Between November 2009 and June 2012, 273 patients were randomized to appendectomy and 257 to antibiotics. The overall costs of appendectomy were 1.4 times higher (p<0.001) (€5716; 95% CI: €5510 to €5925) compared with antibiotic therapy (€4171; 95% CI: €3879 to €4463) resulting in cost savings of €1545 per patient (95% CI: €1193 to €1899; p<0.001) in the antibiotic group. At 5 years, the majority (61%, n = 156) of antibiotic group patients did not undergo appendectomy. Conclusions At 5-year follow-up antibiotic treatment resulted in significantly lower overall costs compared with appendectomy. As the majority of appendicitis recurrences occur within the first year after the initial antibiotic treatment, these results suggest that treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis with antibiotics instead of appendectomy results in lower overall costs even at longer-term follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2964228822,"Cancer antigen 15–3 (CA15-3) is widely utilized for monitoring metastatic breast cancer (BC). However, its utility for early detection of breast cancer is severely limited due to poor clinical sensitivity and specificity. The glycosylation of CA15-3 is known to be affected by BC, and therefore it might offer a way to construct CA15-3 glycovariant assays with improved cancer specificity. To this end, we performed lectin-based glycoprofiling of BC-associated CA15-3. CA15-3 expressed by a BC cell line was immobilized on microtitration wells using an anti-CA15-3 antibody. The glycosylation of the immobilized CA15-3 was then detected by using lectins coated onto europium (III)-doped nanoparticles (Eu+3-NPs) and measuring the time-resolved fluorescence of Eu. Out of multiple lectin-Eu+3-NP preparations, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) -Eu3+-NPs bound to the BC cell line-dericed CA15-3 glycovariants (CA15-3Lectin). To evaluate the clinical performance of these two lectin-based assays, plasma samples from metastatic BC patients (n = 53) and healthy age-matched women (n = 20).Plasma CA15-3Lectin measurements better distinguished metastatic BC patients from healthy controls than the conventional CA15-3 immunoassay. At 90% specificity, the clinical sensitivity of the assays was 66.0, 67.9 and 81.1% for the conventional CA15-3, CA15-3MGL and CA15-3WGA assays, respectively. Baseline CA15-3MGL and CA15-3WGA were correlated to conventional baseline CA15-3 levels (r = 0.68, p<0.001, r = 0.90, p>0.001, respectively). However, very low baseline CA15-3MGL levels ≤ 5 U/mL were common in this metastatic breast cancer patient population.In conclusion, the new CA15-3Lectin concept could considerably improve the clinical sensitivity of BC detection compared to the conventional CA15-3 immunoassays and should be validated further on a larger series of subjects with different cancer subtypes and stages."
https://openalex.org/W2964182651,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses photosensitisers such as protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) to target tumours via the release of toxic singlet oxygen when irradiated. The effectivity of the treatment is limited by the innate properties of the photosensitizers; they typically exhibit inefficient accumulation in target tissue and high dark toxicity. Carbon dots (CDs) are biocompatible fluorescent nanoparticles which can improve PpIX cellular uptake and solubility. In this work, we present conjugates synthesised by host-guest encapsulation (PpIX@CD) and amide cross-linking (PpIX-CD). Characterization demonstrated conjugates have a loading efficiency of 34-48% and similar singlet oxygen production to PpIX. PpIX-containing CDs showed a 2.2 to 3.7-fold decrease in dark toxicity. PpIX-CD and PpIX@CD showed equivalent light-induced toxicity to PpIX in concentrations >1 μg/ml, leading to a 3.2 to 4.1-fold increase in photo-toxicity index (PI). The less soluble fraction of cross-linked conjugates (PpIX-CD)p did not show significant difference from PpIX. Confocal light scanning microscopy demonstrated rapid intracellular uptake and accumulation of conjugates. Our results demonstrate the variations between cross-linking strategies in CD-based conjugates, highlighting their potential as carriers in drug delivery and bioimaging applications."
https://openalex.org/W2964289057,"The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of a six-week in-season period of soccer training and games (congested period) on plasma volume variations (PV), hematological parameters, and physical fitness in elite players. In addition, we analyzed relationships between training load, hematological parameters and players' physical fitness.Eighteen elite players were evaluated before (T1) and after (T2) a six-week in-season period interspersed with 10 soccer matches. At T1 and T2, players performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (YYIR1), the repeated shuttle sprint ability test (RSSA), the countermovement jump test (CMJ), and the squat jump test (SJ). In addition, PV and hematological parameters (erythrocytes [M/mm3], hematocrit [%], hemoglobin [g/dl], mean corpuscular volume [fl], mean corpuscular hemoglobin content [pg], and mean hemoglobin concentration [%]) were assessed. Daily ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored in order to quantify the internal training load.From T1 to T2, significant performance declines were found for the YYIR1 (p<0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.5), RSSA (p<0.01, ES = 0.6) and SJ tests (p< 0.046, ES = 0.7). However, no significant changes were found for the CMJ (p = 0.86, ES = 0.1). Post-exercise, RSSA blood lactate (p<0.012, ES = 0.2) and PV (p<0.01, ES = 0.7) increased significantly from T1 to T2. A significant decrease was found from T1 to T2 for the erythrocyte value (p<0.002, ES = 0.5) and the hemoglobin concentration (p<0.018, ES = 0.8). The hematocrit percentage rate was also significantly lower (p<0.001, ES = 0.6) at T2. The mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin content and the mean hemoglobin content values were not statistically different from T1 to T2. No significant relationships were detected between training load parameters and percentage changes of hematological parameters. However, a significant relationship was observed between training load and changes in RSSA performance (r = -0.60; p<0.003).An intensive period of ""congested match play"" over 6 weeks significantly compromised players' physical fitness. These changes were not related to hematological parameters, even though significant alterations were detected for selected measures."
https://openalex.org/W2963088923,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation. In this study, we investigated effect of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) on IL-6 expression in canine dermal fibroblasts. IL-1β induced IL-6 mRNA expression and protein release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When cells were treated with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor FR180240 inhibited IL-1β-induced IL-6 mRNA expression, but not SP600125 or SKF86002, which are c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK inhibitors, respectively. In cells treated with U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which activates ERK, IL-1β-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was also inhibited. IL-1β stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In cells transfected with ERK1 and ERK2 isoform siRNAs, IL-1β-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was reduced. These observations suggest that IL-1β induces IL-6 expression via ERK1/2 signaling pathway in canine dermal fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2963724219,"Stroke has a major impact on survivors and their social environment. Care delivery is advocated to become more client-centered and home-based because of their positive impact on client outcomes. The objective of this study was to explore professionals' perspectives on the provision of Home-Based Stroke Rehabilitation (HBSR) in the Netherlands and on the barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of HBSR in daily practice.Semi-structured focus groups were conducted to explore the perspectives of health and social care professionals involved in stroke rehabilitation. Directed content analysis was performed to analyze the transcripts of recorded conversations.Fourteen professionals participated in focus groups (n = 12) or, if unable to attend, an interview (n = 2). Participants varied in professional backgrounds and roles in treating Dutch clients post stroke. Barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of HBSR in daily practice were identified in relation to: the innovation, the user, the organization and the socio-political context. Participants reported that HBSR can be efficient and effective to most clients because it facilitates client- and caregiver-centered rehabilitation within the clients' own environment. However, barriers in implementing HBSR were perceived in a lack of (structured) inter-professional collaboration and the transparency of expertise of primary care professionals. Also, the current financial structures for HBSR in the Netherlands are viewed as inappropriate.In line with previous studies, we found that HBSR is recognized by professionals as a promising alternative to institution-based rehabilitation for clients with sufficient capabilities (e.g. their own health and informal support).Multiple factors influencing the implementation of HBSR were identified. Our study suggests that, in order to implement HBSR in daily practice, region specific implementation strategies need to be developed. We recommend developing strategies concerning: organized and coordinated inter-professional collaboration, transparency of the expertise of primary care professionals, and the financial structures of HBSR."
https://openalex.org/W2963073463,"Environmental managers face major challenges related to project implementation and communicating the significance of those projects to the public. Effective communication can mitigate public opposition or increase support for specific projects and increase public and political support for environmental management more generally. In this study, we evaluate which types of benefits or losses environmental managers should communicate and how to frame those attributes to achieve greater public support. To do so, we field a survey experiment that presents the benefits of an invasive species management project, utilizing a two (economic, ecological) by two (gain, loss) factorial design as well as a control message. Ecological messages lead to significantly more support for invasive species management than economic messages, and loss frames are more effective than gain frames. We also find that treatment responses differ across several covariates including political ideology and environmentalism. These results indicate that the public is more concerned with managing invasive species for intrinsic environmental worth than economic benefit and that preventing further environmental degradation is more motivating than promoting additional environmental gains."
https://openalex.org/W2963271638,"The lymphatic vascular system plays important roles in the control of tissue fluid homeostasis and immune responses. While VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis promotes hair follicle (HF) growth, the potential role of lymphatic vessels (LVs) in HF cycling has remained unknown. In this study, we found that LVs are localized in close proximity to the HF bulge area throughout the postnatal and depilation-induced hair cycle in mice and that a network of LVs directly connects the individual HFs. Increased LV density in the skin of K14-VEGF-C transgenic mice was associated with prolongation of anagen HF growth. Conversely, HF entry into the catagen phase was accelerated in K14-sVEGFR3 transgenic mice that lack cutaneous LVs. Importantly, repeated intradermal injections of VEGF-C promoted hair growth in mice. Conditioned media from lymphatic endothelial cells promoted human dermal papilla cell (DPC) growth and expression of IGF-1 and alkaline phosphatase, both activators of DPCs. Our results reveal an unexpected role of LVs in coordinating and promoting HF growth and identify potential new therapeutic strategies for hair loss-associated conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2963619924,"Bosten Lake is an important region of Northwest China that has transformed from a freshwater lake to a saltwater lake since the 1970s. The water quality in the Bosten Lake basin is important for social and economic development, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the key indicators of water quality. The land use data, precipitation data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model were used to simulate the N and P exports of the Bosten Lake basin. The spatial and temporal dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus exports, and the response of nitrogen and phosphorus exports to land use change and precipitation change were analyzed between 2000 and 2015. The results show that the amount of N and P exports increased during 2000-2015, and the N and P exports are mainly distributed around Bosten Lake. The N and P exports are greatly affected by cultivated land, built-up areas and grassland, while they are less affected by other land use types. The high precipitation areas with small exports of N and P are mainly distributed in mountain areas, while small precipitation areas with large exports of N and P are distributed in plains where the cultivated land and built-up areas are concentrated. The InVEST model can be used in Northwest China, and the statistical downscaling of reanalysis precipitation data can be used in the InVEST model to improve the simulation accuracy in the data scarce regions of Northwest China."
https://openalex.org/W2963806910,"The study aimed to evaluate the body composition of patients with mitochondrial diseases (MD) and correlate it with disease severity. Overall, 89 patients (age ≥ 18 years) with MD were recruited, including 49 with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and 40 with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactate acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Body composition, including fat mass index (FMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), were examined using multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis. Clinical assessments, including muscle strength, usual gait speed, and disease severity determined by the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale score (NMDAS), were performed. The comparisons between patients group and age- and gender-matched healthy controls, as well as the correlations between anthropometric measurements, body composition, and disease severity were analyzed. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), FFMI, SMI, and ASMI were significantly lower in patients with MD than in healthy controls. Notably, low muscle mass was noted in 69.7% (62/89) of MD patients, with 22 patients also presenting with compromised physical performance as indicated by decreased gait speed, resulting in 24.7% satisfied the sarcopenia diagnostic criteria. Disease severity was more negatively correlated with ASMI than it was with height, weight, and BMI. Subgroup analysis showed that in the MELAS subgroup, disease severity was negatively correlated with height, weight, and ASMI; whereas in the CPEO subgroup, it was only negatively correlated with ASMI and SMI. Additionally, ASMI was positively associated with muscle strength. Altogether, compared with BMI, ASMI is a more sensitive biomarker predicting disease severity of MD, both in MELAS and CPEO patients."
https://openalex.org/W2963005456,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype D (HBV/D) is globally widespread, and ten subgenotypes (D1 to D10) showing distinct geographic distributions have been described to date. The evolutionary history of HBV/D and its subgenotypes, for which few complete genome sequences are available, in the Americas is not well understood. The main objective of the current study was to determine the full-length genomic sequences of HBV/D isolates from Brazil and frequency, origin and spread of HBV/D subgenotypes in the Americas. Complete HBV/D genomes isolated from 39 Brazilian patients infected with subgenotypes D1 (n = 1), D2 (n = 10), D3 (n = 27), and D4 (n = 1) were sequenced and analyzed together with reference sequences using the Bayesian coalescent and phylogeographic framework. A search for HBV/D sequences available in GenBank revealed 209 complete and 926 partial genomes from American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Martinique, Mexico, USA and Venezuela), with the major circulating subgenotypes identified as D1 (26%), D2 (17%), D3 (36%), D4 (21%), and D7 (1%) within the continent. The detailed evolutionary history of HBV/D in the Americas was investigated by using different evolutionary time scales. Spatiotemporal reconstruction analyses using short-term substitution rates suggested times of the most recent common ancestor for the American HBV/D subgenotypes coincident with mass migratory movements to Americas during the 19th and 20th centuries. In particular, significant linkages between Argentina and Syria (D1), Brazil and Central/Eastern Europe (D2), USA and India (D2), and Brazil and Southern Europe (D3) were estimated, consistent with historical and epidemiological data."

The study aimed to describe: 1) the challenges and protective factors that affect the well-being of migrant families receiving care at La Maison Bleue; and 2) how La Maison Bleue strengthens resilience among these families.We conducted a focused ethnography. Immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants were invited to participate. We collected data from November to December 2017 via semi-structured interviews and participant observation during group activities at La Maison Bleue. Data were thematically analysed.Twenty-four mothers participated (9 interviewed, 17 observed). Challenges to well-being included family separation, isolation, loss of support, the immigration process, an unfamiliar culture and environment, and language barriers. Key protective factors were women's intrinsic drive to overcome difficulties, their positive outlook and ability to find meaning in their adversity, their faith, culture and traditions, and supportive relationships, both locally and transnationally. La Maison Bleue strengthened resilience by providing a safe space, offering holistic care that responded to both medical and psychosocial needs, and empowering women to achieve their full potential towards better health for themselves and their families.Migrant mothers have many strengths and centres like La Maison Bleue can offer a safe space and be an empowering community resource to assist mothers in overcoming the multiple challenges that they face while resettling and raising their young children in a new country."
https://openalex.org/W2963282543,"The prevalence of overweightness in Bangladesh is increasing, while underweightness also continues to persist. A better understanding of the patterns and socioeconomic risk factors of both conditions, particularly among women, is critical in order to promote the development of interventions to improve maternal health in Bangladesh. This study therefore sought to assess the patterns of under- and overweightness between 2004 and 2014 and to examine the predictors of individual and community-level inequalities of under- and overnutrition in Bangladesh.Cross-sectional data of 10, 431, and 16,478 ever-married nonpregnant women aged between 15 and 49 years who did not give birth in the two months preceding the survey were extracted from the 2004 and 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys, respectively. Body mass index was used to measure weight status, and underweightness, at-risk for overweightness, overweightness, and obesity were the main outcome variables. Patterns of nutritional change over time was examined by considering the annual average rate of change. Multilevel multinomial logistic regression and quantile regression were used to identify the inequalities.In 2014, the age-adjusted prevalence values of underweightness, at-risk for overweightness, overweightness, and obesity were 19.7%, 14.9%, 18.1% and 4.0%, respectively. A higher average annual rate of reduction of underweightness was found among wealthier, highly educated, and wealthier community-living women, while a rate of increase of overweightness was found among poorer, uneducated, and poor community-living women. Individual and community-level inequalities of malnutrition were observed among these populations. In comparison with women living in low wealth communities, women from wealthier communities were at an increased risk of being at-risk for overweightness [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.91], overweight (AOR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.27-2.00), and obese (AOR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.42-3.18).This study suggests the coexistence of a double burden of under- and overnutrition in Bangladesh and that the prevalence of overweightness surpasses that of underweightness. The burdens of under- and overnutrition are strongly associated with women's individual socioeconomic positions and the nature of the community in which they live."
https://openalex.org/W2962869148,"Hypogeococcus pungens, a mealybug native of southern South America, is devastating native cacti in Puerto Rico and threatening cactus diversity in the Caribbean, and potentially in Central and North America. The taxonomic status of H. pungens is controversial since it has been reported feeding not only on Cactaceae but also on other plant families throughout its distribution range. However, in Australia, where the species had been exported from Argentina to control weedy American cacti, it was never found on host plants other than Cactaceae. These conflicting pieces of evidence not only cast doubt on the species identity that invaded Puerto Rico, but also have a negative impact on the search for natural enemies to be used in biological control programs against this pest. Here we present reproductive incompatibility and phylogenetic evidences that give support to the hypothesis that H. pungens is a species complex in which divergence appears to be driven by the host plants. The nuclear EF1α and 18S and the mitochondrial COI genes were used as markers to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among H. pungens populations collected in Argentina, Australia and Puerto Rico feeding on Cactaceae and/or Amaranthaceae. Additionally, we conducted reciprocal crosses between mealybugs from both hosts. Species delimitation analysis revealed two well-supported putative species within H. pungens, one including mealybugs feeding on Amaranthaceae (H. pungens sensu stricto), and a new undescribed species using Cactaceae as hosts. Additionally, we found asymmetric reproductive incompatibility between these putative species suggesting recent reproductive isolation. The Bayesian species delimitation also suggested that the Australian mealybug population may derive from another undescribed species. Overall, the patterns of genetic differentiation may be interpreted as the result of recent speciation events prompted by host plant shifts.

We still need to identify the geographical origin of the pest in order to enable the use of biological control to reduce the threat to cacti diversity in the Caribbean."
https://openalex.org/W2962900852,"Background Physical inactivity is a major health issue in Saudi Arabia (SA). Being physically active can improve overall health and prevent the risk of noncommunicable diseases and their consequences. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of primary health care physicians in SA toward physical activity (PA) and identify the correlates of PA counseling provided by physicians. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four main cities of Eastern Province, SA (Al-Khobar, Dammam, Qatif, and Safwa). A total of 147 physicians (44%) filled out self-reported surveys that were used in the assessment of the aims. Results Overall, 59.9% of the physicians believed that PA promotion to patients was their responsibility, and 53.7% of the physicians felt confident in their ability to provide PA counseling. However, the physicians indicated that lack of time, inadequate referral services for PA, and inadequate training in PA counseling are barriers to providing PA counseling to their patients. Only 5.4% of the physicians had excellent knowledge about PA recommendations. Female physicians were more likely to promote PA than male physicians (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.10–12.58; P = .03) and more likely to assess PA in pediatric patients (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.03–6.61; P = .04). Compared to other specialties, family physicians were more likely to provide general PA counseling to patients without chronic diseases (OR, 8.86; 95% CI, 1.86–42.13; P = .006). Physicians who saw fewer adult patients were more likely to systematically track/follow-up on the PA of patients (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14–8.58; P = .03) and to promote PA to pediatric patients (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.37–6.00; P = .005). Conclusions Training medical staff in PA counseling and strengthening the health care workforce and infrastructure can help physicians improve their counseling practice."
https://openalex.org/W2963219656,"The aim of this work is to provide a methodology to model the dielectric properties of human tissues based on phantoms prepared with an aqueous solution, in a semi-solid form, by using off-the-shelf components. Polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C) has been employed as a novel gelling agent in the fabrication of phantoms for microwave applications in a wide frequency range, from 500 MHz to 20 GHz. Agar-based and deionized water phantoms have also been manufactured for comparison purposes. Mathematical models dependent on frequency and sucrose concentration are proposed to obtain the complex permittivity of the desired mimicked tissues. These models have been validated in the referred bandwidth showing a good agreement to experimental data for different sucrose concentrations. The PVA-C model provides a great performance as compared to agar, increasing the shelf-life of the phantoms and improving their consistency for contact-required devices. In addition, the feasibility of fabricating a multilayer phantom has been demonstrated with a two-layer phantom that exhibits a clear interface between each layer and its properties. Thus, the use of PVA-C extends the option for producing complex multilayer and multimodal phantoms."
https://openalex.org/W2964063837,"Unusual radiological images may delay diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for an atypical radiological image in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.We retrospectively analyzed data from patients admitted to one hospital from January 2013 to December 2016 for sputum smear-positive lung tuberculosis who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) on admission. Patients whose sputum cultures were positive for general bacteria were excluded. Patient characteristics and laboratory data were compared between patients with cavity and those without and between patients with upper predominant lung involvement and those without.This study included 94 (93%) of 101 patients who underwent chest CT. The non-cavity group was older, had a greater number of females, had a lower C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and had a lower glomerular filtration rate. Multivariate analysis showed that a low CRP level (OR 0.808; 95% CI 0.674-0.967; p = 0.020) significantly predicted non-cavity pulmonary tuberculosis. The non-upper predominant lung involvement group was older and had a greater number of females, poorer performance status, a higher CRP level, and a lower serum albumin level. A poor performance status (OR 2.155; 95% CI 1.257-3.693; p = 0.005) was found to significantly predict pulmonary tuberculosis with non-upper predominant lung distributions.A low CRP level and poor performance status were associated with non-cavity and non-upper predominant lung distribution, respectively, in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis patients with these characteristics may present unusual chest images."
https://openalex.org/W2962434134,"Traditional search tasks have taught us much about vision and attention. Recently, several groups have begun to use multiple-target search to explore more complex and temporally extended ""foraging"" behaviour. Many of these new foraging tasks, however, maintain the simplified 2D displays and response demands associated with traditional, single-target visual search. In this respect, they may fail to capture important aspects of real-world search or foraging behaviour. In the current paper, we present a serious game for mobile platforms, developed in Unity3D, in which human participants play the role of an animal foraging for food in a simulated 3D environment. Game settings can be adjusted, so that, for example, custom target and distractor items can be uploaded, and task parameters, such as the number of target categories or target/distractor ratio are all easy to modify. We are also making the Unity3D project available, so that further modifications can also be made. We demonstrate how the app can be used to address specific research questions by conducting two human foraging experiments. Our results indicate that in this 3D environment, a standard feature/conjunction manipulation does not lead to a reduction in foraging runs, as it is known to do in simple, 2D foraging tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2962995457,"All-ceramic restoration has become a popular technology for dental restoration; however, the relative bond strength between the ceramic and resin limits its further application. Long-term high bond strength, especially after thermal cycling, is of great importance for effective restoration. The effect of physical and/or chemical surface treatments on bonding durability is seldom reported. To overcome this problem, we investigate the bond strength between lithium disilicate ceramics (LDC) and two kinds of resin cements before and after thermal cycling for a variety of surface treatments including hydrofluoric acid, two kinds of silane and a combined effect. The shear bond strength in every group is characterized by universal mechanical testing machine averaged by sixteen-time measurements. The results show that when treated with HF and a mixed silane, the LDC surface shows maximum bonding strengths of 27.1 MPa and 23.3 MPa with two different resin cements after 5000 thermal cycling, respectively, indicating an excellent ability to resist the damage induced by cyclic expansion and contraction. This long-term high bond strength is attributed to the combined effect of micromechanical interlocking (physical bonding) and the formation of Si-O-Si and -C-C- at the interface (chemical bonding). This result offers great potential for enhancing bond strength for all-ceramic restoration by optimizing the surface treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2963175678,"Understanding how increases in water temperature may affect winter dormancy period duration and overwinter survival are important for the effective conservation and management of estuarine species in the face of a warming climate. In this study, we determined the length of the overwintering period and the probability of overwinter survival of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), an ecologically and economically important estuarine crustacean. Overwintering period length and probability of overwinter survival were determined using projected water temperatures up to the year 2100, derived from a harmonic model that utilized air temperatures from multi-model ensemble of regional-scale climate projections. Our estimates of warming water temperatures by 2100 in Chesapeake Bay indicate that winters will be up to 50% shorter and overwinter survival will increase by at least 20% compared to current conditions. The warmer conditions will lead to faster and prolonged seasonal growth, which, when combined with lower winter mortality, will lead to increased population productivity. The level of expression of this increased productivity will depend on the response of other elements of the Chesapeake Bay food web, as well as possible changes to fishery management policies over the same time period."
https://openalex.org/W2963869843,"Severe-febrile-illness (SFI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The burden of SFI in SSA is currently unknown and its estimation is fraught with challenges. This is due to a lack of diagnostic capacity for SFI in SSA, and thus a dearth of baseline data on the underlying etiology of SFI cases and scant SFI-specific causative-agent prevalence data. To highlight the public health significance of SFI in SSA, we developed a Bayesian model to quantify the incidence of SFI hospital admissions in SSA. Our estimates indicate a mean population-weighted SFI-inpatient-admission incidence rate of 18.4 (6.8-31.1, 68% CrI) per 1000 people for the year 2014, across all ages within areas of SSA with stable Plasmodium falciparum transmission. We further estimated a total of 16,200,337 (5,993,249-27,321,779, 68% CrI) SFI hospital admissions. This analysis reveals the significant burden of SFI in hospitals in SSA, but also highlights the paucity of pathogen-specific prevalence and incidence data for SFI in SSA. Future improvements in pathogen-specific diagnostics for causative agents of SFI will increase the abundance of SFI-specific prevalence and incidence data, aid future estimations of SFI burden, and enable clinicians to identify SFI-specific pathogens, administer appropriate treatment and management, and facilitate appropriate antibiotic use."
https://openalex.org/W2963404214,"Background Loss to follow-up (LTFU) is a term used to classify patients no longer being seen in a clinical care program, including HIV treatment programs. It is unclear if these patients have transferred their care services elsewhere, died, or if there are other reasons for their LTFU. To better understand the status of patients meeting the criteria of LTFU, we traced a sample of HIV-infected patients that were LTFU from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) antiretroviral program. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected adult patients who enrolled for care between 2010 and 2014 at LUTH and were considered LTFU. Patients with locator information were traced using phone calls. Face-to-face interviews were used to collect data from successfully traced and consenting participants. Predictors of LTFU from LUTH, disengagement from care and willingness to re-engage in care in LUTH were assessed. Results Of 6108 registered patients, 3397 (56%) were LTFU and being unmarried was a predictor of being LTFU from LUTH. Of 425 patients that were traced, 355 (84%) were alive and 70 (16%) were dead. Two hundred and sixty-eight patients consented to interviews; 96 (35.8%) of these had transferred to another clinic for care while 172 (64.2%) were disengaged from care. More than half (149/268; 55.6%) were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some of the primary reasons for LTFU were; long distance to clinic (56%) and feeling healthy (6.7%). Predictor of disengagement from care within the interviewed cohort was not having started ART. The predictors of willingness to re-engage in care included, not having started ART, male sex and longer duration in HIV care prior to LTFU. Conclusion Most of the interviewed cohort that was LTFU were truly disengaged from care and not on ART. Interventions are required to address processes of re-engagement of patients that are LTFU."
https://openalex.org/W2964049947,"The 3D multi-cellular tumoroid (MCT) model is an in vivo-like, avascular tumor model that has received much attention as a refined screening platform for drug therapies. Several types of research have been efforted to improve the physiological characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of the in vivo-like MCTs. Size-controlled MCTs have received much attention for obtaining highly reproducible results in drug screening assays and achieving a homogeneous and meaningful level of biological activities. Here, we describe an effective method for fabricating the size-controlled in vivo-like MCTs using a cell-loss-free (CLF) microwell arrays. The CLF microwell arrays was fabricated by using the simple operation of laser carving of a poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) master mold. We also demonstrated the biophysicochemical effect of tumor microenvironment (TME) resident fibroblasts through the expression of TGFβ, αSMA, Type I-, IV collagen, angiogenesis related markers on tumorigenesis, and confirmed the drug response of MCTs with anti-cancer agents. This technology for the fabrication of CLF microwell arrays could be used as an effective method to produce an in vitro tumor model for cancer research and drug discovery."

Repeated stress exposure might influence the learning process in simulation as well as real-life.1) To record heart rate and heart rate variability evolution during one-day simulation over one year; 2) To analyze the effect of repetitive high-fidelity simulations on the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.Single-center, investigator-initiated RCT. 48 participants were randomized in 12 multidisciplinary teams of French Emergency Medical Services to manage infant shock in high-fidelity simulations. In the experimental group, 6 multidisciplinary teams were exposed to 9 different simulation sessions over 1 year. In the control group, 6 multidisciplinary teams participated in only 3 simulation sessions, in common with those of the experimental group (initial, intermediate after 6 months, and finally after 1 year). Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were analyzed on a 24-hour Holter from the day prior to simulation until the end of simulation. Questionnaires of Impact of Event Scale-Revised at 7 days and Post-traumatic Check-List Scale at 1 month were used to detect possible post-traumatic stress disorder in participants. p<0.05 was considered significant.Stress increased during each simulation in the two groups. After analysis on the 24-hour period, there was no significant difference between the two groups during the initial simulation session in terms of heart rate and heart rate variability. In the 24-hour period of the intermediate and final simulation sessions, the level of stress was higher in the control group during the diurnal (p = 0.04) and nocturnal periods (p = 0.01). No participant developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the 72 simulation sessions.Despite the stress generated by simulation, the more the sessions were repeated, the less were their repercussions on the daily lives of participants, reflected by a lower sympathetic activity. Moreover, repetition of simulations did not lead to post-traumatic stress disorder.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02424890."
https://openalex.org/W2963115373,"The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between several parameters of neuromuscular performance with dynamic postural control using a Bayesian Network Classifiers (BN) based analysis.The y-balance test (measure of dynamic postural control), isokinetic (concentric and eccentric) knee flexion and extension strength, isometric hip abduction and adduction strength, lower extremity joint range of motion (ROM) and core stability were assessed in 44 elite male futsal players. A feature selection process was carried out before building a BN (using the Tabu search algorithm) for each leg. The BN models built were used to make belief updating processes to study the individual and concurrent contributions of the selected parameters of neuromuscular performance on dynamic postural control.The BNs generated using the selected features by the algorithms correlation attribute evaluator and chi squared reported the highest evaluation criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) for the dominant (AUC = 0.899) and non-dominant (AUC = 0.879) legs, respectively.The BNs demonstrated that performance achieved in the y-balance test appears to be widely influenced by hip and knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion ROM measures in the sagittal plane, as well as by measures of static but mainly dynamic core stability in the frontal plane. Therefore, training interventions aimed at improving or maintaining dynamic postural control in elite male futsal players should include, among other things, exercises that produce ROM scores equal or higher than 127° of hip flexion, 132.5° of knee flexion as well as 34° and 30.5° of ankle dorsiflexion with the knee flexed and extended, respectively. Likewise, these training interventions should also include exercises to maintain or improve both the static and dynamic (medial-lateral plane) core stability so that futsal players can achieve medial radial error values lower than 6.69 and 8.79 mm, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2963930604,"Loss of natural wetlands is a global phenomenon that has severe consequences for waterbird populations and their associated ecosystem services. Although agroecosystems can reduce the impact of natural habitat loss, drivers of use of such artificial habitats by waterbirds remain poorly understood. Using the cosmopolitan northern pintail Anas acuta as a model species, we monitored home-range and fine-scale resource selection across the agricultural landscape. Individuals were tracked using GPS-GSM transmitters, and a suite of environmental and landscape features were measured throughout the winter seasons. Spatial patterns of habitat use were analysed using generalized linear mixed effect models by integrating field-observations with GPS telemetry. All birds used rice fields as foraging grounds at night and commuted to an adjacent reservoir to roost during daylight. Home-ranges and maximum foraging distances of nocturnally foraging birds increased with decreasing availability of flooded fields, and were positively correlated with moonlight levels. Birds selected flooded rice paddies (water depth range: 9-21 cm) with standing stubble and substrate with pebbles smaller than 0.5 cm in diameter. Density of rice seeds, rice paddy size, and other environmental and landscape features did not emerge as significant predictors. Our findings indicate that nocturnal foraging of northern pintails within rice fields is driven primarily by straw manipulation, water level and substrate pebble size. Thus, the presence of standing stubble in flooded paddies with soft bottoms should be prioritized to improve foraging areas for dabbling ducks. These management procedures in themselves would not increase economic costs or affect rice production and could be applied for dabbling-duck conservation throughout the world."
https://openalex.org/W2964064657,"Cassava improvement using traditional breeding strategies is slow due to the species’ long breeding cycle. However, the use of genomic selection can lead to a shorter breeding cycle. This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters for productive traits based on pedigree (pedigree and phenotypic information) and genomic (markers and phenotypic information) analyses using biparental crosses at different stages of selection. A total of 290 clones were genotyped and phenotyped for fresh root yield (FRY), dry matter content (DMC), dry yield (DY), fresh shoot yield (FSY) and harvest index (HI). The clones were evaluated in clonal evaluation trials (CET), preliminary yield trials (PYT), advanced yield trials (AYT) and uniform yield trials (UYT), from 2013 to 2018 in ten locations. The breeding stages were analyzed as follows: one stage (CET), two stages (CET and PYT), three stages (CET, PYT and AYT) and four stages (CET, PYT, AYT and UYT). The genomic predictions were analyzed via k-fold cross-validation based on the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) considering a model with genetic additive effects and genotype × location interactions. Genomic and pedigree accuracies were moderate to high (0.56–0.72 and 0.62–0.78, respectively) for important starch-related traits such as DY and FRY; when considering one breeding stage (CET) with the aim of early selection, the genomic accuracies ranged from 0.60 (DMC) to 0.71 (HI). Moreover, the correlations between the genomic estimation breeding values of one-stage genomic analysis and the estimated breeding values of the four-stage (full data set) pedigree analysis were high for all traits as well as for a selection index including all traits. The results indicate great possibilities for genomic selection in cassava, especially for selection early in the breeding cycle (saving time and effort)."
https://openalex.org/W2964135730,"Lectins are a group of ubiquitous proteins which specifically recognize and reversibly bind sugar moieties of glycoprotein and glycolipid constituents on cell surfaces. The mutagenesis approach is often employed to characterize lectin binding properties. As lectins are not enzymes, it is not easy to perform a rapid specificity screening of mutants using chromogenic substrates. It is necessary to use different binding assays such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), microscale thermophoresis (MST), enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLA), or glycan arrays for their characterization. These methods often require fluorescently labeled proteins (MST), highly purified proteins (SPR) or high protein concentrations (ITC). Mutant proteins may often exhibit problematic behaviour, such as poor solubility or low stability. Lectin-based cell agglutination is a simple and low-cost technique which can overcome most of these problems. In this work, a modified method of the agglutination of human erythrocytes and yeast cells with microscopy detection was successfully used for a specificity study of the newly prepared mutant lectin RS-IIL_A22S, which experimentally completed studies on sugar preferences of lectins in the PA-IIL family. Results showed that the sensitivity of this method is comparable with ITC, is able to determine subtle differences in lectin specificity, and works directly in cell lysates. The agglutination method with microscopy detection was validated by comparison of the results with results obtained by agglutination assay in standard 96-well microtiter plate format. In contrast to this assay, the microscopic method can clearly distinguish between hemagglutination and hemolysis. Therefore, this method is suitable for examination of lectins with known hemolytic activity as well as mutant or uncharacterized lectins, which could damage red blood cells. This is due to the experimental arrangement, which includes very short sample incubation time in combination with microscopic detection of agglutinates, that are easily observed by a small portable microscope."
https://openalex.org/W2962923528,"The complex three-way interaction between airflow, tissue, and sound, for asymmetric vocal fold vibration, is not well understood. Current modeling efforts are not able to explain clinical observations where drastic differences in sound production are often observed, with no noticeable differences in the vocal fold kinematics. To advance this understanding, an acoustical model for voiced sound generation in the presence of asymmetric intraglottal flows is developed. The source model operates in conjunction with a wave reflection analog propagation scheme and an asymmetric flow description within the glottis. To enable comparison with prior work, the source model is evaluated using a well-studied two-mass vocal fold model. The proposed source model is evaluated through acoustic measures of interest, including radiated sound pressure level, maximum flow declination rate, and spectral tilt, and also via its effects on the vocal fold dynamics. The influence of the model, in comparison to the standard symmetric Bernoulli flow description, results in an increased transfer of energy from the fluid to the vocal folds, increased radiated sound pressure level and maximum flow declination rate, and decreased spectral tilt. These differences are most pronounced for asymmetric vocal fold configurations that mimic unilateral paresis and paralysis, where minor kinematic changes can result in significant acoustic and aerodynamic differences. The results illustrate that fluid effects arising from asymmetric glottal flow can play an important role in the acoustics of pathological voiced speech."

Humans can host the parasite for years without presenting significant symptoms, turning its diagnosis and control into a difficult task. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of recombinant proteins of P. malariae MSP1.Five regions of PmMSP1 were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-fusion proteins and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity, subtyping, and affinity of raised antibodies were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cellular immune responses were analyzed by lymphoproliferation assays and cytokine levels produced by splenocytes were detected by cytometry.We found that N-terminal, central regions, and PmMSP119 are strongly immunogenic in mice. After three doses, the induced immune responses remained high for 70 days. While antibodies induced after immunization with N-terminal and central regions showed similar affinities to the target antigens, affinities of IgG against PmMSP119 were higher. All proteins induced similar antibody subclass patterns (predominantly IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b), characterizing a mixed Th1/Th2 response. Further, autologous stimulation of splenocytes from immunized mice led to the secretion of IL2 and IL4, independently of the antigen used. Importantly, IgG from P. malariae-exposed individuals reacted against PmMSP1 recombinant proteins with a high specificity. On the other hand, sera from P. vivax or P. falciparum-infected individuals did not react at all against recombinant PmMSP1 proteins.Recombinant PmMSP1 proteins are very useful diagnostic markers of P. malariae in epidemiological studies or in the differential diagnosis of malaria caused by this species. Immunization with recombinant PmMSP1 proteins resulted in a significant humoral immune response, which may turn them potential component candidates for a vaccine against P. malariae."

We used phylogenetic analysis to identify P. fijiensis homologs (PKS8-4 and Hybrid8-3) to the PKS4 polyketide synthases (PKS) from Neurospora crassa and Sordaria macrospora involved in sexual reproduction. These sequences also formed a clade with lovastatin, compactin, and betaenone-producing PKS sequences. Transcriptome analysis showed that both the P. fijiensis Hybrid8-3 and PKS8-4 genes have higher expression in infected leaf tissue compared to in culture. Domain analysis showed that PKS8-4 is more similar than Hybrid8-3 to PKS4. pPKS8-4:GFP transcriptional fusion transformants showed expression of GFP in flask-shaped structures in mycelial cultures as well as in crosses between compatible and incompatible mating types. Confocal microscopy confirmed expression in spermagonia in leaf substomatal cavities, consistent with a role in sexual reproduction. A disruption mutant of pks8-4 retained normal pathogenicity on banana, and no differences were observed in growth, conidial production, and spermagonia production. GC-MS profiling of the mutant and wild type did not identify differences in polyketide metabolites, but did identify changes in saturated fatty acid methyl esters and alkene and alkane derivatives. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a polyketide synthase pathway associated with spermagonia."

Thirty cities have been designated as experimental sites to serve as models for future sponge city construction, as more than 80% of the built-up urban areas in China must reach the standards of sponge cities by 2030. Greening plants play an important role in sponge cities, and water-use efficiency (WUE) is a vital index to determine whether plants could adapt to and grow healthily in environments with water deficits. In this study, WUE of greening plants was quantified by measuring the stable carbon isotope fractionation. Suitable plants for the green spaces in Guyuan sponge city, in northern China, were selected based on their WUE, and the main factors affecting WUE were studied in four habitats within the city. Plant species identity had the greatest effect on WUE, while habitat and plant life form had lower effect, illustrating that WUE is a relatively stable and reliable index for the classification of plant species. We can improve the WUE and ecological function of green spaces in sponge cities by using isotope technology to select suitable plant species with high WUE. To our knowledge, this study is the first to select plant species for sponge city by using this method, providing a quick and scientific method for the selection of greening plants for future sponge cities."

This study aimed to investigate whether this O2 extraction reserve was present in various populations and whether it exhibited sex- and/or training- related differences.Sixteen men- 8 untrained (27±5 years; 83±11 kg; 179±9 cm), 8 trained (27±4 years; 82±10 kg; 182±8 cm) and 9 trained women (27±2 years; 66±10 kg; 172±6 cm) performed a RI cycling test to exhaustion. The NIRS-derived deoxy[Hb+Mb] signal was measured continuously on the VL as a proxy for O2 extraction. A leg blood flow occlusion (i.e., ischemia) was performed at rest (LBFOCC 1) and immediately post the RI test (LBFOCC 2).No significant difference was found between the deoxy[Hb+Mb] amplitude during LBFOCC 1 and the deoxy[Hb+Mb]PLATEAU (p>0.05) nor between baseline (bsln) deoxy[Hb+Mb] values. deoxy[Hb+Mb] amplitude during LBFOCC 2 was significantly greater than LBFOCC 1 and at deoxy[Hb+Mb]PLATEAU (p<0.05) with group means ~30–45% higher than the deoxy[Hb+Mb]PLATEAU and LBFOCC 1 (p<0.05). No significant differences were found between groups in O2 extraction reserve, regardless of sex- or training-statusThe results of this study demonstrated the existence of an O2 extraction reserve in different populations, and that neither sex- nor training-related differences affect the amplitude of the reserve."

Methods We conducted a nationwide follow-up study using routinely collected data for adult PLHIV diagnosed on or before 31 December 2011 and alive and in care as of 1 January 2008. Participants were observed from 1 January 2008 (study start) to 30 June 2012 (study end). Main outcome measures were gender-stratified age-standardized incidence rates for China (ASIRC) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for all malignancy types/sites observed. Results Among 399,451 subjects, a majority was aged 30–44 years (49.3%), male (69.8%), and Han Chinese (67.9%). A total of 3,819 reports of cancer were identified. Overall, ASIRC was 776.4 per 100,000 for males and 486.5 per 100,000 for females. Malignancy sites/types with highest ASIRC among males were lung (226.0 per 100,000), liver (145.7 per 100,000), and lymphoma (63.1 per 100,000), and among females were lung (66.8 per 100,000), lymphoma (48.0 per 100,000), stomach (47.8 per 100,000), and cervix (47.6 per 100,000). Overall SIR for males was 3.4 and for females was 2.6. Highest SIR was observed for Kaposi sarcoma (2,639.8 for males, 1,593.5 for females) and lymphoma (13.9 for males, 16.0 for females). Conclusions These results provide evidence of substantial AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancer burden among adult Chinese PLHIV between 2008 and 2011. Although further study is warranted, China should take action to improve cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment for this vulnerable population."

The relationship is remarkably linear across the entire distribution for both the total difficulties score and subscale scores of the SDQ; higher scores on the SDQ (more problems) are related to worse performance in academic tests. We assess the similarity across respondent type; parent (child age 7 and 11), teacher (child age 11) and self-reported scores (child age 11), and find that teacher and parent reported scores have very similar slopes in the SDQ-test score relationship, while the child reported SDQ in relation to the academic test performance has a flatter slope."

We examined if the assumed effect of gazing rituals on attractiveness ratings exists and if it is associated with dissociation. In an experiment, we asked N = 65 non-clinical females to focus on the nose of a photographed face at pre- and post-test. In between, participants gazed at the nose of either the same (relevant gazing) or another face (irrelevant gazing). We found increasing dissociation after gazing in both conditions and a differentially stronger decrease of attractiveness ratings in the relevant gazing condition. Our findings support the hypothesized effect of gazing rituals on attractiveness evaluation in cognitive-behavioral models for BDD."
https://openalex.org/W2963445134,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential hormones for plant growth and development. Enzymes DET2 and CYP90 family are responsible for BR biosynthesis in seed plants. Yet, their roles in non-seed plants are unknown. Here, we report the first functional study of DET2 and all 4 CYP90 genes isolated from Selaginella moellendorfii. Sm89026 (SmCPD) belonged to a clade with CYP90A1 (CPD) and CYP90B1 (DWF4) while Sm182839, Sm233379 and Sm157387 formed a distinct clade with CYP90C1 (ROT3) and CYP90D1. SmDET2, SmCPD and Sm157387 were highly expressed in both leaves and strobili while Sm233379 was only highly expressed in the leaves but not strobili, implying their differential functions in a tissue-specific manner in S. moellendorfii. We showed that only SmDET2 and SmCPD completely rescued Arabidopsis det2 and cpd mutant phenotypes, respectively, suggestive of their conserved BR biosynthetic functions. However, neither SmCPD nor other CYP90 genes rescued any other cyp90 mutants. Yet overexpression of Sm233379 altered plant fertility and BR response, which means that Sm233379 is not an ortholog of any CYP90 genes in Arabidopsis but appears to have a BR function in the S. moellendorfii leaves. This function is likely turned off during the development of the strobili. Our results suggest a dramatic functional divergence of CYP90 family in the non-seed plants. While some of them are functionally similar to that of seed plants, the others may be functionally distinct from that of seed plants, shedding light for future exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2964005688,"The extraversion personality trait has a positive correlation with social interaction. In neuroimaging studies, investigations on extraversion in face-to-face verbal interactions are still scarce. This study presents an electroencephalography (EEG)-based investigation of the extraversion personality trait in relation to eye contact during face-to-face interactions, as this is a vital signal in social interactions. A sample of healthy male participants were selected (consisting of sixteen more extraverted and sixteen less extraverted individuals) and evaluated with the Eysenck's Personality Inventory (EPI) and Big Five Inventory (BFI) tools. EEG alpha oscillations in the occipital region were measured to investigate extraversion personality trait correlates of eye contact during a face-to-face interaction task and an eyes-open condition. The results revealed that the extraversion personality trait has a significant positive correlation with EEG alpha coherence in the occipital region, presumably due to its relationship with eye contact during the interaction task. Furthermore, the decrease in EEG alpha power during the interaction task compared to the eyes-open condition was found to be greater in the less extraverted participants; however, no significant difference was observed between the less and more extraverted participants. Overall, these findings encourage further research towards the understanding of neural mechanism correlates of the extraversion personality trait—particularly in social interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2962759412,"Mammals have two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. While rods are exceptionally sensitive and mediate vision at very low illumination levels, cones operate in daylight and are responsible for the bulk of visual perception in most diurnal animals, including humans. Yet the mechanisms of phototransduction in cones is understudied, largely due to unavailability of pure cone outer segment (COS) preparations. Here we present a novel mathematical model of cone phototransduction that explicitly takes into account complex cone geometry and its multiple physical scales, faithfully reproduces features of the cone response, and is orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard 3D diffusion model. This is accomplished through the mathematical techniques of homogenization and concentrated capacity. The homogenized model is then computationally implemented by finite element method. This homogenized model permits one to analyze the effects of COS geometry on visual transduction and lends itself to performing large numbers of numerical trials, as required for parameter analysis and the stochasticity of rod and cone signal transduction. Agreement between the nonhomogenized, (i.e., standard 3D), and homogenized diffusion models is reported along with their simulation times and memory costs. Virtual expression of rod biochemistry on cone morphology is also presented for understanding some of the characteristic differences between rods and cones. These simulations evidence that 3D cone morphology and ion channel localization contribute to biphasic flash response, i.e undershoot. The 3D nonhomogenized and homogenized models are contrasted with more traditional and coarser well-stirred and 1D longitudinal diffusion models. The latter are single-scale and do not explicitly account for the multi-scale geometry of the COS, unlike the 3D homogenized model. We show that simpler models exaggerate the magnitude of the current suppression, yield accelerated time to peak, and do not predict the local concentration of cGMP at the ionic channels."
https://openalex.org/W2963037632,"Hospital performance is often measured using self-reported statistics, such as the incidence of hospital-transmitted micro-organisms or those exhibiting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), encouraging hospitals with high levels to improve their performance. However, hospitals that increase screening efforts will appear to have a higher incidence and perform poorly, undermining comparison between hospitals and disincentivising testing, thus hampering infection control. We propose a surveillance system in which hospitals test patients previously discharged from other hospitals and report observed cases. Using English National Health Service (NHS) Hospital Episode Statistics data, we analysed patient movements across England and assessed the number of hospitals required to participate in such a reporting scheme to deliver robust estimates of incidence. With over 1.2 million admissions to English hospitals previously discharged from other hospitals annually, even when only a fraction of hospitals (41/155) participate (each screening at least 1000 of these admissions), the proposed surveillance system can estimate incidence across all hospitals. By reporting on other hospitals, the reporting of incidence is separated from the task of improving own performance. Therefore the incentives for increasing performance can be aligned to increase (rather than decrease) screening efforts, thus delivering both more comparable figures on the AMR problems across hospitals and improving infection control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2963567395,"As the location trajectory contains more spatial-temporal information about the user, it will be even dangerous for jeopardizing the privacy of the user. In order to cope with the correlation, an algorithm that utilizes the query division had been proposed. In this algorithm, random blocks of query context was used, so as the adversary was obfuscated and difficult to correlate the real result. However, this algorithm fails to dispose the size of each query block, as once same size blocks were obtained by the adversary continuously, so the adversary can regard them as blocks from the same query context, and then obtains the query context to correlate the discrete locations. In view of above conditions, in this paper we propose a fine granularity block division algorithm based on the conception of granularity measurement as well as granularity layer division, so with the help of collaborative users the location privacy of the user will be protected. In this algorithm, the query context will be divided into fine granularity size of information blocks that difficult to be distinguished with others, and then these blocks will be exchanged with other collaborative users to eliminate the difference in block size. In addition, as each block is divided into fine granularity size, the adversary will be difficult to correlate the discrete locations into location trajectory, so the location privacy will be protected. At last, through security analysis and experimental verification, this granularity indistinguishable algorithm is analyzed and verified at both theoretical and practical levels, which further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other similar algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2964036635,"Microbial surface properties are important for interactions with the environment in which cells reside. Surface properties of lactic acid bacteria significantly vary and some strains can form strong emulsions when mixed with a hydrocarbon. Lactococcus lactis NCDO712 forms oil-in-water emulsions upon mixing of a cell suspension with petroleum. In the emulsion the bacteria locate at the oil-water interphase which is consistent with Pickering stabilization. Cells of strain NCDO712 mixed with sunflower seed oil did not stabilize the oil droplets. This study shows that the addition of either ethanol or ammonium sulfate led to cell aggregation, which subsequently allowed stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. From this, we conclude that bacterial cell aggregation is important for emulsion droplet stabilization. To determine how bacterial emulsification influences the microbial transcriptome RNAseq analysis was performed on lactococci taken from the oil-water interphase. In comparison to cells in suspension 72 genes were significantly differentially expressed with a more than 4-fold difference. The majority of these genes encode proteins involved in transport processes and the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and ions. Especially the proportion of genes belonging to the CodY regulon was high. Our results also point out that in a complex environment such as food fermentations a heterogeneous response of microbes might be caused by microbe-matrix interactions. In addition, microdroplet technologies are increasingly used in research. The understanding of interactions between bacterial cells and oil-water interphases is of importance for conducting and interpreting such experiments."
https://openalex.org/W4256395024,"Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the voice for communicating sonic ideas, and the accuracy with which it can be used to imitate acoustic instruments, synthesised sounds and environmental sounds. However, there has been little research on vocal imitation of percussion sounds, particularly concerning the perceptual similarity between imitations and the sounds being imitated. In the present study we address this by investigating how accurately musicians can vocally imitate percussion sounds, in terms of whether listeners consider the imitations ‘more similar’ to the imitated sounds than to other same–category sounds. In a vocal production task, 14 musicians imitated 30 drum sounds from five categories (cymbals, hats, kicks, snares, toms). Listeners were then asked to rate the similarity between the imitations and same–category drum sounds via web based listening test. We found that imitated sounds received the highest similarity ratings for 16 of the 30 sounds. The similarity between a given drum sound and its imitation was generally rated higher than for imitations of another same–category sound, however for some drum categories (snares and toms) certain sounds were consistently considered most similar to the imitations, irrespective of the sound being imitated. Finally, we apply an existing auditory image based measure for perceptual similarity between same–category drum sounds, to model the similarity ratings using linear mixed effect regression. The results indicate that this measure is a good predictor of perceptual similarity between imitations and imitated sounds, when compared to acoustic features containing only temporal or spectral features."
https://openalex.org/W2963646200,"To compare costs and efficacy of reflex and recall prenatal DNA screening for trisomy 21, 18 and 13 (affected pregnancies). In both methods women have Combined test markers measured. With recall screening, women with a high Combined test risk are recalled for counselling and offered a DNA blood test or invasive diagnostic testing. With reflex screening, a DNA analysis is automatically performed on plasma collected when blood was collected for measurement of the Combined test markers.Published data were used to estimate, for each method, using various unit costs and risk cut-offs, the cost per woman screened, cost per affected pregnancy diagnosed, and for a given number of women screened, numbers of affected pregnancies diagnosed, unaffected pregnancies with positive results, and women with unaffected pregnancies having invasive diagnostic testing.Cost per woman screened is lower with reflex v recall screening: £37 v £38, and £11,043 v £11,178 per affected pregnancy diagnosed (DNA £250, Combined test markers risk cut-off 1 in 150). Reflex screening results in similar numbers of affected pregnancies diagnosed, with 100-fold fewer false-positives and 20-fold fewer women with unaffected pregnancies having invasive diagnostic testing.Reflex DNA screening is less expensive, more cost-effective, and safer than recall screening."
