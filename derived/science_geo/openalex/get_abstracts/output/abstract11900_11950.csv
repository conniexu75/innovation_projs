https://openalex.org/W1576056823,"A vaccinia virus-specified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase was isolated from the cytoplasm of infected HeLa cells. The enzyme appeared in cells only after infection; it differed in its chromatographic properties from all cellular RNA polymerases; and its subunit composition (seven subunits ranging in size from 13,500 to 135,000 daltons) was completely different from that of HeLa cell RNA polymerases I and II. The latter two enzymes were also isolated and their subunit compositions were found to resemble closely those of mouse plasmacytoma MOPC 315 RNA polymerases I and II. The three largest subunits of the isolated vaccinia virus-specified RNA polymerase migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels at the same rate as virion core polypeptides VP1c, VP1d, and VP2c; the enzyme may therefore be the same as the vaccinia virus core-associated RNA polymerase. The purified enzyme was free of detectable exonuclease and poly(A) polymerase activity. It was maximally stimulated by 0.08 M KCl and 0.001 M MN/sup 2 +/; Mg/sup 2 +/ could not substitute for MN/sup 2 +/ to a significant degree. The enzyme was very resistant to ..cap alpha..-amanitin. It was 10 times more active with denatured calf thymus or vaccinia virus DNA as template than with the corresponding nativemore » DNAs, but transcribed the synthetic double-stranded poly(d(A-T)) almost as rapidly as single-stranded natural DNA. It transcribed all sequences of native vaccinia virus DNA.« less"

https://openalex.org/W1984662056,"STIMULUS-secretion coupling in pancreatic acinar cells is believed to be mediated by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ activity1–5. Based on the observation that physiological secretagogues trigger a rapid increase of Ca2+ efflux3,4 and stimulate enzyme release even in the absence of extracellular calcium2,4,5, it has been proposed that stimulus–secretion coupling involves a redistribution of intracellular calcium3,5,6. Since most calcium in pancreatic acinar cells is bound to membranes or is sequestered in mitochondria7, we have attempted to monitor these calcium stores during secretion by using the fluorescent probe chlorotetracycline (CTC). This probe forms highly fluorescent complexes with Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the presence of biological membranes or detergent miceles8,9 and has been successfully used in isolated mitochondria10,11 and sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles12 to monitor calcium movements induced by substrates and inhibitors. In this report, we show that fluorescence of CTC associated with pancreatic acinar cell membranes decreases rapidly on stimulation of enzyme secretion and that this intensity change is preferential for CTC complexed to calcium."

https://openalex.org/W2062438387,"RECENT years have witnessed an increasing interest in applications of low temperature techniques to studies of enzyme-catalysed reactions, the aims being the temporal resolution of the contributing reactions and the stabilisation of intermediate species. To overcome the low temperature limit set by the freezing point of the aqueous medium mixtures of water and various polar organic solvents have been used1–4. Although these aqueous mixtures affect the solvation interactions of the enzyme and its conformational stability5, they can be shown to influence neither substrate specificity, nor the reaction pathway. We have investigated the feasibility of supercooled water to achieve conditions closer to the physiological ones. To circumvent freezing by heterogeneous nucleation, the aqueous phase containing enzyme, substrate and buffers was emulsified in an oil which was supersaturated with a water insoluble surfactant6. We here present the results on bacterial cytochrome P450, a mono-oxygenase which has already been studied in mixed solvents1,2"
