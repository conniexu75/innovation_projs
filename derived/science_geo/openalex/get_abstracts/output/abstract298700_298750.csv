https://openalex.org/W2050809698,"How strong is the case linking global release of chlorofluorocarbons to episodic disappearance of ozone from the Antarctic stratosphere each austral spring? Three lines of evidence defining a link are (i) observed containment in the vortex of ClO concentrations two orders of magnitude greater than normal levels; (ii) in situ observations obtained during ten high-altitude aircraft flights into the vortex as the ozone hole was forming that show a decrease in ozone concentrations as ClO concentrations increased; and (iii) a comparison between observed ozone loss rates and those predicted with the use of absolute concentrations of ClO and BrO, the rate-limiting radicals in an array of proposed catalytic cycles. Recent advances in our understanding of the kinetics, photochemistry, and structural details of key intermediates in these catalytic cycles as well as an improved absolute calibration for ClO and BrO concentrations at the temperatures and pressures encountered in the lower antarctic stratosphere have been essential for defining the link."
https://openalex.org/W1984527430,"Dramatic springtime depletions of ozone in polar regions require that polar stratospheric air has a high degree of dynamical isolation and extremely cold temperatures necessary for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. Both of these conditions are produced within the stratospheric winter polar vortex. Recent aircraft missions have provided new information about the structure of polar vortices during winter and their relation to polar ozone depletions. The aircraft data show that gradients of potential vorticity and the concentration of conservative trace species are large at the transition from mid-latitude to polar air. The presence of such sharp gradients at the boundary of polar air implies that the inward mixing of heat and constituents is strongly inhibited and that the perturbed polar stratospheric chemistry associated with the ozone hole is isolated from the rest of the stratosphere until the vortex breaks up in late spring. The overall size of the polar vortex thus limits the maximum areal coverage of the annual polar ozone depletions. Because it appears that this limit has not been reached for the Antarctic depletions, the possibility of future increases in the size of the Antarctic ozone hole is left open. In the Northern Hemisphere, the smaller vortex and the more restricted region of cold temperatures suggest that this region has a smaller theoretical maximum for column ozone depletion, about 40 percent of the currently observed change in the Antarctic ozone column in spring."

https://openalex.org/W2172074944,"Three-dimensional numerical ocean circulation model experiments that were designed to evaluate the circulation characteristics for the mid-Cretaceous ( approximately 100 million years ago) show that the primary direction of flow through the Tethys Ocean was eastward; in contrast, a westward flowing circumglobal Tethys current has been a consistent feature of earlier reconstructions of Cretaceous ocean circulation. The model studies demonstrate that (i) ocean circulation is sufficiently sensitive to the role of continental positions, sea level, and climate to limit the application of modern analogs to past circulations, and (ii) reconstructions based on limited biogeographic data may not provide unique surface circulation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2001077046,"Transmission electron microscopy of experimentally deformed amphibolite suggests that submicroscopic intracrystalline tubes formed around linear defects may be a previously unrecognized kind of diffusion pathway. Deformed and compositionally altered plagioclase and amphibole crystals include moderate densities of linear defects that morphologically resemble unit dislocations but display unusual contrast. During prolonged electron irradiation, the core regions of the defects expand to well-defined tubes that are approximately 20 nanometers in diameter. Both observations suggest that the regions about the defect cores are glassy and were filled with silicate-water fluid during the experiments. Intracrystalline transport along these tubes would likely be several orders of magnitude faster than traditionally conceived processes of solid-state volume diffusion, grain-boundary solvent transfer, and ordinary pipe diffusion along dislocation cores."

https://openalex.org/W2081411197,"The cabinet in Ottowa will soon decide whether or not the government of Canada can afford its share of the $709 million costs for the construction of a new accelerator adjacent to the world's largest cyclotron in Vancover, British Columbia. The new accelerator has been dubbed KAON for the subatomic particles it will produce. The accelerator is to be a joint venture with Japan, Germany, and the U.S. who have already shelved similar proposals for KAON facilities in favor of a single facility at Vancover. The KAON factory would use the existing cyclotron accelerator at the Tri-University Meson Facility as a front end to five new accelerator and accumulator rings that will boost the energy of protons to 360GeV. This not particularly high energy will be compensated by the intensity of the beam, and many experiments that test the so-called Standard Model of particle physics will be carried out."
