https://openalex.org/W2045838737,"A liquid-solution-phase technique for preparing submicrometer-sized silicon single crystals is presented. The synthesis is based on the reduction of SiCl4 and RSiCl3 (R = H, octyl) by sodium metal in a nonpolar organic solvent at high temperatures (385°C) and high pressures (>100 atmospheres). For R = H, the synthesis produces hexagonal-shaped silicon single crystals ranging from 5 to 3000 nanometers in size. For R = octyl, the synthesis also produces hexagonal-shaped silicon single crystals; however, the size range is controlled to 5.5 ± 2.5 nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W2087878259,The Middle Pliocene ( approximately 3 million years ago) has been identified as the last time the Earth was significantly warmer than it was during the Last Interglacial and Holocene. A quantitative micropaleontological paleotemperature transect from equator to high latitudes in the North Atlantic indicates that Middle Pliocene warmth involved increased meridional oceanic heat transport.
https://openalex.org/W2085565714,An analysis of a two-dimensional tidal model of the Wadden Sea reveals Lagrangian chaos in the trajectories of water parcels. The associated chaotic stirring results from the transverse intersection of the stable and unstable curves of hyperbolic fixed points in the Lagrangian residual displacement field (the tidal Poincaré map). This tidal dispersion mechanism produces rapid water exchange along the channel axis and could be representative of many shallow tidal seas.

This situation should readily lead to the exclusion of one of the phases from any interface that favors the other. Such complete wetting behavior from a binary mixture of statistical olefinic copolymers is reported. By means of a self-regulating geometry, it is found that the thickness of a wetting layer of one of the phases at the polymer-air interface, growing from the other coexisting phase, attains macroscopic dimensions, increasing logarithmically with time. These results indicate that binary polymer mixtures could be attractive models for the study of wetting phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2078857004,"The unearthing of a complete skull and skeleton of the early dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis sheds light on the early evolution of dinosaurs. Discovered in the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina, the fossils show that Herrerasaurus, a primitive theropod, was an agile, bipedal predator with a short forelimb specialized for grasping and raking. The fossils clarify anatomical features of the common ancestor of all dinosaurs. Herrerasaurus and younger dinosaurs from Upper Triassic beds in Argentina suggest that the dinosaurian radiation was well under way before dinosaurs dominated terrestrial vertebrate communities in taxonomic diversity and abundance."

The formation and annihilation of these metastable structural surface excitations is associated with the shift in position of large numbers of germanium surface atoms along a specific row direction like beads on an abacus. The effect provides a mechanism for understanding the transport of atoms on a semiconductor surface."

The results indicate that various neutral isomers exist, some with electron affinities as low as 1 electron volt. The method of production plays an important role in the characteristics of carbon clusters."
