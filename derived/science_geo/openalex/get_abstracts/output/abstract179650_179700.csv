https://openalex.org/W2161548459,"The Period2 gene plays a key role in controlling circadian rhythm in mice. We report here that mice deficient in the mPer2 gene are cancer prone. After gamma radiation, these mice show a marked increase in tumor development and reduced apoptosis in thymocytes. The core circadian genes are induced by gamma radiation in wild-type mice but not in mPer2 mutant mice. Temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2, and Gadd45alpha, is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice. In particular, the transcription of c-myc is controlled directly by circadian regulators and is deregulated in the mPer2 mutant. Our studies suggest that the mPer2 gene functions in tumor suppression by regulating DNA damage-responsive pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1994683536,"We have utilized in vitro three-dimensional epithelial cell cultures to analyze the role of apoptosis in the formation and maintenance of a hollow glandular architecture. Lumen formation is associated with the selective apoptosis of centrally located cells; this apoptosis follows apicobasal polarization and precedes proliferative suppression during acinar development. Notably, either inhibiting apoptosis (by exogenously expressing antiapoptotic Bcl family proteins) or enhancing proliferation (via Cyclin D1 or HPV E7 overexpression) does not result in luminal filling, suggesting glandular architecture is resistant to such isolated oncogenic insults. However, the lumen is filled when oncogenes that enhance proliferation are coexpressed with those that inhibit apoptosis, or when ErbB2, which induces both activities, is activated by homodimerization. Hence, apoptosis can counteract increased proliferation to maintain luminal space, suggesting that tumor cells must restrain apoptosis to populate the lumen."
https://openalex.org/W2148194696,"Adenosine is released from the myocardium, endothelial cells, and skeletal muscle in ischemia and is an important regulator of coronary blood flow. We have already shown that acute (2 min) activation of A2a purinoceptors stimulates NO production in human fetal umbilical vein endothelial cells (1) and now report a key role for p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p42/p44MAPK) in the regulation of the l-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. Expression of mRNA for the A2a-, A2b-, and A3-adenosine receptor subtypes was abundant whereas A1-adenosine receptor mRNA levels were negligible. Activation of A2a purinoceptors by adenosine (10 microM) or the A2a receptor agonist CGS21680 (100 nM) resulted in an increase in l-arginine transport and NO release that was not mediated by changes in intracellular Ca2+, pH, or cAMP. Stimulation of endothelial cells with adenosine was associated with a membrane hyperpolarization and phosphorylation of p42/p44MAPK. l-NAME abolished the adenosine-induced hyperpolarization and stimulation of l-arginine transport whereas sodium nitroprusside activated an outward potassium current. Genistein (10 microM) and PD98059 (10 microM), an inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), inhibited adenosine-stimulated l-arginine transport, NO production, and phosphorylation of p42/p44MAPK. We found no evidence for activation of eNOS via the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) in adenosine-stimulated cells. Our results provide the first evidence that adenosine stimulates the endothelial cell l-arginine-NO pathway in a Ca2+-insensitive manner involving p42/p44MAPK, with release of NO leading to a membrane hyperpolarization and activation of l-arginine transport."
https://openalex.org/W1979608640,"Members of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta) superfamily--namely, TGF-beta and BMP2--applied to undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells up-regulated mRNA of mesodermal (Brachyury) and cardiac specific transcription factors (Nkx2.5, MEF2C). Embryoid bodies generated from stem cells primed with these growth factors demonstrated an increased potential for cardiac differentiation with a significant increase in beating areas and enhanced myofibrillogenesis. In an environment of postmitotic cardiomyocytes, stem cells engineered to express a fluorescent protein under the control of a cardiac promoter differentiated into fluorescent ventricular myocytes beating in synchrony with host cells, a process significantly enhanced by TGF-beta or BMP2. In vitro, disruption of the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathways by latency-associated peptide and/or noggin prevented differentiation of stem cells. In fact, only host cells that secrete a TGF-beta family member induced a cardiac phenotype in stem cells. In vivo, transplantation of stem cells into heart also resulted in cardiac differentiation provided that TGF-beta/BMP2 signaling was intact. In infarcted myocardium, grafted stem cells differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes integrated with surrounding tissue, improving contractile performance. Thus, embryonic stem cells are directed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes by signaling mediated through TGF-beta/BMP2, a cardiac paracrine pathway required for therapeutic benefit of stem cell transplantation in diseased heart."
https://openalex.org/W2128569391,"Superoxide activates nucleotide-sensitive mitochondrial proton transport through the uncoupling proteins UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 (Echtay, K. S., et al. (2002)Nature 415, 1482–1486). Two possible mechanisms were proposed: direct activation of the UCP proton transport mechanism by superoxide or its products and a cycle of hydroperoxyl radical entry coupled to UCP-catalyzed superoxide anion export. Here we provide evidence for the first mechanism and show that superoxide activates UCP2 in rat kidney mitochondria from the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane: (i) Exogenous superoxide inhibited matrix aconitase, showing that external superoxide entered the matrix. (ii) Superoxide-induced uncoupling was abolished by low concentrations of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidants 10-(6′-ubiquinonyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium (mitoQ) or 2-[2-(triphenylphosphonio)ethyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol bromide (mitoVit E), which are ubiquinone (Q) or tocopherol derivatives targeted to the matrix by covalent attachment to triphenylphosphonium cation. However, superoxide-induced uncoupling was not affected by similar concentrations of the nontargeted antioxidants Qo, Q1, decylubiquinone, vitamin E, or 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman 2-carboxylic acid (TROLOX) or of the mitochondrially targeted but redox-inactive analogs decyltriphenylphosphonium or 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium. Thus matrix superoxide appears to be necessary for activation of UCP2 by exogenous superoxide. (iii) When the reduced to oxidized ratio of mitoQ accumulated by mitochondria was increased by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase, it induced nucleotide-sensitive uncoupling that was not inhibited by external superoxide dismutase. Under these conditions quinols are known to produce superoxide, and because mitoQ is localized within the mitochondrial matrix this suggests that production of superoxide in the matrix was sufficient to activate UCP2. Furthermore, the superoxide did not need to be exported or to cycle across the inner membrane to cause uncoupling. We conclude that superoxide (or its products) exerts its uncoupling effect by activating the proton transport mechanism of uncoupling proteins at the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Superoxide activates nucleotide-sensitive mitochondrial proton transport through the uncoupling proteins UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 (Echtay, K. S., et al. (2002)Nature 415, 1482–1486).

However, superoxide-induced uncoupling was not affected by similar concentrations of the nontargeted antioxidants Qo, Q1, decylubiquinone, vitamin E, or 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman 2-carboxylic acid (TROLOX) or of the mitochondrially targeted but redox-inactive analogs decyltriphenylphosphonium or 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium.

Brown adipose tissue is a major site of adaptive thermogenesis. The main component responsible for heat generation is uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; TPMP, triphenylmethylphosphonium; Q, ubiquinone; mitoQ, 10-(6′-ubiquinonyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium; mitoVit E, 2-[2-(triphenylphosphonio)ethyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol bromide; decylQ, decylubiquinone; TROLOX, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman 2-carboxylic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; X, xanthine; XO, xanthine oxidase a member of the mitochondrial anion carrier family (1Klingenberg M.

The primary function of UCP1 is to dissipate the proton motive force used by the ATP synthase during oxidative phosphorylation by catalyzing a proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus ATP synthesis is largely bypassed, and the energy is released as heat. The proton transport activity of UCP1 is tightly controlled; it is activated by fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleoside di- and triphosphates (1Klingenberg M. Huang S.-G. Biochim. Biophys.

In 1997, new UCP1 homologs termed UCP2 and UCP3 were described in other mammalian tissues (5Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F.

UCP2 protein is expressed in several tissues, including spleen, lung, stomach, and white adipose tissue (9Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Google Scholar). It is also expressed in kidney and pancreatic β-cells, as judged from GDP-sensitive superoxide-stimulated proton conductance measurements (11Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B.

On the basis of sequence similarity to UCP1, it was initially suggested that they catalyze the basal mitochondrial proton conductance. Work in which the proteins were overexpressed in yeast, mammalian cells, and transgenic mice supported this hypothesis, but these results now appear to be artifacts of unphysiological expression for several reasons, particularly the lack of GDP-sensitive superoxide-stimulated proton conductance (10Harper J.A.

The main problem with these studies is the renaturation of the solubilized inclusion bodies. Nevertheless, they have identified ubiquinone as an essential cofactor for uncoupling in vitro by UCP1 and its homologs UCP2 and UCP3 (27Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M.

Recently, we showed that superoxide activates the inducible proton conductance of mitochondria through effects on UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 and that this activation is very sensitive to inhibition by purine nucleoside di- and triphosphates (11Echtay K.S.

It is present in mitochondria from brown adipose tissue (which contain UCP1) and in yeast mitochondria expressing mammalian UCP1 but is absent in mitochondria from wild-type yeast.

Two possible mechanisms were proposed for the activation of inducible proton conductance by superoxide (11Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A.

In the present report we explore inhibition and activation of superoxide-induced uncoupling by mitochondrially targeted antioxidants (39Murphy M.P.

Uncoupling by exogenous superoxide was inhibited by targeted antioxidants but not by nontargeted analogs, showing that matrix ROS are necessary in the uncoupling mechanism. Uncoupling was activated by generating superoxide selectively in the matrix by using a targeted quinol in conjunction with cyanide, and this uncoupling was insensitive to exogenous superoxide dismutase, showing that matrix ROS are sufficient to activate the uncoupling mechanism without cycling through the external medium. These observations provide evidence for the first mechanism and show that superoxide-stimulated uncoupling through UCPs occurs at the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The mitochondrially targeted compounds mitoQ, mitoVit E, 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium, and decyltriphenylphosphonium were synthesized as described previously (40Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M.

Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 for structures). MitoQ is a mixture of two redox forms of quinone (ubiquinol and ubiquinone) attached to triphenylphosphonium. Qo, Q1, decylQ, vitamin E (α-tocopherol, type VI), triphenylmethylphosphonium chloride, xanthine oxidase (buttermilk), and isocitrate dehydrogenase were from Sigma. TROLOX was from Aldrich, and xanthine was from Fluka. Two female Wistar rats (4–8 weeks old) were killed by stunning followed by cervical dislocation. The kidneys were immediately removed and placed in ice-cold medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 2 mm EGTA (isolation medium). The mitochondria were isolated essentially as described previously (42Rolfe D.F.S. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Google Scholar), with all steps carried out at 4 °C. Tissue was minced with sharp scissors, rinsed, and gently homogenized using a glass Dounce homogenizer (10–15 passes with medium fit plunger). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1047 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 11,621 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in isolation medium and centrifuged at 11,621 × g for 10 min. This step was repeated. The pellet was resuspended in isolation medium, and the protein concentration was determined by the Biuret method. To measure the kinetics of proton conductance, the respiration rate used to drive proton leak (in the presence of oligomycin to block ATP synthesis) was measured as a function of mitochondrial membrane potential, the driving force for the leak (43Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 128-133Google Scholar). Proton leak rates can be calculated from respiration rates by multiplying by the H+/O ratio of 6. Respiration rate and membrane potential were measured simultaneously using electrodes sensitive to oxygen (Clark electrode; Rank Brothers Ltd.) and to the potential-dependent probe triphenylmethylphosphonium cation (TPMP+) (44Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Kidney mitochondria (0.35 mg/ml) were incubated in standard assay medium (total volume, 3.5 ml) containing 120 mm KCl, 5 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm Hepes, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, at 37 °C with the addition of 5 μm rotenone, 80 ng of nigericin/ml, and 1 μg of oligomycin/ml. The electrode was calibrated with sequential 0.5 μm additions up to 2.5 μmTPMP+. When other phosphonium compounds (mitoQ, mitoVit E, 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium, and decyltriphenylphosphonium) were tested, these compounds were used instead of TPMP to calibrate the TPMP electrode and to monitor the mitochondrial potential. The binding correction was assumed to be 0.4/μl/mg of protein (44Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1995: 39-62Google Scholar) for all phosphonium compounds; the more hydrophobic analogs will bind more strongly than this, so membrane potentials estimated with these probes in Figs. 4 b, 6, 7 a, and 8 will be systematically overestimated to different extents. However, the pattern of changes using any particular phosphonium probe will not be affected by the binding correction. Respiration was initiated with 4 mmsuccinate, and the membrane potential was titrated by sequential addition of malonate up to about 1 mm. After each run, 0.2 μm carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added to release the phosphonium probe for base-line correction. Where indicated, exogenous superoxide was generated using xanthine (50 μm) and xanthine oxidase (0.01 unit/3.5 ml of assay medium). Xanthine was prepared at 0.35 mm in assay medium, and 500 μl of stock was added to 3 ml of assay medium to give 50 μm xanthine in a total volume of 3.5 ml in each run. Xanthine oxidase was prepared in assay medium at 0.2 unit/100 μl, and 5 μl (0.01 unit) was added to the assay medium. Xanthine and xanthine oxidase were added before the TPMP+ calibration and incubated with mitochondria for about 10–15 min before the addition of succinate.Figure 6Effects of 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium and decyltriphenylphosphonium on superoxide-induced uncoupling.Mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored by TPMP+ electrode calibrated with sequential addition of 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium (a) or decyltriphenylphosphonium (b) up to 2.5 μm. ■, control; ⋄, with X+XO added before 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium or decyltriphenylphosphonium; ○, with X+XO and 0.5 mm GDP added before 4-chlorobutyltriphenylphosphonium or decyltriphenylphosphonium.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Google Scholar). Kidney mitochondria (0.35 mg/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 3.5 ml of assay buffer, (120 mm KCl, 5 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP, 2 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 5 mm citrate, pH 7.2), either with or without xanthine (50 μm) plus xanthine oxidase (0.01 unit/3.5 ml). After 20 min, superoxide dismutase (45 units) was added, and the reaction was started by the addition of Triton X-100 (0.12% v/v). Because we use xanthine plus xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide and activate uncoupling by UCPs (11Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Google Scholar), there is a possible complication because of oxygen consumption by the xanthine oxidase (12Couplan E. Del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Alves-Guerra M.C. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26268-26275Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the base-line rate of oxygen consumption of nonenergized mitochondria in the absence (Fig.2 a) or presence of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase (Fig.2 b) was about 7 nmol of oxygen/min/mg of protein; it was not inhibited by GDP (Fig. 2 c). After the addition of succinate, oxygen consumption rates were much greater (Fig. 2, a–c). The proton leak curves calculated from Fig. 2, a–c, are summarized in Fig. 2 d. The state 4 respiration of control mitochondria was about 100 μmol of oxygen/min/mg of protein; in the presence of superoxide it increased to about 140 μmol of oxygen/min/mg of protein. Even after correcting for the base-line rate, the state 4 respiration of superoxide-treated mitochondria was higher than controls, and the proton leak curve was still deflected upwards, indicating increased mitochondrial uncoupling. The superoxide-induced uncoupling was inhibited by GDP (Fig. 2, c andd). Because of its insignificance to the superoxide-induced uncoupling, we show all of the results in this report (and in Refs. 11Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A.

These results confirm that superoxide induces GDP-sensitive uncoupling in kidney mitochondria (11Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Google Scholar) and that the effect of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase is not simply one of increasing base-line oxygen consumption (12Couplan E. Del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Alves-Guerra M.C. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26268-26275Google Scholar). We investigated whether exogenously generated superoxide reached the mitochondrial matrix by assaying the activity of aconitase, a matrix enzyme highly sensitive to superoxide (45Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, incubating kidney mitochondria with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase under our conditions significantly decreased the activity of aconitase. Xanthine or xanthine oxidase alone had no effect. The addition of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that detoxifies superoxide to H2O2, together with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase protected against damage to aconitase (data not shown). This indicates that superoxide generated outside mitochondria using xanthine plus xanthine oxidase reaches the matrix. Exogenously generated superoxide reaches"

Maternal H+/K+-ATPase mRNA is symmetrically expressed in the 1-cell Xenopus embryo but becomes localized during the first two cell divisions, demonstrating that asymmetry is generated within two hours postfertilization. Although H+/K+-ATPase subunit mRNAs are symmetrically localized in chick embryos, an endogenous H+/K+-ATPase-dependent difference in membrane voltage potential exists between the left and right sides of the primitive streak. In both species, pharmacologic or genetic perturbation of endogenous H+/K+-ATPase randomized the sided pattern of asymmetrically expressed genes and induced organ heterotaxia. Thus, LR asymmetry determination depends on a very early differential ion flux created by H+/K+-ATPase activity."

Here, we demonstrate that one of two murine homologs, mDispA, can rescue disp function in Drosophila and is essential for all Hh patterning activities examined in the early mouse embryo. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking mDispA respond normally to exogenously provided Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal, but are impaired in stimulation of other responding cells when expressing Shh. We have developed a biochemical assay that directly measures the activity of Disp proteins in release of soluble Hh proteins. This activity is disrupted by alteration of residues functionally conserved in Patched and in a related family of bacterial transmembrane transporters, thus suggesting similar mechanisms of action for all of these proteins."

The rapid, non-genomic actions of this sex steroid are attributed to membrane action, while gene transcription occurs through nuclear receptor function. However, gene transcription can also result from estrogen signaling initiated at the membrane, but the relative importance of this mechanism is not known. In vascular endothelial cells (EC), estradiol (E2) activates several kinase cascades, including phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3K)/Akt, a signaling pathway that impacts EC biology. We determined here by DNA microarray that 40-min exposure to E2 significantly increased 250 genes in EC, up-regulation that was substantially prevented by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. This coincided with maximum E2-induced PI3K activity at 15–30 min. An important vascular gene strongly up-regulated by E2 in our array produces cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). In cultured EC, E2induced both Cox-2 gene expression and new Cox-2 protein synthesis by 40 and 60 min, respectively, and rapidly stimulated the secretion of prostaglandins PGI2 and PGE2. The up-regulation of gene expression reflected transcriptional transactivation, shown using Cox-2 promoter/luciferase reporters in the EC. Soluble inhibitors or dominant negative constructs for PI3K and Akt prevented all these actions of E2.

At the cell surface, a small population of ER binds E2 and activates G proteins (5Pietras R. Szego C.M. Nature. 1977; 265: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 6Razandi M. Pedram A.

Multiple signaling pathways are then rapidly stimulated by E2 in target cells that express endogenous ERα and ERβ, and these pathways have been linked to discrete cellular actions of the steroid (8Singer C.A. Figueroa-Masot X.A. Batchelor R.H. Dorsa D.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol.

Wang E.-A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This protein sequesters ER away from the nucleus and strongly reduces E2-activated transcription yet promotes increased ERK signaling and aggressive behavior of the tumor. It is proposed therefore that the integration of cell surface and nuclear signaling impacts overall cell biology (13Levin E.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Signaling from the membrane leads to the post-translational modification of important structural and functional proteins in the cell. In EC, E2 activates the p38-MAPKAP-2 kinase pathway; MAPKAP-2 phosphorylates and modifies the function of heat shock protein 27 (14). This important modification leads to the morphological preservation and survival of the EC and stimulates primitive capillary tube formation. In breast cancer, E2 acts as a cell survival factor, in part by preventing chemotherapy or radiation-induced JNK activation (9Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JNK phosphorylates and inactivates Bcl2 and Bcl-xl, leading to the assembly of the apoptosome and caspase-mediated cell death. By preventing JNK activation and Bcl2/Bcl-xl phosphorylation, E2 rescues the breast cancer cells (9Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This provides a mechanism for the ability of E2to oppose therapeutic interventions in this malignancy. In addition to post-translational protein effects, E2 is recognized to stimulate transcription through signaling typically initiated at the membrane. As precedent for this effect of E2, growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors (insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor) exist in the plasma membrane and signal through common kinase cascades to gene transcription. E2 effects may involve the G protein-initiated, signaling-induced synthesis or activation of transcription factors. E2 stimulates c-fos through ERK- or PI3K-dependent pathways (15Watters J.J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). E2 activation of PI3K in EC results from the membrane ER-p85 regulatory subunit (PI3K) association, and this signaling to nitric oxide production rescues rats from ischemia-reperfusion injury (20Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). However, insight is largely lacking as to the full extent and importance of the specific integration of membrane signaling and nuclear effects of the sex steroid. We therefore identified the transcriptional targets in EC that are rapidly up-regulated from E2 signaling through the activation of PI3K. We also describe in depth the ability of E2-induced PI3K activation to up-regulate one specific gene, Cox-2, leading to the production of the enzyme, secretion of products of Cox-2 activation, and EC migration. This approach can be used to identify programs of gene activation that result from membrane-initiated steroid signaling (MISS) 2Terminology to replace “non-genomic” effects of steroids, as suggested by the Consensus Working Group at the FASEB conference on Membrane Steroid Receptors, Aspen, CO, June 22–27, 2002. by E2. EC were incubated with/without 10 nm E2 and 10 μm LY294002 for up to 6 h. Cells were then lysed, and the lysates pelleted then dissolved in SDS sample buffer, boiled, separated, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated Akt was detected using phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL Western blot kit. Equal samples from the cells were also immunoprecipitated, and immunoblots of the precipitated kinase protein from each experimental condition were determined to show equal gel loading. All experiments were repeated two or three times. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated without or with 10 nm E2 with or without the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μm), or LY294002 alone, for 40 min. For validation, the experiment was repeated a second time. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and by RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA was adjusted to 1 μg/μl, and first-strand cDNA, followed by double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ mRNA by the Microarray Facility at the University of California, Irvine. This was done using the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and poly(T) nucleotide primers that contained a sequence recognized by T7 RNA polymerase. A portion of the resulting double-stranded cDNA was used as a template to generate biotin-tagged cRNA from an in vitro transcription reaction (IVT) using the BioArray High-Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (T7) (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). 15 μg of the biotin-tagged cRNA was fragmented to strands of 35–200 bases in length following prescribed protocols (Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual). 10 μg of the fragmented cRNA was hybridized with rotation at 45 °C for 16 h to probe sets present on an Affymetrix human U95a array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were automatically washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Probe arrays were then scanned on a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray scanner. Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 was used to quantify and analyze the average difference in intensities between conditions of the experiment, for each represented gene. The comparisons between conditions were outputted as -fold increase or decrease, or no change, and data were compared with determine which genes were E2-responsive in a PI3K-dependent fashion. This output was then inserted into a stringent, Bayesian-based statistical analysis program (Cyber-T) (21Long A.D. Mangalam H.J. Chan B.Y.P. Toller L. Hatfield G.W. Baldi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19937-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), available as a web interface at the University of California at Irvine. The upper 2.5% of genes identified as being significantly different by Cyber-T (and in agreement with the Affymetrix analysis) are presented in table form. Validation of differential expression was performed by RT-PCR for four genes identified in the microarray and was standardized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. cDNA was prepared from 3 μg of total RNA isolated from EC, primed with random hexamers (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions.

PCR reactions were performed using 200 nm of primers with 2 μl of cDNA in 50 μl of Platinum PCR supermix (Invitrogen). After an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 4 min, 25–35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55–61 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 30–45 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The cycle number and annealing temperature was adjusted for each of the genes amplified. For reporter assays, BAEC were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the PGL-3 plasmid containing 1.8 kb of the human Cox-2promoter driving a luciferase reporter fusion protein (22Sheng H. Shao J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were recovered in serum overnight, then synchronized without serum over 24 h before experiments (in phenol red-free medium). Cells were then incubated for 6 h with10 nmE2 with or without either LY294002 (10 μm), a soluble inhibitor of NFκB (SN50M), or the corresponding inactive control (SN50), each at 20 μm. All inhibitors were fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). Assays were quantified by luminometer, and the results were adjusted for expression of co-transfectedRenilla luciferase. Triplicate determinations per condition were carried out in each of two experiments. The combined data were analyzed by analysis of variance plus Schefe's test, at ap < 0.05 level of significance. For protein synthesis, BAECs were exposed to 0.1–10 nm E2for 60 min, preceded where indicated for 30 min by incubation with ICI 182,780 (1 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), or wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) (100 nm).

Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M202391200Google Scholar), or with pcDNA3 as control. The cells were recovered and synchronized over 24 h then incubated with E2. For PGI2 (measured as 6-keto-PGF1α) and PGE2secretion studies, BAEC were incubated for 0–240 min with E2, to determine time of peak secretion. This was found to be 30 min, as subsequent time points reflected both secretion and accumulation. Additional studies were then conducted at 30 min. BAEC were incubated with/without 10 nm E2, with or without inhibitors, including NS-398 (5 μm) (Cox-2 inhibitor), or SC-560 (20 nm) (Cox-1 inhibitor). Each condition was run in duplicate. The incubation media were collected and concentrated by lyophilization, and prostaglandin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical). The study was repeated three times, with the results reflected in thebar graph. EC were grown to monolayer confluence on six-well plates and synchronized for 24 h in the absence of serum. A “wound” was created by scraping the monolayer with a single-edge razor blade, and cells were removed to the left of the wound. Serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 nm E2 with or without NS-398, SC-560, LY294002, wortmannin, or alone as control was added to separate dishes of wounded EC for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and assessed for migration (14Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). BAEC migration was measured using an image analyzer system composed of an inverted microscope and a 20- to 24-inch digitizing board (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) attached to a computer. The Sigma Scan program (Jandel) was used for analysis of measurements of the distance traveled by the cells within the calibrated area adjacent to the wound. Five measurements in each well were taken, and results from three separate experiments contributed to create the bar graph. E2induced substantial Akt phosphorylation by 5 min, reflecting PI3K activation, because the phosphorylation was totally prevented by a PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 1). The peak activity occurred at 15 min and lasted for the 6-h duration of the experiment. We therefore carried out our array studies to assess genes rapidly induced by E2 via PI3K signaling, based upon these results. EC were incubated with 10 nmE2 or without steroid (control) for 40 min, in the presence or absence of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. cRNA from each experimental condition was used for microarray gene analysis, as delineated under “Materials and Methods.” The DNA array hybridization pattern was analyzed by both Affymetrix statistical software and the CyberT Bayesian-based program, and 250 genes were identified as being significantly up-regulated by E2 (upper 2.5% of all genes) (Fig. 2). This occurred in both E2-inducible and PI3K-reversible fashion. In comparing control cRNA (no treatment) to cRNA from cells treated with LY294002 alone, no differences were detected. We list the genes that were 1) up-regulated in this fashion by more than 2-fold and 2) identified to have some known function (Table I). In contrast, few genes were down-regulated by E2 in the quiescent EC, and none depended upon PI3K/Akt activation, whereas several genes were stimulated by E2 and further enhanced upon PI3K inhibition. Genes discussed in the text are given in boldface in Table I.Table IGenes significantly up-regulated by estradiol in a PI3K-dependent fashionGenes that were induced at least 2-fold in endothelial cells after 40-min exposure to E2 but were not significantly induced after exposure to E2 and Ly294002 are listed.

Open table in a new tab Genes that were induced at least 2-fold in endothelial cells after 40-min exposure to E2 but were not significantly induced after exposure to E2 and Ly294002 are listed. Differentially expressed genes were identified by both Affymetrix analysis software and the Cyber T (Bayesian) statistical analysis program. As might be predicted from the time chosen, many transcription factors were rapidly up-regulated. These included the fos,myc, and jun genes previously known to be stimulated by estrogen (15Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 26Hyder S.M. Nawaz Z. Chiapetta C. Yokoyama K. Stancel G.M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 969-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which thereby validate our results. Here we extend the findings and implicate PI3K action in proto-oncogene up-regulation by E2. This sex steroid was recently shown to activate c-fos transcription in MCF-7 cells, via a PI3K/Akt pathway, targeting the serum response factor motif in the proximal fos promoter (16Duan R. Xie W., Li, X. McDougal A. Safe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also found stimulation of many transcription factors not previously known to be regulated by E2; these genes are therefore implicated in further E2 transcriptional action. In some situations, linked gene programs could be tentatively identified, based upon the existing literature. As an example, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (TableI, cytokines) stimulates osteoblast precursor-cell differentiation in part via up-regulating the AREB6 transcription factor (29Locklin R.M. Riggs B.L. Hicok K.C. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Khosla S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 2192-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Estrogen induces osteoblast differentiation (30Plant A. Samuels A. Perry M.J. Colley S. Gibson R. Tobias J.H. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 84: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and we found that E2 stimulates both genes here, via a PI3K-induced mechanism. Another transcriptional target for AREB6 is the Na+/K+-ATPase gene (31Watanabe Y. Kawakami K. Hirayama Y. Nagano K. J. Biochem. 1993; 114: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). E2is known to stimulate the activity of this enzyme (32Dzurba A. Ziegelhoffer A. Vrbjar N. Styk J. Slezak J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 176: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), potentially linking these observations to upstream signaling. As shown here, the HZF2 transcription factor is induced by E2 in PI3K-dependent fashion (Table I). HZF2 has been reported to be up-regulated by nitric oxide (NO) (33Schafer U. Schneider A. Neugebauer E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and E2 strongly and rapidly stimulates NO production in EC in PI3K-dependent fashion (20Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). NO induction by E2 prevents the deleterious blood vessel response to ischemia-reperfusion injury (20Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Together, these results potentially identify a linked cell biological program in EC. Several members of the EGR family of transcription factors were identified as induced by E2 in our array. Egr-1 is up-regulated (and important) in the response to acute and chronic vascular injury, where it may serve a protective function (34Khachigan L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Du B. Kent K.C. Bush H., Jr. Schulick A.H. Kreiger K. Collins T. McCaffrey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39039-39047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E2 mitigates the acute injury response to carotid angioplasty (36Mendelsohn M.E. Karas R.H. New Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar), perhaps in part through inducing Egr-1 in the EC, as shown here. Signaling molecules were also rapidly induced by E2, including both kinases and phosphatases. Steroid and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase activity is known to be a target for PI3K/Akt signaling (37Richards J.S. Sharma S.C. Falender A.E. Lo Y.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 580-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and has roles in both steroid-induced memory (38Tsai K.J. Chen S.K., Ma, Y.L. Hsu W.L. Lee E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3990-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and sodium transport (39Faletti C.J. Perrotti N. Taylor S.I. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C494-C500Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which are both functions of E2 (40Sherwin B.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 41Ediger T.R. Kraus W.L. Weinman E.J. Katznellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2976-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We also found that, via PI3K, E2up-regulates Cot/(Tpl-2), a transformation-associated factor and serine/threonine kinase. Akt phosphorylation of Cot induces NFκB-dependent transduction (42Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N., Xu, Z. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 16: 5662-5674Google Scholar), important for various functions, including cell survival. E2 potently inhibits hypoxia-induced EC apoptosis (14Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Genes coding for structural proteins, cytokines, or enzymes were identified as being stimulated by E2. Two members of the NGFI-B subfamily of nuclear orphan receptors, TR3 andMINOR, were rapidly and strongly induced by E2 via PI3K. A cytokine gene, CYR61, was previously demonstrated to be up-regulated by E2 in breast cancer but through an unknown mechanism (43Tsai M.S. Bogart D.F., Li, P. Mehmi I. Lupu R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 964-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In EC, we implicate signaling via PI3K. Up-regulation of the PTTG gene by estrogen (found here) was previously shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of E2-induced pituitary tumor formation and the stimulation of bFGF secretion (44Heany A.P. Fernando M. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). E2 and bFGF are recognized angiogenesis factors (14Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 45Lederman R.J. Mendensohn F.O. Anderson R.D. Saucedo J.F. Tenaglia A.N. Hermiller J.B. Hillegass W.B. Rocha-Singh K. Moon T.E. Whitehouse M.J. Annex B.H. TRAFFIC investigators Lancet. 2002; 359: 2048-2050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and therefore a potential linkage in EC of PTTG-induced bFGF could be important for the recognized neovascularization function of E2. ThePLAP (phospholipase A2-activating protein) gene was found to be stimulated in our array (Table I). This protein has been reported to contribute to up-regulate the Cox-2 gene and stimulate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (46Ribardo D.A. Kuhl K.R. Peterson J.W. Chopra A.K. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we propose a linkage of E2-induced, PI3K-dependent up-regulation of PLAP, contributing to E2-induced Cox-2 up-regulation and PG secretion/production (see below). Thus, many relevant genes are rapidly induced by this sex steroid in response to one signal pathway typically initiated at the plasma membrane. To confirm the array studies, we carried out semi-quantitative RT-PCR for several of the genes identified (Fig. 3). For the four genes examined (Cox-2, JunB, CREM, andEGR2), there was increased expression in EC after 40-min exposure to 10 nm E2 (lane 2), compared with the control (no E2) (lane 1). Furthermore, this increase was significantly abrogated by addition of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (lane 3), whereas the inhibitor alone had no effect compared with control levels (lane 4). The results provide validation of the array data for these specific genes. One of the genes strongly up-regulated by E2 in our EC gene array codes for the Cox-2 enzyme (Table I). Cox-2 activity gives rise to pGI2 and PGE2 production, important for various aspects of vascular function (47Li D.Y. Hardy P. Abran D. Martinez-Bermudez A.K. Guerguerian A.M. Bhattacharaya M. Almazan G. Peri K.G. Varma D.R. Chemtob S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1283-R1290PubMed Google Scholar, 48Hocheri K. Endemann D. Kammerl M.C. Grobecker H.F. Kurtz A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To explore the interactions between E2signaling through PI3K to Cox-2 in greater depth, we first confirmed the array results by RT-PCR (Fig. 3). We then further investigated transcriptional regulation by E2. We therefore expressed in BAEC a plasmid containing a 1.8-kb human Cox-2 promoter driving a luciferase reporter. This was significantly responsive to 10 nm E2, in a PI3K-dependent fashion (Fig. 4). One known target for PI3K/Akt signaling is the activation of the NFκB transcription factor (49Pandey S.K., He, H.J. Chesley A. Juhaszova M. Crow M.T. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 50Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Yung W.K. Reddy S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that a soluble NFκB inhibitor (but not its inactive control) completely reversed the E2stimulation of the Cox-2 promoter (Fig. 4). These data support the microarray studies and the idea that the up-regulation of the Cox-2 gene by E2 is transcriptional. Furthermore, this E2 action depends on signaling via PI3K and NFκB. NFκB binding sites are present within the humanCox-2 promoter at −580 and −358. Supporting this mechanism, we found that E2 significantly activated both 0.8 and 0.4 kb Cox-2 promoters driving luciferase reporter constructs, suggesting that the NFκB binding site at −358 in particular is important. 3A. Pedram, M. Razandi, M. Aitkenhead, C. C. W. Hughes, and E. R. Levin, unpublished observations.Previous studies indicate that PI3K/Akt can regulate Cox-2 mRNA production or stability in positive or negative fashion, dependent upon the stimulus and cellular context (51Monick M.M. Robeff P.K. Butler N.S. Flaherty D.M. Carter A.B. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32992-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 52Tang Q. Chen W. Gonzales M.S. Finch J. Inoue H. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cox-2 protein synthesis was then determined by Western blot. After 1-h exposure of EC to E2, the Cox-2 protein was nearly 3-fold increased in relevant E2concentration-responsive fashion (Fig. 5 A). The PI3K inhibitors, LY 294002 and wortmannin, each caused an 80% reduction in Cox-2 protein synthesis, as did ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist. Expression of dominant negative constructs for the p85 subunit of PI3K (DN-PI3K) or Akt (DN-Akt) also resulted in substantial inhibition of E2-induced Cox-2 protein expression. The dominant negative constructs had no effects alone (data not shown). In preliminary studies, we determined a time course for PGE2 and PGI2 secretion in response to E2. Compared with basal secretion (0 time), E2stimulated an initial 2-fold PGE2 release at 10 min (first point assessed), reaching a maximum increase at 30 min and plateauing thereafter (data not shown). Based upon these results, BAEC were then incubated with 10 nm E2 with or without inhibitors of ER, PI3K, and Cox-1 or Cox-2 for 30 min. As seen in Fig. 5 B, E2 stimulated a 13-fold increase of PGE2 secretion, 75% prevented by ICI 182,780. Co-incubation of the cells with NS-398 (a specific Cox-2 inhibitor) reversed the E2 effect by 86%. A specific Cox-1 inhibitor (SC-560) also provided a 33% inhibition of the E2 effect, suggesting that PGE2 synthesis was mainly dependent upon the Cox-2 enzyme. It is recognized that PGE2 and PGI2 can both result from either Cox-1 or Cox-2 enzymatic action, but in a given cell type or in response to a specific stimulus, one cyclooxygenase activity may predominate over the other (53Coceani F. Ackerley C. Seidlitz E. Kelsey L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Importantly, the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY 294002 each prevented E2-induced PGE2 secretion by 87%. This is consistent with the ability of E2 to activate theCox-2 gene in a PI3K-dependent fashion, as identified by microarray and reporter studies. Interestingly, the PGE2 receptor was also found in our array to be up-regulated by E2 via PI3K (Table I). As for PGI2, E2 induced a 4-fold increase in secretion (Fig. 5 B). This was 60% reversed by ICI 182,780, 58% by the Cox-2 inhibitor, and 36% by the Cox-1 inhibitor. The PI3K inhibitors also reduced the E2 induction of PGI2 by 60%. Our results greatly extend the observations of others that E2 can rapidly stimulate the secretion of PGI2 from endothelial cells (54Akarasereenont P. Techatraisak K. Thaworn A. Chotewuttakorn S. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 55Shareman T.S. Chambliss K.L. Gibson L.L. Pace M.C. Mendelsohn M.E. Pfister S.L. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we show transcriptional up-regulation of the Cox-2 gene, increased protein production, and stimulation of both PGE2 and PGI2 secretion, in a PI3K-dependent fashion. An observation that is relevant for EC is that Cox-2 and cAMP-signaling enhances angiogenesis through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (56Amano H. Hayashi I. Yoshida S. Yoshimura H. Majima M. Hum. Cell. 2002; 15: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cox-2 and cAMP are up-regulated by E2signaling from the membrane (2, 6, and here). This may be significant to E2-modulated induction and developmental function of vascular endothelial growth factor, in the formation and permeability of the blood vessels of the ovary and uterus (56Amano H. Hayashi I. Yoshida S. Yoshimura H. Majima M. Hum. Cell. 2002; 15: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 57Ferrara N. Chen H. Davis-Smyth T. Gerber H.P. Nguyen T.N. Peers D. Chislom V. Hillan K.J. Schwall R.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We then examined possible roles for Cox-2-derived prostaglandins and E2 in mediating EC migration. E2 is known to induce several aspects of angiogenesis, including EC migration (14Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and Cox-2 also importantly participates in these processes (28Matsumoto H., Ma, W.-g. Daikoku T. Zhao X. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29260-29267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cultured EC were “wounded,” and the migration of EC across this wound barrier was determined after 24-h exposure to various conditions. As seen in Fig. 6, 10 nm E2(panel B) induced a 3-fold increase in migration area compared with control EC (panel A). The effect of E2 was reduced 75% by a Cox-2 inhibitor (panel C), but not significantly by a Cox-1 inhibitor (panel D). The effect of E2 was also prevented by LY294002 (panel E) and by wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) (panel F). The inhibitors by themselves had no effects on EC migration (data not shown). Thus, we link the Cox-2 up-regulation in EC, induced by E2 and PI3K signaling, to a cell biological outcome. Increasingly, the integration of membrane and nuclear actions of steroids is recognized. An important mechanism demonstrated here is that steroids rapidly induce through kinase signaling many genes coding for transcription factors. We determined that the identified transcription factor gene promoters usually lack any form of estrogen response elements. Transcription factor up-regulation presumably then leads to the induction of additional genes that regulate steroid-induced cellular function. However, we also show that, by the same signaling mechanism, steroids rapidly up-regulate genes coding for enzymes or signaling molecules. The protein products of these genes both directly impact cell functions (i.e. cell migration) and induce additional transcription. Through membrane-initiated steroid signaling (MISS), we propose that estrogen affects overall cellular processes by post-translationally modulating the functions of existing proteins (9Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol.

We describe the crystal structure of Neurospora DIM-5, a histone H3 lysine 9 methyltranferase (HKMT), determined at 1.98 Å resolution, as well as results of biochemical characterization and site-directed mutagenesis of key residues. This SET domain protein bears no structural similarity to previously characterized AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases but includes notable features such as a triangular Zn3Cys9 zinc cluster in the pre-SET domain and a AdoMet binding site in the SET domain essential for methyl transfer. The structure suggests a mechanism for the methylation reaction and provides the structural basis for functional characterization of the HKMT family and the SET domain."

The 2.6 Å resolution structure of Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase in a pseudo-bisubstrate complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine and a HEPES ion reveals an all-β architecture for the SET domain embedded within a larger α-helical enzyme fold. Conserved regions of the SET domain bind S-adenosylmethionine and substrate lysine at two sites connected by a pore. We propose that methyl transfer is catalyzed by a conserved Tyr at a narrow pore connecting the sites. The cofactor enters by a “back door” on the opposite side of the enzyme from substrate, promoting highly specific protein recognition and allowing addition of multiple methyl groups."
https://openalex.org/W2061016075,"The therapeutic value of DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents is dependent upon their ability to induce tumor cell apoptosis while sparing most normal tissues. Here, we show that a component of the apoptotic response to these agents in several different types of tumor cells is the deamidation of two asparagines in the unstructured loop of Bcl-xL, and we demonstrate that deamidation of these asparagines imports susceptibility to apoptosis by disrupting the ability of Bcl-xL to block the proapoptotic activity of BH3 domain-only proteins. Conversely, Bcl-xL deamidation is actively suppressed in fibroblasts, and suppression of deamidation is an essential component of their resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that the regulation of Bcl-xL deamidation has a critical role in the tumor-specific activity of DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2003049393,"Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a proinflammatory cytokine that maintains thermal hyperalgesia and facilitates the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from rat cutaneous nociceptors in vivo and in vitro. Brief applications of IL-1 beta to nociceptive neurons yielded a potentiation of heat-activated inward currents (Iheat) and a shift of activation threshold toward lower temperature without altering intracellular calcium levels. The IL-1 beta-induced heat sensitization was not dependent on G-protein-coupled receptors but was mediated by activation of protein kinases. The nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, the specific protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide BIM1, and the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein reduced the sensitizing effect of IL-1 beta whereas negative controls were ineffective. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed IL-1RI but not RII expression in neurons rather than surrounding satellite cells in rat dorsal root ganglia. IL-1 beta acts on sensory neurons to increase their susceptibility for noxious heat via an IL-1RI/PTK/PKC-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2157323046,"We examined the relationship between brain anatomy and the ability to learn nonnative speech sounds, as well as rapidly changing and steady-state nonlinguistic sounds, using voxel-based morphometry in 59 healthy adults. Faster phonetic learners appeared to have more white matter in parietal regions, especially in the left hemisphere. The pattern of results was similar for the rapidly changing but not for the steady-state nonlinguistic stimuli, suggesting that morphological correlates of phonetic learning are related to the ability to process rapid temporal variation. Greater asymmetry in the amount of white matter in faster learners may be related to greater myelination allowing more efficient neural processing, which is critical for the ability to process certain speech sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2003387590,"The interaction between nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) and transport factors is crucial for the translocation of macromolecules through nuclear pores. Many nucleoporins contain FG sequence repeats, and previous studies have demonstrated interactions between repeats containing FxFG or GLFG cores and transport factors. The crystal structure of residues 1–442 of importin-β bound to a GLFG peptide indicates that this repeat core binds to the same primary site as FxFG cores. Importin-β-I178D shows reduced binding to both FxFG and GLFG repeats, consistent with both binding to an overlapping site in the hydrophobic groove between the A-helices of HEAT repeats 5 and 6. Moreover, FxFG repeats can displace importin-β or its S. cerevisiae homologue, Kap95, bound to GLFG repeats. Addition of soluble GLFG repeats decreases the rate of nuclear protein import in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, indicating that this interaction has a role in the translocation of carrier-cargo complexes through nuclear pores.

The binding of GLFG and FxFG repeats to overlapping sites on importin-β indicates that functional differences between different repeats probably arise from differences in their spatial organization. nuclear pore complex glutathione S-transferase dithiothreitol phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin The bidirectional exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm takes place through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)1 that perforate the nuclear envelope (reviewed by Refs. 1Bayliss R.

The active transport of large macromolecules through NPCs requires escort or carrier proteins that shuttle rapidly between the two cellular compartments. Members of the importin-β/karyopherin-β family function as carriers for many nuclear trafficking processes including nuclear protein import and export and tRNA export (reviewed by Refs. 2Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and 3Vasu S.K. Forbes D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, not all nuclear trafficking is mediated by members of this family. For example, the NXF family is important for mRNA export (reviewed by Refs. 5Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholarand 6Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and NTF2 mediates nuclear import of RanGDP (7Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D.

Transport by carrier proteins is thought to be a sequential stepwise process. For example, importin-β binds cargo molecules in the cytoplasm, either directly or via an adapter such as importin-α, the complex moves through the NPC, and then cargo is released in the nucleus on importin-β binding RanGTP. The importin-β·RanGTP complex is recycled to the cytoplasm where it is dissociated by hydrolysis of the GTP on Ran, freeing importin-β for another round of import (reviewed by Refs. 9Görlich D.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although the actual mechanism of translocation through NPCs remains controversial, a shared tenet of each model involves binding of carrier molecules to a subset of NPC proteins (termed nucleoporins or “Nups”) that contain domains with repeating Phe-Gly (FG) sequence motifs (Refs. 11Allen N.P.

These repeats have hydrophobic cores based on FG, GLFG, or FxFG motifs separated by hydrophilic linkers of variable sequence and length. In vitro, FG-Nups interact directly with a broad range of transport factors and there is compelling in vivo evidence that interaction between carriers and FG-Nups is important for at least one stage of translocation through NPCs (Ref. 11Allen N.P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). FG-Nups may function to concentrate carrier-cargo complexes at the NPC entrance (18Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) or participate in a sequence of docking and undocking interactions as the carrier-cargo complexes transit through NPCs (Refs.11Allen N.P.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Alternatively, FG-Nups may form a meshwork within the central channel that is permeable only to molecules that interact with FG repeats (19Ribbeck K. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Rout and Wente (15Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) suggested that FG-Nups may divide into different subfamilies, based on differences in the primary core sequences between different Nups (FG, GLFG, and FxFG) and on differences in linker sequences. In addition, the distribution of different FG-Nup subfamilies within NPCs is not the same (18Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 20Stoffler D. Farhenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The most complete analysis has been possible in Saccharomyces cerevisiae where there are 13 different FG-Nups. The GLFG-Nups are found on both sides of the NPC, some FG-Nups are exclusively on the cytoplasmic side, and some FxFG-Nups are exclusively on the nuclear side (18Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Individual FG-Nups show distinct binding preferences for different carriers (11Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that potentially some may have specialized functions. This possibility is also supported by a range of genetic, biochemical, andin vivo evidence implicating different FG-Nups in import or export events (Refs. 1Bayliss R. Corbett A.H. Stewart M.

A combination of biochemical and structural studies have indicated that, although FxFG-Nups may bind at several sites on importin-β, the primary site is located in the N-terminal half of the molecule between the A-helices of HEAT repeats 5 and 6 (21Bayliss R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, fragments containing the C-terminal half of importin-β do show some binding to nuclear envelopes (31Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of residues 1–442 of importin-β complexed with FxFG repeats (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) shows two putative FxFG sites, but the site between the A-helices of repeats 5 and 6 has higher occupancy. Moreover, mutations at this site (for example, I178D) weaken the binding of FxFG constructs considerably, consistent with its representing the primary FxFG binding site (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The binding of importin-β to FG-Nups as well as to cargo and/or importin-α is disrupted by RanGTP (11Allen N.P. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Rexach M. Blobel G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and comparison of different co-crystal structures suggests that RanGTP binding may induce a conformational change in importin-β that occludes the primary FxFG binding site (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). It has not been established unequivocally if such a mechanism contributes to vectorial movement through NPCs or release of importin-β from Nups. Crystal structures of FxFG repeat cores bound to importin-β and NTF2 (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2843-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and an FG core bound to the mRNA export factor Tap/NXF1 (37Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) indicate that, in each complex, the interaction is dominated by repeat core Phe side chains being buried in a hydrophobic pocket. Mutations in this pocket reduced the binding of these transport factors to FG-Nups (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 36Bayliss R. Leung S.W. Baker R.P. Quimby B.B. Corbett A.H. Stewart M.

Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, the affinity of FxFG repeat peptides for the UBA domain of Tap was dramatically reduced when the second Phe, F2, was mutated to Ala (38Grant R.P. Hurt E. Neuhaus D. Stewart M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overall, these data indicate that the hydrophobic cores of FG repeats are crucial to their binding to transport factors, although they do not rule out there also being contributions from the linkers. To determine the precise function of each interaction in a cycle of productive nuclear transport, it is crucial to define how the FG repeats are recognized by nuclear transport factors. To address this question, we have investigated the interaction of GLFG- and FxFG-Nups with importin-β, and report here the 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of a complex between residues 1–442 of importin-β and a GLFG repeat containing peptide. The GLFG core binds to the same hydrophobic site on importin-β previously identified as the principal FxFG binding site (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). I178D-importin-β, which shows reduced affinity for FxFG repeats, also shows reduced binding to GLFG repeats and nuclear protein import is inhibited by soluble GLFG repeats. Moreover, we show that the binding of GLFG repeats to importin-β is inhibited by soluble FxFG repeats confirming that, in solution, the GLFG and FxFG repeat cores bind primarily to overlapping sites on importin-β. Similar competition between GLFG- and FxFG-Nups was observed with Kap95. The cloning, expression, and purification of human importin-β and its I178D mutant, Ib442, canine Ran, and the S. cerevisiae Nsp1 FF18 (containing eighteen FxFG repeats) have been described previously (21Bayliss R.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the FxFG repeat containing domain of Nup1 residues 423–816 were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described by the suppliers (Amersham Biosciences). GLFG peptide (DSGGLFGSK) was dissolved in Milli Q water buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris (∼2 mm). Crystals of the Ib442-GLFG complex were obtained by vapor diffusion using hanging drops of 6 μl composed of 3 μl of well buffer and 3 μl of Ib442/GLFG mixture (15 mg/ml Ib442, 25 mm GLFG peptide). Well buffer was composed of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and 1.2m ammonium sulfate. Crystals were slowly dehydrated by transfer to a hanging drop containing 2 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, 25 mm GLFG peptide above a well containing 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0. After 2 days the crystals were transferred to 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, before plunge-freezing into liquid nitrogen. Ib442-GLFG crystals vitrified in this way diffracted to 2.8-Å resolution using 1.488-Å wavelength radiation and a Mar345 detector on beamline 14.1 at the SRS (Daresbury, UK). Data were integrated using MOSFLM (42Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and reduced using SCALA (42Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Crystals of Ib442-FF5 withP212121 symmetry were grown under similar conditions to theP21212 crystals (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) by vapor diffusion using 7-μl hanging drops composed of 3 μl of drop buffer, 3 μl of Ib442 protein (of 4.5 mg/ml stock solution), and 1 μl of FF5 (11 mg/ml stock solution). Reservoir buffer was 1.2–1.28m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.9, 30 mm DTT and drop buffer was 1.16–1.2 mammonium sulfate, 200 mm ammonium acetate, 25 mm DTT. Diffraction-quality crystals (dimensions 200 × 50 × 50 μm), which diffracted past 3 Å, were grown by microseeding. Crystals were transferred to reservoir buffer containing 24% glycerol for less than 1 min and flash-frozen at 100 K. A native data set was collected at 100 K using 0.934-Å wavelength radiation on beamline ID14-EH1 at ESRF (Grenoble, France) using a MarCCD detector. Molecular replacement and refinement used the CNS package (43Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 50: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The structures of the crystals of Ib442 complexed to either GLFG or FxFG peptides were determined by molecular replacement using residues 1–442 of importin-β bound to the IBB domain (28Cingolini G. Petose C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) as a model. Although the coordinates of Ib442 when bound to FF5, in the original Ib442-FF5 crystal form, was a more similar starting model than the IBB-bound structure, we thought it prudent to avoid the possibility of introducing bias arising from a Nup-bound Ib442 as a model. The Ib442 chains were rebuilt locally and refined using simulated annealing before examining F 0 −F c difference maps to locate putative bound Nup repeats. In both cases, characteristic tubes of difference density were observed from which there were bulky protrusions that could be identified as Phe and Leu side chains. Structural figures were made using MOLSCRIPT (44Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (45Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), and Raster3d (46Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Saturating amounts of GST-Nup were incubated with 200 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) for 1 h in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Unbound material was removed by washing four times with binding buffer. For each binding reaction, 40 μl of bead slurry (50% suspension) in 1 ml of binding buffer was incubated with 10 μg of wild type or I178D importin-β for 40 min at 4 °C. For competition assays, 100 μg of FF18 or 60 μg of importin-α were included in the incubation. After incubation, beads were washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer, resuspended in sample buffer (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Solid phase binding assays were carried out on Immulon II microtiter plates (Dynex) essentially as described by Ben-Efraim and Gerace (34Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Plates were coated with 25 nm Nsp1 FF18, GST-Nup100 (residues 2–610), GST-Nup116 (residues 161–730), or GST per well for 16 h at 4 °C in coating buffer (PBS supplemented with 2 mm DTT and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After adsorption the plates were washed three times by immersion in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer (coating buffer supplemented with 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20). Binding reactions were carried out for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μl/well of the indicated amounts of S-tagged importin-β (wild-type or I178D mutant) or Kap95 proteins in binding buffer. After binding, plates were washed three times by immersion in binding buffer without BSA and proteins were cross-linked for 15 min at room temperature by incubation in 1 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce) in the same buffer. The wells were then washed for 20 min in PBS-T (PBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20), 10 min with PBS-T containing 100 mm ethanolamine, and finally incubated for 10 min in PBS-T containing 3% BSA. The bound S-tagged proteins were detected by incubation with S-protein-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen) in coating buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. After 1 h at 4 °C, the plates were washed three times by immersion in PBS. Horseradish peroxidase substrate (100 μg/ml 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Vector Laboratories), 0.006% H2O2 in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0) was added for 10 min at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.5 mH2SO4. The signal was determined at 450 nm with a Molecular Devices plate reader. For competition experiments, free Nup proteins, RanGTP, or RanGDP were added to the wells along with a fixed concentration of S-tagged importin-β or Kap95. Ran was loaded with either GTP or GDP as previously described (34Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 48Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J.

Hardy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN) to generate pSW1381, pSW1371, and pSW1449, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into SWY561 (Mata ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100 kap95::HIS3 pSW271 (KAP95 URA3 CEN), Ref. 12Iovine M.K. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. J.

To test for complementation, yeast transformants were struck to synthetic complete media supplemented with 2% glucose and 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid. Growth was assayed at 23 °C for 7 days. Nuclear protein import was assayed using digitonin-permeabilized HeLa S3 cells essentially as described (21Bayliss R. Littlewood T.D. Stewart M.

Purified bacterially expressed proteins (1.2 μm importin-α, 2.25 μm Ran, and 2.7 μm NTF2) were combined in a final volume of 8 μl of transport buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 120 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm Mg acetate, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.05 mg/ml creatine kinase). Importin-β was used at a concentration of 250 nm, and cells were examined using identical microscope settings. In competition studies, the Nup proteins Nsp1 FF18 or GST-Nup100-(2–610) were included at a final concentration of 10 or 25 μm. After 30 min, cells were fixed and examined using a MRC1024 confocal microscope. All fluorescent images were captured using 488 nm excitation and with identical laser intensity, iris, and gain settings. Six-frame Kalman averaging was used for all images. Low-power micrographs were recorded for a number of fields in each sample and the number of cells in which fluorescent substrate had been imported into the nucleus was quantitated. Approximately 100 cells were counted for each sample. Coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1o6o and 1o6p. We investigated the structural basis for the interaction between importin-β and GLFG repeats using crystals of importin-β residues 1–442 (Ib442) complexed with a peptide of the sequence DSGGLFGSK. By analogy with the binding to FxFG repeats (50Bayliss R. Kent H.M. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we anticipated that the binding of GLFG repeats to importin-β would probably be mediated largely by their hydrophobic cores, and so we employed ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. In this way we obtained crystalline plates, measuring ∼0.1 × 0.05 × 0.02 mm, which had P21 symmetry and diffracted past 2.8-Å resolution (Table I) using synchrotron radiation. We also obtained crystals of putative Ib442-GLFG complexes using several repeats derived from Nup116, but none diffracted to high resolution.Table ICrystallographic data for Ib442/Nup crystalsComplexed with GLFG peptideComplexed with FF51-aFF5 is a construct fromS. cerevisiae Nsp1p that contains five FxFG repeats (21).Crystals SymmetryP21P212121 Lattice parameters a (Å)125.8267.11 b (Å)67.03125.35 c (Å)129.26266.67 β (degrees)98.9990.0Data collection Resolution range (Å)67.4–2.8 (2.95–2.8)1-bThe highest resolution shell is in parentheses.60.9–2.8 (2.95–2.8)1-bThe highest resolution shell is in parentheses.

Visual responses were probed with spatially uniform flickering stimuli, so that retinal processing was uninfluenced by eye movements. Nonetheless, saccades had diverse effects, altering not only response strength but also the temporal and chromatic properties of the receptive field. Of these changes, the most prominent was a biphasic modulation of response strength, weak suppression followed by strong enhancement. Saccadic modulation was widespread, and affected both of the major processing streams in the LGN. Our results demonstrate that during natural viewing, thalamic response properties can vary dramatically, even over the course of a single fixation."
https://openalex.org/W2161019406,"Methylation of lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of histones is thought to represent an important component of the mechanism that regulates chromatin structure. The evolutionarily conserved SET domain occurs in most proteins known to possess histone lysine methyltransferase activity. We present here the crystal structure of a large fragment of human SET7/9 that contains a N-terminal β-sheet domain as well as the conserved SET domain. Mutagenesis identifies two residues in the C terminus of the protein that appear essential for catalytic activity toward lysine-4 of histone H3. Furthermore, we show how the cofactor AdoMet binds to this domain and present biochemical data supporting the role of invariant residues in catalysis, binding of AdoMet, and interactions with the peptide substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2066425039,"Cell degeneration in Alzheimer's disease is mediated by a toxic mechanism that involves interaction of the AbetaP peptide with the plasma membrane of the target cell. We report here that PC12 cells become resistant to the cytotoxic action of AbetaP when incubated in a medium that enriches cholesterol levels of the surface membrane. On the other hand, making cholesterol-deficient membranes by either cholesterol extraction with cyclodextrin or by inhibiting de novo synthesis of cholesterol makes PC12 cells more vulnerable to the action of AbetaP. Increasing cholesterol content of PS liposomes also suppresses AbetaP-dependent liposome aggregation. We suggest that by modifying the fluidity of the neuronal membranes, cholesterol modulates the incorporation and pore formation of AbetaP into cell membranes. This idea is supported by our finding that the enhanced cytotoxicity generated by lowering the membrane cholesterol content can be reversed by AbetaP calcium channel blockers Zn2+ and tromethamine."
https://openalex.org/W2148603246,"Acquired or inherent drug resistance is the major problem in achieving successful cancer treatment. However, the mechanism(s) of pleiotropic drug resistance remains obscure. We have identified and characterized a cellular metabolic strategy that differentiates drug-resistant cells from drug-sensitive cells. This strategy may serve to protect drug-resistant cells from damage caused by chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. We show that drug-resistant cells have low mitochondrial membrane potential, use nonglucose carbon sources (fatty acids) for mitochondrial oxygen consumption when glucose becomes limited, and are protected from exogenous stress such as radiation. In addition, drug-resistant cells express high levels of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). The discovery of this metabolic strategy potentially facilitates the design of novel therapeutic approaches to drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1989084881,"Cyclic and linear peptides containing the Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) motif have proven useful for delivering various anti-tumor compounds and viral particles to tumor vessels. We have investigated the role of cyclic constraints on the structure and tumor-homing properties of NGR peptides using tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) derivatives containing disulfide-bridged (CNGRC-TNF) and linear (GNGRG-TNF) NGR domains. Experiments carried out in animal models showed that both GNGRG and CNGRC can target TNF to tumors. However, the anti-tumor activity of CNGRC-TNF was >10-fold higher than that of GNGRG-TNF. Molecular dynamic simulation of cyclic CNGRC showed the presence of a bend geometry involving residues Gly3-Arg4. Molecular dynamic simulation of the same peptide without disulfide constraints showed that the most populated and thermodynamically favored configuration is characterized by the presence of a β-turn involving residues Gly3-Arg4 and hydrogen bonding interactions between the backbone atoms of Asn2 and Cys5. These results suggest that the NGR motif has a strong propensity to form β-turn in linear peptides and may explain the finding that GNGRG peptide can target TNF to tumors, albeit to a lower extent than CNGRC. The disulfide bridge constraint is critical for stabilizing the bent conformation and for increasing the tumor targeting efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2085137108,"Alveolar hypoxia may impair sodium-dependent alveolar fluid transport and induce pulmonary edema in rat and human lung, an effect that can be prevented by the inhalation of β2-agonists. To investigate the mechanism of β2-agonist-mediated stimulation of sodium transport under conditions of moderate hypoxia, we examined the effect of terbutaline on epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression and activity in cultured rat alveolar epithelial type II cells exposed to 3% O2 for 24 h. Hypoxia reduced transepithelial sodium current and amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity without decreasing ENaC subunit mRNA or protein levels. The functional decrease was associated with reduced abundance of ENaC subunits (especially β and γ) in the apical membrane of hypoxic cells, as quantified by biotinylation. cAMP stimulation with terbutaline reversed the hypoxia-induced decrease in transepithelial sodium transport by stimulating sodium channel activity and markedly increased the abundance of β-and γ-ENaC in the plasma membrane of hypoxic cells. The effect of terbutaline was prevented by brefeldin A, a blocker of anterograde transport. These novel results establish that hypoxia-induced inhibition of amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity is mediated by decreased apical expression of ENaC subunits and that β2-agonists reverse this effect by enhancing the insertion of ENaC subunits into the membrane of hypoxic alveolar epithelial cells.

Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Google Scholar, 2Canessa C. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

Rev. 2002; 82: 569-600Google Scholar). The critical role of ENaC in alveolar fluid homeostasis has been highlighted by the fact that newborn α-ENaC knockout mice died shortly after birth, primarily from failure to clear their lungs of fluid (5Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Google Scholar). Despite its physiological importance, little is known about the regulation of ENaC processing, trafficking to, and stability at the cell surface of alveolar epithelial cells under physiological or pathological conditions and in response to hormonal and pharmacological stimuli. β-Adrenergic agonists have been reported to stimulate active sodium transport across alveolar epithelium in various species in vivo and in vitro (4Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. Clerici C. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 569-600Google Scholar), but the mechanism(s) whereby these agents increase apical sodium channel activity in native ATII cells remains unclear. Interestingly, a recent study performed in a model of Fischer rat thyroid epithelial cells cotransfected with α-, β-, and γ-ENaC suggested that cAMP agonists stimulate sodium current by enhancing the translocation of ENaC subunit proteins from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, thus increasing the number of sodium channels at the cell surface (6Snyder P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Google Scholar). The alveolar epithelium is normally exposed after birth to a mean alveolar oxygen (O2) pressure of 100 mm Hg, but alveolar hypoxia may occur in many physiological or pathological conditions, such as ascent to high altitude, alveolar hypoventilation, or pulmonary edema from heart failure or acute lung injury. Rapid ascent to high altitude may induce in some subjects the development of pulmonary edema. Although the initial cause of alveolar flooding is likely related to altered hemodynamics or increased lung microvascular permeability (7West J.B. Tsukimoto K. Mathieu-Costello O. Predileto R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1731-1742Google Scholar, 8Stelzner T.J. O'Brien R.F. Sato K. Weil J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1840-1847Google Scholar), new data from human and animal studies support the concept that defective alveolar fluid clearance could have a pathogenic role in the development of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and could be a potential target for therapy. Sartori et al. (9Sartori C. Allemann Y. Duplain H. Lepori M. Egli M. Lipp E. Hutter D. Turini P. Hugli O. Cook S. Nicod P. Scherrer U. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1631-1636Google Scholar) recently reported that HAPE-sensitive subjects at low altitude have a decrease in nasal transepithelial potential difference compared with HAPE-insensitive subjects, suggesting that these subjects may have a genetically determined impairment of transepithelial sodium and liquid clearance in the lungs. Interestingly, the risk of HAPE was clearly reduced in these susceptible subjects by prophylactic inhalation of β2-agonists, which are known to up-regulate sodium-dependent alveolar fluid transport in the human lung (10Sakuma T. Okaniwa G. Nakada T. Nishimura T. Fujimura S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 305-310Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, a recent animal study revealed that in vivo hypoxia (8% O2) reduced sodium and fluid transport across rat alveolar epithelium (11Vivona M.L. Matthay M.A. Blot Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 554-561Google Scholar). This hypoxia-induced decrease in transepithelial sodium transport occurred with no concomitant decrease in the quantity of sodium transport proteins expressed in alveolar epithelial cells from hypoxic rats, suggesting that inhibition of sodium transport was related to post-translational mechanism(s) altering the trafficking, stability at the cell surface, or the biophysical properties of transport proteins. Moreover, in this rat model, intra-alveolar administration of the β2-agonist terbutaline rapidly and completely reversed the hypoxia-induced decrease in transepithelial sodium transport and alveolar liquid clearance. Therefore, we hypothesized that one mechanism whereby hypoxia may reduce transepithelial sodium transport across alveolar epithelial cells would be by decreasing the number of sodium channels at the cell surface of ATII cells and that β2-agonists could reverse this effect by promoting insertion of new sodium channel subunits in the apical membrane. To test this hypothesis, we used an in vitro model of rat ATII cells in primary culture exposed to 3% O2, equivalent to an O2 pressure of 45 mm Hg in culture medium and corresponding to the degree of alveolar hypoxia used in the in vivo model of previously studied rats. The effects of hypoxia and β2-agonist treatment on transepithelial sodium transport and specifically on rat ENaC (rENaC) expression and activity were evaluated. Using an approach of apical cell surface biotinylation, we also quantified, for the first time in native mammalian epithelial cells, the abundance of the three rENaC subunits in the plasma membrane of ATII cells and evaluated whether it was altered by moderate hypoxia or β2-agonists. The procedure of ATII cell isolation from pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats accorded with legislation currently in force in France and animal welfare guidelines (Ministère de la Pêche et de l'Agriculture, agreement 5669). ATII cells were isolated from adult rats (200–250 g) by elastase digestion of lung tissue followed by sequential filtration and differential adherence on bacteriological dishes as previously described (12Planès C. Escoubet B. Blot-Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Farman N. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 508-518Google Scholar). Cells (purity, >80%; viability, >95%) were seeded either onto Transwell/Snapwell (polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 0.4 μm; Costar, Cambridge, MA) filters or onto 6- or 12-well plastic culture dishes and cultured in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in DMEM containing 25 mm d-glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 23.8 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. On day 3 after isolation, 1 μm dexamethasone was added to the culture medium, and fetal bovine serum concentration was reduced to 5%. The experiments were performed 4–6 days after isolation. 4–5 days after plating, the cell medium was removed and replaced by 0.2 ml/cm2 of fresh medium to decrease the diffusion distance of the ambient gas. The cells were placed in a humidified airtight incubator with inflow and outflow valves, and the hypoxic gas mixture containing 3% O2, 5% CO2, 92% N2 was flushed at 5 liters/min for 20 min before the airtight incubator was sealed and kept at 37 °C for 24 h. Control normoxic cells were maintained in a 21% O2, 5% CO2, 74% N2 humidified incubator for the same period of time. Oxygen tensions assayed in cell culture medium were ∼45 and 140 mm Hg for 3 and 21% O2, respectively. Measurements of short circuit current (I sc), transepithelial potential difference, and transepithelial resistance (R te) were performed on day 5 or 6 using a voltage-clamp system (Costar Corp.) with the apical and basolateral surfaces bathed in DMEM thermostated at 37 °C. I sc was measured every 5 min by clamping potential difference to 0 mV for 1 s, andR te was calculated fromI sc and potential difference using Ohm's law. Snapwell filters with unstable I sc or withR te < 300 Ω.cm2 were discarded. Amiloride-sensitive I sc was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (AML, 10 μm). In some experiments, the β2-agonist terbutaline (TB, 100 μm) or vehicle was added into the apical compartment, and I sc was monitored for 30–40 min before apical addition of 10 μm amiloride. Experiments were also undertaken to measure sodium influx through apical amiloride-sensitive channels in basolaterally permeabilized cells, as previously described by Guo et al. (13Guo Y. DuVall M.D. Crow J.P. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L369-L377Google Scholar). ATII cell monolayers were bathed with an apical compartment solution containing 145 mm Na+, 5 mm K+, 125 mm Cl−, 1.2 mmCa2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, 25 mm HCO3−, 3.3 mm HPO4−, 0.8 mm HPO42−, 10 mm mannitol (pH 7.4), and a basolateral compartment solution containing 25 mm Na+, 5 mmK+, 125 mm Cl−, 1.2 mmCa2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, 25 mm HCO3−, 3.3 mm HPO4−, 0.8 mm HPO42−, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4) and 120N-methyl-d-glucamine (an impermeant cation) for 20 min, before the basolateral membrane was permeabilized by basolateral addition of amphotericin B (10 μm), a monovalent ionophore. This induced a slowly developing (3–6 min) rise in I sc. Once the I screached a new steady state (I ampho,max), amiloride was added to the apical bathing solution, and the difference current, representing the amiloride-sensitive component of the Na+ current across the apical membrane (I ampho,AML), was calculated. Cells in 35-mm plastic dishes were lysed in a buffer containing 4 m guanidium thiocyanate and 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, and directly used for RNase protection assay as previously described (12Planès C. Escoubet B. Blot-Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Farman N. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 508-518Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA equivalent of 106 cells or 20 μg of yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were cohybridized with 5 × 105 cpm for rENaC probes and 5 × 104 cpm for β-actin probes 50 °C overnight. RNase digestion (RNase A, 40 μg/ml and T1, 2 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed at 30 °C for 60 min, followed by digestion with proteinase K (12.5 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 30 min. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the protected fragments were separated by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The signal was quantitated from the gel using direct radioactivity measurement with an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Actin expression was used as an internal standard because hypoxia did not significantly modify the level of actin mRNA (12Planès C. Escoubet B. Blot-Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Farman N. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 508-518Google Scholar). The results were expressed as the ratios of expression of the mRNA of interest to actin mRNA (arbitrary units). Cells in 24-mm Transwell filters were washed twice, scraped off the filters in ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors and kept on ice for 1 h. The cell lysates were then centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 15 min) at 4 °C. Samples of the supernatants (10–15 μg of protein in 1 volume of sample buffer containing 10% glycerol, 12.5% 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% of 20% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5 of 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) were resolved through 10% acrylamide gels, electroblotted, electrically transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and subsequently probed for the α-, β-, or γ-rENaC subunits. Rabbit polyclonal anti-α-rENaC, anti-β-rENaC, and anti-γ-rENaC antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution, and mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution. The specificity of antibodies against α-, β-, and γ-rENaC has previously been demonstrated by the displacement of the immunoprecipitated product with α-, β-, or γ-rENaC fusion proteins, respectively (14Duc C. Farman N. Canessa C. Bonvalet J.P. Rossier B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1907-1921Google Scholar). The anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at dilution 1:5000, and the signal was developed with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of rENaC and actin levels was obtained using NIH image software. Biotinylation and recovery of apical membrane proteins were performed with a method adapted from Gottardi et al. (15Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Google Scholar) and Hanwell et al. (16Hanwell D. Ishigawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Google Scholar). Briefly, ATII cells grown on Transwell filters were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ (PBS with 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). Apical membrane proteins were then biotinylated by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C with NHS-ss-biotin 1.25 mg/ml (Pierce) freshly diluted into biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with gentle agitation. ATII cells were rinsed with PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ + glycine (100 mm) and washed in this buffer for 20 min at 4 °C to quench unreacted biotin. The cells were then rinsed twice with PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+, scraped in cold PBS, and pelleted at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were solubilized for 45 min in 20 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with packed streptavidin-agarose beads to recover biotinylated proteins. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, and aliquots of supernatants were taken to represent the unbound, intracellular pool of proteins. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer before loading onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel as described above. To ensure the absence of leakage of biotin into the cells, we systematically verified the absence of the intracellular protein actin in biotinylated extracts. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. For functional data, one-way or two-way variance analyses were performed, and when allowed by the F value, the results were compared by the modified least significant difference. For Western blot experiments, differences between groups were evaluated with paired t tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The effects of hypoxia (3% O2) on sodium transport across ATII cell monolayers were evaluated by electrophysiological studies. Snapwell filters were mounted immediately at the end of normoxic/hypoxic exposure into a voltage clamp system, and electrophysiological measurements were performed. The mean electrophysiological values obtained from filters exposed to normoxia or hypoxia are given in Table I. Hypoxia significantly decreased base-line I sc and amiloride-sensitive I sc by 37 and 45%, respectively, but did not change the amiloride-insensitive part ofI sc. To determine whether hypoxia affected apical sodium channel activity, I sc was measured in the presence of a sodium concentration gradient across the monolayers (mucosal to serosal: 145:25 mm) after permeabilization of the basolateral membrane with amphotericin B. The addition of amphotericin B to the basolateral bath rapidly increasedI sc to a peak value (I ampho,max), as shown in Fig.1. The peak valueI ampho,max and the amiloride-sensitive part of this current (I ampho,AML), reflecting sodium influx through amiloride-sensitive channels located in the apical membranes, were both significantly decreased in cells exposed to hypoxia as compared with normoxic controls (Fig. 1).Table IEffect of moderate hypoxia on bioelectric measurements in rat ATII cell monolayersR teI scBase lineAML-sensitive(Ω · cm2)(μA/cm2)Normoxia (21% O2)738 ± 93.47.1 ± 0.735.8 ± 0.69Hypoxia (3% O2)914 ± 70.14.5 ± 0.37aSignificantly different from normoxic control (p < 0.01).3.2 ± 0.32aSignificantly different from normoxic control (p < 0.01).Confluent rat ATII cells grown for 4–5 days on snapwell filters were exposed to either 21 or 3% O2 for 24 h before bioelectric measurements were performed using a voltage clamp system.

Open table in a new tab Confluent rat ATII cells grown for 4–5 days on snapwell filters were exposed to either 21 or 3% O2 for 24 h before bioelectric measurements were performed using a voltage clamp system. The data are the means ± S.E. from six or seven filters for each condition, obtained from at least three separate primary cultures. AML-sensitiveI sc was the difference between theI sc value in the absence of amiloride (baselineI sc) and the I sc value measured after the addition of 10 μm amiloride into the apical bath. Fig.2 A shows that transcripts encoding for the three rENaC subunits were detected by RNase protection assays in ATII cells exposed to either normoxia or moderate hypoxia (3% O2 for 24h). Exposure to hypoxia did not significantly modify the levels of α-, β-, or γ-rENaC mRNAs in ATII cells, as compared with normoxic controls (Fig. 2 B). The protein levels of the three rENaC subunits were determined in whole ATII cell extracts grown on filters by Western blot experiments using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Fig.3 A). The α-rENaC antibody revealed two bands, a main band at 85 kDa (the expected size of α-rENaC) and a smaller band that migrated at 65 kDa. The β- and γ-rENaC subunits were detected as two single bands that migrated at 100 and 90 kDa, respectively, which represent the expected sizes of β- and γ-rENaC proteins. The protein levels of α- and γ-rENaC subunits (normalized to the corresponding actin signal) were not significantly modified by exposure to 3% O2 hypoxia, but the quantity of β-rENaC subunit was decreased by almost 30% (p < 0.05) as compared with normoxic controls (Fig.3 B). Biotinylation of ATII cell apical membranes was used to estimate the effect of moderate hypoxia on the amount of rENaC subunit proteins expressed at the plasma membrane. The absence of any labeling of actin, an abundant intracellular protein, in biotinylated extracts indicated that biotin did not enter the cells during the experimental procedures. As shown in Fig.4 A, biotinylated α-rENaC subunit protein was detected on Western blot as a single band of 65 kDa, a molecular mass clearly lower than that of the α-rENaC protein detected in the corresponding intracellular pool of proteins (85 kDa), as previously reported in A6 cells derived fromXenopus laevis kidney (17Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Google Scholar). The specificity of the signal was assessed by the absence of any signal with the preimmune serum and by competition experiments showing a decrease of the 65-kDa band in biotinylated extracts when the antiserum was preincubated with an excess of α-rENaC fusion protein. Crude estimation revealed that α-rENaC expressed at the apical membrane of normoxic ATII cells represented ∼20–25% of total α-rENaC pool. Biotinylated β-rENaC and γ-rENaC proteins were also detected as single bands with molecular masses similar to the signals obtained in corresponding intracellular extracts (Fig. 4 A). Biotinylated β-rENaC and γ-rENaC expressed at the cell membrane represented ∼5% of total β-rENaC and γ-rENaC cellular pools, respectively. Exposure to moderate hypoxia significantly decreased the amount of biotinylated α-, β-, and γ-rENaC subunit proteins (normalized to the content of β-actin in corresponding intracellular pool of proteins), as compared with normoxic condition (Fig. 4 B). The decrease was moderate for α-rENaC but much more severe for β-rENaC and γ-rENaC, which was sometimes undetectable in hypoxic biotinylated extracts. Hypoxia did not modify the amount of α-rENaC and γ-rENaC in intracellular extracts but decreased by ∼25% the amount of intracellular β-rENaC. The effect of TB was tested on the bioelectric properties of normoxic and hypoxic ATII cells grown on filters. As shown in Fig.5 A, the addition of 100 μm terbutaline into the apical bath induced a transient decrease in I sc that was of greater magnitude in normoxic and than in hypoxic filters (0.9 ± 0.10versus 0.4 ± 0.07 μA/cm2, respectively;p < 0.001). This decrease was followed by a gradual increase in I sc to steady state levels (I TB,max), surpassing the base line in both normoxic and hypoxic monolayers. The TB-induced increase inI sc was of greater magnitude in hypoxic cells than in normoxic cells because I TB,maxrepresented 142 ± 4.8% versus 117 ± 3.8% of base-line I sc value in hypoxic and normoxic filters, respectively (p < 0.01). As a consequence, although base-line I sc was significantly lower in hypoxic filters, I TB,max was not significantly different in normoxic and hypoxic filters (Fig.5 B). Indeed, the amiloride-sensitive component ofI TB,max was comparable in cells exposed to 3% O2 and in control cells (5.1 ± 0.26 versus5.9 ± 0.51 μA/cm2, respectively, non-significant), indicating that the β2-agonist completely reversed the hypoxia-induced decrease in sodium transport across ATII cell monolayers. To determine whether the TB-induced increase inI sc was associated in hypoxic ATII cells with an increase in apical sodium channel activity, hypoxic ATII cell monolayers treated for 40 min with 100 μm TB (or vehicle) in the presence of a mucosal to serosal sodium concentration gradient were basolaterally permeabilized with amphotericin B. Terbutaline induced as expected a progressive increase inI sc, and basolateral application of amphotericin B further increased I sc. Terbutaline increased by 48% I ampho,AML, the amiloride-sensitive part of I sc peak value following amphotericin addition, which reflects sodium influx through apical amiloride-sensitive channels, as compared with vehicle (I ampho,AML: 8.7 ± 0.56 versus5.8 ± 0.87 μA/cm2, for TB and vehicle, respectively; n = 5–6 filters for each conditions.p < 0.05). This result indicates that the reversal by TB of the hypoxia-induced decrease in transepithelial sodium transport is, at least in part, accounted for by an increase in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity. To determine whether the reversal of the hypoxia-induced decrease in amiloride-sensitive sodium transport by β2-agonists could partly result from the translocation of sodium transport proteins from cytoplasmic storage to the plasma membrane (6Snyder P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Google Scholar), we studied the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins from the cytosolic pool to the cell surface, on TB-induced I sc response in hypoxic ATII cells. Alveolar type II cells exposed to 3% O2 for 24 h were incubated for 20 min with or without BFA (1 μg/ml) before TB (or vehicle) was added to the apical bath (Fig.6 A). Brefeldin A had no significant effect per se on the basalI sc or on amiloride-sensitiveI sc measured in the absence of TB (Fig.6 B). Pretreatment with BFA completely abolished the stimulatory effect of TB on I sc. Indeed, amiloride-sensitive I sc in hypoxic cells treated with BFA and TB was not significantly different fromI sc in control hypoxic cells or in hypoxic cells treated with BFA alone. Additional experiments showed that preincubation with BFA also completely inhibited the TB-inducedI sc increase in normoxic cells (data not shown). Incubation of hypoxic ATII cells with TB immediately at the end of the 3% O2 exposure significantly increased the amount of biotinylated β- and γ-rENaC subunit proteins by 1.9- and 2.9-fold, respectively, as compared with unstimulated hypoxic controls (Fig. 7). Terbutaline did not significantly increase the amount of biotinylated α-rENaC subunit protein in hypoxic cells. In normoxic ATII cells, cell surface expression of rENaC subunits was not significantly modified by TB, because biotinylated α-, β-, and γ-rENaC in treated cells represented 114 ± 16, 126 ± 20, and 126 ± 36% of untreated normoxic controls, respectively (n = 3–4, non-significant). The present study shows that reduction of amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity in native rat ATII cells by moderate hypoxia is related to decreased expression of rENaC subunits, especially that of β- and γ-rENaC, at the apical plasma membrane. The β2-agonist terbutaline rapidly reversed the hypoxia-induced inhibition of amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity, at least in part by increasing the abundance of β- and γ-rENaC subunits in the apical membrane of hypoxic ATII cells. These results provide direct evidence that moderate hypoxia reduces the apical expression of sodium channels in ATII cells, either by decreasing the translocation of rENaC subunits from cytoplasmic pools to the plasma membrane or by increasing their rate of internalization. The results also suggest that β2-agonists stimulate sodium absorption by increasing the delivery of rENaC subunits into the plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial cells. A previous study reported that in vivo exposure of rats to moderate hypoxia (8% O2 for 24 h, equivalent to an alveolar O2 pressure of 45–50 mm Hg) reduced alveolar fluid clearance through a decrease of active sodium transport across alveolar epithelium (11Vivona M.L. Matthay M.A. Blot Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 554-561Google Scholar). This hypoxia-induced decrease in alveolar transepithelial sodium transport occurred with no change in gene expression or protein abundance of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC subunits in ATII cells, suggesting that hypoxia modifies rENaC expression at the post-translational level. Interestingly, intra-alveolar administration of the β2-agonist terbutaline rapidly and completely reversed the decrease in transepithelial sodium transport in thatin vivo study. In the present in vitro study, rat ATII cell monolayers were exposed to a moderate hypoxia (3% O2, equivalent to an O2 pressure of 45 mm Hg in culture medium) for 24 h. Hypoxia resulted in an inhibition of active transepithelial sodium transport as assessed by a 45% decrease in amiloride-sensitiveI sc, caused, at least in part, by a decrease in sodium channel activity because the amiloride-sensitive part ofI sc in basolaterally permeabilized monolayers decreased by ∼40% in hypoxic ATII cells as compared with normoxic controls. In this condition of moderate hypoxia, α-, β-, and γ-rENaC mRNA levels as well as α- and γ-rENaC subunit proteins in whole ATII cell extracts were unchanged, and only a mild decrease in the amount of β-rENaC subunit was observed. Thesein vitro results mimicked those obtained in vivoin rats exposed to 8% O2 (11Vivona M.L. Matthay M.A. Blot Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 554-561Google Scholar). They strongly suggest that inhibition of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels by moderate hypoxia occurs at the post-translational level and may involve either a decrease in the number of sodium channels in the apical membrane of hypoxic ATII cells or direct alteration of intrinsic sodium channel properties. To assess rENaC subunit protein expression at the plasma membrane of normoxic and hypoxic ATII cells, we performed experiments of biotinylation of proteins expressed at the apical cell surface. This approach was original inasmuch as, to our knowledge, it constitutes the first example of direct quantification of rENaC subunit apical expression in mammalian epithelial cells endogenously expressing ENaC. In normoxic ATII cells under steady state conditions, the apical expression of α-rENaC represented ∼20–25% of total α-rENaC cellular pool, a proportion similar to that obtained in renal amphibian A6 cells (18Weisz O.A. Wang J.-M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Google Scholar), and apical expression of β- and γ-rENaC subunits was only 5% of total cellular pools. Although biotinylated β- and γ-rENaC subunit bands migrated at the same level as intracellular β- and γ-rENaC, biotinylated α-rENaC had an apparent molecular mass (65 kDa) lower than intracellular α-rENaC (85 kDa). A similar observation has been previously made in X. laeviskidney-derived A6 cells in which the prominent fraction of α-xENaC expressed at the cell surface also had an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (17Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Google Scholar). This finding has been attributed to the fact that during its maturation, α-xENaC is prone to form disulfide bridges resistant to reducing agents, a phenomenon that induces a faster migration of the protein on SDS-PAGE and changing the apparent molecular mass to 65 kDa. Hypoxia significantly decreased the abundance of α-, β-, and γ-rENaC subunits expressed at the apical membrane of ATII cells. Interestingly, the decrease was greater for β- and γ-rENaC subunits than for the α-rENaC subunit. Although moderate, the decrease in apical α-rENaC might participate per se in the functional impairment of sodium transport, inasmuch as the expression of α-rENaC subunit is required to obtain significant channel activity inXenopus oocytes (2Canessa C. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Google Scholar). Indeed, the dramatic decrease in β- and γ-rENaC subunit expression at the cell surface suggests that the trafficking of these proteins is highly sensitive to hypoxia and that the density of β- and γ-rENaC subunits at the apical membrane of ATII cells could become critical when O2 availability is reduced. Insufficient abundance of β- and γ-rENaC subunits may lead to a decreased number of highly selective sodium channels typical of ENaC, inasmuch as the presence of the three subunits is required to form complete ENaC channels with optimal activity (2Canessa C. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, a previous patch-clamp study (19Jain L. Chen X.-J. Ramosevac S. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L646-L658Google Scholar) reported that in cultured rat ATII cells, the level of oxygenation positively influenced the expression of highly selective sodium channels over nonselective sodium channels presumably made of α-rENaC subunits alone or in association with proteins other than β- and γ-rENaC subunits (20Jain L. Chen X.-J. Malik B. Al-Khalili O. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1046-L1051Google Scholar). In the present study, the β2-agonist terbutaline added at the end of hypoxic exposure rapidly and completely reversed the hypoxia-induced decrease in transepithelial sodium transport by increasing apical sodium channel activity, in line with results obtained in hypoxic rats in vivo (11Vivona M.L. Matthay M.A. Blot Chabaud M. Friedlander G. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 554-561Google Scholar). Up to now, most studies trying to address the mechanism(s) whereby β2-agonists increase sodium absorption in native epithelial cells have been limited to a functional approach, because the very small number of ENaC channels expressed at the plasma membrane has hampered the use of traditional biochemical techniques. In native ATII cells, functional studies have provided conflicting results, attributing the effect of β2-agonists to either an increase in the number of highly selective sodium channels in the apical membrane (21Chen X.-J. Eaton D.C. Jain L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L609-L620Google Scholar), an increase in sodium channel open probability (22Yue G. Shoemaker R.L. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L94-L100Google Scholar, 23Senyk O. Ismailov I. Bradford A.L. Baker R.R. Matalon S. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1148-C1156Google Scholar), or an indirect stimulation of transcellular sodium movement through the stimulation of apical chloride conductance (24Jiang X. Ingbar D.H. O'Grady S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 276: C1610-C1620Google Scholar). Recently, using a novel approach based on the covalent modification of cotransfected ENaC subunits at the cell surface of Fischer rat thyroid epithelial cells, Snyder (6Snyder P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Google Scholar) provided convincing evidence that the cAMP-mediated stimulation of I sc resulted from an increase in the ratio of translocation versusinternalization of ENaC subunits to the cell surface. That such a phenomenon could also take place in alveolar epithelial cells endogenously expressing rENaC was supported herein by biotinylation experiments and functional data. In hypoxic ATII cells, terbutaline largely increased the abundance of β- and γ-rENaC subunit proteins at the apical cell surface, and preincubation of ATII cells with brefeldin A, a blocker of anterograde transport, completely abolished the terbutaline-induced stimulation of I sc. Moreover, the fact that the transient I scdecrease following the addition of terbutaline, which reflects chloride influx across the apical membrane (24Jiang X. Ingbar D.H. O'Grady S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 276: C1610-C1620Google Scholar), was clearly smaller in hypoxic than in normoxic monolayers rules out the possibility that the stimulation of sodium transport induced by β2-agonists in hypoxic cells was due solely to an increased driving force secondary to activation of apical chloride channels. It is interesting to note that the levels of expression of β- and γ-rENaC at the plasma membrane, which were the most affected by hypoxia, were also the most responsive to terbutaline in hypoxic cells. This finding suggests that the regulation of rENaC subunit apical expression in response to hypoxic challenge and β2-agonists was noncoordinate and that the apical expression of β- and γ-rENaC, but not of α-rENaC, may play a critical role in the regulation of sodium channel activity under hypoxic conditions. In normoxic ATII cells, only a mild and insignificant increase in rENaC subunit apical expression was evident following treatment with terbutaline, which was not surprising in view of the small magnitude of the I sc increase induced by terbutaline under normoxic conditions. This mild increase in rENaC subunit apical expression may be partly responsible for the terbutaline-induced stimulation of I sc, but we cannot exclude that additional effect(s) of β2-agonists, such as augmented sodium channel open probability, might also be involved, at least under normoxic conditions (22Yue G. Shoemaker R.L. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L94-L100Google Scholar, 23Senyk O. Ismailov I. Bradford A.L. Baker R.R. Matalon S. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1148-C1156Google Scholar). The present study has important pathophysiological and clinical implications. First, moderate to severe alveolar hypoxia occurs in virtually all critically ill patients who develop pulmonary edema. Second, alveolar hypoxia caused by exposure to high altitude may induce in susceptible subjects the development of pulmonary edema resulting from imbalance between forces that drive liquid into the airspaces and mechanisms of alveolar fluid clearance that are primarily driven by active transepithelial alveolar sodium transport. In fact, it has been recently reported that prophylactic inhalation of a β2-agonist significantly reduces the risk of high altitude pulmonary edema in susceptible subjects, most likely by up-regulating alveolar sodium and fluid transport (9Sartori C. Allemann Y. Duplain H. Lepori M. Egli M. Lipp E. Hutter D. Turini P. Hugli O. Cook S. Nicod P. Scherrer U. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1631-1636Google Scholar). The experimental data, demonstrating that terbutaline increases apical expression of sodium channel subunits in hypoxic ATII epithelial cells, provide one mechanism whereby β2-agonists may prevent the hypoxia-induced decrease in vectorial sodium transport across alveolar epithelium. They do not exclude, of course, an additional effect of β2-agonists on basolateral Na,K-ATPase activity, as previously reported (25Bertorello A. Ridge K. Chibalin A. Katz A. Sznajder J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L20-L27Google Scholar). Finally, because terbutaline, although administered at the end of a 24-h exposure to hypoxia, was able to reverse rapidly and completely the hypoxia-induced inhibition of transepithelial sodium transport in ATII cells, it is quite possible that β2-agonists could be useful not only in the prevention of high altitude pulmonary edema but also in the treatment of other causes of pulmonary edema associated with moderate to severe hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2139367421,"Innate immune functions are known to be compromised during sepsis, often with lethal consequences. There is also evidence in rats that sepsis is associated with excessive complement activation and generation of the potent anaphylatoxin C5a. In the presence of a cyclic peptide antagonist (C5aRa) to the C5a receptor (C5aR), the binding of murine 125I-C5a to murine neutrophils was reduced, the in vitro chemotactic responses of mouse neutrophils to mouse C5a were markedly diminished, the acquired defect in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production of C5a-exposed neutrophils was reversed, and the lung permeability index (extravascular leakage of albumin) in mice after intrapulmonary deposition of IgG immune complexes was markedly diminished. Mice that developed sepsis after cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) and were treated with C5aRa had greatly improved survival rates. These data suggest that C5aRa interferes with neutrophil responses to C5a, preventing C5a-induced compromise of innate immunity during sepsis, with greatly improved survival rates after CLP."

(adisintegrinand metalloprotease domain) proteins constitute a family of transmembrane glycoproteins and serve essential physiological roles in fertilization, myogenesis, and neurogenesis. These functions are due to distinct protein domains involved in cell-cell fusion, cell-cell interaction, or proteolysis of membrane proteins, a process termed ectodomain shedding (1Peschon J.J.

March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1997; 282: 1281-1284Google Scholar). To date, the family of ADAM proteinases comprises more than 30 members in different species (2Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin.

Proteolysis of membrane-bound surface molecules was also demonstrated for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (9Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T.

Catalytically active ADAMs are usually activated by furin-catalyzed removal of the prodomain or by other proprotein convertases. For cleavage by furin-like convertases or prohormone convertases, such ADAMs possess a consensus sequence RX(K/R)R localized between the pro- and metalloprotease domains. This type of activation has been demonstrated for a number of ADAM proteases, among them ADAMs 9 (12Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument- Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Google Scholar), 10 (13Anders A. Gilbert S. Garten W. Postina R. Fahrenholz F.

Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 104-110Google Scholar). Two members of the ADAM family in the mouse, ADAM8 (17Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Google Scholar) and ADAM28 (18Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Google Scholar), do not contain the consensus sequence for activation by furin-like proteases. In ADAM28, a recently cloned ADAM, a point mutation from glutamate 343 to alanine in the catalytic domain prevents prodomain removal, suggesting an autocatalytic mechanism for the protease activation (18Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Google Scholar). Up to now, the mechanism of activation of ADAM8 is unknown. In matrix metalloproteases and in the snake venom metalloprotease Adamalysin II, the free sulfhydryl of the cysteine switch residue in the prodomain is thought to bind to the Zn2+ ion in the catalytic site. This interaction between the prodomain and the active site appears to inhibit the catalytic site and acts as an intramolecular chaperone, allowing the pro- and the metalloprotease domain to fold properly during transport through the secretory pathway (19Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Google Scholar). In addition to their proteolytic properties, ADAMs are able to mediate cell-cell interactions via their disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains. A role in cell adhesion has been demonstrated for ADAM9, ADAM12, and ADAM15 (20Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Google Scholar, 21Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Google Scholar, 22Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Stephens P.E. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Google Scholar). The recombinant disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain of ADAM12 mediates cell adhesion (23Zolkiewska A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 423-431Google Scholar). Human ADAM15 is the only metalloprotease-disintegrin containing an RGD sequence within the integrin-binding loop of the disintegrin domain (24Krätzschmar J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4593-4596Google Scholar), and this has been shown to bind to the integrins αvβ3 and α5β1 (21Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Google Scholar, 25Nath D. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Google Scholar). However, although necessary for integrin binding, the tripeptide alone is not sufficient to determine specificity for cell adhesion; rather, the overall loop structure within the integrin binding loop forms the determinant for integrin binding (21Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Google Scholar). Two ADAMs, ADAM22 and 23, lacking the conserved catalytic motif are highly expressed in the CNS. Deficiency in ADAM23 leads to an embryonic lethality (26Leighton P.A. Mitchell K.J. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Pinson K. Scherz P. Skarnes W.C. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 2001; 410: 174-179Google Scholar), whereas a knockout of ADAM22 causes ataxia (27Sagane K. Yamazaki K. Miziui Y. Tanaka I. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 79-86Google Scholar), demonstrating that these ADAMs play essential roles in the CNS. ADAM8 was originally cloned as MS2 or CD156 from mouse macrophages (17Yoshida S. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Google Scholar). It is expressed in macrophages, neurons, and oligodendrocytes and is up-regulated in the CNS following neurodegeneration and subsequent activation of glia cells, astrocytes, and microglia, suggesting that ADAM8 plays a role in neuron-glia interactions (28Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Google Scholar). In rats immunized with a recombinant ADAM8 disintegrin domain, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced by myelin basic protein fragments is significantly ameliorated (29Schluesener H.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 87: 197-202Google Scholar). ADAM8 has also been implicated in the differentiation of osteoclasts, a process involving cell-cell fusion (30Choi S.J. Han J.H. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 814-822Google Scholar). These results suggest a role of ADAM8 in cell adhesion and cell fusion; however, the mechanisms of these activities are unknown. In the current study of ADAM8 we present the biochemical properties of ADAM8 with respect to catalytic activity, autocatalytic processing, and cell adhesion. Taq DNA polymerase (Master-Mix) was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and Pfupolymerase from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany). The furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) was from Bachem (Heidelberg) and biotin-NHS from Amersham Biosciences (Lund, Sweden). Recombinant TIMPs 1 and 2, the inhibitory domain of TIMP4, and BB-94 were kindly provided by Dr. Harald Tschesche (University of Bielefeld). TIMP3 was obtained from Chemicon (Heidelberg, Germany). The catalytic domain of murine ADAM8 (amino acids 190–398) with a C-terminal histidine (HIS) tag was cloned using the Escherichia coli expression vector pRSETA. ADAM8catHIS was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified from inclusion bodies using nickel-Sepharose according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). After removal of urea by dialysis against PBS, the renatured protein was used to generate polyclonal rabbit antisera. Antibodies were affinity-purified by coupling the recombinant ADAM8catHIS to a HiTrap NHS column, passing 5 ml of serum over the column, washing, and eluting specific antibodies with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. Eluted antibodies were neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, and then dialyzed into PBS. The disintegrin domain (DD) of ADAM8 (amino acid residues 406–482) was cloned using the E. coli expression vector PGEX-2T. The resulting GST-A8DD fusion protein was expressed inE. coli strain BL21 after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h. E. coli lysates were prepared and the GST fusion protein was purified on a glutathione agarose column. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against PBS. The resulting protein was used to generate a polyclonal rabbit antisera. Antibodies were affinity-purified by coupling the recombinant GSTA8DD protein to a HiTrap NHS column, passing 5 ml of serum over the column, washing, and eluting with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. Eluted antibodies were neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl and then dialyzed into PBS. To remove anti-GST antibodies and cross-reacting antibodies, the affinity-purified antibody was passed over an additional HiTrap NHS column to which a similarly expressed and purified ADAM15 GST-DD had been coupled. The flowthrough was collected and shown to be specific for GSTA8DD compared with the ADAM15 GST-DD in an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assay. Affinity-purified antibodies were stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Antibody a-CTD was generated as described (28Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Google Scholar) and was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures and were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) containing 5% FCS and 1% glutamine. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% FCS and 1% glutamine. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or by the calcium phosphate technique. Stable 1321N1 transfectants were selected with 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 mm 1,10-o-phenanthroline, 10 mmEGTA, and CompleteTM EDTA-free inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim). The samples were incubated on ice for 1 h. After sonification, cell lysates were further enriched by ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Braunschweig, Germany). Proteins bound to ConA-Sepharose were washed 2× with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 and were eluted either with 100–200 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (for direct analysis) or with 100–200 μl of 0.2 mα-methylmannoside (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) plus inhibitor mixture to recover active protease. Where indicated, samples were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH) or PNGaseF (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of soluble ADAM8 proteins, cell supernatants from transfected cells were collected after adding serum-free medium 24 h before cell harvest. Supernatants were concentrated ∼10-fold by using YM columns (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) and ConA-Sepharose. Samples were run on 7.5–10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Nylon membranes (Biodyne B, PALL, Portsmouth, UK) by electroblotting. After staining with 1% (w/v) Ponceau solution, proteins were subjected to immunoblotting by blocking with 5% milk powder overnight and antibodies were used in a 1:1000 dilution (pc antibodies) or 1:50 (monoclonal a-FLAG antibody) (31Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar). Detection of the proteins was performed with anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP or anti-mouse-IgG-HRP (1:4000 to 1:5000, Sigma) using LumiLight Plus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the chemiluminescent substrate. A full-length mouse ADAM8 cDNA (2481 bp) was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase with proofreading activity with the following primers: A8 fw, 5′-ATG CTT GGC CTC TGG CTG CTC AG-3′; A8 rev (FLAG sequence in italics), 5′-TCAGAT CTC CTG AGG CTT AAA CTG AGG GAA GGA CCT CTT CTG GAT GGG-3′. At the 3′-end, we used an oligonucleotide encoding 10 additional amino acids (SFPQFKPQEI, “Bi-Pro” FLAG) (29Schluesener H.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 87: 197-202Google Scholar) for immunodetection. The resulting PCR product (“A8cF”) was cloned in the mammalian expression vector pTARGET (Promega, Heidelberg). Additional constructs with domain deletions or mutations in the catalytic domain were derived by PCR with A8 fw and the following primers: A8EC, 5′-TCA-FLAGsequence-ACA GTT GGG TGG TGC CCA GCC-3′; A8MP, 5′-TCA-FLAGsequence-CAC GAA CCG GTT GAC ATC TGG-3′. For introducing the point mutation glutamate to glutamine (E330Q), the amplification product of the primer pair A8fw and EQA8 (5′-CCA GGT TGT GGC CCA GCT GAT G-3′) was used as a sense primer in conjunction with the A8rev primer for amplification of full-length EQ-A8cF or primer A8MP for the soluble EQ-A8MP construct. For generation of the construct A8-ΔDD, the amplification products of the primer pair A8fw and A8ΔDD, 5′-TCT AGA CAC GAA CCG GTT GAC ATC TGG-3′, as well as sA8ΔDD, 5′-TCT AGA TGC CCA GGG GGC TAC TGC TTT-3′, and A8rev were subcloned in the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and the fragments were ligated together by the extra XbaI site, thereby introducing two additional residues, serine and arginine. Cells grown on collagen-coated coverslips were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 min at room temperature. To detect ADAM8, we used polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain (a-CTD, 1:500 in PBS) (28Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Google Scholar), the disintegrin domain (a-DD, 1:200), or an antibody against the catalytic domain of ADAM8 (a-MP, 1:200) for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. As secondary antibody, we used a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Cy3 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Fluorescent stainings were visualized using an Axiophot fluorescence microscope or by confocal laser microscopy (TCS SP2, Leica, Germany). Images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Transfected COS-7 cells were grown to confluency on 90-mm plates, washed with PBS at 4 °C, and incubated for 45 min with the non-membrane-permeant biotinylation reagent NHS-LC biotin (Pierce, Bonn, Germany) at room temperature. After washing with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitors. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bi-Pro antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) (32Giesemann T. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Rothkegel M. Bartsch J.W. Buchmeier S. Jockusch B.M. Jockusch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37908-37914Google Scholar). After elution with 2× Laemmli buffer, the samples were applied on SDS-PAGE gels, and the ADAM8-specific bands were detected by Western blotting and staining with a-CTD (1:1000) or streptavidin-HRP (1:1000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNA fragment encoding the A8 DC domain was generated by PCR using PlatinumTM Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following primers: DCE-A8f, 5′-GGT GGC CCT GTG TGT GGA AAC-3′; DCE-A8r, 5′-TAC ACA GTT GGG TGG TGC CCA-3′. The resulting cDNA fragment was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHis2 (Invitrogen) containing a C-terminal Myc and His6 tag. This vector was transformed into E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen). Recombinant protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h to overnight. Purification of the recombinant DCE domain was done using the XpressTM system protein purification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for native protein preparations. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with constructs encoding various forms of C-terminally FLAG-tagged soluble catalytic domain lacking the transmembrane domain (see Fig. 1). The cells were grown to confluency, and 24 h before harvest, growth medium was exchanged by serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The supernatants were collected and concentrated by centrifugation on Amicon YM-30 (Millipore) columns. The concentrated supernatants were further purified by affinity purification with ConA-Sepharose or as Fc fusion protein by protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The purity of soluble proteases was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and concentrations were determined using the BCA reagent. Further supplies of the ADAM8 catalytic domain expressed as an Fc fusion were generated essentially as described previously for ADAM17 (33Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Google Scholar). PCR-amplified DNA encoding the prepro-catalytic domain was inserted upstream of an enterokinase cleavage site ([V405 in ADAM8V]DDDDK−) followed by the human IgG1 heavy chain constant region, hinge, CH2, and CH3 in vector pEE12. Following stable transfection of NSO myeloma cells (31Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar), conditioned media were incubated with protein A-Sepharose from which ADAM8 was eluted following washing and cleavage with recombinant enterokinase (33Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Google Scholar). Purified A8 proteins were incubated with 1–10 μg of bovine myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in the presence of 100 μm ZnCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, and EDTA-free inhibitor MixtureTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digestion products were analyzed on 15% PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. ADAM8 protease activity was measured by monitoring the cleavage of the quenched fluorescent peptide [Suc-H-(Mcp)-GSLPQKSH-K(Dpa)-R-amide] substrate. Assays were performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 1 μg of ADAM8, 10 mm HEPES, 0.98 mm CHAPS, and 2% Me2SO at pH 7.5. After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the increase in fluorescence (λ excitation: 340 nm; λ emission: 405 nm) associated with peptide cleavage was measured with a fluorometer system LB-970 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). To determine the IC50 values, test compounds were prepared at an initial concentration of 1.5 mm in 100% Me2SO, then diluted in assay buffer to 0.3 mm. Further dilutions were made in assay buffer containing 20% Me2SO, prior to diluting 10-fold into the assay, to allow testing across the range 1 nm to 30 μm. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism. Data were fitted by using non-linear regression analysis. For preparation of sequencing samples, cell lysates from ten 150-mm plates of COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the complete A8 protein were lysed with RIPA buffer (see above). After ConA-Sepharose purification and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody 4A6 (31Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar), samples were run on an SDS-PAGE gel in borate buffer (50 mmH3BO3, pH 9.0, 20% ethanol, 1 mmdithiothreitol). After electrophoresis, samples were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Porablot, Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany) and stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or anti-A8-CD. For N-terminal sequencing, ADAM8 bands were cut out and applied on a protein sequencer (Knauer, Germany). Usually, 5 cycles of automated Edman degradation were run to obtain sufficient sequence information. Cell adhesion was tested essentially as described previously (23Zolkiewska A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 423-431Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were covered with the indicated amount of recombinant protein in PBS at 4 °C for 16 h. After blocking with bovine serum albumin for 1 h, 105 cells in PBS or medium (with 5% FCS) were seeded onto the plates. For blocking experiments, cells were incubated prior to seeding with a-DD (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were rinsed 3× with PBS, and the remaining cells were quantified by counting 10 randomly chosen viewing fields (100-fold magnification) or by quantification through SDS-PAGE. The 100% value of cell adhesion was obtained by allowing 105 cells to adhere completely. Transiently transfected cells were co-transfected with a GFP vector, and the amount of GFP+ cells was counted in comparison to the total number of GFP+ cells seeded into control wells. The construct A8cF (Fig. 1) contains the complete cDNA sequence of mouse ADAM8 with 826 amino acids. For immunodetection and affinity purification, A8cF contains an additional FLAG sequence (F) of 10 amino acids derived from birch pollen profilin (“BiPro-flag”) (31Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Google Scholar). Upon expression of the full-length construct A8cF in COS-7 cells, three bands representing ADAM8 protein were observed in cell lysates: 1) a proform of Mr 120,000; 2) a processed form with an Mr of 90,000, which is consistent with propeptide removal; 3) a “remnant” form of ADAM8 protein with an apparent molecular weight of ∼60,000 (Fig. 1B). The remnant ADAM8 protein has been detected even in the permanent presence of protease inhibitors during the preparation of the cell lysates and was found to be abundant in all tissues and cells expressing ADAM8 investigated to date (28Schlomann U. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Yamamoto S. Jockusch H. Bartsch J.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7964-7971Google Scholar). As expected, a-MP detected only pro-ADAM8 and the 90-kDa processed form (Fig. 1B), but not the remnant ADAM8 protein, which lacks the catalytic domain. To investigate the maturation of ADAM8, we performed Western blot analysis with an EndoH-treated sample of ADAM8 expressing COS-7 cells. Only pro-ADAM8 was sensitive to EndoH, whereas the mature and the remnant form of ADAM8 were EndoH-resistant. An identical sample cleaved with PNGaseF, which removes most or all carbohydrate moieties, showed a shift of all three ADAM8 bands, demonstratingN-glycosylation (Fig. 2A). From surface-biotinylated COS-7 cells, only the processed forms of ADAM8 with molecular masses of 90 and 60 kDa were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B), indicating that prodomain removal occurs intracellularly. Taken together these results suggest that the observed processing of ADAM8 occurs by prodomain removal during passage through the secretory pathway. ADAM8 contains a non-perfect consensus cleavage sequence for furin (RETR in amino acid position 193). A specific inhibitor of furin-like proteases (decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone) did not to inhibit the processing of A8cF in COS-7 cells, even in high concentrations of 50 μm(Fig. 3A). This finding suggested tha"
https://openalex.org/W2129080285,"Recycling of endocytosed membrane proteins involves passage through early endosomes and recycling endosomes. Previously, we demonstrated a role for clathrin-coated vesicles in transferrin receptor recycling. These clathrin-coated vesicles are formed from recycling endosomes in a process that was inhibited in dynamin-1<sup>G273D</sup>-overexpressing cells. Here we show a second transferrin recycling pathway, which requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Two unrelated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, retained endocytosed transferrin in early endosomes but did not affect transfer through recycling endosomes. The inhibitory effects of LY294002 and dynamin-1<sup>G273D</sup> on transferrin recycling were additive. In combination with brefeldin A, a drug that prevents the formation of clathrin-coated buds at recycling endosomes, LY294002 inhibited transferrin recycling synergistically. Collectively, these data indicate two distinct recycling pathways. One pathway involves transfer from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, from where clathrin/dynamin-coated vesicles provide for further transport, whereas the other route bypasses recycling endosomes and requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1985155082,"We found that a polycistronic operon (ywfBCDEFG) and a monocistronic gene (ywfH) are required for the biosynthesis of bacilysin in Bacillus subtilis. The disruption of these genes by plasmid integration caused loss of the ability to produce bacilysin, accompanied by a lack of bacilysin synthetase activity in the crude extract. We investigated the regulatory mechanism for bacilysin biosynthesis using the transcriptional lacZ fusion system. The transcription of these genes was found to be induced at the transition from exponential to stationary phase. Induction of transcription was accelerated by depleting a required amino acid, which was done by transferring the wild-type (rel +) cells to an amino acid-limited medium. In contrast, no enhancement of the gene expression was detected in relA mutant cells. In wild-type (rel +) cells, a forced reduction of intracellular GTP, brought about by addition of decoyinine, which is a GMP synthetase inhibitor, enhanced the expression of both theywfBCDEFG operon and the ywfH gene, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in bacilysin production. Disruption of thecodY gene, which regulates stationary phase genes by detecting the level of GTP, also induced transcription of these genes. In contrast, the expression of ywfBCDEFG inrelA cells was not activated either by decoyinine addition or codY disruption, although the expression ofywfH was induced. Moreover, the codY disruption resulted in an increase of bacilysin production only inrel + cells. These results indicate that guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate (ppGpp) plays a crucial role in transcription of the ywfBCDEFG operon and that the transcription of these genes are dependent upon the level of intracellular GTP which is transmitted as a signal via the CodY-mediated repression system. We propose that, unlike antibiotic production in Streptomyces spp., bacilysin production inB. subtilis is controlled by a dual regulation system composed of the guanine nucleotides ppGpp and GTP. We found that a polycistronic operon (ywfBCDEFG) and a monocistronic gene (ywfH) are required for the biosynthesis of bacilysin in Bacillus subtilis. The disruption of these genes by plasmid integration caused loss of the ability to produce bacilysin, accompanied by a lack of bacilysin synthetase activity in the crude extract. We investigated the regulatory mechanism for bacilysin biosynthesis using the transcriptional lacZ fusion system. The transcription of these genes was found to be induced at the transition from exponential to stationary phase. Induction of transcription was accelerated by depleting a required amino acid, which was done by transferring the wild-type (rel +) cells to an amino acid-limited medium. In contrast, no enhancement of the gene expression was detected in relA mutant cells. In wild-type (rel +) cells, a forced reduction of intracellular GTP, brought about by addition of decoyinine, which is a GMP synthetase inhibitor, enhanced the expression of both theywfBCDEFG operon and the ywfH gene, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in bacilysin production. Disruption of thecodY gene, which regulates stationary phase genes by detecting the level of GTP, also induced transcription of these genes. In contrast, the expression of ywfBCDEFG inrelA cells was not activated either by decoyinine addition or codY disruption, although the expression ofywfH was induced. Moreover, the codY disruption resulted in an increase of bacilysin production only inrel + cells. These results indicate that guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate (ppGpp) plays a crucial role in transcription of the ywfBCDEFG operon and that the transcription of these genes are dependent upon the level of intracellular GTP which is transmitted as a signal via the CodY-mediated repression system. We propose that, unlike antibiotic production in Streptomyces spp., bacilysin production inB. subtilis is controlled by a dual regulation system composed of the guanine nucleotides ppGpp and GTP. guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid electrospray ionization mass spectrometry high performance liquid chromatography The stringent response is one of the most important adaptations, by which bacteria have to survive in a nutrient limited environment. This response leads to the repression of stable RNA synthesis (rRNA and tRNA) and gene expression for various translational factors and ribosomal proteins. The stringent response also activates the expression of certain genes, including the amino acids biosynthesis genes. Numerous studies have indicated that the stringent response depends on a transient increase of the hyperphosphorelated guanosine nucleotides, guanosine 5′-diphosphate 3′-diphosphate (ppGpp),1 in response to the binding of uncharged tRNA to the ribosomal A site (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Mutant cells that are unable to repress stable RNA synthesis under depleted amino acid conditions have been termed “relaxed.” In many cases, these mutations are found in the relA gene, which encodes the ppGpp synthetase, or the relC (= rplK) gene, which codes for the ribosomal protein L11. These relaxed (rel) mutants are unable to initiate ribosome-mediated synthesis of ppGpp (2Swanton M. Edlin G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Smith I. Paress P. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4008-4016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the RelA and L11 proteins are thought to be essential mediators, which signal cessation to the transcriptional machinery. ppGpp inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the GMP synthesis pathway, resulting in a rapid reduction in the level of GTP (6Ochi K. Kandala J. Freese E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1062-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even under nutrient excess conditions, the accumulation of ppGpp caused by amino acid depletion results in the reduction of intracellular GTP and eventually leads to the induction of sporulation and genetic competence development in the stringent (rel +) but not in the relaxed (relA) strain (7Lopez J.M. Dromerick A. Freese E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 605-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ochi K. Kandala J.C. Freese E. J. Biol.

The deleterious effects of the relA mutation can be repaired by addition of decoyinine, a GMP synthetase inhibitor, or by inactivation of CodY, which regulates the expression of various stationary phase genes by detecting the level of intracellular GTP (9Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Serror P. Wong K.W. Sonenshein A.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Inaoka T. Ochi K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3923-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, a low level of intracellular GTP can stimulate the transcription of stationary phase genes, and ppGpp plays a role to accentuate the reduction in the level of GTP. Numerous microorganisms, including Bacillus subtilis, produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites often possess antibiotic activity but are not essential for the growth of a producing organism. The secondary metabolism may be taken as one of the adaptive responses to a nutrient limited environment. Working with the genera Streptomyces andBacillus, the correlation between the stringent response and antibiotic production has been established. In the absence of a functional relA or rplK gene, antibiotic production by these organisms is remarkably reduced or lost (11Chakraburtty R. Bibb M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5854-5861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Martinez-Costa O.H. Arias P. Romero N.M. Parro V. Mellado R.P. Malpartida F. J. Biol.

Therefore, the initiation of antibiotic production is considered to be positively regulated by the stringent response (15Kawamoto S. Zhang D. Ochi K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Ochi K. Zhang D. Kawamoto S. Hesketh A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 488-498PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hesketh A. Sun J. Bibb M.

B. subtilis provides a feasible system for the study of various biological functions, as denoted by the presence of a transformation system and the availability of genomic information courtesy of the completed genome project. Thus, we attempted to clarify the regulation mechanism for antibiotic production in this organism as a model for bacterial secondary metabolism. Bacilysin is one of simplest peptide antibiotics produced by B. subtilis (19Walker J.E. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is a dipeptide consisting of anl-alanine at the N terminus and an unusual amino acid,l-anticapsin, at the C terminus. Although biosynthesis of bacilysin has been studied extensively (20Sakajoh M.

Alaeddinoglu N.G. Demain A.L. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1990; 6: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), little is known about the regulation mechanism for biosynthesis. In this study, an attempt was made to identify the genes essential for bacilysin biosynthesis. Subsequently, we performed an expression analysis of these genes, mainly in relation to ppGpp and GTP. The results are discussed in the light of adaptive responses such as sporulation and competence development. The strains of B. subtilis and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains 61884 (rel +) and 61883 (relA1) are isogenic strains with respect to the relA1 mutation (8Ochi K. Kandala J.C. Freese E. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab B. subtilis strains were grown aerobically in S7N medium or L medium at 37 °C. S7N medium is a modified S7 medium (24Freese E.B. Vasantha N. Freese E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 170: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) containing 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm MOPS (adjusted pH 7.0 by KOH), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mmCaCl2, 50 μm MnCl2, 5 μm FeCl3, 2 μm thiamin, 1% glucose, 20 mm glutamate, and 0.1% nutrient broth (Difco). L medium contained the following (per liter): 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl. Tryptophan (50 μg/ml) and aspartate (2 mm for L medium or 20 mm for S7N medium) were supplemented as required into the medium. For selection of B. subtilis transformants, neomycin (4 μg/ml), and erythromycin (0.5 μg/ml) were used. For selection ofEscherichia coli transformants, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was used. To generate the TI81 strain, a DNA fragment that contained the open reading frame for ywfA (580 bp) was amplified by PCR with the primers ywfA-F (5′-ATGAACAGCAATCAAAACAATG-3′) and ywfA-R (5′-GCATTTCAAGGAGAATCAGC-3′), and cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 resulting in pCR2.1-ywfA. A 1.3-kb SmaI fragment containing the neo gene was isolated pBEST501 (25Itaya M. Kondo K. Tanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and inserted into the SspI site of pCR2.1-ywfA. The resulting plasmid pCR2.1-ywfA::neo was digested with HindIII, used to transform B. subtilis 61884, and was selected for neomycin resistance on L agar plates. The resulting B. subtilis strain TI81 was used as aywfA disruptant. For construction of strains TI91, TI92, TI112, and TI113, plasmid pMutinT3 (26Moriya S. Tsujikawa E. Hassan A.K. Asai K. Kodama T. Ogasawara N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was integrated into the ywfB gene orywfH gene on the chromosome via a single-crossover event as follows. The DNA fragment containing a partial ywfB gene orywfH gene was amplified by PCR with the following specific primer pairs: ΔywfB-F (5′-aagcttATGATTATATTGGATAATAGCATTCAG-3′) and ΔywfB-R (5′-ggatccTAGGTGAAGGATGTGAAACAAT-3′) (for ywfB), and ywfH-F (5′-aagcttCATTTTTTTCAAAGGGGTGC-3′) and ywfH-R (5′-ggatccTTATCAAATGTGTCAGGCGC-3′) (for ywfH). These primers have the HindIII or BamHI site as indicated by the lowercase boldface letters. The fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 to generate pCR2.1-ywfB and pCR2.1-ywfH, respectively.HindIII-BamHI fragments were fully sequenced to confirm correct sequence and then ligated into the corresponding restriction sites for pMutinT3, resulting in pMutinT3-ΔywfB and pMutinT3-ywfH, respectively. These plasmids were used to transform B. subtilis 61884 and were selected for erythromycin resistance on L agar plates, thus generating strains TI91 and TI112. To generate strains TI92 and TI113, strain 61883 was transformed with the chromosomal DNAs derived from TI91 and TI112, respectively. The correct constructions were confirmed by PCR analysis using the chromosomal DNA from each mutant. Antibiotic activities were determined by the paper disk-agar diffusion assay using S. aureus 209P as a test organism. B. subtilis strains were grown in S7N medium at 37 °C for 12 h with vigorous shaking. Then, cultures were diluted 50-fold in fresh S7N medium and further incubated under the same condition. The supernatants (50 μl) of the culture broth obtained after centrifugation were applied on paper disk (diameter, 8 mm; Advantec). The paper disks were then placed on a bacilysin assay plate (20Sakajoh M. Solomon N.A. Demain A.L. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1987; 2: 201-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) inoculated with S. aureus 209P. The bacilysin assay plate contained (per liter): 3.3 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O, 1 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of NaCl, 0.7 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g of trisodium citrate·2H2O, 2.4 g of sodium glutamate·H2O, 10 g of glucose, 0.025 g each of the following amino acids (arginine, cysteine, glycine, histidine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine), and 10 g of agar. If necessary, glucosamine hydrochloride was added into the agar plate at the final concentration of 1 mm. The supernatants of the culture broths (each 50 ml) for strains 61884 and 61883 obtained after centrifugation were freeze-dried using a vacuum pump. The residual material was dissolved in 5 ml of water and put through reverse phase HPLC (Capcell pack C18 UG120 column, 15 × 250 mm, Shiseido) using water as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The fraction containing antibiotic activity (from the 61884 broth) was freeze-dried and analyzed by ESI-MS (Thermo Quest LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source, Thermo Quest). No any antibiotic activity was detected in other HPLC fractions. The fraction for 61883 was collected at the same elution time when bacilysin was detected for 61884. Because anticapsin is not commercially available, we prepared it from the S. griseoplanus NRRL3507 culture broth using a method described previously (27Shah R. Neuss N. Gorman M. Boeck L.D. J. Antibiot. 1970; 23: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Anticapsin was purified, and its structure was confirmed by ESI-MS spectrometry analysis (data not shown). The activity of bacilysin synthetase was detected using the method described by Sakajoh et al. (20Sakajoh M. Solomon N.A. Demain A.L. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1987; 2: 201-208Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bacilysin activity in cell-free extracts was detected using the bacilysin assay plate. β-Galactosidase assay was carried out as described by Miller (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The specific activity was expressed as [absorbance at 420 nm (A 420) per minute per milliliter of culture per A 650] × 1000. Cells were inoculated into S7N medium, grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking, and harvested at time 0 (the time point of transition from exponential to stationary phase), at which time point A 650 was ∼1.0. The total cellular RNA was prepared using the Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene). The resulting RNA sample (15 μg for ywfBCDEFG and 5 μg forywfH) was electrophoresed after denaturation with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide, transferred on a membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences), and then hybridized with an RNA probe. RNA probes for ywfB and ywfH were prepared using T7 RNA polymerase with pCR2.1-ywfB and pCR2.1-ywfH as the template, respectively. DIG RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics and used for labeling. When the B. subtilis wild-type (rel +) strain 61884 was grown in S7N medium, cells produced an antibiotic against S. aureus after 8 h of incubation (Table II). On the other hand, antibiotic production by the isogenic relAmutant 61883 was significantly lower than that of 61884. Antibiotic production by 61884 (but not 61883) increased 3–5-fold when cells were first grown to middle exponential phase with a sufficient amount of aspartate (20 mm) and then transferred to the same media except containing a limiting amount of aspartate (2 mm). This down-shift condition, which provoked a stringent response, was accompanied by a temporal increase of ppGpp (from 4 pmol/AM600 to 90 pmol/AM600) and 5-fold decrease of GTP (8Ochi K. Kandala J.C. Freese E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6866-6875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ochi K. Ohsawa S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2473-2482PubMed Google Scholar). (AM is the amount of cells that would produce an A 650 = 1 if suspended in 1 ml.) B. subtilis produces the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin, which interferes with glucosamine synthesis (29Kenig M. Abraham E.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 94: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As expected, antibacterial potency was negated by the addition of glucosamine into the assay plate (data not shown). Further evidence came from mass-spectrometric analysis. We isolated the fraction containing antibiotic activity by reversed phase HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed this sample by ESI-mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 A). The peak atm/z 271.1, which represents the mass of bacilysin [M + H]+, was detected at a high intensity in the sample prepared from the 61884 culture extract. ESI-MS/MS of the protonated molecule of bacilysin, which was used as a precursor ion, revealed fragment ions derived from cleavage of the amide bond at m/z200 (corresponding to the protonated molecule of anticapsin) and atm/z 182 (corresponding to the mass of dehydrated anticapsin) (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the peak corresponding to [M + H]+ of bacilysin was not detected when a sample from therelA strain (61883) was analyzed (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the antibiotic produced by B. subtilis61884 is bacilysin and its production is dependent on the stringent response.Table IIAnalysis of culture broths for bacilysin titer and of cell extracts for basilysin synthetase activityStrainRelevant genotypeBacilysin titer2-aCells were grown for 8 h in S7N medium, and each culture broth was appropriately diluted and applied onto a paper disk.

Open table in a new tab The alanine-anticapsin ligation is thought to be the final step in the bacilysin biosynthesis pathway. B. subtilis mutant ng79 shows neither a detectable amount of bacilysin in the culture broth nor alanine-anticapsin ligase (bacilysin synthetase) activity because of abac-1 mutation (22Hilton M.D. Alaeddinoglu N.G. Demain A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1018-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the bac-1 mutation in ng79 exists between the ctrA and sacA loci (22Hilton M.D. Alaeddinoglu N.G. Demain A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1018-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we utilized this fact to find the gene with bac-1mutation. We inserted a neomycin-resistant gene (as a selectable marker) within the ywfA gene, which is located in thectrA-sacA region. Disruption of ywfAgene did not affect bacilysin production (Fig. 2). Strain ng79 was then transformed with the DNA from the ywfA disruptant strain TI81, and antibiotic productivity of the resulting transformants were examined. Because 63% of transformants (19/30) produced antibiotic, we deduced that thebac-1 mutation is located in the polycistronic operonywfBCDEFG (previously designatedipa80/85d; Ref. 30Glaser P. Kunst F. Arnaud M. Coudart M.P. Gonzales W. Hullo M.F. Ionescu M. Lubochinsky B. Marcelino L. Moszer I. Presecan E. Santana M. Schneider E. Schweizer J. Vertes A. Rapoport G. Danchin A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore sequenced theywfBCDEFG genes in ng79 and compared the data with the sequence of the parent strain PY79, and found three point mutations,ywfC118 (C352 to T, Pro-118 to Ser), ywfD178(C532 to T, Arg-178 to Trp), and ywfE179 (C536 to T, Pro-179 to Leu). Of these mutations, introduction of the ywfE179mutation with ywfA::neo into 61884 (TI94) resulted in the loss of bacilysin production (Fig. 2), as well as bacilysin synthetase activity (Table II). It remained unknown whether ywfC118 and ywfD178 lesions are responsible for the loss of bacilysin production in ng79. For further analysis, we constructed ywfB disruption mutants, which carry an IPTG-dependent ywfCDEFG, andywfH interruption mutants, which carry an IPTG-dependent ywfH. The pMutinT3-derived plasmids used for these constructions allowed the creation of a transcriptional element fusing the target gene promoter to thelacZ gene. This made it possible to control the expression of downstream gene(s) that may belong to the same operon via the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter. In the absence of IPTG, the constructed mutants TI91 (ywfB::pMutinT3) and TI112 (ywfH::pMutinT3) did not produce any antibiotic activity (Fig. 2) or any detectable bacilysin synthetase activity (Table II). Even in the presence of IPTG, antibiotic production of these mutants was not re-acquired, although the mutants did give rise to a detectable amount of bacilysin synthetase activity (Table II). These results indicate that the YwfB protein is essential for bacilysin production but not for alanine-anticapsin ligation because the mutant TI91 has the disrupted ywfB gene. On the other hand, YwfE and YwfH can be assigned to be involved in the alanine-anticapsin ligation (Table II). No restoration of antibiotic production in the ywfH interruption mutant, even in the presence of IPTG, may indicate that a greater amount of theywfH gene product is required for bacilysin production. Although the induction of antibiotic production and sporulation often start concomitantly, implying a mechanistic connection of these two processes, the bacilysin nonproducing mutant sporulated as well as wild-type strain, producing 3 × 108 spores/ml after 30 h of incubation in S7N medium as examined with strain TI94. To analyze the expression of bacilysin biosynthesis gene, we constructed transcriptional lacZfusion elements to each promoter. In the rel +strain, expression of ywfB and ywfH were induced at the transition between exponential and stationary phase during growth in S7N medium (Fig. 3,A and B). However, expression of ywfBin the relA strain was much less compared with therel + strain (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, virtually no difference in the expression of ywfH was observed between the rel + and relAstrains (Fig. 3 B). As demonstrated by lacZ fusion analysis, the target gene was inactivated upon plasmid integration, which might influence its own expression. Therefore, we analyzed the level of transcripts directly by Northern blotting using probes forywfB and ywfH. The ywfBCDEFGtranscript (6.7 kb) was detected onl"

As CYP mono-oxygenases activity is frequently altered during disease, we tested our hypothesis that CYP mono-oxygenase expression and testosterone metabolism are altered in cardiac hypertrophy. We investigate major CYP mono-oxygenase isoforms and other steroid-metabolizing enzymes and the androgen receptor in normal, hypertrophic, and assist device-supported human hearts and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We show increased and idiosyncratic metabolism of testosterone in hypertrophic heart and link these changes to altered CYP mono-oxygenase expression. We show significant induction of 5-alpha steroid reductase and P450 aromatase gene expression and enhanced production of dihydrotestosterone, which can be inhibited by the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor finasteride. We show increased gene expression of the androgen receptor and increased levels of lipid peroxidation in diseased hearts, the latter being markedly inhibited by CYP mono-oxygenase inactivation. We show alpha-MHC to be significantly repressed in cardiac hypertrophy and restored to normal on testosterone supplementation. We conclude that heart-specific steroid metabolism is of critical importance in cardiac hypertrophy"
https://openalex.org/W2163518354,"Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is thought to be involved in the remodeling of high density lipoproteins (HDL), which are atheroprotective. It is also involved in the metabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Hence, PLTP is thought to be an important factor in lipoprotein metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis. We have overexpressed PLTP in mice heterozygous for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, a model for atherosclerosis. We show that increased PLTP activity results in a dose-dependent decrease in HDL, and a moderate stimulation of VLDL secretion (≤1.5-fold). The mice were given a high fat, high cholesterol diet, which resulted in hypercholesterolemia in all animals. HDL concentrations were dramatically reduced in PLTP-overexpressing animals when compared with LDL receptor controls, whereas VLDL + LDL cholesterol levels were identical. Susceptibility to atherosclerosis was increased in a PLTP dose-responsive manner. We conclude that PLTP increases susceptibility to atherosclerosis by lowering HDL concentrations, and therefore we suggest that an increase in PLTP is a novel, long term risk factor for atherosclerosis in humans.

High density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; PLTP, phospholipid transfer protein; apo, apolipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDLR, LDL receptor. are believed to be protective against the development of atherosclerosis because they mediate reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. the transfer of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver (1Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Google Scholar, 2Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the molecular details and key regulatory proteins involved is incomplete (3Sviridov D. Nestel P. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 245-254Google Scholar, 4Libby P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 3N-8NScopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Google Scholar). One effector of this process is the ATP-binding cassette ABCA1, which is functionally deficient in Tangier disease (reviewed in Ref. 6Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Google Scholar). The high incidence of coronary artery disease in Tangier patients suggests an essential, protective role of HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport in the development of atherosclerosis (7Tall A.R. Wang N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1205-1207Google Scholar). However, recent results suggest that the contribution of ABCA1 to overall reverse cholesterol transport and its role in atherogenesis are primarily related to its function in macrophages (8Groen A.K. Bloks V.W. Bandsma R.H. Ottenhoff R. Chimini G. Kuipers F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 843-850Google Scholar, 9Tall A.R. Wang N. Mucksavage P. J. Clin.

Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6298-6303Google Scholar). Therefore, other potential key proteins in reverse cholesterol transport are of interest, including PLTP (11Bruce C. Chouinard R.A. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Google Scholar, 12Huuskonen J. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 269-281Google Scholar, 13van Tol A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 135-139Google Scholar). Previously, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human PLTP and showed that plasma from these animals is more effective in preventing accumulation of cholesterol by cultured macrophages (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar). We and others therefore suggested an anti-atherogenic effect for PLTP (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar, 15Albers J.J. Tu A.Y. Paigen B. Chen H. Cheung M.C. Marcovina S.M. Int. J. Clin. Lab.

On the other hand, overexpression of PLTP results in a decrease of plasma HDL levels (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27393-27400Google Scholar), which could be an atherogenic effect. Thus, it is unclear whether the net effect of high PLTP activity levels would be atherogenic or anti-atherogenic. The complete absence of PLTP activity in PLTP knockout mice inhibits HDL maturation, which results in reduced levels of plasma HDL caused by accelerated decay (19Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Google Scholar, 20Qin S. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Google Scholar). Still, PLTP knockout mice showed decreased atherosclerosis (21Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Google Scholar). This could be partly explained by the discovery of a novel, intracellular function of PLTP in hepatocytes; it was found that PLTP deficiency caused a decrease in apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins in most but not all mouse models used (21Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Google Scholar). From these results, it was concluded that PLTP is involved in VLDL secretion (21Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Google Scholar). To clearly establish the relationship between variability in PLTP activity and the development of atherosclerosis, we created a series of transgenic mice with various levels of PLTP activities. The susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis was studied in these mice and related to changes in plasma lipoproteins. The isolation of a cosmid clone with the complete human PLTP gene including its natural flanking sequences was described previously (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar). A DNA construct for the generation of mice with liver-specific expression of PLTP was generated from this cosmid using mouse albumin promoter and enhancer sequences (equivalent to construct NB (22Pinkert C.A. Ornitz D.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 268-276Google Scholar), kindly donated by Dr. R. D. Palmiter, Seattle, WA) and α-fetoprotein enhancer sequences (kindly donated by Dr. S. M. Tilghman, Princeton, NJ). The PLTP sequences upstream from exon 1 were removed, and a 2.3-kbNotI-BamHI fragment, including the albumin promoter and enhancer sequences, was cloned into the BamHI site in exon 1 of the PLTP gene. A 6.5-kb genomic fragment containing the three α-fetoprotein enhancer elements (shown to interact with the albumin promoter to result in high liver expression) (23Camper S.A. Godbout R. Tilghman S.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1989; 36: 131-143Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRV site 1.5 kb downstream of the last exon of the PLTP gene (exon 16, containing the STOP codon). The cloning strategy necessitated the replacement of the genomic sequence between the BamHI sites in exons 5 and 8 by the equivalent cDNA sequence (264 bp). Transgenic mice were obtained by microinjection of fertilized oocytes as described before (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar). The P1 transgenic line was originally described in Ref. 14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar. All of the mice used in this study were >96% C57BL/6J (N5) male mice. LDLR−/− mice in C57BL/6J were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Controls were littermates. The mice were 12 weeks old at the beginning of the diet studies. The mice were fed either a chow diet or an atherogenic high fat, high cholesterol diet containing 40% (w/w) sucrose, 15% (w/w) cocoa butter, 1% (w/w) cholesterol, and 0.5% (w/w) cholate (diet N; Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) for 12 weeks, preceeded by 2 weeks of diet containing 50% (w/w) sucrose (diet J; Hope Farms). Plasma samples were collected by orbital bleedings after fasting the animals overnight. All of the procedures in this study were in accordance with national and institutional guidelines. For RNA isolation studies, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the organs were quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was either stored at −80 °C or processed immediately. Total RNA was isolated using the Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent from Biotecx Laboratories Inc. (Houston, TX) and used as a template for reverse transcription primed by oligo(dT). RNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar). PCR products were run on polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography on Kodak BioMax MR-1 films or by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Details on the primer sets used, and PCR conditions are available upon request via E-mail. Lipoprotein fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation of plasma samples in a Beckman 42.2 Ti rotor (42000 rpm, 3 h, 12 °C) at d = 1.063 g/ml. The tubes were sliced, and two fractions were collected: VLDL + LDL, d < 1.063 g/ml; and HDL, d > 1.063 g/ml. Alternatively, the lipoprotein fractions were isolated by gradient ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW60 Ti rotor (24Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Google Scholar). The total cholesterol was measured with commercial kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PLTP activity was measured as described before (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar) and expressed as a percentage of human reference plasma (100% is equivalent to 14 μmol/ml/h). The in vivo production of triglycerides by the liver, secreted as VLDL, was measured in mice that were fasted overnight. 500 mg/kg body weight of Triton WR1339 (Tyloxapol; Sigma) was injected intravenously. At 1, 30, and 60 min after injection, 40 μl of blood was collected via orbital puncture. At 90 min after the injection, the mice were sacrificed, and an additional large blood sample was collected. From these samples, VLDL was isolated by gradient ultracentrifugation. Triglyceride levels in each of the blood samples as well as triglycerides, free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids in VLDL were determined via commercially available kits (25Lie J. de Crom R. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van Haperen R. Scheek L. Jansen H. Ehnholm C. van Tol A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 379-385Google Scholar). The accumulation of triglycerides in plasma was linear in the time period studied. From the slope, the rate of secretion was calculated and related to the body weight of the animals (n = 5–9 animals/group). A small number of animals was injected intravenously with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (ICN, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands). After 12 weeks of the high fat, high cholesterol diet, the animals were anesthesized with isofluran, the thorax was opened, and the animals were subjected to perfusion fixation through the left ventricle of the heart using phosphate-buffered 4% formalin. The heart and aortic arch were dissected and processed for cryosectioning. 10-μm cryosections of the valves in the aortic root were stained with Oil Red O and Mayer's hematoxilin. The sections were photographed with a Sony digital camera. The atherosclerotic area was measured in five sections at 80-μm intervals using the NIH Image based Scion Image image processing and analyzing software (available from www.scioncorp.com) according to Paigen et al. (26Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Google Scholar). All of values are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical analyses are from one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests performed with Intercooled Stata 6.0 software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX). To investigate variation in PLTP expression levels as a risk for the development of atherosclerosis, we generated several lines of transgenic mice overexpressing various levels of human PLTP. These mice were made with two genomic constructs in which PLTP expression is either under the control of its native promoter, resulting in the normal, multi-organ expression pattern of PLTP (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar, 16Jiang X. Francone O.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Google Scholar), or under the control of the albumin promoter together with the albumin enhancer and α-fetoprotein enhancers, resulting in expression in hepatocytes. The mouse lines with these constructs were arbitrarily called P1 or P4 (multi-organ expression) and A2 or A3 (expression in hepatocytes), respectively (Fig. 1a). The expression of human PLTP was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR, using primers specific for human PLTP. As shown in Fig. 1b, there is no signal from endogenous, murine PLTP in control, nontransgenic animals. Human PLTP mRNA can be detected in liver, adrenal glands, and lung, and, to a lesser extent, in kidney in P1 and P4 mice. A2 and A3 mice expressed the transgene predominantly in liver. The level of hepatic mRNA is much higher in the A2 and A3 lines when compared with the P1 and P4 lines. Human PLTP mRNA was also detected in lungs in the A2 line mice; however, the expression in liver is much more prominent. The expression in liver of murine PLTP, studied with primers specific for murine PLTP, and other genes encoding proteins involved in HDL metabolism were not altered by overexpression of human PLTP (Fig. 1c). Plasma PLTP activity levels in the different lines of transgenic mice ranged from 2-fold (P1 mice) to 9-fold (A2 mice) higher than the activity in wild type littermates (Fig. 2a). Cholesterol concentration decreases with increasing PLTP activity in plasma from these transgenic mouse lines to less than 10% of the normal levels in the A2 mice (Fig. 2b). Because plasma cholesterol in mice is mainly in HDL, the decrease in cholesterol should be reflected by a decrease of this class of lipoproteins. Fig. 2c confirms that the most prominent protein in HDL, apoAI, decreases with increasing PLTP activity to levels below detection in the A2 mice (Fig. 2c). In contrast to humans, mice lack substantial levels of plasma LDL and hardly develop atherosclerosis. Therefore, we cross-bred human PLTP transgenic mice into an LDLR+/− background, which has been shown to be a good model for moderate atherosclerosis development (29Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Google Scholar). This background results in an increase in PLTP activity: 360 ± 80% (n = 19) in LDLR+/− miceversus 266 ± 47% (n = 12) in wild type mice (p < 0.02; compare Fig. 3a with Fig. 2a). Also in mice with LDLR+/− background, there is an inverse correlation between PLTP activity and cholesterol levels in plasma (Fig. 3). As expected, the plasma cholesterol levels were higher in LDLR+/− mice: 3.5 ± 0.6 mm(n = 19) versus 2.2 ± 0.3 mm (n = 12) in C57BL/6J wild type mice (p < 0.0001). However, in the transgenic lines with substantially elevated PLTP levels (P4/LDLR+/−, A3/LDLR+/−, and A2/LDLR+/− mice), plasma cholesterol was decreased to levels below those found in the wild type control animals (LDLR+/+; compare Fig. 3b with Fig. 2b). Because PLTP deficiency impairs VLDL secretion by the liver (21Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Google Scholar), we tested whether overexpression of PLTP would result in increased VLDL triglyceride secretion. We made a comparison between control LDLR+/− mice and P1/LDLR+/−, which is the transgenic line with the lowest expression of PLTP, and A2/LDLR+/− mice, which have the highest expression of PLTP. In addition, hepatic expression of PLTP is greatly increased in A2/LDLR+/− mice (Fig. 1b), and thus a hepatocyte-specific effect should be highly augmented in these animals. Hepatic triglyceride secretion appeared to be increased by PLTP overexpression but only to a moderate extent (Fig. 4a). The rate of triglyceride secretion was only 1.3- and 1.5-fold higher than in control animals in P1/LDLR+/− mice and A2/LDLR+/− mice, respectively (Fig. 4b). PLTP overexpression did not induce any gross changes in the ratio of apoB100/apoB48 (Fig. 4c). The lipid composition of secreted VLDL was similar in the three groups (Fig. 4d). Subsequently, mice from each of the five groups tested in Fig. 3 were fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. The plasma levels of total cholesterol were highly increased after 4 weeks, to 13.4 ± 5.4 mm in LDLR+/− control mice (versus 3.5 ± 0.6 mm before the diet). The overexpression of human PLTP did not seem to affect this, because the high plasma cholesterol levels in the PLTP transgenic mice on the high fat, high cholesterol diet were essentially the same as in the control mice (TableI).Table IPLTP activity and plasma cholesterol in mice fed an atherogenic dietn4 weeks12 weeksPLTPTCPLTPTCVLDL/LDL TCHDL TCLDLR+/−19358 ± 9413.4 ± 5.4329 ± 13011.0 ± 2.28.2 ± 1.81.32 ± 0.51P1/LDLR+/−17762 ± 74aSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.05.10.8 ± 2.9aSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.05.662 ± 999.6 ± 3.17.9 ± 2.90.55 ± 0.23bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.P4/LDLR+/−191081 ± 256bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.12.2 ± 3.31030 ± 179cSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.001.10.7 ± 3.17.8 ± 2.30.21 ± 0.08bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.A2/LDLR+/−134023 ± 1328bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.12.3 ± 2.74583 ± 1705bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.9.6 ± 4.86.7 ± 2.90.16 ± 0.07bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.A3/LDLR+/−171088 ± 223bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.11.6 ± 4.5956 ± 245cSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.001.10.1 ± 5.27.8 ± 3.40.24 ± 0.14bSignificantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.a Significantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.05.b Significantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.01.c Significantly different from LDLR+/−,p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab At the end of the 12-week diet period, PLTP activity, total cholesterol, VLDL + LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were measured (Table I). Total cholesterol does not increase further between 4 and 12 weeks on the high fat, high cholesterol diet. There is no difference between the various genotypes. Also VLDL + LDL cholesterol is not significantly affected in any group in comparison with control mice. In contrast, HDL cholesterol is decreased in all human PLTP expressing mice in comparison with control animals. In the transgenic line with moderate expression of the PLTP transgene, P1/LDLR+/−, a 60% reduction of HDL cholesterol was observed; in the other PLTP transgenic lines, this reduction was more than 80%. Fig. 5a shows representative photographs of the aortic root sections with atherosclerotic lesions of the various groups after 12 weeks of the high fat, high cholesterol diet. Fig. 5b shows the individual and mean atherosclerotic lesion areas. In the P1/LDLR+/− mice, there is a tendency toward more severe atherosclerosis than in controls, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, in all other groups of PLTP transgenic mice, the atherosclerotic lesion area is significantly increased. The A2/LDLR+/− mice, which have the highest level of plasma PLTP activity, also have the highest atherosclerotic lesion area (p < 0.001; compared with all other transgenic lines). In the present study, we found that elevation of plasma PLTP activity has different effects on lipoproteins: secretion of VLDL is increased, whereas plasma HDL-cholesterol levels are decreased. In addition, we found a PLTP dose-dependent increase of the development of atherosclerosis. Lines A3 (hepatocyte-specific expression) and P4 (not liver-specific) have comparable plasma PLTP activity levels and show no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters studied here. Thus, the effects described in this report are likely caused by plasma PLTP, regardless of the site of synthesis. Although there is a stimulatory effect of PLTP on VLDL secretion by the liver, this effect seems to be saturated by moderately increased PLTP expression. Therefore, the effect of PLTP on VLDL secretion is an unlikely explanation for the increase in the development of atherosclerosis that we found in PLTP transgenic mice. On the other hand, plasma HDL levels are clearly related to the activity levels of plasma PLTP. In the highest expressing line of PLTP transgenic mice (A2), both HDL cholesterol and HDL protein (apoAI) were virtually absent from plasma, a result also found in adenoviral transfected mice that express very high levels of PLTP (17Ehnholm S. van Dijk K.W. van 't Hof B. van der Zee A. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Hofker M. Havekes L. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1248-1253Google Scholar, 18Föger B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Shamburek R.D. Parrot C.L. Talley G.D. Brewer H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27393-27400Google Scholar). This is explained by the surface activity of PLTP on phospholipids in the outer shell of the HDL particles, causing instability and increased HDL catabolism (18Föger B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Shamburek R.D. Parrot C.L. Talley G.D. Brewer H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27393-27400Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we found that plasma decay of labeled HDL cholesterylether is accelerated in our PLTP transgenic mice. 2R. van Haperen, A. van Tol, T. van Gent, L. Scheek, P. Visser, A. van der Kamp, F. Grosveld, and R. de Crom, unpublished results. The decrease in apoAI/HDL is probably not the result of decreased apoAI synthesis, because hepatic apoAI mRNA levels are unchanged in both of the PLTP transgenic lines (Fig. 1c). From the present studies it is clear that PLTP lowers plasma HDL in mice fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet, whereas VLDL/LDL levels remain unchanged by expression of human PLTP (Table I). There is a large body of evidence showing an inverse relationship between circulating levels of HDL and the incidence of atherosclerosic disease. Low levels of plasma HDL are generally associated with an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis. The initial finding that apoAI-deficient mice did not show atherosclerosis (30Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Google Scholar) remained a single observation, which is probably due to the fact that the mice were not backcrossed to an atherosclerosis-prone genetic background. Later it was found that apoAI deficiency does result in enhanced atherosclerosis in atherosusceptible backgrounds (31Voyiaziakis E. Goldberg I.J. Plump A.S. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Huang L.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 313-321Google Scholar, 32Hughes S.D. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1725-1729Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanism of the atheroprotective effect of HDL is complex because HDL has multiple functions that contribute to this relationship. These include a key role in reverse cholesterol transport, antioxidant effects via proteins associated with HDL like paraoxonase, and anti-inflammatory properties of HDL (4Libby P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 3N-8NScopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Tall A.R. Jiang X. Luo Y. Silver D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1185-1188Google Scholar, 34Durrington P.N. Mackness B.

Previously, we and others suggested that overexpression of PLTP resulted in an increase in the anti-atherogenic potential of HDL, because of an increased formation of pre-β-HDL in plasma (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar, 16Jiang X. Francone O.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27393-27400Google Scholar). In addition, plasma from PLTP transgenic animals was more efficient in preventing the accumulation of cholesterol by cultured macrophages (14van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Google Scholar). Still, the present study shows that atherosclerosis is increased in mice overexpressing PLTP. From these in vivoexperiments we conclude that the decrease in total HDL apparently is the deciding factor and not a possible effect on pre-β-HDL. This conclusion is corroborated by recent findings bringing the key role of pre-β-HDL in cellular cholesterol efflux under discussion (37Sviridov D. Miyazaki O. Theodore K. Hoang A. Fukamachi I. Nestel P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1482-1488Google Scholar). We conclude that high plasma activity levels of PLTP are atherogenic via a lowering effect on HDL cholesterol. The elevations in plasma PLTP activity in the transgenic mice we used started at 2-fold. Until now, such differences have not been found in humans. However, atherosclerosis is a long term process, taking several decades in humans. This process has to be accelerated to be able to do studies in genetically modified animals. Therefore, models are used with substantial overexpression, which have proven to be very informative for proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, including ABCA1 (38Joyce C.W. Amar M.J.

Science. 1996; 273: 966-968Google Scholar), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (40Herrera V.L. Makrides S.C. Xie H.X. Adari H. Krauss R.M. Ryan U.S. Ruiz-Opazo N. Nat.

Actually, PLTP transgenic mice with an elevated activity of 30% have been generated and showed no effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins (16Jiang X. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Google Scholar). Mice with only one functional PLTP allele (PLTP+/−) do not have any abnormalities in lipoproteins when fed normal chow or a high fat, high cholesterol diet (19Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Google Scholar). Therefore, physiological PLTP levels might be considered “high.” It is conceivable that moderate differences in PLTP levels found among humans might affect the life-long process of the development of atherosclerotic disease. Until now, mutations in the PLTP gene resulting in differences in PLTP activity have not been found. However, the available data show high PLTP activity levels in conditions that have been associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, i.e. diabetes type 1 and 2, and obesity (12Huuskonen J. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 269-281Google Scholar,42Riemens S. van Tol A. Sluiter W. Dullaart R. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 140: 71-79Google Scholar, 43Colhoun H.M. Scheek L.M. Rubens M.B. Van Gent T. Underwood S.R. Fuller J.H. Van Tol A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 652-659Google Scholar).

Alkaline phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1) (APs) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; GCAP, germ cell AP; IAP, intestinal AP; PLAP, placental AP; TNAP, tissue-nonspecific AP1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; GCAP, germ cell AP; IAP, intestinal AP; PLAP, placental AP; TNAP, tissue-nonspecific AP are dimeric enzymes present in most, if not all, organisms (2McComb R.B. Bowers G.N. Posen S. Alkaline Phosphatases. Plenum Press, New York1979: 986-988Google Scholar). They catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters with release of inorganic phosphate (3Schwartz J.H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mammalian APs have low sequence identity with theEscherichia coli enzyme (25–30%), but the residues involved in the active site of the enzyme and those coordinating the two zinc atoms and the magnesium ion are largely conserved, and the catalytic mechanism deduced from the structure of the E. coli AP was proposed to be similar in eukaryotic APs (4Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In humans, APs are encoded by four distinct loci. Three isozymes are tissue-specific, i.e. intestinal AP (IAP), placental AP (PLAP), and germ cell AP (GCAP). They are 90–98% homologous, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 2, bands q34-q37. The fourth AP isozyme is tissue-nonspecific (TNAP) and is expressed in a variety of tissues throughout development. TNAP is about 50% identical to the other three isozymes, and its gene is located on chromosome 1, bands p36.1-p34 (5Harris H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 186: 133-150Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar).Our current understanding of the functional properties of mammalian APs comes largely from studies using PLAP and TNAP as paradigms. Isozyme-specific properties, such as the characteristic uncompetitive inhibition properties of mammalian APs (6Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), have been attributed to a top, flexible loop (or crown domain) unique to mammalian APs. This domain is also responsible for collagen binding in the case of TNAP (9Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Lloys G.C. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) has facilitated further studies on the structure and function of mammalian APs. An analysis of the structural-functional relationship of residues conserved between the E. coli AP and the PLAP structure revealed a conserved function for those residues that stabilize the active site zinc and magnesium metal ions, whereas the non-homologous disulphide bonds differ in their structural significance and non-conserved residues take part in determining the heat stability and uncompetitive inhibition properties of mammalian alkaline phosphatases (14Kozlenkov A. Manes T. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Deactivating mutations in the TNAP gene cause the inborn error of metabolism known as hypophosphatasia (15Henthorn P.S. Whyte MP Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), characterized by poorly mineralized cartilage and bones. The severity and expressivity of hypophosphatasia depends on the nature of the TNAP mutation (16Zurutuza L. Muller F. Gibrat J.F. Taillandier A. Simon-Bouy B. Serre J.L. Mornet E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mapping of hypophosphatasia mutations to specific three-dimensional locations on the TNAP molecule has provided clues as to the structural significance of these areas for enzyme structure and function (17Mornet E. Stura E. Lia-Baldini A.S. Stigbrand T. Menez A. Le Du M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31171-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It appears clear that the function of TNAP in bone tissue consists of hydrolizing inorganic pyrophosphate to maintain a proper concentration of this mineralization inhibitor to ensure proper bone mineralization (18Hessle L. Johnsson K.A. Anderson H.C. Narisawa S. Sali A. Goding J.W. Terkeltaub R. Millán J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of the three tissue-specific human APs remains to be clarified.It has been suggested that PLAP may be involved in the transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus (12Makiya R.

Int. 2000; 63: 168-174Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Of considerable interest is the fact that human APs are abundantly expressed in tumor cells and that their serum levels are often used as tumor markers (24Millán J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Plasma TNAP levels can indicate the presence of osteosarcomas (25Farley J.R. Hall S.L. Herring S. Tarbaux N.M. Matsuyama T. Wergedal J.E. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 664-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), Paget's disease (26Deftos L.J. Wolfert R.L. Hill C.S. Horm. Metab.

Chem. 1995; 41: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PLAP is a marker of cancer of the ovary, testis, lung, and the gastrointestinal tract (28Nathanson L. Fishman W.H. Cancer (Phila.). 1971; 27: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Jacoby B. Bagshawe K.D. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 35: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Loose J.H.

Takahashi Y. Yamamura Y. Ann. Intern. Med. 1975; 83: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Although APs are homodimeric molecules, the re-expression in cancer cells of more than one AP isozyme often results in the formation and release into body fluids of heterodimeric enzymes. The Kasahara AP isoform was identified in a variety of human cancer cell lines (35Higashino K. Hashinotsume M. Kang K.-Y. Takahashi Y. Yamamura Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1972; 40: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Higashino K. Otani R. Kudo S. Yamamura Y. Clin.

Higashino K. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3408-3412PubMed Google Scholar). The human postnatal intestine also contains heterodimers of IAP and PLAP (38Behrens C.M. Enns C.A. Sussman H.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ovarian cancer cells often express both PLAP and GCAP (39Smans K.A. Ingvarsson M.B. Lindgren P. Canevari S. Walt H. Stigbrand T. Bäckström T. Millán J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and cell lines derived from these tumors have been shown to express PLAP/GCAP heterodimers (40Watanabe S. Watanabe T. Li W.B. Soong B.-W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hendrix P.G. Hoylaerts M.F. Nouwen E.J. De Broe M.E. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1793-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, no heterodimers have ever been reported between any of the tissue-specific APs and TNAP. The fact that APs can form heterodimers is of structural significance since APs are non-cooperative allosteric enzymes in which the stability and the catalytic properties of each monomer are controlled by the conformation of the second subunit (10Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This means that the properties of the heterodimeric enzymes do not correspond to the weighted average of each homodimeric counterpart. Understanding the behavior of AP heterodimers is also of biological significance since, in tissues such as the bovine intestine where up to seven IAP isozymes with differing kinetic properties are co-expressed (42Manes T. Hoylaerts M.F. Müller R. Lottspeich F. Hölke W. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23353-23360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the formation of heterodimers can give rise to significant functional complexity and novel substrate specificities.In this study, we have built three-dimensional models of GCAP, IAP, and TNAP based on the 1.8-Å PLAP structure. We have analyzed the homodimer interface and the active site cleft of each modeled isozyme structure. This analysis has allowed us to understand the restrictions observed in AP heterodimer formation, whereas also defining a fingerprint of the active site characteristic of each AP isozymeMATERIALS AND METHODSThe PLAP dimer was generated from the coordinates of the PLAP structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1EW2 (1Le Du M.H.

The GCAP, IAP, and TNAP sequences were aligned to the PLAP sequence using the program BLAST (43; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/bl2.html). The PLAP and GCAP molecules display 98% identity with no insertion or deletion relative to PLAP. The IAP and PLAP molecules show 87% identity and 91% homology with no insertion or deletion relative to PLAP. The TNAP and PLAP molecules, however, display 57% identity and 74% homology, and TNAP has four insertions of one residue, one insertion of three residues, and one deletion of two residues relative to PLAP.The GCAP, IAP, and TNAP homodimeric models and the PLAP/GCAP, PLAP/IAP, and PLAP/TNAP heterodimeric models were constructed using the sequence alignment as found with BLAST, the coordinates of the PLAP dimer, and the program MODELLER (44Sanchez R. Sali A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 143: 97-129PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of the model geometries was checked with PROCHECK (45Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Alkaline phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1) (APs) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; GCAP, germ cell AP; IAP, intestinal AP; PLAP, placental AP; TNAP, tissue-nonspecific AP1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; GCAP, germ cell AP; IAP, intestinal AP; PLAP, placental AP; TNAP, tissue-nonspecific AP are dimeric enzymes present in most, if not all, organisms (2McComb R.B. Bowers G.N. Posen S. Alkaline Phosphatases. Plenum Press, New York1979: 986-988Google Scholar). They catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters with release of inorganic phosphate (3Schwartz J.H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mammalian APs have low sequence identity with theEscherichia coli enzyme (25–30%), but the residues involved in the active site of the enzyme and those coordinating the two zinc atoms and the magnesium ion are largely conserved, and the catalytic mechanism deduced from the structure of the E. coli AP was proposed to be similar in eukaryotic APs (4Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In humans, APs are encoded by four distinct loci. Three isozymes are tissue-specific, i.e. intestinal AP (IAP), placental AP (PLAP), and germ cell AP (GCAP). They are 90–98% homologous, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 2, bands q34-q37. The fourth AP isozyme is tissue-nonspecific (TNAP) and is expressed in a variety of tissues throughout development. TNAP is about 50% identical to the other three isozymes, and its gene is located on chromosome 1, bands p36.1-p34 (5Harris H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 186: 133-150Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of the functional properties of mammalian APs comes largely from studies using PLAP and TNAP as paradigms. Isozyme-specific properties, such as the characteristic uncompetitive inhibition properties of mammalian APs (6Hummer C. Millán J.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and even their allosteric properties (10Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), have been attributed to a top, flexible loop (or crown domain) unique to mammalian APs. This domain is also responsible for collagen binding in the case of TNAP (9Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Lloys G.C. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Makiya R. Stigbrand T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of the 1.8-Å resolution structure of human PLAP (1Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) has facilitated further studies on the structure and function of mammalian APs. An analysis of the structural-functional relationship of residues conserved between the E. coli AP and the PLAP structure revealed a conserved function for those residues that stabilize the active site zinc and magnesium metal ions, whereas the non-homologous disulphide bonds differ in their structural significance and non-conserved residues take part in determining the heat stability and uncompetitive inhibition properties of mammalian alkaline phosphatases (14Kozlenkov A. Manes T. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Deactivating mutations in the TNAP gene cause the inborn error of metabolism known as hypophosphatasia (15Henthorn P.S. Whyte MP Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), characterized by poorly mineralized cartilage and bones. The severity and expressivity of hypophosphatasia depends on the nature of the TNAP mutation (16Zurutuza L. Muller F. Gibrat J.F. Taillandier A. Simon-Bouy B. Serre J.L. Mornet E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mapping of hypophosphatasia mutations to specific three-dimensional locations on the TNAP molecule has provided clues as to the structural significance of these areas for enzyme structure and function (17Mornet E. Stura E. Lia-Baldini A.S. Stigbrand T. Menez A. Le Du M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31171-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It appears clear that the function of TNAP in bone tissue consists of hydrolizing inorganic pyrophosphate to maintain a proper concentration of this mineralization inhibitor to ensure proper bone mineralization (18Hessle L. Johnsson K.A. Anderson H.C. Narisawa S. Sali A. Goding J.W. Terkeltaub R. Millán J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of the three tissue-specific human APs remains to be clarified. It has been suggested that PLAP may be involved in the transfer of maternal IgG to the fetus (12Makiya R. Stigbrand T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Makiya R. Stigbrand T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1997; 327: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and evidence has accumulated indicating a role of PLAP in cell division in normal and transformed cells (20Stinson R.A. Chan J.R.A. Adv. Prot. Phosphatases. 1987; 4: 127-151Google Scholar, 21Telfer J.F. Green C.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22She Q. Mukherjee J.J. Huang J. Crilly K.S.

Int. 2000; 63: 168-174Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Of considerable interest is the fact that human APs are abundantly expressed in tumor cells and that their serum levels are often used as tumor markers (24Millán J.L. Fishman W.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Plasma TNAP levels can indicate the presence of osteosarcomas (25Farley J.R. Hall S.L. Herring S. Tarbaux N.M. Matsuyama T. Wergedal J.E. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 664-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), Paget's disease (26Deftos L.J. Wolfert R.L. Hill C.S. Horm. Metab.

Chem. 1995; 41: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PLAP is a marker of cancer of the ovary, testis, lung, and the gastrointestinal tract (28Nathanson L. Fishman W.H. Cancer (Phila.). 1971; 27: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Jacoby B. Bagshawe K.D. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 35: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Loose J.H. Damjanov I. Harris H. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1984; 82: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). GCAP is a particularly good marker of carcinoma (in situ) of the testis (31Wahren B. Homgren P.Å. Stigbrand T. Int. J. Cancer. 1979; 24: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Jeppsson A. Wahren B. Brehmer-Andersson E. Silfverswärd C. Stigbrand T. Millán J.L. Int. J.

Pathol. 1999; 189: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and IAP is a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (34Higashino K. Otani R. Kudo S. Hashinotsume M. Hada T. Kang K.-Y. Ohkochi T. Takahashi Y. Yamamura Y. Ann. Intern. Med. 1975; 83: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although APs are homodimeric molecules, the re-expression in cancer cells of more than one AP isozyme often results in the formation and release into body fluids of heterodimeric enzymes. The Kasahara AP isoform was identified in a variety of human cancer cell lines (35Higashino K. Hashinotsume M. Kang K.-Y. Takahashi Y. Yamamura Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1972; 40: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Higashino K. Otani R. Kudo S. Yamamura Y. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and cancer sera and was later found to consist of heterodimers of the IAP and PLAP (37Imanishi H. Hada T. Muratani K. Hirano K. Higashino K. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3408-3412PubMed Google Scholar). The human postnatal intestine also contains heterodimers of IAP and PLAP (38Behrens C.M. Enns C.A. Sussman H.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ovarian cancer cells often express both PLAP and GCAP (39Smans K.A. Ingvarsson M.B. Lindgren P. Canevari S. Walt H. Stigbrand T. Bäckström T. Millán J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and cell lines derived from these tumors have been shown to express PLAP/GCAP heterodimers (40Watanabe S. Watanabe T. Li W.B. Soong B.-W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hendrix P.G. Hoylaerts M.F. Nouwen E.J. De Broe M.E. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1793-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, no heterodimers have ever been reported between any of the tissue-specific APs and TNAP. The fact that APs can form heterodimers is of structural significance since APs are non-cooperative allosteric enzymes in which the stability and the catalytic properties of each monomer are controlled by the conformation of the second subunit (10Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This means that the properties of the heterodimeric enzymes do not correspond to the weighted average of each homodimeric counterpart. Understanding the behavior of AP heterodimers is also of biological significance since, in tissues such as the bovine intestine where up to seven IAP isozymes with differing kinetic properties are co-expressed (42Manes T. Hoylaerts M.F. Müller R. Lottspeich F. Hölke W. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23353-23360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the formation of heterodimers can give rise to significant functional complexity and novel substrate specificities. In this study, we have built three-dimensional models of GCAP, IAP, and TNAP based on the 1.8-Å PLAP structure. We have analyzed the homodimer interface and the active site cleft of each modeled isozyme structure. This analysis has allowed us to understand the restrictions observed in AP heterodimer formation, whereas also defining a fingerprint of the active site characteristic of each AP isozyme MATERIALS AND METHODSThe PLAP dimer was generated from the coordinates of the PLAP structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1EW2 (1Le Du M.H.

The GCAP, IAP, and TNAP sequences were aligned to the PLAP sequence using the program BLAST (43; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/bl2.html). The PLAP and GCAP molecules display 98% identity with no insertion or deletion relative to PLAP. The IAP and PLAP molecules show 87% identity and 91% homology with no insertion or deletion relative to PLAP.

The pantothenic acid antimetaboliteN-pentylpantothenamide inhibits the growth ofEscherichia coli with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 μm. In this study, we examine the mechanism of this inhibition. Using the last five enzymes of the CoA biosynthetic pathway in E. coli we demonstrate thatN-pentylpantothenamide does not inhibit the CoA biosynthetic enzymes but instead acts as an alternative substrate, forming the CoA analog ethyldethia-CoA. We show thatN-pentylpantothenamide is converted to ethyldethia-CoA 10.5 times faster than CoA is biosynthesized from pantothenic acid, demonstrating that ethyldethia-CoA biosynthesis can effectively compete with CoA biosynthesis in the cell. We conclude that the mechanism of toxicity of N-pentylpantothenamide is most likely due to its biosynthetic conversion to the CoA analog ethyldethia-CoA, which may act as an inhibitor of CoA- and acetyl-CoA-utilizing enzymes.

Coenzyme A (CoA) 1The abbreviations used are: CoA, coenzyme A; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy; CoaA, pantothenate kinase; CoaBC, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase; CoaD, phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase; CoaE, dephospho-CoA kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1a is an essential cofactor in numerous metabolic pathways involving Claisen/aldol condensations and acyl substitutions, while the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety of CoA is used as a covalently bound cofactor in fatty acid, polyketide, and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis. Because of this metabolic centrality, the development of new antibiotics designed as inhibitors of CoA-utilizing enzymes (i.e. as CoA antivitamins or antimetabolites) may be feasible. However, while several CoA analogs have been characterized as inhibitors of CoA-utilizing enzymes in vitro (1Mishra P.K. Drueckhammer D.G. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 3283-3309Google Scholar), these analogs are not useful as antibiotics because bacteria are unable to transport CoA across the cell membrane (2Jackowski F.C.S. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar, 3Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 115-120Google Scholar). Therefore the design of CoA antimetabolites must be based on pantothenic acid 2a, the most advanced cell-permeable biosynthetic intermediate (4Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 136-142Google Scholar, 5Jackowski S. Alix J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3842-3848Google Scholar), or its precursors (see Fig. 1). Two pantothenic acid analogs have been described previously: pantoyltaurine, in which the carboxylate of pantothenic acid 2a is replaced by a sulfonate, does not inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli because it is not transported by pantothenate permease (6Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1156-1161Google Scholar); andN-pentylpantothenamide 2b, which inhibitsE. coli with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ∼2 μm (7Clifton G. Bryant S.R. Skinner C.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 523-528Google Scholar). In this study we considered two mechanisms for the antibiotic activity of N-pentylpantothenamide 2b. In the first mechanism, inhibition of CoA biosynthesis byN-pentylpantothenamide 2b or one of its metabolites would result in a decreased amount of CoA being formed in the cell and thus would retard bacterial cell growth. In the second mechanism, we considered the possibility that 2b is biosynthetically converted to the CoA analog ethyldethia-CoA, which might function as a CoA antimetabolite and inhibit CoA and acetyl-CoA-utilizing enzymes. Since the five enzymes required for the conversion of pantothenic acid to CoA (Fig. 1) have all recently been overexpressed and characterized (8Geerlof A. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2774-2778Google Scholar), we were able to differentiate between these two mechanisms in this paper. All chemicals and buffer components were purchased from Aldrich, Sigma or Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. 4′-Phosphopantetheine 5 was synthesized as previously described (12Moffatt J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 663-675Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Varian INOVA 400 MHz instrument. All HPLC analyses were performed on a HP series 1100 HPLC system with HPLC grade solvents using a Supelcosil LC-18-T 3 μm, 15 cm × 4.6 mm ID column (Supelco). ESI-MS analyses were performed at the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center on a Bruker Esquire-LC ESI-ion trap mass spectrometer by direct infusion of the analyte mixture into the instrument at a rate of 1 μl/min. Sodium pantothenate (2.0 g, 8.3 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water, and the solution was passed through an Amberlite IR-120 (H+) column. The column was subsequently washed with two column volumes of deionized water, and the combined eluates were lyophilized. The free acid obtained in this manner was dissolved in dry dimethyl formamide (10 ml), and amylamine (1.16 ml, 10 mmol) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (2.24 ml, 10 mmol) were added. The solution was cooled to 0 °C and triethylamine (1.39 ml, 10 mmol) was added. The solution was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h, followed by stirring at room temperature overnight. The volume of solvent was reduced by rotary evaporation with external heating, and the residue applied to a short silica gel column, eluting with 95:5 CH2Cl2/methanol and concentrating the eluatein vacuo to remove final traces of dimethyl formamide. The product was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with 95:5 CH2Cl2/methanol, and the fractions containing 2b were collected and were concentrated in vacuo yielding the product as a colorless oil. The oil was dissolved in deionized water and lyophilized to give 2b as a white powder (1.56 g, 65% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.45 (b, 1H), 6.14 (b, 1H), 3.98 (s, 1H), 3.56 (m, 2H), 3.47 (s, 2H), 3.21 (dt, 2H), 2.45 (t, 2H), 1.48 (m, 2H), 1.28 (m, 4H), 0.99 (s, 3H), 0.91 (s, 3H), 0.87 (t, 3H). Dibenzylchlorophosphate was preparedin situ by reacting dibenzyl phosphite (1.97 g, 6.0 mmol) and N-chlorosuccinimide (0.80 g, 6.0 mmol) in dry benzene (8 ml) for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered and added drop-wise to a solution of 2b (577 mg, 2.0 mmol) in dry pyridine (9 ml) at −40 °C (dry ice/acetonitrile). After stirring at −40 °C for 2 h, the mixture was placed in a −20 °C freezer overnight. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and was subsequently quenched with water (3 ml). The solvent was removed in vacuo and ethyl acetate (25 ml) was added. The resulting suspension was washed with 1 mH2SO4 (2 × 5 ml) and 1 mNaHCO3 (2 × 5 ml), saturated Na2SO4 (1 × 5 ml), and dried (Na2SO4), and then the solvent was removed. The product was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel with 95:5 CH2Cl2/methanol, and the fractions containing 7 were collected and concentrated in vacuo to give the product as a colorless oil (271 mg, 25% yield).1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ7.33 (m, 10H), 7.25 (b, 1H), 6.15 (b, 1H), 5.03 (m, 4H), 3.98 (dd, 1H), 3.86 (s, 1H), 3.53 (m, 3H), 3.19 (dt, 2H), 2.41 (m, 2H), 1.46 (m, 2H), 1.27 (m, 4H), 1.04 (s, 3H), 0.86 (t, 3H), 0.78 (s, 3H). Pd/C (10%, 20 mg) was added to a solution of7 (200 mg, 365 μmol) in 9:1 methanol/water (10 ml), and the suspension was hydrogenated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature for 2 h. The solution was filtered, and the solvent removed in vacuo to give 3b as a clear glass (110 mg, 82% yield). The product was dissolved in H2O, titrated to pH ∼6.0 with 1 m NaOH and stored as frozen aliquots of a stock solution (60 mm) at −20 °C.1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ3.83 (s, 1H), 3.63 (dd, 1H), 3.39 (dd, 1H), 3.30 (m, 2H), 2.95 (t, 2H), 2.76 (t, 2H), 1.28 (m, 2H), 1.08 (m, 4H), 0.77 (s, 3H), 0.69 (s, 3H), 0.67 (t, 3H). Minimal medium (0.8 mm MgSO4, 10.0 mm citric acid, 60 mmK2HPO4, 20 mmNaNH4HPO4, 0.5% glucose) (50 ml) was inoculated with 50 μl of an overnight culture of E. coli B and subsequently grown at 37 °C in the presence of varying concentrations of 2b. The A600was periodically determined until the stationary growth phase was reached in each respective culture. The minimal concentration of2b that retarded the onset of logarithmic growth under these conditions was regarded as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Pure pantothenate kinase fromE. coli (CoaA) was a gift from Suzanne Jackowski. Phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase from E. coli (CoaBC) was purified as previously described (10Strauss E. Kinsland C. Ge Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Google Scholar). Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from E. coli (CoaD) has previously been overexpressed from plasmidpUC/coaD (a gift from D. Drueckhammer) and purified (8Geerlof A. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27105-27111Google Scholar). However, as this plasmid did not encode a His-tagged protein,pUC/coaD was treated with NdeI andBamHI, and the resulting coaD-containing fragment was cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The sequence of the resulting plasmid, designated pESC106, was verified by automated DNA sequencing (Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center) and was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). To obtain pure protein E. coli BL21(DE3) pESC106 was grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of LB broth supplemented with 15 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate toA600 ∼0.6 and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After growing overnight at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, suspended in sonication buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mNaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 ml/g cell paste), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 35,000 × gfor 30 min to clarify the cell-free extract. This was applied to a 2-ml His-Bind column (Novagen). Weakly bound proteins were removed by washing with sonication buffer, followed by sonication buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. CoaD was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 0.5 m. The chromatography was monitored at A280. Dephospho-CoA kinase from E. coli (CoaE) has previously been overexpressed as a non-fusion protein usingpET/coaE (a gift from D. Drueckhammer) (11Mishra P.K. Park P.K. Drueckhammer D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2774-2778Google Scholar). To obtain the His-tagged protein, the coaE (previously yacE) gene was amplified by PCR using as the forward primer: 5′-CCGGGAATATAACATATGAGGTATATAGTTGCC-3′, to introduce anNdeI site (underlined) at the start of the gene, and as the reverse primer: 5′-AAAGGACCTGGATCCGCATTACGG-3′ to introduce a BamHI site (underlined) at the end of the gene. The resulting PCR product was cloned intoNdeI/BamHI-digested pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The sequence of the resulting plasmid, designatedpESC124, was verified by automated DNA sequencing (Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center) and was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). To obtain pure protein, E. coli BL21(DE3) pESC124 was grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of LB broth supplemented with 15 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate toA600 ∼0.6, and induced with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After growing overnight at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, suspended in sonication buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 ml/g cell paste), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 30 min to clarify the cell-free extract. This was applied to a 2.5-ml His-Bind column (Novagen). Weakly bound proteins were removed by washing with sonication buffer, followed by sonication buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. CoaE was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 0.5 m. The chromatography was monitored at A280. HPLC analysis of reaction mixtures containing CoA analogs was performed using 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, containing increasing amounts of methanol as follows: 0–3 min, isocratic, 5% MeOH; 3–5 min, 5–10% MeOH; 5–10 min, 10–15% MeOH; 10–13 min, 15–30% MeOH; 13–26 min, isocratic, 30% MeOH. Chromatography was monitored at 254 nm. Retention times: CTP, CDP, CMP, 1.6–1.9 min; ATP, ADP, AMP, 2.3–3.0 min; coenzyme A1a, 12.0 min; 3′-dephospho-coenzyme A 6a, 16.6 min; ethyldethia-coenzyme A 1b, 19.7 min; and 3′-dephospho-ethyldethia-coenzyme A 6b, 26.6 min. Each 150-μl reaction mixture contained ATP (5.0 mm), CTP (1.0 mm), l-cysteine (1.0 mm), DTT (2.0 mm), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), CoaA (15 μg), CoaBC (15 μg), CoaD (15 μg), and CoaE (15 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). Reactions were initiated by addition of the natural substrate 2a (0.5 mm), the analog 2b (0.5 mm), or by addition of water to the negative control samples. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and stopped by transferring the reaction to 95 °C for 5 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm × 5 min). The supernatant (25 μl) was injected onto the HPLC column for analysis using the conditions described above. A 600-μl reaction mixture contained3b (10.5 mm), ATP (20 mm), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), CoaD (100 μg) and CoaE (150 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). Reactions were initiated by addition of the biosynthetic enzymes, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped by transferring the reaction to 95 °C for 5 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm × 5 min). The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (1 × 25 cm) pre-equilibrated with NH4HCO3 (50 mm), and the column was eluted with a 600-ml gradient of NH4HCO3(50–300 mm). The chromatography was monitored atA254. The product eluted as the last fraction from the column at ∼180 mmNH4HCO3. The product-containing fractions were combined and lyophilized, dissolved in water and lyophilized again. This was repeated until a constant weight of product was achieved. Yield: 4.4 mg (tetra-ammonium salt) (83%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ8.36 (s, 1H), 8.07 (s, 1H), 5.97 (d, 1H), 4.39 (s, 1H), 4.04 (s, 1H), 3.81 (s, 1H), 3.61 (m, 3H), 3.35 (m, 1H), 3.26 (m, 2H), 2.93 (m, 1H), 2.88 (t, 2H), 2.23 (t, 2H), 1.21 (m, 2H), 1.04 (m, 4H), 0.67 (s, 3H), 0.62 (t, 3H), 0.55 (s, 3H). [M + H]+ calculated for C24H43N7O16P3 m/z 778.2, found 778.1; [M − ATP]+ = 271.2. A 600-μl reaction mixture contained 3b (10.5 mm), ATP (20 mm), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), CoaD (100 μg) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (2 units) in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). Reactions were initiated by addition of the biosynthetic enzymes. Four identical reaction mixtures were treated as for the purification of 1b, their supernatants combined and loaded onto a single DEAE-cellulose column (1 × 25 cm) pre-equilibrated with NH4HCO3 (50 mm). The column was eluted with a 500-ml gradient of NH4HCO3 (50–250 mm). The chromatography was monitored at A254. The product eluted as the first fraction from the column at ∼90 mm NH4HCO3. The product-containing fractions were combined and lyophilized, dissolved in water and lyophilized again. This was repeated until a constant weight of product was achieved. Yield: 14.8 mg (di-ammonium salt) (84%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ8.33 (s, 1H), 8.07 (s, 1H), 5.95 (d, 1H), 4.57 (t, 1H), 4.34 (t, 1H), 4.20 (s, 1H), 4.04 (s, 1H), 3.82 (s, 1H), 3.66 (m, 1H), 3.38 (m, 1H), 3.26 (t, 2H), 2.89 (t, 2H), 2.24 (t, 2H), 1.22 (m, 2H), 1.03 (m, 4H), 0.72 (s, 3H), 0.63 (t, 3H), 0.58 (s, 3H). [M + H]+ calculated for C24H42N7O13P2 m/z 698.2, found 698.2; [M − ADP]+ = 271.2. All enzyme assays were based on the decrease of NADH concentration, as monitored by changes in absorbance at 340 nm. An extinction coefficient of 6220m−1·cm−1 was used for NADH. Reactions were performed at 25 °C in a Hitachi U-2010 Spectrophotometer. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the obtained data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Origin 6.0 (Microcal). Pantothenate kinase activity was determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay that coupled the production of ADP to the consumption of NADH. Each 500-μl reaction mixture contained ATP (1.5 mm), NADH (0.3 mm), phospho(enol)pyruvate (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), KCl (20 mm), pyruvate kinase (5 units), lactic dehydrogenase (5 units) and CoaA (5 μg) in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The reaction was initiated by addition of substrate (2a or 2b, at concentrations between 10 and 160 μm). The phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase activity of CoaBC was assayed by the method of O'Brien (13O'Brien W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 76: 423-430Google Scholar) using the pyrophosphate detection kit available from Sigma (catalog no. P7275) that couples the production of pyrophosphate to the consumption of NADH. Each 500-μl reaction mixture contained 200 μl of pyrophosphate detection reagent, 3a (50 μm), CTP (1.0 mm), l-cysteine (1.0 mm), DTT (2.5 mm), and MgCl2 (2.0 mm) in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The reaction was initiated by addition of 2.4 μg of pure CoaBC. To test the inhibitory effect of3b, it was introduced in increasing concentrations up to 3.0 mm), and the rate of reaction was compared with the control reaction. Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase activity was assayed by the method of O'Brien (13O'Brien W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 76: 423-430Google Scholar) using the pyrophosphate detection kit available from Sigma (catalog no. P7275) that couples the production of pyrophosphate to the consumption of NADH. Each 500-μl reaction mixture contained 200 μl of pyrophosphate reagent, ATP (1.5 mm), DTT (1.0 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), KCl (20 mm), and CoaD (5 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The reaction was initiated by addition of substrate (5 or 3b, at concentrations between 10 and 250 μm. Dephospho-CoA kinase activity was determined by a modification of the published assay method (11Mishra P.K. Park P.K. Drueckhammer D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2774-2778Google Scholar). Each 500-μl reaction mixture contained ATP (5 mm), NADH (0.3 mm)), phospho(enol)pyruvate (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), KCl (20 mm), pyruvate kinase (5 units), lactic dehydrogenase (5 units), and CoaE (5 μg) in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The reaction was initiated by addition of substrate (6a or 6b, at concentrations between 0.13 and 2.0 mm). The competitive biosynthesis of 1a and1b was monitored as follows: the biosynthetic reaction in the 500-μl sample containing 2a (0.5 mm),2b (0.5 mm), ATP (5.0 mm), CTP (1.0 mm), l-cysteine (1.0 mm), DTT (2.0 mm), MgCl2 (15.0 mm), CoaA (25 μg), CoaBC (25 μg), CoaD (25 μg), and CoaE (25 μg) in 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) was pre-incubated at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by addition of the biosynthetic enzymes. At set time intervals 40-μl aliquots were withdrawn and immediately placed in a microcentrifuge tube preheated to 95 °C. After 5 min at 95 °C, the sample was centrifuged (13,000 rpm × 5 min) and 30 μl of the supernatant was added to 6 μl of guanosine (6 mm in 0.5 m HCl) as internal standard. The solution was mixed well, and 25 μl was injected onto the HPLC column for analysis using the same conditions as described above. The concentrations of 1a and 1b were determined using a standard curve obtained using known amounts of pure CoA co-injected with the same internal standard. The pantothenic acid analog N-pentylpantothenamide2b and its phosphate 3b were obtained by the improved synthetic route shown in Fig. 2. We found that compound 2b inhibited the growth of E. coli in minimal medium (MIC = 2 μm) as previously reported (7Clifton G. Bryant S.R. Skinner C.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 523-528Google Scholar). Analysis of the growth rate of E. coli grown in minimal medium and in the presence of varying amounts of 2b shows that the inhibitor retarded the onset of logarithmic growth, but did not abolish it entirely (Fig. 3). Furthermore, regardless of the initial amount of inhibitor present, all cultures grew to similar final cell densities. Taken together, these results show that compound2b is bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal and thatE. coli can overcome the inhibitory effect ofN-pentylpantothenamide over time.Figure 3Growth curves for E. coli B in minimal medium at 37 °C containing increasing amounts of the pantothenic acid analog N-pentylpantothenamide (2b). Concentrations of 2b used: ▪, no inhibitor; ■, 1 μm; ●, 2 μm; ○, 3 μm, ▴, 15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We considered two hypotheses for the toxicity of 2b: either it inhibits CoA biosynthesis, thus limiting the amount of CoA available to cells, or it is biosynthetically converted to ethyldethia-CoA, a potential CoA antimetabolite that could inhibit CoA utilizing enzymes. To differentiate between these mechanisms the last five enzymes involved in CoA biosynthesis were isolated from overexpression strains and incubated with the natural precursor 2a or its analog2b, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC. The chromatograms from these reaction mixtures are shown in Fig. 4. When 2a, the natural biosynthetic intermediate, was used as the substrate, the major new product formed was identified as CoA since it co-eluted with an authentic sample of 1a (Fig. 4A). When the analog2b was used as the substrate, a new compound, eluting with a longer retention time than CoA, was formed (Fig. 4B). To determine the identity of the new compound authentic ethyldethia-CoA1b was prepared synthetically using 3b as the starting material, which allows its purification from reaction mixtures in multimilligram quantities by anion exchange chromatography. The structure of the material obtained in this way was confirmed as being ethyldethia-CoA 1b by 1H NMR and ESI-MS analyses. The compound first identified by HPLC analysis was thus shown to be ethyldethia-CoA 1b by co-elution with this authentic sample. In the same way, authentic dephospho-ethyldethia-CoA6b was prepared by replacing the CoaE in the reaction mixtures with inorganic pyrophosphatase, and the synthetic material used to determine the identity of a compound eluting after 27 min, also by co-elution (not shown). These results demonstrate that the E. coli CoA biosynthetic enzymes (CoaABCDE) can catalyze the conversion of N-pentylpantothenamide 2b to ethyldethia-CoA 1b. To establish the extent to which the CoA biosynthetic enzymes differentiate between the natural substrates and their respective analogs, we have determinedkcat/Km for both possible substrates of each enzyme (Table I). This was done using standard kinase assays for CoaA and CoaE, while an assay based on pyrophosphate release was used in the case of CoaD. These experiments demonstrate that, except in the case of CoaA where the difference is small, the analog is a better substrate than the natural precursor. In the case of CoaD, 3b is adenylylated ∼3 times faster than 5, while CoaE exhibits a slightly larger preference, with the phosphorylation of 6b to give ethyldethia-CoA 1b occurring 4.6 times faster than the phosphorylation of 6a. In addition, treatment of a mixture of the natural substrate 3a (50 μm) and the analog 3b with the bifunctional enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/decarboxylase (10Strauss E. Kinsland C. Ge Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Google Scholar) failed to reveal any inhibition of the synthetase activity of this enzyme with concentrations of the analog as high as 3 mm, as determined using the pyrophosphate release assay. These results demonstrate that inhibition of the CoA biosynthetic enzymes cannot be the mode of antibiotic action of N-pentylpantothenamide2b.Table IKinetic parameters of CoA biosynthetic enzymes with their natural substrates and appropriate substrate analogs based on 2baCoaBC was excluded from this comparative analysis since it does not catalyze a reaction with any analog derived from the inhibitor 2b.EnzymeSubstratekcatKmkcat/Kms−1μms−1·mmCoaA2a1.07 ± 0.0416.7 ± 2.064.2 ± 8.12b1.18 ± 0.0717.1 ± 3.669.2 ± 15.0CoaD512.3 ± 1.5119 ± 30102 ± 293b14.8 ± 0.947.1 ± 8.8312 ± 62CoaE6a4.01 ± 0.24645 ± 1156.22 ± 1.186b12.0 ± 1.0414 ± 9528.8 ± 7.1a CoaBC was excluded from this comparative analysis since it does not catalyze a reaction with any analog derived from the inhibitor 2b. Open table in a new tab To test the prediction from the kinetic parameters in Table I that the biosynthesis of ethyldethia-CoA 1b is faster than the biosynthesis of CoA, 2a and 2b (500 μm) each) were incubated with purified CoaABCDE and the formation of 1a and 1b was followed by HPLC (Fig. 5). Based on initial rates, the biosynthesis of ethyldethia-CoA (1b) occurs 10.5 times faster than the biosynthesis of CoA. Since pantothenate kinase does not significantly differentiate between 2a and 2b, this rate difference is due to the preferential adenylylation of3b over 5, the preferential phosphorylation of6b over 6a, and the fact that the conversion of3b to 1b requires two enzyme activities (CoaBC) less than the conversion of 3a to 1a. Thus, while the relative concentrations of the biosynthetic enzymes and the ratio of 2a to 2b in vivo is likely to be different from what was used here, this experiment suggests that the biosynthesis of ethyldethia-CoA is likely to compete effectively with the biosynthesis of CoA in the cell. In conclusion our data show that the CoA biosynthetic enzymes are not inhibited by N-pentylpantothenamide 2b; rather this compound functions as a substrate of these enzymes, as shown by its preferential conversion to ethyldethia-CoA 1b in the competition experiment. This suggests that the toxicity ofN-pentylpantothenamide results from the inhibition of CoA-utilizing enzymes by the CoA analog ethyldethia-CoA 1b. The proposed antimetabolite activity of 1b is supported by the demonstration that desulfo-CoA, which differs from 1bonly in the length of the alkyl chain of the N-substituted amide, inhibits carnitine acetyl transferase, phosphotransacetylase, citrate synthase, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (14Chase J.F.A. Middleton B. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 208-213Google Scholar). Our mechanistic proposal for the mode of action of 2b is analogous to the recently discovered mechanism of action of bacimethrin, which is converted in vivo to methoxythiamin pyrophosphate, a thiamin pyrophosphate antivitamin (15Reddick J.J. Saha S. Lee J. Melnick J.S. Perkins J. Begley T.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2245-2248Google Scholar). The facile in vivo conversion ofN-pentylpantothenamide to ethyldethia-CoA overcomes the permeability problem of getting CoA analogs into cells; as a resultN-pentylpantothenamide may be a useful compound for studying the physiological consequences of depriving cells of CoA and for trapping intermediates on complex enzymes such as fatty acid synthase, polyketide synthases, and non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetases, all of which utilize the CoA-derived 4′-phosphopantetheine cofactor.

The striking resemblance of its L-shaped structure to that of tRNA has suggested that the mode of action of RRF may be based on mimicry of tRNA. Directed hydroxyl radical probing of 16S and 23S rRNA from Fe(II) tethered to ten positions on the surface of E. coli RRF constrains it to a well-defined location in the subunit interface cavity. Surprisingly, the orientation of RRF in the ribosome differs markedly from any of those previously observed for tRNA, suggesting that structural mimicry does not necessarily reflect functional mimicry."

To determine the physiological function(s) of 1-cysPrx, we have used an antisense strategy to suppress endogenous 1-cysPrx in L2 cells, a rat lung epithelial cell line. A 25-base antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was designed to bind a complementary sequence overlapping the translational start site (−18 to +7) in the rat 1-cysPrx mRNA, blocking protein synthesis. Treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide for 48 h resulted in approximately 60% suppression of the 1-cysPrx protein content as measured by immunoblot analysis and an approximately 44% decrease of glutathione peroxidase activity as compared with random oligonucleotide treated and control (vehicle only) cells. Accumulation of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide in plasma membranes was demonstrated by high pressure liquid chromatography assay for conjugated dienes (260 pmol/106cells for antisense versus 70 pmol/106 cells for random oligonucleotide and control cells) and by fluorescence of diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine, a probe for lipid peroxidation. The percentage of cells showing positive staining for annexin V and propidium iodide after antisense treatment was 40% at 28 h and 80% at 48 h.

Therap. 2001; 17: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), little is known about its physiological function and its potential role in protection of cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage. ROS are generated in all aerobic organisms during normal cellular metabolism, during anti-microbial defense, and associated with environmental insults. Exposure to increased levels of ROS, referred to as oxidative stress, leads to oxidation of proteins, lipid peroxidation, and DNA base modification and strand breakage (13Marnett L.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 14Hensley K. Floyd R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage caused by ROS can also induce uncontrolled cellular proliferation, differentiation, aging, and apoptosis (15Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 16Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7532) Google Scholar). Living organisms have evolved both nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants to cope with ROS-mediated stresses. Phospholipids form the major structural component of biological membranes, the lipid bilayer, thus providing the environment for the function of membrane-associated proteins such as ion channels, receptors, and enzymes through lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. Peroxidation of phospholipids perturbs the structure of the bilayer, thus altering the active conformation of membrane-associated proteins resulting in the inability of cells to maintain the nonequilibrium state between cytosol and the extracellular milieu (17Parasassi T. Bittolo-Bon G. Brunrlli R. Cazzolato G. Krasnowska E.K. Mei G. Sevanian A. Ursini F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As a consequence, avoidance of cellular toxicity requires specific mechanisms to protect against an accumulation of PLOOH in plasma membrane. Because cytosolic GPx (type I) cannot reduce PLOOH (2Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y. Chen J.W. Feinstein S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21326-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that membrane repair of peroxidative damage requires the sequential action of three enzymes: phospholipase A to cleave the peroxidized acyl chain, GPx to reduce the peroxidized fatty acid, and acyl transferase to regenerate the phospholipid (18van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Sevanian A. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (373) Google Scholar). More recently, phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx, a seleno enzyme, has been shown to directly reduce PLOOH (19Roveri A. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and to protect cells against oxidant stress (20Wang H.P. Qian S.Y. Schafer F.Q. Domann F.E. Oberley L.W. Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 825-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase can also reduce PLOOH, although at a relatively low efficiency (21Hurst R. Yongping B. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Pandya U. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19220-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 1-cysPrx can reduce PLOOH with a rate constant similar to that of phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (2Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y. Chen J.W. Feinstein S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21326-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, its effectiveness in protection against cellular phospholipid peroxidation has not been established. In a previous study, we showed that overexpression of 1-cysPrx in a cell line protects against peroxidative injury associated with extracellularly generated ⋅OH (23Manevich Y. Sweitzer T.D. Pak J.H. Feinstein S.I. Muzykantov V.R. Fisher A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11599-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used an antisense strategy to examine the effect of suppression of 1-cysPrx expression on viability of L2 cells, a rat lung epithelial cell line. The L2 line was chosen because these cells express 1-cysPrx mRNA and protein (24Kim H.S. Pak J.H. Gonzales L.W. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This cell line allowed us to test the hypothesis that decreased 1-cysPrx expression would result in lipid peroxidation and damage to cell membranes. Glutathione, glutathione reductase, NADPH,tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and H2O2were purchased from Sigma. All cell culture medium components were from Invitrogen. Trolox, a water-soluble form of vitamin E, was obtained from Aldrich. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Components for the PCR were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) was purchased from Dojindo Molecular Technologies (Kumamoto, Japan). High titer adenoviral stocks were produced by the Vector Core of the Institute of Human Gene Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania. L2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimal essential medium containing l-glutamine and supplemented with 5% bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells, 3 × 105 for a 60-mm culture dish or 2 × 104cells for a two chamber slide, were seeded 24 h prior to oligonucleotide treatment. Alveolar type II epithelial cells were isolated from rat lungs by digestion with elastase and maintained in primary culture for 24 h as previously described (8Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M.K. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar). A 25-base morpholino oligonucleotide (5′-CGGGCATGGCGGCAGTGGTGACGCT-3′) complementary to 18 nucleotides before the start of translation through the first two amino acid codons in rat 1-cysPrx cDNA (8Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M.K. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared and purified at GeneTools, LLC (Philomath, OR). A randomly generated 25-base morpholino oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′ was used as a control for antisense specificity. The oligonucleotides were resuspended in sterile water and stored at −20 °C. Cellular treatment with oligonucleotides was performed using ethoxylated polyethylenimine in a delivery solution provided by GeneTools, LLC. Morpholino oligonucleotide (0.47 μm), delivery solution (0.19 μm ethoxylated polyethylenimine), and serum-free minimal essential medium were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 2.85 ml was added to each 60-mm culture dish. The same solution with an equivalent volume of H2O substituted for oligonucleotide was used as a vehicle control. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the transfection solution was replaced with fresh serum containing minimal essential medium. In some experiments, 150 μm Trolox was added to the culture medium at that time. The assembly and production of recombinant adenovirus was performed using the Adeno-X Expression System (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The coding region of rat 1-cysPrx was generated by PCR using full-length rat 1-cysPrx cDNA as a template. An XbaI restriction site was introduced into the upstream primer (5′-CCTCTAGAATGCCCGGAGGGCTGCTT-3′), and a KpnI site was introduced into the downstream primer (5′-CCGGTACCTTAAGGCTGGGGCGTATAACG-3′). Purified 675-bp PCR products were double digested with XbaI and KpnI, ligated to the similarly digested pShuttle mammalian expression vector, and transformed into competent TOP10F′ Escherichia colicells (Invitrogen). The plasmids containing the insert of 1-cysPrx were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression cassette was transferred to the adenoviral genome by means of an in vitro ligation reaction; the entire expression cassette was flanked by unique PI-SceI and I-CeuI cleavage sites so that it could be excised and ligated to the adenoviral DNA. The adenoviral plasmid DNA from transformed colonies was checked for the presence of the insert DNA and its orientation by restriction enzyme digestion. The newly tailored recombinant adenoviral plasmid was linearized withPacI and then transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the supplier. After 4–7 days, the plaques became visible, and subsequently most of the cells detached from the plate. The cell suspension was cleared by centrifugation (1500 × g) for 5 min, and the supernatant containing ∼103–105 viral particles (a low titer viral stock) was frozen at −70 °C until use. This low titer viral stock was used for the production of a high titer viral stock (Ad.1-cysPrx). L2 cells were plated 12–24 h before infection with adenovirus at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm culture dish. After 1–2 h of incubation, the virus-containing medium was replaced by fresh complete growth medium and placed in a 37 °C humidified CO2 incubator for 48 h. As a control for efficiency of infection and viral toxicity, some dishes were infected with the same number of particles of adenovirus containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene (Ad.GFP). The cells were washed twice with PBS and disrupted with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, complete protease inhibitor mixture). The cell extracts were homogenized by sonication and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Blue assay (Bio-Rad). Supernatant containing 30 μg of protein was mixed with 2× sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and applied to a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was probed with 1:3000 diluted rabbit anti-1-cysPrx polyclonal antibody (24Kim H.S. Pak J.H. Gonzales L.W. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and 1:5000 diluted horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) with detection by ECL and quantitated by densitometric scanning of x-ray film using the FluorS multi-imager (Bio-Rad). The membrane then was washed with stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) at 55 °C and reprobed with 1:500 diluted rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) to normalize for protein loading. Total RNA was isolated from adenovirus-infected cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The size-fractionated RNA was then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary action and hybridized to 32P-labeled rat 1-cysPrx cDNA probe generated by random priming (Amersham Biosciences). After a high stringency wash, the membrane was exposed to Kodak x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 14 h and quantitated as described above for immunoblots. To normalize for loading, the membrane was stripped of the 1-cysPrx probe, rehybridized with32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe and re-exposed to x-ray film. GPx activity was determined by coupled NADPH/glutathione reductase assay in the presence of GSH with PCOOH ortert-butyl hydroperoxide as substrate, and lysosomal-type PLA2 activity was measured at pH 4 with a liposome-based assay using radiochemical detection as described previously (3Chen J.W.

L2 cells from the three experimental conditions (control, antisense and random oligonucleotide-treated) that were adherent to 60-mm culture dishes were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer procedure (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The extract was dried under a stream of N2, and the pellet of phospholipids was redissolved in 50 μl of methanol for analysis by HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA). The samples were injected onto a reverse phase high resolution C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm) (NovaPack®), eluted isocratically with methanol, 50 mm ammonium acetate (60:40 v/v, pH 5.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an Alliance 2690 separation unit, and detected with PDA 996 UV and RI 442 detectors. The data were processed using Millenium32 software. Phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) was detected by absorbance of conjugated dienes at 234 nm. A PCOOH standard was prepared using 15-lipoxygenase (Cayman Chemical Company Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) and 1-palmitoyl-2-linolenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Sigma) as reported previously (2Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y. Chen J.W. Feinstein S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21326-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). DPPP was used as a membrane-localized fluorescent probe that reacts specifically with hydroperoxides and becomes highly fluorescent when oxidized (26Takahashi M. Shibata M. Niki E. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Control, antisense and random oligonucleotide-treated L2 cells adherent to 12 × 25-mm plastic slides (Aclar; Allied Signal, Morristown, NJ) were grown in 60-mm culture dishes (two identical slides/dish) in complete medium. The slides were washed twice with PBS and placed in a standard quartz cuvette (10 × 10 mm) containing 50 μm DPPP in PBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the slides were washed twice with fresh PBS and placed in a standard quartz cuvette at a 45° angle to the excitation beam of a spectrofluorometer (PTI, Bricktown, NJ). After recording the initial emission spectrum, the increase in fluorescence (excitation, 351 nm; emission 380 nm, excitation slit, 1 nm; emission slit, 3 nm) was measured continuously before and after the addition of 10 μm Cu2+ and 0.5 mm ascorbate (Asc). To detect the early stages of injury, translocation of phosphatidylserine in the cell membrane was examined by the annexin V assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). At 0, 28, or 48 h after antisense or random morpholino oligonucleotide treatment, the cells were labeled in situ with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI), and six randomly selected fields were counted for fluorescent cells using a Nikon Diaphot microscope. Subsequent image capture and analysis was performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). The number of stained cells was normalized to the total number of cells as counted by phase microscopy of the same field. DNA cleavage, a characteristic of apoptosis, was detected by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At 5, 28, or 48 h after antisense or random oligonucleotide treatment, L2 cells cultured on two chamber slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate at 4 °C for 2 min and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with TUNEL reaction mixture containing the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. 4′6′Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, 300 nm) was used to counterstain double-stranded DNA in nuclei after TUNEL staining. The cells were air-dried, and coverslips were applied with 3 μl of Mowiol (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Images of nuclear fluorescence typical of apoptotic cells were collected by fluorescence microscopy as described above. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by Mann Whitneyt test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by comparison of the treated versus untreated by the Bonferroni procedure using SigmaStat software (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). The level of significance was taken as p < 0.05. L2 cells treated with antisense oligonucleotide grew poorly compared with control and random oligonucleotide-treated cells and exhibited a round cell shape by microscopy with a high rate of detachment from the dishes (data not shown). Cellular morphology and cell attachment in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells was improved significantly by the addition of Trolox to the culture medium. Control L2 cells expressed 1-cysPrx at ∼35% of the level observed in primarily isolated rat type II alveolar epithelial cells after 24 h in culture as determined by Northern and immunoblots (Fig. 1). Control (vehicle only) and random oligonucleotide-treated L2 cells showed no change in immunoreactive 1-cysPrx during 48 h of culture (Fig.2). By contrast, treatment of L2 cells with the antisense oligonucleotide for 48 h decreased the immunodetectable 1-cysPrx protein level by ∼60% (Fig.2 A). Antisense oligonucleotide treatment had no significant effect on 1-cysPrx protein expression in the primarily isolated rat type II cells (data not shown). The reason for the difference in efficacy was evaluated by the use of fluoroscein-labeled 1-cysPrx antisense oligonucleotide, which showed a 5-fold higher fluorescence in the L2 cells versus type II alveolar epithelial cells (data not shown), indicating resistance to transfection in the primarily isolated cells.Figure 2Treatment of L2 cells with antisense or random morpholino oligonucleotides or with vehicle (ethoxylated polyethylenimine) alone (control). A, cells were harvested 24 or 48 h post-treatment, and 30 μg of total soluble protein from each lysate were immunoblotted with an anti-1-cysPrx polyclonal antibody. Expression of 1-cysPrx protein was normalized to that for actin as indicated by the ratio below each lane. B, GPx and lysosomal-type phospholipase A2(aiPLA 2) activities were measured from the same cell homogenate at 48 h post-treatment. Each data set represents the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. *,p < 0.05 compared with the corresponding activity for random oligonucleotide or control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enzymatic activities were evaluated in crude cell extracts from vehicle only (control) and antisense and random oligonucleotide-treated L2 cells at 48 h of culture. Antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells showed decreased activity by 44% for GPx and 48% for PLA2relative to control, whereas random oligonucleotide had no effect on activities (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of lipid extracts of antisense and random oligonucleotide-treated L2 cells by HPLC showed similar levels of PCOOH at the start of incubation (Fig.3 A). After 48 h of culture, antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells showed a marked increase in the phospholipid hydroperoxide peak on the HPLC tracing, whereas the corresponding peak in random oligonucleotide-treated cells was unchanged (Fig. 3 A). The increase in PCOOH at 48 h of culture was ∼3.5-fold (p < 0.05) in antisense oligonucleotide compared with random oligonucleotide-treated L2 cells (Fig. 3 B). Accumulation of PCOOH in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells was significantly reduced by the addition of Trolox to the culture medium (Fig. 3 B). Lipid peroxidation was analyzed further by use of the specific fluorescent probe, DPPP. Control (vehicle only) L2 cells cultured for 48 h, then labeled with DPPP, and analyzed in a fluorometer showed low level fluorescence emission with a peak at 380 nm (Fig.4 A). Random oligonucleotide-treated cells showed a similar level of DPPP fluorescence. There was approximately four times more oxidized DPPP fluorescence in antisense oligonucleotide-treated L2 cells after 48 h of incubation as compared with random oligonucleotide-treated and control cells (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate lipid peroxidation of antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells during growth in normal culture medium.Figure 4Detection of lipid peroxidation in cellular membrane using DPPP as a membrane specific fluorescent probe. A, emission spectra (excitation at 351 nm) at 48 h after vehicle only (control) or random or antisense oligonucleotide treatment of L2 cells adherent to plastic slides.

Held K.D. Biaglow J.E. Radical Res. 1997; 148: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and DPPP were used to evaluate lipid peroxidation in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells in response to oxidative stress. DPPP fluorescence of cells was normalized to background fluorescence before the Cu2+-Asc treatment. Cu2+-Asc treatment of L2 cells showed an instantaneous increase in DPPP fluorescence with a rate of fluorescence change that was ∼60% greater in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells as compared with that of random oligonucleotide-treated or vehicle only (control) cells (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells with decreased 1-cysPrx have a diminished capacity to reduce plasma membrane phospholipid hydroperoxides generated by oxidant stress. To determine whether antisense oligonucleotide treatment resulted in translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaf of the plasma membrane, we examined cellular binding of annexin V as an index of perturbation of the membrane bilayer. PI staining was used as a marker of increased plasma membrane permeability. Approximately 10% of cells showed anne"
https://openalex.org/W2151574291,"PAS kinase is a serine/threonine kinase regulated in cis by a PAS domain. A genetic study of the two PAS kinase genes in budding yeast gave evidence of the involvement of these enzymes in the control of sugar metabolism and translation. Using a biochemical screen for PAS kinase substrates, three translation factors were identified as direct phosphorylation targets. PAS kinase was also found to phosphorylate UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and glycogen synthase, the enzymes catalyzing the two final steps in the glycogen biosynthetic pathway. Genetic, biochemical, and physiological data provide evidence that both of these enzymes are inhibited by PAS kinase-dependent phosphorylation, thereby downregulating carbohydrate storage. These studies provide evidence of a cell-autonomous signaling system that both controls and connects the balance of fuel consumption/storage to protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2073158293,"The identification of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) as an activating kinase for members of the AGC family of kinases has led to its implication as the activating kinase for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. It has been established in vitro that PDK-1 can phosphorylate the catalytic (C) subunit (19Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Google Scholar), but theEscherichia coli-expressed C-subunit undergoes autophosphorylation. To assess which of these mechanisms occurs in mammalian cells, a set of mutations was engineered flanking the site of PDK-1 phosphorylation, Thr-197, on the activation segment of the C-subunit. Two distinct requirements appeared for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by PDK-1. Autophosphorylation was disrupted by mutations that compromised activity (Thr-201 and Gly-200) or altered substrate recognition (Arg-194). Conversely, only residues peripheral to Thr-197 altered PDK-1 phosphorylation, including a potential hydrophobic PDK-1 binding site at the C terminus. To address thein vivo requirements for phosphorylation, select mutant proteins were transfected into COS-7 cells, and their phosphorylation state was assessed with phospho-specific antibodies. The phosphorylation pattern of these mutant proteins indicates that autophosphorylation is not the maturation mechanism in the eukaryotic cell; instead, a heterologous kinase with properties resembling the in vitro characteristics of PDK-1 is responsible forin vivo phosphorylation of PKA. The identification of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) as an activating kinase for members of the AGC family of kinases has led to its implication as the activating kinase for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. It has been established in vitro that PDK-1 can phosphorylate the catalytic (C) subunit (19Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Google Scholar), but theEscherichia coli-expressed C-subunit undergoes autophosphorylation. To assess which of these mechanisms occurs in mammalian cells, a set of mutations was engineered flanking the site of PDK-1 phosphorylation, Thr-197, on the activation segment of the C-subunit. Two distinct requirements appeared for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by PDK-1. Autophosphorylation was disrupted by mutations that compromised activity (Thr-201 and Gly-200) or altered substrate recognition (Arg-194). Conversely, only residues peripheral to Thr-197 altered PDK-1 phosphorylation, including a potential hydrophobic PDK-1 binding site at the C terminus. To address thein vivo requirements for phosphorylation, select mutant proteins were transfected into COS-7 cells, and their phosphorylation state was assessed with phospho-specific antibodies. The phosphorylation pattern of these mutant proteins indicates that autophosphorylation is not the maturation mechanism in the eukaryotic cell; instead, a heterologous kinase with properties resembling the in vitro characteristics of PDK-1 is responsible forin vivo phosphorylation of PKA. The need for cells to respond to their changing environment requires that they are able to detect change and modify their activity accordingly. The mechanisms used to detect and institute these changes are collectively referred to as signal transduction. Although many different motifs are in place to implement the proper response, protein phosphorylation is one of the most prominent. This event, which involves the transfer of a phosphate from a nucleotide triphosphate to a protein substrate, can dramatically alter the activity of that protein and ultimately the properties of the entire cell. This phosphoryl transfer event is catalyzed enzymatically by the protein kinase family, and these enzymes are themselves often regulated by phosphorylation. The proteins kinases are related through a structurally conserved catalytic core. This core is perhaps best represented by the catalytic subunit (C-subunit) 1The abbreviations used are: C-subunit, catalytic subunit; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PDK-1, 3-phosphoinisitide-dependent protein kinase-1; DTT, dithiothreitol; RII-subunit, type II regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA is one of the simplest and best understood members in the family (1Beebe S.J. Corbin J.D. The Enzymes: Control by Phosphorylation, Part A. Academic Press, New York1986Google Scholar, 2Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Google Scholar, 3Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Google Scholar). This is due, in part, to its subunit organization. PKA is composed of two catalytic subunits and a homodimer of two regulatory subunits that can dissociate upon activation by cAMP. This organization allows for a detailed examination of one subunit without any interference from the other subunit. Furthermore, the catalytic subunit is comprised mostly of the conserved core; therefore, it can serve as a blueprint for understanding other protein kinases (4Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Google Scholar, 5Smith C.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Akamine P. Taylor S.S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 313-341Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit is a 350-amino acid protein (6Shoji S. Parmelee D.C. Wade R.D. Kumar S. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Long G.L. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 848-851Google Scholar) with the kinase core represented by residues 40–300. Many structurally conserved motifs define the catalytic core. One feature is its bilobal organization (7Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar). The smaller N-terminal lobe is comprised mainly of β-sheets and is responsible for nucleotide binding (8Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Google Scholar), whereas the larger C-terminal lobe is composed mostly of α−helices and is responsible for substrate binding and catalysis (7Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar). Each lobe contains its own conserved sequence motifs (9Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Google Scholar). The small lobe contains the glycine-rich loop, which binds nucleotide, and the C-helix, whose orientation coordinates many parts of the molecule in the proper conformation necessary for optimal catalysis. The large lobe also contains conserved motifs such as the catalytic loop, magnesium positioning loop, activation loop, and the P+1 loop, with the latter three making up the activation segment. Fig.1 A illustrates the amino acid sequence of the activation segment, its functional motifs, and where they fall in Hanks' subdomain classification. The overall architecture of the loop is depicted in Fig. 1 B, and the interactions coordinated by the Thr-197 phosphate are illustrated in Fig.1 C. The activity of many kinases is regulated by the phosphorylation of residues on the activation segment (10Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Google Scholar), often by an upstream kinase. A phosphate on the activation loop properly positions the loop for both catalysis and substrate recognition (11Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Google Scholar, 12Hagopian J.C. Kirtley M.P. Stevenson L.M. Gergis R.M. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Parsons S.M. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 275-280Google Scholar). Unlike many other kinases, the C-subunit normally is assembled as an active enzyme that is fully phosphorylated on its activation loop. Regulation of the C-subunit occurs through holoenzyme formation with the regulatory subunit and is dependent on the level of cellular cAMP. When purified from mammalian tissue, the C-subunit is always phosphorylated on its activation loop (13Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Google Scholar). What is not well understood is the in vivo mechanism for this phosphorylation. Although C-subunit expressed in Escherichia coli autophosphorylates on both Thr-197 and Ser-338, this most likely does not reflect the mechanism used in the eukaryotic cell (14Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Google Scholar). The identification of 3-phosphoinisitide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) (15Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Google Scholar, 16Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Google Scholar) was soon followed by the identification of a number of its substrates. PDK-1 belongs to the AGC family of kinases and is a constitutively active kinase regulated in part by a plextrin homology (PH) domain. It was first discovered as the activating enzyme for Akt/PKB. Subsequently, a number of protein kinases have been shown to be substrates of PDK-1. Some of these included PKC (17Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Google Scholar), S6 kinase (18Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Google Scholar), and PKA (19Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the sequences of the activation loops for those kinases demonstrated to be PDK-1 substrates compared with the two kinases determined not to be substrates. In an effort to identify the PKA kinase, PDK1 was assayed and found to be an excellent in vitro kinase for the C-subunit (19Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event proved critical for the activation of the unphosphorylated substrate C-subunit. Whether PDK-1 is the in vivo PKA kinase or not remains to be resolved. However, it is clear from the work of Steinberg and co-workers (14Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Google Scholar) that the C-subunit is not autophosphorylated in mammalian cells; it is phosphorylated by a heterologous kinase. This work attempts to comprehensively examine the role that individual residues in the activation segment contribute to the various functional parameters of the catalytic subunit. Each residue was mutated to alanine, and the resultant mutant proteins were assayed for their ability to affect autophosphorylation in E. coli, phosphorylation of a peptide substrate, binding to a regulatory subunit isoform, and phosphorylation of Thr-197 by PDK-1. The results strengthen the definition of the different motifs of the activation segment and reiterate the functional significance that this conserved loop has in the regulation of this important family of enzymes. In addition, the APE anchor was identified as an important determinant for PDK-1 phosphorylation. The reagents used were pRSETB expression vector (Invitrogen), [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), E. coli strains BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and H-89 (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), Muta-Gene site-directed mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem), SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate detection kit (Pierce), oligonucleotides (Sigma), the PepTag PKA activity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies were from Covance (Princeton, NJ), and antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated activation loop of protein kinase C (PKC), referred to as α-Thr 197-P, were a gift from A. Newton (University of California, San Diego) (20Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Google Scholar). Antibodies against the catalytic subunit of PKA were described previously (21Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Grant B. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 915-925Google Scholar). Antibodies directed toward the unphosphorylated Thr-197, α-Thr-197-OH, were described previously. 2M. J. Moore and S. S. Taylor, submitted for publication. Plasmid pCMV5 containing Myc-tagged PDK1 was the same as previously described (18Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed with the ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. cDNA for the murine PKA Cα-subunit in the bacterial expression vector pRESTB was used as a template for Kunkel-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). All mutations were made using the Muta-Gene kit per the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA sequencing analysis instruments confirmed the presence of the correct mutation. Wild-type and mutant C-subunits were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.8, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), incubated for an additional 6 h at 24 °C, collected by centrifugation, and stored frozen. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100 and lysed by 3× freeze thawing and sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min. The PepTag assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay uses the Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) peptide substrate tagged with a fluorescent dye. Upon phosphorylation, the net charge of this peptide changes from +1 to −1, which then alters the migration of the peptide when run on an agarose gel. Briefly, lysed bacterial supernatant expressing the wild type or mutant proteins was incubated with the tagged Kemptide substrate and activator buffers at 30 °C, and the reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel at 100 V. Active protein was detected by its substrate migrating toward the anode. Human 293 cells were propagated at 2 × 106 per 10-cm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. A pCMV5 vector containing Myc-tagged PDK1 was transfected using the Qiagen Effectene transfection kit. 48 h post transfection, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended in Buffer A (50 mmTris-Cl, 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) as described (18Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Google Scholar). The cells were then subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw cycle followed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, 2 μl of mouse anti-Myc antibody were mixed with the cell extract of 1% of a 10-cm dish in 25 μl of Buffer A for 2 h on ice. The immunocomplex was then transferred to 10 μl (bed volume) of protein G-Sepharose resin and mixed for 1 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates then were washed at room temperature five times, twice with buffer A, twice with buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, and once with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For the kinase assay, 0.25 μg of H-89-C was mixed with 25 μm ATP, 5μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mmMgCl2 in 25 μl of Buffer B and incubated with the immobilized PDK1 for 45 min at 30 °C with frequent gentle mixing. Aliquots of each reaction were subject to SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation was observed by autoradiography. COS cells were plated into 6-well plates the day prior to transfections and transfected with Effectene reagent. 30 h later, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped on ice in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture III (final concentrations were 100 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 80 nm aprotinin, 5 μm bestatin,1.5 μm E-64, 2 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). Scraped cells sat with lysis buffer for 15 min and were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge for 20 min to pellet any insoluble material. The supernatants were removed and incubated overnight in the cold with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA tag. The following morning protein G-Sepharose was added for 2 h, and immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed 2 times in lysis buffer with 0.1% Triton, and finally resuspended in SDS sample buffer for electrophoresis. Samples were run on Nu-Page minigels from Invitrogen, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed for either the total C-subunit of PKA or the Thr-197 phosphorylation state using a rabbit α-C-subunit and a rabbit α-Thr-197-P, respectively. Two classes of mutant proteins were engineered in the C-subunit. Our primary focus was the region extending from the activation loop through the anchor motif to the large lobe, residues 194–208. This corresponds to subdomain VIII in Hanks' designation (24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar). Each residue in this segment was replaced with alanine. Also, two additional mutants outside the activation segment, F347A and F350A, were used to characterize the PDK-1 specificity. In order for these mutants to be tested as substrates for PDK-1, they needed to be isolated in their unphosphorylated state. Each mutant thus was expressed in E. coli and, upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), was treated with the ATP analog H-89. H-89 is an inhibitor of C-subunit activity and prevents autophosphorylation (14Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Google Scholar, 25Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Google Scholar). The single alanine mutants engineered at positions 194–208 were tested first for their ability to autophosphorylate. It has been established that when the C-subunit is expressed in E. coli, processing into the active form occurs through an autophosphorylation mechanism (21Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Grant B. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 915-925Google Scholar). To assess the effect that each mutation might have on autophosphorylation, each mutant protein was expressed in E. coli without the addition of H-89. The soluble fraction of lysed cells expressing each mutant protein was used for two immunoblots (Fig.3 A). The first was probed using the antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated activation loop, α-Thr-197-P, and the other with an antibody raised against the C-subunit, α-C-subunit. The α-C-subunit immunoblot shows that there are similar amounts of protein for each mutant, but the α-Thr-197-P blot indicated that some of the mutant proteins are not capable of undergoing autophosphorylation. Only three of these do not phosphorylate, i.e. R194A, G200A, and T201A. The mutation of Arg-194 would abolish the consensus sequence for C-subunit phosphorylation and likely account for the inability of this mutant protein to be phosphorylated. The latter two mutant proteins are not only a part of the peptide-positioning loop, but they contact residues in the core that are required for catalysis. The same mutant proteins used to evaluate autophosphorylation were tested for their effect on activity using the PepTag PKA activity assay (Fig.3 B). This assay uses the PKA peptide substrate Kemptide (26Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2638-2642Google Scholar) tagged with a fluorescent dye. Upon phosphorylation, the net charge of this peptide changes from +1 to −1. When these samples are loaded onto an agarose gel, phosphorylated peptide migrates in the opposite direction of the unphosphorylated peptide. Just as was done in the autophosphorylation assays, the soluble fractions containing mutant proteins expressed in the absence of H-89 were assayed for activity. Several of these mutants are compromised in their activity. Because phosphorylation is required for activity, those mutants that could not autophosphorylate, were also inactive, i.e. R194A, G200A, and T201A. Of the mutant proteins that could autophosphorylate, there were two that had compromised activity, namely Y204A and E208A. These mutants are unique because they autophosphorylated and yet are not capable of phosphorylating a peptide substrate. These mutant proteins were also assessed for their ability to bind to the R-subunit. The soluble fractions of theE. coli expression extracts were incubated with a purified His-tagged RII-subunit mutant, R213K. This RIIα subunit has a mutation in the cAMP-binding site of cAMP binding domain A and thus forms a holoenzyme complex that is more resistant to dissociation by cAMP. It can be used for the purification of the C-subunit. The R-subunits were then pulled down via their His-tag using Ni2+ affinity resin. The complexes were then subject to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using an α-C-subunit antibody (Fig. 3 C). Mutants that were incapable of binding the R-subunit were, again, R194A, G200A, and T201A. These were the same mutants that were unable to autophosphorylate. These results are consistent with data indicating that phosphorylation of Thr-197 on the activation loop is required for R-subunit binding (27Levin L.R. Zoller M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1066-1075Google Scholar). Y204A and E208A were also capable of binding to RIIα, even though they did not display catalytic activity. Nearly all H-89-treated mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable with wild type C-subunit and were soluble. The PDK-1 used in these assays was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells transfected with a Myc-tagged PDK-1 using an anti-Myc antibody and GammaBind G-Sepharose (19Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Google Scholar). Assays were conducted with PDK-1 on the resin in a reaction buffer containing[γ-32P]ATP, and the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate containing the individual C-subunit mutants as substrates. Residues contributing to substrate recognition were identified by reduced 32P incorporation following incubation with PDK-1. The most striking observation initially, shown in Fig.4, was that most of the mutant proteins were substrates for PDK-1 based on this qualitative assay. This is particularly true for residues 194–205, which includes the entire peptide-positioning loop. This is a region that is highly conserved in all of the known substrates of PDK-1 (28Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the mutant proteins that represent the highly conserved residues immediately following the phosphorylation site did not disrupt PDK-1 phosphorylation. In contrast, mutations at Pro-207 and Glu-208, located at the very end of the activation segment, did interfere with PDK-1 phosphorylation. Immunoblotting was used to demonstrate that there were equivalent amounts of protein in each assay using the anti-C-subunit antibody. In addition to the high degree of similarity between the residues following the site of phosphorylation in PDK-1 substrates, all the known substrates of PDK-1 appear to have a FXXF motif at the C terminus. This sequence was shown to be important for interaction with PDK-1 (29Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Google Scholar). The hydrophobic motif is thought to dock to the small domain of PDK-1 and position the enzyme for phosphorylation by PDK-1 on its activation loop. This motif corresponds to the last four residues of the C-subunit. Phe-347 and Phe-350 residues were mutated to Ala to assess their effects on autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by PDK-1 (Fig.5). When expressed in the absence of H-89 and probed with the α-Thr-197-P antibody, both of these mutant proteins are phosphorylated at Thr-197. Alternatively, when expressed in the presence of H-89 and incubated with PDK-1 and [γ-32P]ATP, there is no incorporation of32P, indicating no recognition by PDK-1. Although the in vitro results nicely map out distinct requirements for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by PDK-1, they do not address phosphorylation that occurs in a eukaryotic cell. To observe which residues are required for phosphorylationin vivo and to make a comparison with the in vitro results, select mutant proteins were transfected into COS cells, and their phosphorylation state was determined using phospho-specific antibodies. To avoid cross-reactivity with the endogenous C-subunit, an HA tag was placed at the C terminus of the C-subunit, and transfected proteins were immunoprecipitated before being subject to Western blot analysis. The Thr-197 phosphorylation state and expression levels were determined using the α-Thr-197-P and α-C-subunit antibodies, respectively. Wild type and the following four mutant proteins were selected for transfection: R194A for disrupting autophosphorylation, E208A for disrupting in vitro PDK-1 phosphorylation, and F347A and F350A for altering the PDK-1 docking site as well as for compromising the in vitro PDK-1 phosphorylation. As indicated in Fig.6, the phosphorylation pattern observed here closely matches that for the in vitro PDK-1 phosphorylation assays, providing further evidence that PDK-1 is indeed responsible for C-subunit phosphorylation in vivo. The activation segment of protein kinases is a conserved and essential motif in the protein kinase family (24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar). One of the central features of this segment is phosphorylation of one or more residues in the activation loop (10Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Google Scholar). This event is a crucial on/off step for the activation of many kinases. Although this on/off event is not a part of the in vivo cAMP-mediated activation mechanism for PKA, the phosphate is critical for C-subunit activity (30Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Google Scholar). How the C-subunit is initially assembled as a fully phosphorylated protein in the holoenzyme has been poorly understood. Those kinases whose structure have been solved in their unphosphorylated and inactive state highlight the changes in the loop's position and demonstrate the central role that a single phosphate plays in orchestrating a fully functional active site (31Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Google Scholar, 32De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Google Scholar). This change displaces many residues critical for activity. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis in this region was used to help define how individual amino acids contribute to the maturation process. The ability to obtain an E. coli-expressed C-subunit that is soluble, active, and purified in high yield has allowed for extensive characterization of this enzyme (33Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme, autophosphorylated on Thr-197 and Ser-338, is fully active, has a stable conformation, and is very soluble. When expressing activation segment mutant proteins, there appear to be two requirements necessary for autophosphorylation to occur, namely activity and substrate recognition. The inability of G200A and T201A to autophosphorylate is undoubtedly related to their disruption of interactions critical for activity. The crystallographic molecular model shows that the hydroxyl moiety of Thr-201 is hydrogen-bonding distance from Lys-168 and, in some cases, actually bridges Lys-168 to Asp-166 (8Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Google Scholar). Lys-168 is the single link from the large lobe to the γ-phosphate of ATP and is an essential part of the phosphoryl transfer process; Asp-166 orients the substrate hydroxyl to accept the phosphate and is a required component of the activation site. A mutation at Thr-201 disrupts this interaction and most likely the organization of the active site, resulting in an inactive enzyme. Thr-201 is conserved in all Ser/Thr protein kinases (24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar). Replacing the Gly-200 with Ala may increase the rigidity of the loop and prevent the adjacent residue, Thr-201, from making its essential interaction; however, it is more likely that this mutation abolishes activity because of steric factors. Furthermore the backbone amide of Gly-200 interacts with the P + 1 residue of the substrate. Thus, these two residues coordinate the phosphoryl transfer site by binding to the peptide (Gly-200) and may organize, through Thr-201, the two residues in the catalytic loop that bind to the two substrates,i.e. ATP (via Lys-168) and the peptide hydroxyl (via Asp-166). Fig. 7 A depicts the backbone interactions that involve Thr-201. The second requirement, substrate recognition, is observed with the mutation of Arg-194, situated at the P-3 position. General PKA substrate recognition involves two Arg residues, either at the P-2 and P-3 or P-3 and P-6 positions. Removal of the P-3 Arg-194 abolishes the only basic residue in the consensus sequence and would certainly alter recognition of Thr-197 as a site of phosphorylation. Complementary characterization of the mutant proteins reiterates the importance of the Thr-197 phosphate as well as that of particular residues. The ability to bind the RII-subunit appeared to depend entirely on the presence of a phosphate in coprecipitation experiments. This correlates with previous observations (27Levin L.R. Zoller M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1066-1075Google Scholar), but stresses that in these qualitative assays it contributes to RII-subunit binding more than any particular residue. Not surprising is the correlation between phosphorylation state and activity. There are two additional mutant proteins that have diminished activity, Y204A and E208A. Tyr-204 appears to be crucial for substrate recognition as well as stabilizing the P+1 loop. 3M. J. Moore, J. A. Adams, and S. S. Taylor, submitted for publication. The highly conserved Glu-208 serves as an anchor to the large lobe through its interaction with Arg-280. Disruption of this anchor could alter the P+1 loop and substrate recognition and perhaps even the interactions made by the Thr-197 phosphate. The identification of PDK-1 and its substrates has provided new understanding about the activation of kinases in the AGC superfamily (35Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Google Scholar). Its relationship as an in vitro kinase for the C-subunit has allowed for new thinking as to the processing of the C-subunit in eukaryotic cells. The most compelling evidence still supports the prediction that the C-subunit is not autophosphorylated in mammalian cells but instead is phosphorylated by a heterologous protein kinase (14Cauthron R.D. Carter K.B. Liauw S. Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1416-1423Google Scholar). PDK-1 or a homolog of PDK-1 is still a candidate for anin vivo PKA kinase, even though embryonic stem cells with the PDK-1 gene knocked out did not completely abolish phosphorylation of the C-subunit (36Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Google Scholar). We thus compared sequence requirements for autophosphorylation versus requirements for phosphorylation by PDK-1. The residues that compromised PDK-1 phosphorylation were distal to Thr-197, namely P207A and E208A, which are located in the activation loop anchor. The identification of Pro-207 and Glu-208 as recognition determinants for PDK-1 has not been previously described, and these residues lie outside the limits of most peptide screens. Pro-207 certainly conveys rigidity to the anchor, and replacing it with Ala would make it more flexible. The E208A mutation would abolish the interaction with Arg-280. Neither mutant protein altered autophosphorylation, despite the compromised activity of E208A. We predict that the Pro-Glu motif may be a previously unrecognized determinant for PDK-1 in addition to its requirements for a peripheral hydrophobic docking site. Other residues that immediately follow the phosphorylation site are highly conserved in PDK-1 substrates (24Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar) but did not disrupt PDK-1 phosphorylation. The high degree of conservation in this region thus appears to be more important for function than PDK-1 recognition. Previous work established that PDK-1 could interact with some of its substrates through a C-terminal hydrophobic docking site (29Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Google Scholar, 34Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D. Kelly J.J. Frech M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Google Scholar, 37Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Google Scholar). The FXXF motif occurs in PDK-1 substrates (Fig. 2) and corresponds to the last four residues of the C-subunit (Fig.7 B). A yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length PDK-1 as bait was used to identify the C terminus of the C-subunit as a PDK-1 binding partner (29Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Google Scholar). This interaction was disrupted when either Phe-347 or Phe-350 were mutated to Ala. Mutations were engineered at Phe-347 and Phe-350 to address their contributions to phosphorylation at Thr-197 in the substrate form of the C-subunit. Previous work demonstrated that these two mutant proteins exhibit compromised activity (22Batkin M. Schvartz I. Shaltiel S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5366-5373Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both F347A and F350A mutant proteins autophosphorylated when expressed in bacteria; in contrast, these mutant proteins were not phosphorylated by PDK-1 in vitro. This supports the prediction that PDK-1 or a homolog of PDK-1 may indeed be the in vivo kinase. Additionally, this motif is absent in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and 5′-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) (Fig. 2), and that is probably why they do not serve as substrates of PDK-1 despite the similarity in the activation segment residues. Clearly the requirements for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by PDK-1 are quite distinct. Because in vitro experiments allow for the characterization of a particular type of phosphorylation mechanism but do not address phosphorylation in the eukaryotic environment, select mutant proteins that correspond to residues important for autophosphorylation or PDK-1 phosphorylation were transfected into a mammalian cell line, and their phosphorylation states were determined. Those mutant proteins that disrupted PDK-1 phosphorylation in vitro also disrupted phosphorylation in vivo, whereas the autophosphorylation-disrupting mutant protein was properly phosphorylated in vivo. Not only does this discount autophosphorylation as the in vivo mechanism for PKA phosphorylation, but the PKA kinase activity observed in COS cells also has similar substrate requirements as PDK-1 does in vitro. Clearly PDK-1 is an excellent in vitro kinase for the unphosphorylated C-subunit. When the contributions individual amino acids make to C-subunit phosphorylation were examined, separate requirements were observed for autophosphorylation and for phosphorylation by PDK-1. Moreover, those residues important for PDK-1 phosphorylation were also required for phosphorylation in vivo. As our understanding of the cellular regulation of PDK-1 continues to expand, so might our understanding of how the maturation process of the unphosphorylated C-subunit contributes to its own regulation."

We investigated the role that local innate immunity might have on vector competence, taking Stomoxys calcitrans as a model. S. calcitrans is sympatric with tsetse flies, feeds on many of the same vertebrate hosts, and is thus regularly exposed to the trypanosomes that cause African sleeping sickness and nagana. Despite this, S. calcitrans is not a cyclical vector of these trypanosomes. Trypanosomes develop exclusively in the lumen of digestive organs, and so epithelial immune mechanisms, and in particular antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), may be the prime determinants of the fate of an infection. To investigate why S. calcitrans is not a cyclical vector of trypanosomes, we have looked in its midgut for AMPs with trypanolytic activity. We have identified a new AMP of 42 amino acids, which we named stomoxyn, constitutively expressed and secreted exclusively in the anterior midgut of S. calcitrans. It displays an amphipathic helical structure and exhibits a broad activity spectrum affecting the growth of microorganisms. Interestingly, this AMP exhibits trypanolytic activity to Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. We argue that stomoxyn may help to explain why S. calcitrans is not a vector of trypanosomes causing African sleeping sickness and nagana.

We argue that stomoxyn may help to explain why S. calcitrans is not a vector of trypanosomes causing African sleeping sickness and nagana. Epithelial intestinal innate immunity plays a major role in the control of infectious diseases in vertebrates (1Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In invertebrates, data are still fragmentary despite gut epithelium being an essential interface for parasites during their development in insect vectors. Understanding vector biology is a key element in the control of many parasitic diseases. In this context, the comparison of the trypanosome vector Glossina with the sympatric but non-vectorStomoxys calcitrans is particularly interesting. The tsetse fly Glossina spp. is the major vector of the range of trypanosomes that cause African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. Stable flies, Stomoxys spp., feed on the same vertebrate hosts as tsetse flies and have a very similar digestive physiology and midgut anatomy. Although Stomoxys is constantly exposed to trypanosomes, it kills them in the midgut within 2–4 days of ingestion (3Abdally M.H. A Study of the Midgut (Reservoir Zone) and Haemolymph Lectins of the Stable Fly, Stomoxys Calcitrans, Ph.D. thesis. University of Wales, 1996Google Scholar). So Stomoxys is not a cyclical vector of trypanosomes (although it can act as a mechanical vector, “flying pin”). Why Stomoxys is not a cyclical vector of trypanosomes is unknown. Recent studies have shown that the insect immune system plays a determinant role in the fate of trypanosome infections in tsetse flies (4Hao Z. Kasumba I. Lehane M.J. Gibson W.C. Kwon J. Aksoy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12648-12653Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 5Boulanger N. Brun R. Ehret-Sabatier L. Kunz C. Bulet P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consequently, in this report, we address the possibility that the distinction in vectorial capacity between Glossina and Stomoxys may lie in differences in immune mechanisms. Trypanosoma vivax matures entirely in the mouthparts ofGlossina. The other trypanosomes causing nagana and human disease are ingested into the fly midgut where they multiply first in the endoperitrophic space and later in the ectoperitrophic space tightly sandwiched between the peritrophic matrix and the anterior midgut epithelium (6Welburn S.C. Maudlin I. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 399-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These trypanosomes then migrate, entirely within the lumenal space of the intestine, to the mouthparts or salivary glands for transmission to a new vertebrate. Consequently it is epithelial rather than systemic immune responses that are likely to have the major bearing on the fate of trypanosome infections. Epithelia constitute the first line of defense in the innate immunity of both vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 7Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immun. 1998; 10: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and invertebrates (8Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Muller H. Kafatos F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, the mouse gut epithelium responds to bacterial infection by secretion of α-defensins or cryptdins (reviewed in Refs. 1Bevins C.L. Martin-Porter E. Ganz T. Gut. 1999; 45: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 2Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), and gut expression of β-defensins is up-regulated by the parasiteCryptosporidium parvum (11Tarver A.P. Clark D.P. Diamond G. Russell J.P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cohen K.S. Jones D.E. Sweeney R.W. Wines M. Hwang S. Bevins C.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In invertebrates, the S. calcitrans anterior midgut epithelium responds to microbial infection by post-transcriptional up-regulation of secreted defensins, whereas the mosquito midgut responds to Plasmodium infection by up-regulation of a range of immunity factors including several AMP genes (reviewed in Ref. 12Dimopoulos G. Muller H.M. Levashina E.A. Kafatos F.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We know that some of these AMPs can be active against trypanosomes (4Hao Z. Kasumba I. Lehane M.J. Gibson W.C. Kwon J. Aksoy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12648-12653Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and other parasites such as Plasmodium and filarial worms that also spend part of their life in the gut of a blood-sucking insect (13Lowenberger C.A. Ferdig M.T. Bulet P. Khalili S. Hoffmann J.A. Christensen B.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,14Shahabuddin M. Fields I. Bulet P. Hoffmann J.A. Miller L.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 89: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because of the potential importance of epithelial AMPs for determining vectorial capacity, we have looked for novel AMPs in gut extracts ofS. calcitrans using biochemical and molecular approaches. It is already known that the anterior midgut epithelium of S. calcitrans produces two defensins (9Lehane M.J. Wu D. Lehane S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11502-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that are secreted into the midgut lumen (15Munks R. Hamilton J. Lehane S.M. Lehane M.J. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Hamilton J. Munks R. Lehane S.M. Lehane M.J. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, in addition to these defensins, we identified a novel 42-residue peptide, which we named stomoxyn. Stomoxyn has no sequence homology with other known proteins. This molecule is adult and anterior midgut-specific, where it is constitutively expressed. As shown by a circular dichroism study, stomoxyn adopts an α-helical structure only in the presence of an organic solvent that mimics a phospholipid membrane. Stomoxyn is active against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast, and its activity is apparent within a few minutes of exposure. Although stomoxyn has only limited hemolytic activity against bovine red blood cells, it possesses significant trypanolytic effect on trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Consequently it may help to explain why Stomoxys is not a vector of African trypanosomiasis. S. calcitrans were reared as described by O'Brochtaet al. (17O'Brochta D.A. Atkinson P.W. Lehane M.J. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Adult male and female insects, both of which feed on blood, were used in the experiments. The artificial blood meal (18Lehane S.M. Assinder S.J. Lehane M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and casein hydrolysate meal were made with high purity water. Flies used for HPLC purification of midgut AMPs were fed from cotton wool soaked swabs on either pig blood or casein hydrolysate (20 g/100 ml). At 24–36 h after feeding, anterior midguts (2,000 consisting of proventriculus, thoracic, and reservoir regions) (19Billingsley P.F. Lehane M.J. Lehane M.J. Billingsley P.F. The Insect Midgut, Stucture and Ultrastructure of the Midgut. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 3-25Google Scholar) were dissected in 154 mm NaCl and homogenized at 4 °C in 200 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.5. The homogenate was heated to 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet and supernatant were stored separately at −20 °C until used. The supernatant of S. calcitrans midgut homogenate was subjected to RP-HPLC on an Aquapore OD300 C18 column (220 × 4.6 mm, BrownleeTM) with a linear gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) over 120 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 35 °C. The column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 225 nm, and fractions were hand-collected. After evaporation under vacuum (Speedvac, Savant), fractions were reconstituted in MilliQ™ water (Millipore). An equivalent of 40 midguts/2 μl was tested for antimicrobial activity using a solid growth inhibition zone assay. HPLC fractions with antimicrobial activity were further purified to homogeneity on a microbore Aquapore RP 300 C8 column (1 × 100 mm, Brownlee™) by appropriate linear biphasic gradients of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 80 μl/min. The column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. Purity of the fractions with antimicrobial activity was controlled between each chromatography by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Pure peptides were finally subjected to Edman degradation. All HPLC purifications were performed at 35 °C with a Waters HPLC system equipped with a pump model 626, a controller model 600S, and a UV detector model 486. MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on a Bruker Daltonique (Bremen, Germany) BIFLEX IIITM mass spectrometer in a positive linear mode with an external calibration. Samples were prepared according to the sandwich method (20Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar) following the procedure reported previously (21Vizioli J. Bulet P. Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Muller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12630-12635Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Automated Edman degradation of the purified AMPs and detection of the phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were carried out using pulse liquid automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 473A). A S. calcitrans adult midgut cDNA library with an estimated complexity of 1.4 × 106 plaque-forming units was constructed in Lambda ZAP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The library was plated using Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue. A degenerate sense PCR primer (S1 5′-ATGACRGCNGTRTCYTT-3′) corresponding to the amino acid sequence KDTAVI of stomoxyn and an M13−20 primer were used in PCR with the cDNA library as template to generate a 336-bp product. This product was cloned using TOPO TA (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A pair of sequence-specific primers were designed from this sequence (S2, 5′-TGTATCCAATTCACTTTTCA-3′, and S3, 5′-TATGACAGCAGTATCCTT-3′) and used in PCR with the cDNA library as template to generate a 193-bp probe. The probe was 32P-labeled and used to screen the midgut cDNA library. Phagemid clones (pBluescript) containing the stomoxyn protein cDNA were excised in vitro from the λ vector using ExAssist helper phage and plated using E. coli XLOLR (Stratagene) and sequenced. Nuclease protection assays were performed using the Multi-NPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNA was prepared from 10 anterior midguts (proventriculus, thoracic, and reservoir regions), 10 posterior midguts (opaque and lipoid regions), 1 remains of a carcass from adultS. calcitrans, 100 eggs, and 2 larvae or 2 pupae using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). For treatment details, see Fig.3 capture. Oligonucleotide probes NPA5 (5′-GCCTCGGTCTGGGTGGCCGAAAGGCATAGCACCAAAACGACCAGAACTACCAGGAATCCACTAA-3′ and NPA4 5′-GCGTGTGGAATCGGAAGGAATGGGAGTAACATCTTCTTATAGAT-3′) were used to detect stomoxyn and S14, respectively. Each oligonucleotide probe contained 10 bp of non-complementary sequences on the 3′ end so that full-length probe can be distinguished from the protected fragment. The peptide was assembled using a multichannel peptide synthesizer adapted to Boc chemistry (22Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). Classical Boc-protected amino acids were used during the assembly but with histidine residues introduced as Boc-His(dinitrophenyl) derivatives. Following the last Boc deprotection, the resin was washed five times with dichloromethane and dried under nitrogen. Finally a standard fluorhydric acid procedure was used for deprotection and cleavage of the peptide from the resin. After removal of the fluorhydric acid by vacuum, the resin was washed with ethyl ether, and the peptide was extracted with acetic acid, water, and acetonitrile. The synthetic peptide was purified to homogeneity by solid-phase extraction and RP-HPLC using a gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water. Peptide purity and integrity were controlled by MALDI-TOF MS. During the peptide purification, antimicrobial activity was assayed against the two test bacteria, the Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus (23Hetru C. Bulet P. Methods in Molecular Biology.in: Shafer W.M. Antibacterial Peptide Protocols. 78. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar) and the Gram-negative E. coli K12 RM148 (9Lehane M.J. Wu D. Lehane S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11502-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl (40–230 midguts, depending on the purification step) of each RP-HPLC fractions were incubated with bacteria overnight at 37 °C. Two AMPs were used as positive controls: Drosophila cecropin A (25 μm) and Aedes defensin A (15 μm) for anti-Gram-negative and -positive activities, respectively. The activity spectrum (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC) of stomoxyn (concentration range, from 0.2 up to 100 μm) was determined against bacteria and fungi using a liquid growth inhibition assay (23Hetru C. Bulet P. Methods in Molecular Biology.in: Shafer W.M. Antibacterial Peptide Protocols. 78. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar). The strains used were from private and public collections (24Vizioli J. Bulet P. Charlet M. Lowenberger C. Blass C. Muller H. Dimopoulos G. Hoffmann J. Kafatos F.C. Richman A. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Silva Jr., P.I. Daffre S. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33464-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Bactericidal effect was measured by colony-forming unit counting at 24 h. When the antimicrobial activity was assayed in the presence of salts, the appropriate medium was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm KCl, or 154 mm NaCl. Overnight cultures of E. coli K12 RM148, M. luteus, andCryptococcus neoformans were diluted in appropriate media and allowed to grow to logarithmic phase. Stomoxyn (10 times the MIC) was incubated with the test microorganism in a 96-well microtiter plate at 37 °C. At different time points (5, 15, 45, and 150 min), samples were removed, diluted, and plated on Luria Bertani broth or Sabouraud agar plate for colony-forming unit counting. Fungal spores (104/ml) of Neurospora crassa were incubated in Eppendorf tubes with 25 μm stomoxyn (4 times the MIC value). At different time points (30, 60, 150, 270 min, and overnight), spores were washed twice with fresh potato dextrose broth (half-strength) and incubated for an additional 48 h. Fungal growth was measured at 550 nm. The antitrypanosomal assay was performed using the Alamar Blue assay according to Raez et al. (26Raez B. Iten M. Grether-Buelher Y. Kaminsky R. Brun R. Acta Trop. 1997; 68: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Briefly, bloodstream forms of T. b. rhodesiense STIB 900 were added to sterile 96-well microtiter plates in 100 μl of culture medium according to Baltz et al. (27Baltz T. Baltz D. Giroud C. Crockett J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) containing 300 bloodstream forms with or without a 3-fold serial drug dilution. The top concentration of stomoxyn was 500 μg/ml (approx. 113 μm). The test was run in duplicate. After 72 h of incubation, 10 μl of Alamar Blue were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for another 2–4 h. The plates were read in a microplate fluorometer system (Spectramax Gemini, Molecular Devices) using an excitation wavelength of 536 nm and an emission wavelength of 588 nm. Data were transferred into a graphic program (Softmax Pro, Molecular Devices), sigmoidal inhibition curves were determined, and IC50 (drug concentration inhibiting 50% of fluorescence development) values were calculated. The activity against procyclic forms was determined in the same way. Procyclics of the same trypanosome strain were grown in SDM-79 medium (28Brun R. Schonenberger Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine red blood cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C until the supernatant was clear. A 10% suspension of bovine red blood cells was incubated in Eppendorf tubes in the presence of 2-fold dilutions of stomoxyn (0.2–100 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples (100 μl) were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and 90 μl of supernatant were transferred in a microtiter plate. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm. As a positive control (100% lysis), bovine red blood cells were incubated with 0.1% SDS. The stability of stomoxyn (12 μm final concentration) in the presence of 25% bovine serum was tested according to the procedure described previously (29Hoffmann R. Bulet P. Urge L. Otvos Jr., L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except that the stability was evaluated by MALDI-TOF MS. For the trypsin stability study, stomoxyn (0.5 mm in a final volume of 20 μl) was incubated with bovine trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at an enzyme/peptide ratio of 1/10, according to the manufacturer's directions. At different time points (5, 15, 30, 60, 150 min, and overnight), an aliquot (0.5 μl) of the sample was removed, and the reaction was stopped with trifluoroacetic acid. The digest products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Circular dichroism spectra of stomoxyn (0.1 mm) were recorded between 180 and 250 nm on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter in 0.5 nm steps at varying concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE) in water (from 0 to 80%, v/v) at pH 4 using a quartz cell of 1 mm. For each experiment, four spectra were averaged, and the baseline was corrected for neat solvent and solvent mixture. All measurements were carried out at 25 and 4 °C. Crude homogenates of anterior midgut of S. calcitrans, 24–36 h after a blood meal, have been shown previously to possess anti-Gram-negative activity. Two insect defensins have already been identified (Smd1 and Smd2 (9Lehane M.J. Wu D. Lehane S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11502-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). In this study, screening of HPLC-purified proteins extracted from 2,000 anterior midguts revealed the presence of eight fractions with antimicrobial activities. Two fractions were active against the Gram-positive test organism M. luteus (Fig. 1, peaks 1and 2), and six were active against the Gram-negative strainE. coli K12 RM148 (Fig. 1, peaks 3–8). After MALDI-TOF MS measurement and partial Edman sequencing, fraction 8 was found to contain Stomoxys defensin Smd2 (data not shown). As the strongest activities were observed in fractions 5 and 7 (Fig. 1), an extensive purification was performed on these fractions, and pure active compounds with molecular masses of 4246.11 MH+and 4415.49 MH+ were measured for fractions 5 and 7, respectively (data not shown). For the molecule at 4246.11 MH+, the following 33-amino acid partial sequence was obtained, RGFRKHFNKLVKKVKHTISETAHVAKDTAVIAG, whereas for the molecule at 4415.49 MH+, a 30-amino acid partial sequence was obtained that was identical to the previous one. As searches in FASTA.GENOME and the SwissProt data base using the Blosum 50 scoring matrix did not establish significant similarity with already known peptides/proteins, we named this new molecule stomoxyn. The full-length stomoxyn sequence was obtained by screening of a midgut cDNA library. The sequence of the stomoxyn cDNA clone is 314 nucleotides long including 42 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated and 68 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequence flanking an open reading frame corresponding to 67 amino acid residues of the precursor protein (Fig.2). According to the results of Edman degradation and cDNA cloning, the calculated molecular mass of mature stomoxyn is 4474.22 MH+. The mass difference observed between this calculated mass and the mass measured for the active compound differed from 59 Da, corresponding to the lack of the C-terminal glycine residue and to amidation of the C-terminal threonine residue.Figure 2The nucleotide sequence of stomoxyn cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence. The mature peptide coding sequence is shown in bold with amino acid residuesbelow. Untranslated 5′ and 3′ sequences are shown initalics, and the start and stop codons areunderlined. The dotted line marks the glycine residue involved in the C-terminal amidation of the threonine residue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of stomoxyn mRNA in different tissues and at various developmental stages in S. calcitrans was determined by nuclease protection assays (Fig. 3). Stomoxyn is expressed in the anterior midgut (proventriculus, thoracic, and reservoir regions) but not in the posterior midgut (opaque and lipoid regions) or the rest of the adult body, eggs, larvae, or pupae of S. calcitrans. The level of cDNA appeared to be unchanged with blood feeding, with and without addition of bacteria and laminarin. However, it should be noted that other immune peptides in these tissues are strongly regulated at the post-transcriptional level (16Hamilton J. Munks R. Lehane S.M. Lehane M.J. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial Activity—To investigate the antimicrobial properties of stomoxyn, the peptide was synthesized using Boc chemistry, purified to homogeneity, and tested against various microorganisms (Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeasts). The activity of stomoxyn was compared with a standard α-helical AMP from insects, Drosophila cecropin A. Stomoxyn had marked activity against most of the microorganisms tested (Table I). All the Gram-negative bacteria tested, except Enterobacter cloacae (6 μm), were affected by less than 2 μm peptide. No activity could be detected against the entomopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, Serratia marcescens, up to 100 μm. These activities are comparable with Drosophila cecropin A. Synthetic stomoxyn also showed high activity against most of the Gram-positive bacteria tested (MICs < 3 μm), except for Bacillus subtilis (MIC = 6.25–12.5 μm). No activity was detected against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, or Staphylococcus aureus up to 100 μm peptide. For all the Gram-positive bacteria tested, stomoxyn was more active than Drosophila cecropin A. In addition, stomoxyn was bactericidal on all the bacterial strains affected (data not shown). Most of the filamentous fungi assayed were highly sensitive to stomoxyn (MIC < 6.25 μm), whereas only a few strains were affected by Drosophilacecropin A. The human pathogenic strain Aspergillus fumigatus was only moderately affected by 100 μmstomoxyn, and Beauveria bassiana was unaffected, whatever the doses. However, A. fumigatus sporulation was inhibited by less than 6 μm stomoxyn (Fig.4 A). In contrast toDrosophila cecropin A, which was inefficient on the four yeast strains tested, stomoxyn was highly active against C. neoformans (MIC = 0.78–1.56 μm), moderately effective against Candida albicans andC. glabrata (MIC = 25–50 μm), and inefficient against Saccharomyces cerevisiae up to 100 μm (Table I). Killing assays on the different pathogens (bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast) revealed that stomoxyn acted within the first few minutes of incubation (data not shown). The antimicrobial activity of stomoxyn was not affected by various concentrations of different salts such as KCl, CaCl2, or NaCl (data not shown).Table IAntimicrobial activity spectrum of stomoxyn (Stom) and Drosophila cecropin A (Cec)Measurement MicroorganismsMICStomCecμmGram negative bacteriaE. coli K12 RM1480.19–0.39NDE. coli D220.19–0.390.1–0.25E. coli D310.19–0.390.1–0.25E. coliSBS363< 0.190.19–0.39E. coli 11060.19–0.390.25–0.5Enterobacter cloacae β123.12–6.250.78–1.56Erwinia carotovora0.78–1.560.78–1.56Klebsiella pneumoniae0.78–1.560.39–0.78Pseudomonas aeruginosa0.39–0.781–2.5Salmonella typhimurium0.39–0.780.5–1S. marcescensDb 11NANAXanthomonas campestris0.39–0.780.5–1Gram-positive bacteriaAerococcus viridans0.78–1.565–10Bacillus cereusNANABacillus megaterium0.78–1.561.56–3.12B. subtilis6.25–12.510–25Enterococcus faecalis0.78–1.56NAL. monocytogenesNANAM. luteus0.78–1.565–10S. aureusNANAStreptococcus pyogenes1.56–3.12NAFilamentous fungiA. fumigatus50–100NAB. bassianaNANAFusarium culmorum0.39–0.781–2.5Fusarium oxysporum0.78–1.561–2.5Nectria haematococca0.39–0.78NDN. crassa3.12–6.252.5–5Trichoderma viride1.56–3.12NDTrichophyton mentagrophytes3.12–6.25NDYeastC. albicans25–50NACandida glabrata25–50NAC. neoformans0.78–1.56NAS. cerevisiaeNANAThe antimicrobial activity spectrum was established in liquid growth inhibition assays.

Host cell responses to Gram-negative bacteria are orchestrated by immediate recognition of and response to minute quantities of bacteria and/or bacterial products that mobilize defense mechanisms. Although normally protective, similar responses to higher concentrations of these products may provide the basis for much of the pathologic sequelae in certain invasive infections. For example, the pathogenicity and severity of infection provoked by Neisseria meningitidis(NMB) 1The abbreviations used are: NMB, Neisseria meningitidis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; Hepes, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid; HSA, human serum albumin; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; LBP, lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LOS, lipooligosaccharide; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LOSagg, lipooligosaccharide aggregates; NMB ACE-1, Neisseria meningitidis serotype B acetate auxotroph; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; sCD14, soluble CD14. has been correlated with high circulating levels of meningococcal endotoxin, lipooligosaccharide (LOS) (1Brandtzaeg P. Kierulf P. Gaustad P. Skulberg A. Bruun J.N. Halvorsen S. Sorensen E. J. Infect. Dis. 1989; 159: 195-204Google Scholar). LOS is a unique amphiphathic glycolipid found in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of NMB and related Gram-negative bacteria (2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Google Scholar, 3Prince A. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 13: 251-260Google Scholar). LOS, like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), contains the bioactive lipid A moiety composed of the disaccharide backbone of β(1′→6)-linked d-glucosamine modified by O-phosphorylethanolamine and substituted with symmetrically arranged amide- and ester-linked 3-hydroxy-substituted fatty acids (4Rahman M.M.

Host cell response to LOS, like other endotoxins, is mediated through specific interactions with several host proteins including the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and CD14 in either a membrane-bound (mCD14) or soluble form (sCD14) to activate cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells, with the resultant release of a broad array of pro-inflammatory mediators (7Gegner J.A.

In particular, interactions between the lipid A portion of endotoxins and albumin have been noted to be important in delivery of endotoxin to cell acceptors (21Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur.

Infect. Immun. 1973; 8: 173-177Google Scholar). We have recently reported the generation of an acetate auxotroph of NMB that permits radiolabeling of LOS to high specific activity (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar). The physical state of the highly radioactive LOS has been examined by gel filtration chromatography under conditions that produce material that can be used directly in bioassays at concentrations that are pathophysiologically relevant (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar). These studies, as well as recent studies with lipopolysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli K12 (29Iovine N. Eastvold J. Elsbach P. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7970-7978Google Scholar), have shown that 1) activation of endothelial cells, as measured by production of IL-8, or 2) activation of blood leukocytes, as measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, can be correlated with changes in the physical and/or biochemical mode of presentation of LOS or LPS (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar). This gel filtration system has been utilized to isolate apparently homogeneous populations of LOS aggregates (LOSagg) and protein:LOS aggregates/complexes (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar, 29Iovine N. Eastvold J. Elsbach P. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7970-7978Google Scholar). Subsequently, the bioactive form of LOS delivered to and responsible for response in mCD14-deficient endothelial cells consists of a complex of LOS with sCD14 that is significantly smaller in molecular size than is LOSagg. Generation of this bioactive LOS containing complex is greatly facilitated by interaction with LBP and involves changes in physical state from an aggregate with an apparentM r 2 × 107 to an active complex with an apparent M r ≤ 100,000. Thus, cellular activation requires the transfer of the amphipathic glycolipid between complex hydrophobic environments, from endotoxin-rich aggregates or monolayers in the bacterial membrane to CD14 and subsequently to Toll-like receptor 4/MD-2 in a host cell membrane. When this transfer of endotoxin occurs across and within aqueous spaces, as it does with sCD14, a role for a lipid carrier might be anticipated. Previous studies have suggested that LBP can play a direct lipid transfer as well as LPS-binding role (30Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1995; 392: 287-295Google Scholar, 31Wurfel M.M. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3925-3934Google Scholar, 32Yu B. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 315-324Google Scholar). We now show that efficient LBP/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LOS and activation of endothelial cells additionally require the presence of albumin. In summary, these findings indicate that albumin is essential for efficient fluid-phase interaction of endotoxin-binding proteins with LOS and subsequent generation of the bioactive species responsible for activation of cells deficient in mCD14. Such a role for albumin is consistent with its prominence in body fluids as a lipid carrier and its ability to bind endotoxin weakly.

[14C]LOS from the mutant strain of encapsulated N. meningitidis serogroup B (NMB ACE-1) was metabolically labeled and isolated as previously described (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar). Briefly, the acetate auxotroph strain NMB ACE-1 was generated by allelic exchange of the putative meningocococcal gene encoding the PDH E1 component (pdhA) with a plasmid containing a copy ofpdhA disrupted by insertion of aK mr cassette (28Giardina P.C.

To obtain [14C]LOS of high specific radioactivity, 160 μCi/ml of [1,2-14C]acetate was added to the medium during growth of meningococci to late log phase. [14C]LOS was purified from radiolabeled bacteria by a modification of the hot phenol-water method (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A.

After ethanol precipitation, the [14C]LOS-containing pellet was dried and resuspended in cold distilled water to an estimated concentration of 100 μg of LOS/ml and then sonicated at room temperature for 15 min in a water bath sonicator.

The specific radioactivity of [14C]LOS was calculated from image and GC-MS analyses as described by Giardina et al. (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar). Columns of Sephacryl HR S500 (1.5 cm × 18 cm) were pre-equilibrated in Hepes-buffered (10 mm, pH 7.4) Hanks' balanced salts solution with divalent cations (HBSS+) ± 0.1% HSA. Aliquots of resuspended and sonicated [14C]LOS were diluted with or without HSA and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before gel filtration chromatography. Chromatography on Sephacryl HR S500 of [14C]LOS, purified as described above, provides a population of [14C]LOS aggregates that elute in the void volume peak fractions,i.e. LOSagg, apparent M r≥ 2 × 107. These fractions served as a source of [14C]LOSagg in subsequent experiments. Chromatographed samples contained from 4 ng to 8 μg LOSagg in 0.2–0.5 ml of column buffer with or without 0.1% HSA. Fractions (1 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. To prepare protein:LOS aggregates, samples were incubated with the indicated proteins for 15 min at 37 °C before application to the column. Samples collected in the absence of albumin were used immediately to prevent loss of material caused by nonspecific sticking. Aliquots of the collected [14C]LOS fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a Beckman LS liquid scintillation counter. Recoveries of the radiolabeled LOSagg + HSA ranged from 70% to 90%; however, recoveries of protein:LOS aggregates in the absence of albumin were lower (in the range of 50–80%). To preclude contamination of purified LOS preparations, all solutions were pyrogen-free and sterile-filtered. The glass columns and connecting tubing were either autoclaved or washed extensively with 70% ethanol. After chromatography, fractions selected for use in bioassays were pooled and passed through sterile syringe filters (0.22 μm pore size) with greater than 90% recovery of labeled material in the sterile filtrate. Fractions were stored under sterile conditions at 4 °C for more than 3 months with no detectable changes in chromatographic or functional properties. The column was calibrated using [14C]oleate-labeledE. coli PL-2 and [14C]acetate as markers of the void (10–11 ml) and inclusion volumes (25–26 ml), respectively, in column buffer with or without 0.1% albumin. Additional standards included blue dextran (M r ≈ 2,000,000), thyroglobulin (650 and 1300 kDa, monomers and dimers, respectively), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Elution profiles of bacteria, blue dextran, and acetate were unaffected by the presence of albumin in the column buffer. Sephacryl S200 chromatography was performed on an AKTA FPLC system using a 1.6 cm × 30 cm column with a flow rate 0.5 ml/min in Hepes-buffered HBSS+; 1-ml fractions were collected and evaluated for the presence of [14C]LOS by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The column was equilibrated with Bio-Rad gel filtration standards that include thyroglobulin (Vo), γ-globulin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and vitamin B12 (Vi). To demonstrate the presence of LBP or CD14 in isolated LOSagg:protein aggregates, samples of LOSagg plus LBP or CD14 were incubated as described with or without HSA, and the aggregates were isolated in the void volume of Sephacryl HR S500 columns equilibrated in Hepes-buffered HBSS+ (1.5 cm x 6 cm). Shorter columns were used to reduce losses of LOSagg during chromatography without albumin and allow efficient isolation of the large aggregates. Void volume fractions containing LOSagg were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid; the precipitated material was washed and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Control samples containing only LBP or sCD14 with no LOS were also chromatographed and treated in a similar manner. In addition to these samples, control samples of LBP and sCD14 of varying concentrations were electrophoresed using anAmersham Biosciences PhastGel system through either 12.5% or 10–15% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry transfer using the same system. To block nonspecific background on the immunoblots, the nitrocellulose was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 and then blocked with 3% BSA in the same buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing, the blots were treated with the appropriate primary antibody (1:1000 rabbit anti-LBP or 1:500 rabbit anti-CD14 serum) diluted in 1% BSA/PBS/0.05% Tween-20 overnight at 25 °C. After washing with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (donkey anti-rabbit IgG) for 1 h at 25 °C and washed with PBS/0.05% Tween-20. The blots were then developed using the Pierce SuperSignal substrate system. To capture protein-containing aggregates/complexes of LOS, appropriate antibodies and controls (1 μg/well) were diluted in Hepes-buffered HBSS+/1% HSA and applied to Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp plates in pH 9.6 bicarbonate buffer overnight at 25 °C. The wells were rinsed with HBSS+/Hepes/1% HSA three times and then incubated for 2 h with each well filled with blocking buffer (Hepes/HBSS+/1% HSA). The ligand to be captured by the antibody was then incubated overnight with shaking at 25 °C. The supernatant was removed and an aliquot reserved for evaluation of the unbound LOS radioactivity. The wells were washed three times with HBSS+/Hepes/1% HSA. Captured material was eluted with 2% SDS by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed and the recovery was evaluated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. HUVEC were routinely cultured on collagen-coated plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 10 ng/ml human endothelial growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells were subcultured and grown to confluence (∼4–5 days). Cell monolayers were then washed twice with warm HBSS+ to remove traces of serum before adding experimental media. Experiments were done with cells between passages 2–6. Cells in 48-well tissue culture plates were incubated for at least 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and 0.1% albumin or, where indicated, without albumin or with 0.1% ovalbumin or gelatin with various concentrations of [14C]LOS with or without LBP (0.2 μg/ml) and sCD14 (0.5 μg/ml). Activation of HUVEC was assessed by measuring accumulation of extracellular IL-8 by ELISA (34Denning G.M. Wollenweber L.A. Railsback M.A. Cox C.D. Stoll L.L. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5777-5784Google Scholar). Equivalent responses were observed with 0.1–0.5 μg/ml of LBP and 0.25–1.0 μg/ml sCD14. We have previously described the purification of an apparently homogeneous population of LOS aggregates from NMB ACE1 with an M r ≥ 2 × 107 as determined by gel filtration (Sephacryl S500) in Hepes-buffered HBSS+ supplemented with 0.1% HSA (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar). To examine the possible role of albumin in LBP/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LOSagg and activation of HUVEC, we purified LOSagg in the absence of albumin. Neither the chromatographic profile of LOS nor the overall recovery of LOS was affected by the absence of albumin (Fig.1). The predominant population of LOS aggregates (LOSagg) formed in the absence or presence of albumin migrated with similar apparent M r (≥ 2 × 107). The isolation of LOSagg with or without albumin provided a source of LOSagg to examine the effect of albumin on the physical state of LOS-containing aggregates formed during the interaction of LOSagg with endotoxin-binding proteins and the role of albumin in cell activation by endotoxin. As we have previously shown (28Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Google Scholar), LOSaggformed and isolated in the presence of albumin (LOSaggHSA) was quantitatively disaggregated when incubated with LBP, sCD14, and albumin (Fig.2). In contrast, LOSaggformed and isolated in the absence of albumin (LOSaggNo HSA) and incubated with LBP and sCD14 without albumin was not significantly disaggregated (Fig.2 A). The presence of albumin exerted similar influences on the activation of endothelial cells by LOSagg in the presence of LBP and sCD14. LOSaggHSA isolated and incubated with LBP and sCD14 in the presence of albumin potently activated HUVEC, whereas LOSaggNo HSA with LBP and sCD14 incubated in the absence of albumin did not (Fig. 2 B). If albumin was added either only during the formation/isolation of LOSagg or introduced only during the incubation of cells with LBP and sCD14, substantial but not optimal LOS-dependent cell activation was observed (data not shown). Different commercial sources of human albumin including fatty acid-free albumin, bovine serum albumin, and human serum albumin purified by gel filtration chromatography all had similar effects (data not shown). The requirement for albumin is apparently specific: neither gelatin nor ovalbumin supported LOS-dependent cell activation (Fig. 3 B) or LBP/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LOSagg(Fig. 3 A). Although the chromatographic profile of NMB ACE-1 LOS was similar in 0.1% ovalbumin (LOSaggOVAL) and 0.1% HSA (compares Fig. 1 and 3 A), the recovered LOSaggOVAL was not significantly disaggregated during incubation with LBP and sCD14 in the presence of ovalbumin (Fig.3 A). Overall recoveries of [14C]LOS either from the chromatographic step or from cell cultures were not appreciably different under the various experimental conditions. These findings strongly suggest that albumin is an essential cofactor for LBP/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LOSaggand activation of endothelial cells. Fig. 4 illustrates that albumin is also needed for optimal LBP/sCD14-dependent activation of HUVEC by E. coli K12 (LCD25) lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Incubation of LPSagg plus LBP, sCD14, and albumin produces disaggregation of LPSagg (29Iovine N. Eastvold J. Elsbach P. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7970-7978Google Scholar). However, recoveries of LPSagg and LPSagg:protein complexes during Sephacryl S500 chromatography in the absence of albumin were low (< 30%), precluding a direct assessment of the role of albumin in LPB/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LPS. To better define where and when albumin is needed to facilitate LBP/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LOSagg, we first examined whether the combined action of LBP and sCD14 in the presence of albumin on LOSaggHSA required the simultaneous presence of these proteins or ordered sequential interactions with LOSaggHSA. For this purpose, gel chromatography was employed to recover LOSagg exposed to either LBP or sCD14 alone. The aggregates formed with LOSaggHSA were separated from any free protein that was not physically associated with LOSaggHSA. In a manner similar to the recently described interactions of LPSagg with LBP (29Iovine N. Eastvold J. Elsbach P. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7970-7978Google Scholar), incubation of LOSaggHSA with LBP alone had no direct disaggregating effects at the concentration utilized in these assays. However, LOSagg recovered after exposure to LBP (i.e. (LOSagg:LBP)HSA; Fig.5 A) was associated with LBP as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 5 insert) and was disaggregated by subsequent treatment with sCD14 to an extent comparable to the disaggregation observed by simultaneous treatment of LOSaggHSA with LBP, sCD14, and albumin (for comparison see Figs. 2 A and 5 A). Treatment of LOSaggHSA directly with sCD14 in albumin resulted in little or no disaggregation (Fig. 5 B) under the conditions and concentrations indicated. The addition of LBP (+ albumin) to the recovered LOSaggHSA treated with sCD14 (LOSagg:sCD14)HSA also did not produce disaggregation of LOSagg (Fig. 5 B). The lack of disaggregation is consistent with the results of immunoblots of the sCD14-treated LOSagg that indicated no significant association of sCD14 with recovered LOSagg. Therefore, efficient LBP/sCD14-dependent disaggregation of LOSagg requires prior interaction of LOSaggwith LBP in the presence of albumin before exposure to sCD14. Because extraction of LOS from LOSaggby sCD14 occurred only after formation of LOSagg:LBP, we expected that this would be the step in which the presence of albumin would be most essential. However, as shown in Fig. 5 C, the absence of albumin during the exposure of LOSagg to LBP precluded subsequent sCD14 disaggregation of LOSagg even when albumin was introduced with sCD14. Immunoblots of LOSagg recovered after incubation with LBP with or without albumin indicated similar association of LBP with LOSagg in the presence or absence of albumin (compare blots"
https://openalex.org/W1973709348,"CtBP (carboxyl-terminal binding protein) has been shown to be a highly conserved co-repressor of transcription that is important in development, cell cycle regulation, and transformation. Viral proteins E1A and EBNA3C and all the variousDrosophila and vertebrate transcription factors to which CtBP has been reported to bind contain a conserved “PXDLS” CtBP-interaction domain. Here we show that EBNA3A binds CtBP both in vitro and in vivo but that this interaction does not require a near consensus98PLDLR102 motif in the NH2terminus of EBNA3A. However, further deletion and mutation analysis revealed that CtBP interacts with this viral protein through a cryptic, bipartite motif located in the COOH terminus of EBNA3A. The two components of this binding domain are similar to the canonical PXDLS motif but do not include the highly conserved, and normally critical, first proline residue. These nonconsensus sites,857ALDLS861 and886VLDLS890, synergize to produce very efficient binding to CtBP. Interaction with CtBP was shown to be important in the repression of transcription by EBNA3A and in the ability of EBNA3A to cooperate with activated Ras to immortalize and transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts. Similar bipartite sequences can be found in other viral and cellular proteins that can interact with CtBP, including the retinoblastoma-interacting protein-methyltransferase RIZ, the oncoprotein EVI1, and Marek's disease virus transforming protein Meq.

Although the precise significance of this interaction remains unknown, it is essential for the immortalization of primary rodent cells by E1A and it has also been reported to negatively modulate E1A-mediated transformation, tumorigenicity, and metastasis (1Quinlan M.P. Douglas J.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2020-2030Google Scholar, 2Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that this E1A-binding protein is one of a highly conserved family of co-repressors of transcription. In Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila CtBP mediates transcriptional repression by numerous factors involved in developmental programs of gene expression including Knirps, Kruppel, Snail, Polycomb, Hairy, and Hairless (3Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Google Scholar, 4Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Google Scholar, 5Poortinga G. Watanabe M.

CtBP also interacts withXenopus laevis (xPC) and human (HPC2) polycomb proteins and thus may be involved in vertebrate gene silencing (7Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Google Scholar). Human CtBP also acts as a co-repressor for the ZEB factors that are involved in the regulation of lymphocyte and muscle differentiation (8Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Google Scholar), and it mediates the repressor and transforming activities of the oncoprotein EVI1 (9Palmer S. Brouillet J.P. Kilbey A. Fulton R. Walker M. Crossley M. Bartholomew C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25834-25840Google Scholar, 10Kilbey A. Bartholomew C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2287-2291Google Scholar). In mice, CtBP is a co-repressor for the NET member of the Ets family of transcription factors and oncogenes (11Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Google Scholar). Furthermore, murine CtBP participates in the Ikaros repression complex (12Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Google Scholar). Angustifolia, the first plant member of the CtBP family was recently identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (13Kim G.T. Shoda K. Tsuge T. Cho K.H. Uchimiya H. Yokoyama R. Nishitani K. Tsukaya H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1267-1279Google Scholar, 14Folkers U. Kirik V. Schobinger U. Falk S. Krishnakumar S. Pollock M.A. Oppenheimer D.G. Day I. Reddy A.S. Jurgens G. Hulskamp M. Reddy A.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1280-1288Google Scholar). It has been reported that in some situations CtBP can recruit chromatin-modifying histone deacetylase enzymes HDAC1, -4, -5, and -7 and that it can also bind Sin3A. However, on some promoters CtBP-mediated repression is independent of HDAC activity (15Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Google Scholar), so presently the precise molecular mechanism by which CtBP inhibits transcription is unknown and may turn out to be quite different in different situations (11Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Google Scholar, 12Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Google Scholar, 15Chinnadurai G. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Google Scholar). All these various factors that regulate transcription and bind to CtBP contain a conserved Pro-X-Asp-Leu-Ser (“PXDLS”) CtBP-interaction domain that is necessary and probably sufficient for the interaction. The conserved proline and leucine residues are generally considered essential for efficient binding (15Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Google Scholar, 18Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Google Scholar, 19Molloy D.P. Milner A.E. Yakub I.K. Chinnadurai G. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20867-20876Google Scholar). A second mammalian CtBP was recently described and the two family members, which are referred to as CtBP1 and CtBP2, are largely homologous although they may have distinct tissue distributions (20Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Google Scholar). The protein described in this report is human CtBP1 and hereafter will be referred to as CtBP. The PXDLS amino acid motif is also found in a human cellular protein called CtIP (CtBP-interactingprotein). CtIP was shown to bridge an interaction between the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and CtBP, forming a complex that can repress E2F-regulated genes and thus participate in the regulation of the cell proliferation cycle; CtIP probably bridges p130 and CtBP in a similar manner (16Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Google Scholar, 21Fusco C. Reymond A. Zervos A.S. Genomics. 1998; 51: 351-358Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that CtBP and CtIP form a link between human polycomb group proteins and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and this repressor complex appears to inhibit cyclin A and cdc2 expression and block entry into mitosis (22Dahiya A. Wong S. Gonzalo S. Gavin M. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 557-569Google Scholar). CtIP has also been shown to bind to the carboxyl-terminal region of the breast cancer-associated tumor suppressor and transcription factor BRCA1 and may be involved in the regulation of p21WAF1 and GADD45 genes by BRCA1 (17Yu X. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Google Scholar, 23Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 2001; 414: 36Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that the binding of CtBP to viral and cellular transcriptional repressors is regulated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides NAD+ and NADH has led to the suggestion that CtBP may serve as a redox sensor for transcription (26Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Google Scholar). The EBNA3A gene has been shown by genetic analysis using recombinant viruses, to be one of the five viral genes that are absolutely essential for the efficient activation and immortalization of human B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (27Kempkes B. Pich D. Zeidler R. Sugden B. Hammerschmidt W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 231-238Google Scholar, 28Kieff E. Rickinson A.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Fourth Ed. Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2511Google Scholar, 29Tomkinson B. Robertson E. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2014-2025Google Scholar). The large (944-amino acid) nuclear protein it encodes is one of a family of three nuclear antigens that probably arose by gene duplication events. EBNAs-3A, -3B, and -3C have limited but significant amino acid sequence homology, have the same gene structure (a short 5′ exon and a long 3′ exon), and are tandemly arranged in the genome (28Kieff E. Rickinson A.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Fourth Ed. Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2511Google Scholar). Genetic studies using recombinant viruses have shown that EBNA3A and EBNA3C are essential for in vitro immortalization of B cells, whereas EBNA3B is dispensable (29Tomkinson B. Robertson E. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2014-2025Google Scholar). All three proteins bind to a cellular DNA-binding protein known as CBF1 or RBP-JK. This factor also binds to, and targets to DNA, the EBV transactivator protein EBNA2 and also the IC-Notch effector of the Notch signaling pathway (30Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 423-434Google Scholar). EBNA3A, -3B, and -3C can all repress EBNA2-mediated transactivation of the EBV LMP-2 promoter (31Le Roux A. Kerdiles B. Walls D. Dedieu J.F. Perricaudet M. Virology. 1994; 205: 596-602Google Scholar) and EBNA3A and -3C can repress reporter plasmids containing the RBP-JK/CBF1 sites from the EBV Cp promoter independently of EBNA2-mediated activation (32Radkov S.A. Bain M. Farrell P.J. West M. Rowe M. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8552-8562Google Scholar). Because Cp is the promoter for all EBNA mRNA initiation in lymphoblastoid cells immortalized by EBV (LCLs), the EBNA3 proteins probably contribute to a negative autoregulatory control loop. In addition, both EBNA3A and EBNA3C exhibit robust repressor activity when targeted to DNA by fusion with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (33Bain M. Watson R.J. Farrell P.J. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2481-2489Google Scholar, 34Cludts I. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1862-1869Google Scholar, 35Waltzer L. Perricaudet M. Sergeant A. Manet E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5909-5915Google Scholar). The repression by EBNA3C is partly mediated by interactions with cellular histone deacetylase and possibly CtBP, but the mechanism of EBNA3A-mediated repression is unknown. It was recently shown that EBNA3C can bind CtBP in vitro andin vivo through a PLDLS motif located in its COOH terminus (amino acids 728–732). This binding is required for EBNA3C to act as a co-operating oncogene (36Touitou R. Hickabottom M. Parker G. Crook T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7749-7755Google Scholar). We were therefore prompted to consider whether EBNA3A may also bind this co-repressor and whether it has similar oncogenic activity. CtBP generally binds to proteins including a PXDLS motif but there are several reports that binding can occur through a variant amino acid sequence, PLDLR (18Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Google Scholar). Because EBNA3A has PLDLR located at amino acids 98–102, GST pull-down experiments were performed to determine whether, like EBNA3C, this related protein binds CtBP in a similar manner. We report that EBNA3A can physically and functionally interact with CtBP but that this does not require the98PLDLR102 motif. The interaction was shown to depend on two cryptic sites located near the COOH terminus of the protein that bind CtBP synergistically. These sites appear to be necessary for EBNA3A-mediated repression of transcription and, as with EBNA3C, binding to CtBP correlated with the ability of EBNA3A to co-operate with oncogenic Ras in primary rodent fibroblasts. Consistent with this, EBNA3A was co-immunoprecipitated with rat CtBP from the EBNA3A-positive immortalized and transformed rat embryo fibroblasts. pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A contains cDNA encoding the full-length EBNA3A protein fused in-frame with an HA epitope. The plasmids pSP72-E3A-(1–524) and pSP72-E3A-(500–944) expressing fragments of EBNA3A were described previously (34Cludts I. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1862-1869Google Scholar). Mutants of EBNA3A were created by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) of the pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A plasmid using the following primers: pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A(ALDAR), GCCATTCTCCGCAGGTTTGCACTAGATGCAAGAACACTTCTTCAAGCG and CGCTTGAAGAAGTGTTCTTGCATCTAGTGCAAACCTGCGGAGAATGGC; pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A(ALDAA), GCAGGGCCTGCCATGGATCGCCGCATCAAGAGCTTCACACGG and CCGTGTGAAGCTCTTGATGCGGCGATCCATGGCAGGCCCTGT; pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A(VLDAA), GATGCCACCGAGGTTCTTGATGCGGCGATCCATGGCAGGCCCCGCCC and GGGCGGGGCCTGCCATGGATCGCCGCATCAAGAACCTCGGTGGCATC. pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A (2× mutant) was created by performing site-directed mutagenesis on pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A(VLDAA) with the primers used in the creation of the EBNA3A(ALDAA) mutant described above. pcDNA3-HA-GaL4DBD-EBNA3A is a plasmid that expresses the 147-amino acid GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) with an NH2-terminal HA epitope tag and has been described previously (36Touitou R. Hickabottom M. Parker G. Crook T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7749-7755Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HA-GAL4DBD-EBNA3A contains cDNA encoding full-length EBNA3A cloned in-frame with HA-tagged GAL4 DBD to create a fusion protein when expressed. pcDNA3-HA-GAL4DBD-EBNA3A was constructed by PCR from pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A with the primers: ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAACTATATGGACAAGGACAGGCCGGG and GCTCTAGAGCTTAGGCCTCATCTGGAGGATC and cloned as anXbaI-NotI fragment into pcDNA3-HA-GAL4DBD. pcDNA3-HA-GAL4DBD-EBNA3A (2× mutant) was created by removal of anAgeI-XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-HA-GAL4DBD-EBNA3A, which was replaced by a similar AgeI-XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A (2× mutant). pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A contains the full-length Rhesus EBNA3A cDNA in-frame with a FLAG epitope tag. The vectors pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A(ALDLS) and pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A(AIDAS) were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A vector using the following primers; pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A(ALDLS), CCCTCATTTTTTGGAGTTACCGCACTTGATCTCAGCCAGGTGAGCTTTGATGAG and CTCATCAAAGCTCACCTGGCTGAGATCAAGTGCGGTAACGCCAAAAAATGAGGG; pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A(AIDAS), GAGGCTTCAGAGTTATGTGACGCTATTGATGCATCAATCCATGGCAGGCCCACC and GGTGGGCCTGCCATGGATTGATGCATCAATAGCGTCACATAACTCTGAAGCCTC. The plasmid pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A (ALDLS, AIDAS) was created by performing site-directed mutagenesis on pcDNA3-flag-RhE3A(ALDLS) using the primers described for the creation of the AIDAS mutant. pcDNA3-EBNA3B and pcDNA3-EBNA3C contain full-length EBNA3B and -3C cDNAs, respectively, and have been described previously (36Touitou R. Hickabottom M. Parker G. Crook T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7749-7755Google Scholar). The plasmid pSG5-HA-CtBP contains cDNA encoding the full-length human CtBP1 fused in-frame with an HA epitope tag. The plasmid was constructed by PCR from pGex-CtBP using the primers: CGGAATTCCGATGGGCAGCTCGCACTTG and CGGAATTCCGCTACAACTGGTCACTGGC and cloned as an EcoRI fragment into pSG5-HA. The plasmid SVβ-gal for the expression of β-galactosidase in mammalian cells has been described previously (37Radkov S.A. Touitou R. Brehm A. Rowe M. West M. Kouzarides T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5688-5697Google Scholar). The plasmid pGL-UAS (a gift from Roger Watson) contains luciferase cDNA under the control of a Gal4 responsive promoter. EJ6.6 includes an activated human (Ha)-ras under the control of the SV40 early promoter (38Crook T. Fisher C. Vousden K.H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 505-510Google Scholar). pGEX-CtBP for bacterial expression of a GST-CtBP fusion protein was described previously (36Touitou R. Hickabottom M. Parker G. Crook T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7749-7755Google Scholar). Similarly, pGEX-RBP-JK was used for the expression of GST-RBP-JK in bacteria as described previously (32Radkov S.A. Bain M. Farrell P.J. West M. Rowe M. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8552-8562Google Scholar,34Cludts I. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1862-1869Google Scholar, 37Radkov S.A. Touitou R. Brehm A. Rowe M. West M. Kouzarides T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5688-5697Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HPC2 contains a full-length HPC2 cDNA, pcDNA3-HDAC4 contains a full-length HDAC4 cDNA, and pcDNA3-myc-CtIP contains a Myc-tagged CtIP cDNA (16Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Google Scholar). Assays were performed essentially as described previously (37Radkov S.A. Touitou R. Brehm A. Rowe M. West M. Kouzarides T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5688-5697Google Scholar). In vitro translated test proteins were adsorbed to GST-coated Sepharose beads for 1 h by rotation at 4 °C in 200 μl of EBC buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaF, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The beads were sedimented by centrifugation, and the cleared supernatant was incubated with GST or GST-CtBP protein bound-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 90 min. The beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of NETN (300 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). The beads were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Results were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions and the purification of GST proteins were carried out as previously described (33Bain M. Watson R.J. Farrell P.J. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2481-2489Google Scholar, 36Touitou R. Hickabottom M. Parker G. Crook T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7749-7755Google Scholar). For Western blot and immunofluorescent detection of EBNA3A a sheep anti-EBNA3A polyclonal antibody (Exalpha Biologicals) was used. For immunoprecipitation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from cell extracts the mouse monoclonal antibody PC10 was used, which was a kind gift from Dr. X. Lu. The antibodies horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep, and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep were used in the detection of CtBP and EBNA3A by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence and were supplied by Dako. The rabbit anti-CtBP serum was raised against GST-CtBP. Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described previously (37Radkov S.A. Touitou R. Brehm A. Rowe M. West M. Kouzarides T. Allday M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5688-5697Google Scholar). Briefly 107 cells were harvested and washed once in ice-cold PBS. The cells were collected by centrifugation and the pellet re-suspended in 600 μl of IP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The cell suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min and the debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was split into 200-μl aliquots per immunoprecipitation reaction and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads was added before the mixture was mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were next pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Complexes were then precipitated with an antibody specific for the protein of interest and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on an orbital rotor for 2 h. After this, 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture and it was left to rotate at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were next washed 4 times in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. 30 μl of SDS sample buffer was then added to the pelleted beads, boiled, centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for Western blot analysis. EBNA3A and Ras-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts (REF) were grown on coverslips before being washed 3 times with PBS. The cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 15 min and then washed twice with PBS. Cells were then incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min before being washed twice with PBS and then blocked with 100 mm glycine. After washing twice in PBG (0.2% gelatin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) the cells were incubated with sheep anti-EBNA3A antibody for 1 h. After 4 washes in PBG the cells were incubated with a FITC-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody for 1 h before a further 4 washes with PBG and a final wash in PBS. The coverslips were mounted on slides and viewed on a confocal microscope. Western blots were performed as previously described (39Parker G.A. Crook T. Bain M. Sara E.A. Farrell P.J. Allday M.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2541-2549Google Scholar) and probed with a sheep anti-EBNA3A antibody for the detection of EBNA3A or with rabbit anti-CtBP serum for the detection of CtBP. DG75 cells (a Burkitt's lymphoma-derived cell line) and LCL lines were grown in suspension and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen)/ml. REFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen)/ml with transformed REFs being selected by the addition of G418 (400 μg/ml) to the media. DG75 cells were transfected with 10 μg of each of the EBNA3A expressing vectors and a CtBP expressing vector for the immunoprecipitation experiments. For reporter assays, 2 μg of SVβ-gal, 7 μg of pGL-UAS, and varying amounts of pcDNA3-HA-GAL4DBD-EBNA3A wt or 2× mutant. The total amounts of DNA were balanced throughout with control vector DNA. Electroporation was used to transfect DG75 cells. Cells were split at a density of 2 × 105/ml 24 h prior to transfection. DNA was added to 0.4-cm3 cuvettes (Bio-Rad) and the volume was made up to 50 μl with unsupplemented RPMI. 107 cells were harvested per transfection. These cells were pelleted at 1400 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained as conditioned medium. The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of unsupplemented RPMI, added to the cuvette, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Electroporation was performed at 250 V, 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cuvettes were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min after which the transfected cells were resuspended by pipette and added to 10 ml of medium (7.5 ml of conditioned medium and 2.5 ml of fresh RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum). Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h before harvesting. Transfected cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in PBS. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and the pellet was lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. Debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. Twenty μl of supernatant per transfection was used in the luciferase assay or in the β-galactosidase assay. Luciferase activity was measured on an Autolumat luminometer using a luciferase detection reagent (Promega). To measure β-galactosidase activity 20 μl of cell lysate per transfection was added to one well of a 96-well tissue culture plate. 150 μl of reaction mixture (1.25 mm CaCl2, 25 μm chlorophenol red-β-galactopyranoside) was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37 °C until the yellow color of the mixture began changing to red. Absorbance at 570 nm was taken as a measure of β-galactosidase activity. All luciferase activity values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity in the lysate. Primary Fisher rat embryo fibroblasts (Biowhittaker UK Ltd.) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of EJ6.6 plasmid expressing Ha-ras and 10 μg of pcDNA3-HA-EBNA3A wt or mutants essentially as described previously (39Parker G.A. Crook T. Bain M. Sara E.A. Farrell P.J. Allday M.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2541-2549Google Scholar). Cells were supplied with fresh, supplemented media containing G418 (400 μg/ml) every 3 days and after 3–4 weeks morphologically transformed colonies of cells were scored by microscope observation. An analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of EBNA3A had revealed a sequence in the NH2 terminus (amino acids 98–102) similar to the PLDLR CtBP binding motif in HDAC4, HPC2, and xPC (18Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Google Scholar). Because CtBP is a co-repressor of transcription and EBNA3A can repress transcription and is a close relative of EBNA3C (that has been shown to bind CtBP), the ability of in vitro translated EBNA3A to bind to a GST fusion with CtBP was tested. Similar experiments were also performed in parallel with EBNA3C and also EBNA3B. This revealed that although EBNA3B showed no binding, EBNA3A appeared to bind to CtBP with even greater affinity than EBNA3C (Fig.1 A). However, mutagenesis of the PLDLR to ALDAR had no effect on binding to CtBP and parallel experiments showed that the binding activity was localized within the COOH, not the NH2 terminus of EBNA3A (Fig. 1,B–D). EBNA3A binding to CtBP is clearly not mediated through the 98PLDLR102 motif. Further inspection of the amino acid sequence of the COOH terminus of EBNA3A revealed two potential, but variant, CtBP binding motifs at amino acids 857–861 (ALDLS) and 886–890 (VLDLS). A recent study of the CtBP-binding site in E1A indicated that the initial proline residue in PXDLS was extremely important for the efficient binding and mutation to alanine dramatically reduced the affinity between CtBP and a peptide (19Molloy D.P. Milner A.E. Yakub I.K. Chinnadurai G. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20867-20876Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, various cross-species comparisons of well characterized CtBP-binding sites showed that the initial proline is almost invariably conserved (15Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Google Scholar, 18Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the absence of alternative candidates these sites in EBNA3A were investigated. Initially, by introducing stop codons, deletions of the COOH terminus of EBNA3A were produced. The truncated mutant EBNA3A1–875 includes only857ALDLS861, whereas the truncated mutant EBNA3A1–847 does not include either potential binding site. Pull-down experiments showed that EBNA3A1–875 binds to GST-CtBP with reduced affinity and EBNA3A1–847shows no binding in similar assays (data not shown). To analyze the relative importance of these sites further,857ALDLS861 was mutated to ALDAA or886VLDLS890 was changed to VLDAA. In addition, another mutant was constructed in which both sites were mutated (ALDAA, VLDAA). The resulting pull-down experiments (Fig.2 A) demonstrated that when either site was mutated there was a decrease in binding and when both sites were mutated, no binding was detected. Quantitation of the binding using a phosphorimaging system revealed the relative binding to each site and showed that binding was synergistic rather than additive (Fig. 2 D). The data are consistent with857ALDLS861 being a very weak binding site,886VLDLS890 having moderate binding activity, and together these variant sites cooperating to bind CtBP with very high efficienc"

We have already shown that acute (2 min) activation of A2a purinoceptors stimulates NO production in human fetal umbilical vein endothelial cells (1) and now report a key role for p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p42/p44MAPK) in the regulation of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. Expression of mRNA for the A2a-, A2b-, and A3-adenosine receptor subtypes was abundant whereas A1-adenosine receptor mRNA levels were negligible. Activation of A2a purinoceptors by adenosine (10 fM) or the A2a receptor agonist CGS21680 (100 nM) resulted in an increase in L-arginine transport and NO release that was not mediated by changes in intracellular Ca2+, pH, or cAMP. Stimulation of endothelial cells with adenosine was associated with a membrane hyperpolarization and phosphorylation of p42/p44MAPK. L-NAME abolished the adenosine-induced hyperpolarization and stimulation of L-arginine transport whereas sodium nitroprusside activated an outward potassium current. Genistein (10 fM) and PD98059 (10 fM), an inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), inhibited adenosine-stimulated L-arginine transport, NO production, and phosphorylation of p42/p44MAPK. We found no evidence for activation of eNOS via the serine/threonine kinase Akt/ PKB (protein kinase B) in adenosine-stimulated cells. Our results provide the first evidence that adenosine stimulates the endothelial cell L-arginine-NO pathway in aCa2+-insensitive manner involving p42/p44MAPK, with release of NO leading to a membrane hyperpolarization and activation of L-arginine transport.—Wyatt, A.

https://openalex.org/W1964208976,"The critical step in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) is the conversion of a cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a protease-resistant, β-sheet rich form (PrPSc). Although the disease transmission normally requires direct interaction between exogenous PrPSc and endogenous PrPC, the pathogenic process in hereditary prion diseases appears to develop spontaneously (i.e. not requiring infection with exogenous PrPSc). To gain insight into the molecular basis of hereditary spongiform encephalopathies, we have characterized the biophysical properties of the recombinant human prion protein variant containing the mutation (Phe198 → Ser) associated with familial Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease. Compared with the wild-type protein, the F198S variant shows a dramatically increased propensity to self-associate into β-sheet-rich oligomers. In a guanidine HCl-containing buffer, the transition of the F198S variant from a normal α-helical conformation into an oligomeric β-sheet structure is about 50 times faster than that of the wild-type protein. Importantly, in contrast to the wild-type PrP, the mutant protein undergoes a spontaneous conversion to oligomeric β-sheet structure even in the absence of guanidine HCl or any other denaturants. In addition to β-sheet structure, the oligomeric form of the protein is characterized by partial resistance to proteinase K digestion, affinity for amyloid-specific dye, thioflavine T, and fibrillar morphology. The increased propensity of the F198S variant to undergo a conversion to a PrPSc-like form correlates with a markedly decreased thermodynamic stability of the native α-helical conformer of the mutant protein.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, comprise a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect both animals and humans. These disorders include bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, scrapie in sheep, chronic waste disorder in deer and elk, and kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) 1The abbreviations used are: GSS, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; PrP, prion protein; PrPC, cellular PrP isoform; PrPSc, scrapie PrP isoform; huPrP90–231, recombinant human prion protein fragment 90–231; ThT, thioflavine T. in humans. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies may arise sporadically, may be inherited (familial forms), or may be acquired by transmission of an infectious agent (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 2Weissmann C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 3-11Google Scholar, 3Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Google Scholar, 4Caughey B. Chesebro B. Adv. Virus Res. 2001; 56: 277-311Google Scholar). The prion diseases are associated with the accumulation of an abnormal form (PrPSc) of host-derived cellular prion protein (PrPC). According to the “protein-only” hypothesis, PrPSc represents the sole component of the infectious prion agent (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 5Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Google Scholar). Although the ultimate proof for this hypothesis is still missing (6Caughey B. Nature Med. 2000; 6: 751-754Google Scholar), the central role of PrP in the pathogenesis of prion diseases is strongly supported by a wealth of biochemical and genetic data (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 2Weissmann C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 3-11Google Scholar, 3Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Google Scholar, 4Caughey B. Chesebro B. Adv. Virus Res. 2001; 56: 277-311Google Scholar). Furthermore, unexpected support for the protein-only model comes from studying prion-like phenomena in yeast. A series of recent studies on protein-based inheritance in these organisms has provided mechanistic “proof of principle,” unequivocally demonstrating that as predicted by the prion hypothesis, proteins can act as infectious agents by causing self-propagating conformational changes (7Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Google Scholar, 8Lindquist S. Cell. 1997; 89: 495-498Google Scholar, 9Sparrer H.E. Santoso A. Szoka F.C. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 289: 595-599Google Scholar). Cellular human prion protein (PrPC) is a glycoprotein that contains a single disulfide bond, is N-glycosylated, and attached to the plasma membrane by a C-terminally linked glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. Although covalent structures of PrPC and PrPSc have been found to be identical (10Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Google Scholar), the two isoforms have dramatically different physiochemical properties. PrPC is monomeric and readily degradable by protolytic enzymes, whereas PrPSc exists as an insoluble aggregate that shows dramatically increased resistance to digestion by proteinase K (1Prusiner S.B.

Furthermore, spectroscopic data indicate that the two prion protein isoforms are characterized by different secondary structure; PrPC is largely α-helical, whereas PrPSc is rich in β-sheet structure (12Caughey B.W.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 509-583Google Scholar). Over 20 mutations in the human PrP gene have been identified to date that segregate with familial Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease, GSS, or fatal familial insomnia (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 2Weissmann C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 3-11Google Scholar, 3Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Google Scholar, 15Gambetti P. Petersen R.B.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 509-583Google Scholar). Because the PrPC→PrPSc conversion in hereditary prion diseases appears to occur spontaneously (i.e. without the presence of an exogenous PrPSc), studies with prion protein variants containing familial mutations could provide important clues regarding the molecular mechanism of the pathogenic process in spongiform encephalopathies. In this study, we have characterized the biophysical properties of the F198S variant of the recombinant human prion protein. The F198S mutation, associated with familial GSS (15Gambetti P. Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Chen S.G. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Gabizon R. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Picardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9349-9353Google Scholar), results in a marked destabilization of the native α-helical conformation of PrPC. Remarkably, the present data show that, compared with the wild-type PrP, the mutant protein is characterized by a greatly increased propensity to undergo a conversion to an oligomeric β-sheet-rich form with physicochemical properties similar to those of brain PrPSc. The plasmid encoding huPrP90–231 with a N-terminal linker containing a His6 tail and a thrombin cleavage site was described previously (17Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Google Scholar). The F198S mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate primers and a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The wild-type and F198S variant proteins were expressed, cleaved with thrombin, and purified as described previously (17Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Google Scholar, 18Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Google Scholar), with the exception that cleavage of F198S huPrP90–231 was carried on for 48 h at room temperature in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.6 (10 units of thrombin/mg of protein). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient (ε276) of 21,640 m−1cm−1. The far UV CD spectra were obtained at room temperature on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Typically, five spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the spectra were corrected for small contribution of a buffer. The measurements were performed at room temperature in 0.2-mm- or 1-cm-pathlength cells. The urea-induced unfolding curves of the proteins were obtained using a model JWATS-489 automatic titrator attached to the spectropolarimeter. In a typical equilibrium unfolding experiment, two stock solutions of huPrP90–231 at identical protein concentrations (1.2 μm) were prepared: one in buffer alone (native protein) and one in an appropriate buffer containing 9m urea (unfolded protein). The buffers used were 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4, 5, and 5.5) and 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7). For each unfolding/refolding curve, a sample in 9 m urea was titrated (in ∼0.1 murea increments) to a sample of native protein in a 1-cm-pathlength cell. Upon each urea addition, the mixture was incubated for 10 s, and the ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded for 32 s. In the control experiments, it was verified that an incubation time of less than 1 s is sufficient for the system to reach equilibrium (the unfolding/refolding of the prion protein is very fast, occurring on the millisecond time scale) (19Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar) and that the unfolding and refolding reactions are fully reversible. Urea was deionized using a mixture of anion exchange (trimethylbenzylammonium) and cation exchange (Dowex MR-3) resins, and its concentration was determined by measuring the refractive index. Infrared spectra were obtained at 25 °C on a Bruker IFS 66 instrument. Samples of either wild-type huPrP90–231 or F198S huPrP90–231 were dissolved in a buffer prepared in D2O (50 mm acetate, pD 5.5) and placed between two calcium fluoride windows separated by a 50-μm Teflon spacer. For each spectrum, 256 scans were accumulated, and the spectra were corrected for absorption of the buffer. Analytical size exclusion experiments were performed on a Bio-Sil SEC-250 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) attached to a Shimadzu SCL-10Avp high pressure liquid chromatography system. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the elution of proteins was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with molecular mass standards for size exclusion chromatography. The light scattering experiments were performed at room temperature on a DynoPro-801 dynamic light scattering instrument (Protein Solution, Inc.). Prior to the measurements, the buffers were filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. The data were analyzed with Dynamics 4.0 software (Protein Solutions, Inc.). The progress of amyloid fibril formation was followed by a fluorimetric thioflavine T (ThT) assay (20Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Google Scholar). Typically, the proteins (60 or 120 μm) were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Small aliquots of each sample (5 or 10 μl for 120 or 60 μm protein solutions, respectively) were withdrawn at different time points and transferred to a quartz cell containing 10 μm ThT in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. After 30 s of incubation at room temperature, the fluorescence was measured at 482 nm using the excitation wavelength of 450 nm. The final protein concentration in the ThT buffer was 3 μm. Samples for electron microscopy were prepared by incubating the wild-type huPrP90–231 or F198S huPrP90–231 (120 μm) at 37 °C in a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Following incubation for 3–5 days, a drop of each sample was placed on a carbon-coated 600-mesh copper grid (Electron Microscope Sciences) and negatively stained with 2% aqueous (w/v) uranyl acetate. Grid preparations were visualized using a JEOL 1200 transmission microscope operating at 80 keV. Samples of the wild-type huPrP90–231 and the F198S variant (120 μm in each case) were preincubated for 5 days at 37 °C in 50 mm acetate, pH 5.5. The protein samples were then transferred to the digestion buffer (50 mm acetate, pH 5.5) containing various amounts of proteinase K (0–50 μg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The final protein concentration in the digestion mixture was 30 μm. The reaction was terminated by boiling the samples in Laemmli electrophoretic buffer (Sigma). The protein fragments were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The effect of the F198S substitution on the thermodynamic stability of the prion protein at different pH values was probed by equilibrium unfolding in urea. At a given pH, the unfolding of the mutant protein occurs at a lower urea concentration than that of the wild-type huPrP90–231 (unfolding curves not shown for brevity). In each case, the experimental curves could be fitted according to a two-state unfolding model (21Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). The results of such fitting analysis, expressed in terms of the midpoint unfolding urea concentration (Cm) and an apparent free energy difference between the native and unfolded state (ΔG o) are summarized in TableI. It should be noted that the apparently good mathematical fit may be fortuitous because the equilibrium unfolding data alone are insufficient to prove the applicability of the two-state unfolding model. Nevertheless, the urea unfolding curves clearly indicate that at each pH value studied the Phe198→ Ser substitution results in a markedly decreased global thermodynamic stability of the prion protein.Table IpH-dependent thermodynamic stability of the wild-type huPrP90–231 and the F198S huPrP90–231pHhuPrP90–231CmaMidpoint unfolding urea concentration.ΔGbFree energy difference between the native and unfolded state.(M)(kJ/mol)4F198S2.67.1 ± 1.0Wild type3.412.0 ± 0.55F198S3.511.9 ± 0.8Wild type4.519.1 ± 0.75.5F198S3.813.7 ± 0.6Wild type5.320.8 ± 0.97F198S4.017.8 ± 0.5Wild type6.126.0 ± 0.6a Midpoint unfolding urea concentration.b Free energy difference between the native and unfolded state.

Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Google Scholar), the recombinant prion protein undergoes a transition to an oligomeric β-sheet-rich structure with essential physiochemical properties similar to those of brain PrPSc. Here, we have examined the effect of the disease-associated F198S mutation on the conversion of huPrP90–231 from the monomeric α-helical conformation to the oligomeric PrPSc-like form. Fig. 1 shows the far UV CD spectra for the wild-type huPrP90–231 (panel A) and the F198S variant (panel B) in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at a protein concentration of 95 μm. In the absence of the denaturant, the spectra of both proteins have a double minimum at 222 and 208 nm, characteristic of α-helical structure. Consistent with the previous report (22Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Google Scholar), upon the addition of 1 m GdnHCl to the wild-type protein, there is a time-dependent decrease in negative ellipticity, concomitant with a change in the shape of the spectrum to one characteristic of β-sheet structure (minimum around 215 nm). Under the present experimental conditions, the α-helix → β-sheet transition for the wild-type huPrP90–231 was relatively slow, with an apparent half-time of ∼19 h. Remarkably, identical treatment of the F198S variant resulted in a very rapid transition to a β-sheet-rich structure. In the later case, the reaction was approximately 50 times faster compared with the wild-type protein; it was completed within less than 2 h and characterized by an apparent half-time of ∼22 min (Fig. 2A).Figure 2The time course of conformational transition to oligomeric β-sheet structure for the wild-type huPrP90–231 (■) and the F198S variant (●) in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl , pH 5.0.

The peak corresponding to the protein monomer (elution time of ∼9.6 min) is represented as M. All of the experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mmacetate buffer containing 1 m GdnHCl, pH 5.0, at a protein concentration of 95 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The oligomerization state of the wild-type huPrP90–231 and the F198S variant was studied by quasi-elastic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. In the absence of GdnHCl, quasi-elastic light scattering data for freshly prepared solutions of both proteins (pH 5 buffer, room temperature) indicated the presence of single species corresponding to monomers with an apparent Stokes radius of ∼2 nm. Upon the addition of 1 m GdnHCl, light scattering measurements indicated the presence of large protein oligomers (data not shown). The time course of the oligomerization reaction for both proteins could be followed by size exclusion chromatography. Representative elution profiles for the wild-type huPrP90–231 and the F198S mutant following 150 min of preincubation in the presence of 1m GdnHCl are shown in Fig. 2C. The chromatograms for both proteins show a peak corresponding to the monomer (elution volume of ∼9.6 ml) and peak(s) corresponding to oligomeric species with an apparent molecular mass ranging from ∼400 kDa to that higher than the fractionation limit of the column (700 kDa for globular proteins). For a given preincubation time, the proportion of the oligomeric protein was markedly higher for the F198S variant as compared with that for the wild-type protein. The time course of the loss of the peak corresponding to monomeric species of both proteins (Fig. 2B) indicates that, under the present experimental conditions, the oligomerization of the F198S variant is ∼50 times faster than that of the wild-type protein (apparent half-times of 22 min and 19 h, respectively). For both the wild-type and mutant proteins, the kinetics of oligomer formation was very similar to the time course of changes in CD spectra (Fig. 2), indicating that the α-helix → β-sheet transition is intimately associated with self-association of the prion protein variants. A dramatically increased propensity of the F198S huPrP90–231 variant to undergo a transition to an oligomeric β-sheet structure in the presence of GdnHCl prompted us to examine the behavior of the mutant protein in the absence of any chemical denaturants. Fig. 3 shows the time evolution of far UV CD spectra for the wild-type huPrP90–231 and the F198S variant upon incubation at 37 °C in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Clearly, the wild-type protein did not undergo any time-dependent conformational changes, remaining for many days in its native α-helical form (Fig. 3A). By contrast, under identical conditions the α-helical form of the F198S variant was highly unstable, undergoing a spontaneous transition to a β-sheet-rich structure (Fig. 3B). The kinetics of this reaction was dependent on the concentration of the protein; for example, at a F198S huPrP90–231 concentration of 60 μm, the apparent half-time of the transition (as measured by changes in CD spectra) was ∼35 h, whereas at the concentration of 120 μm, the half-time was reduced to 14 h. Time-dependent changes in the secondary structure of F198S huPrP90–231 were further examined by infrared spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, the spectrum of a freshly prepared sample of the F198S variant has a maximum at 1648 cm−1 characteristic of a native α-helix-rich conformation. Upon incubation for 48 h at 37 °C in deuterated sodium acetate buffer, pD 5.5, the spectrum of the protein shows two additional bands: one at 1618 cm−1 and one at 1685 cm−1. The latter two bands are highly characteristic of an oligomeric β-sheet structure (26Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Google Scholar). Consistent with the CD data, under the same experimental conditions the infrared spectrum of the wild-type huPrP90–231 did not undergo any time-dependent changes. The latter protein retains the native α-helical structure even after prolonged (many days) incubation in the GdnHCl-free buffer. Similar to the conformational conversion in the presence of GdnHCl, the α-helix → β-sheet transition of F198S huPrP90–231 in the denaturant free buffer was intimately associated with protein oligomerization. The nature of these oligomers was probed by the thioflavine T assay. This assay is based on the increase in ThT fluorescence upon binding of the dye to amyloid fibrils (20Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, incubation of F198S huPrP90–231 in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 37 °C results in a time-dependent increase in ThT binding, suggesting that the protein self-assembles into amyloid (or amyloid-like) structures. The kinetics of the formation of ThT-positive structures is concentration-dependent, becoming faster as the concentration of the protein is increased. Under the given experimental conditions, the time course of the ThT fluorescence increase was very similar to that of β-sheet structure formation (Fig. 5). Importantly, under identical conditions, the wild-type huPrP90–231 did not exhibit any binding of the ThT dye. No ThT fluorescence increase was observed in the presence of the latter protein even after 7 days of incubation at 37 °C. The morphology of oligomeric structures formed by F198S huPrP90–231 was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The micrographs of the protein preincubated at 37 °C in acetate buffer, pH 5.5, showed ordered fibril-like structures with a diameter of 10–20 nm and of variable length (Fig. 6). In addition to these ordered structures, irregular aggregates of variable shape and size were also observed. Consistent with the ThT data, no fibrils (or other oligomeric structures) could be detected under similar experimental conditions for the wild-type huPrP90–231. One of the hallmarks of brain PrPSc is an unusually high resistance to digestion with proteinase K (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Google Scholar, 2Weissmann C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 3-11Google Scholar, 11Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Google Scholar). The protease-resistant core of PrPSc corresponds to the C-terminal region starting near residue 90. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of a monomeric F198S huPrP90–231 (or the wild-type huPrP90–231) with as little as 1 μg/ml of proteinase K resulted in a degradation of the protein. This is in contrast to the behavior of F198S huPrP90–231 that was converted, by incubation at 37 °C, to an oligomeric β-sheet structure. The latter protein displayed a markedly increased resistance to proteinase K digestion; the band corresponding to a ∼17-kDa protein could be observed even upon treatment with as much as 10 μg/ml of the enzyme. Similar incubation of the wild-type huPrP90–231 did not result in the formation of a proteinase K-resistant species. Most of the GdnHCl-independent PrP conversion experiments described in this study were performed in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. However, it should be noted that the spontaneous (i.e. not requiring any denaturant) transition of the F198S variant to an oligomeric form characterized by β-sheet-structure, proteinase K resistance, and affinity for the ThT dye could also be accomplished in a variety of other buffers, including 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Importantly, under identical buffer conditions and within the time scale of the experiments, the wild-type prion protein remained monomeric, readily degradable by proteinase K, and rich in α-helical structure. One of the most intriguing aspects of prion diseases is the link between mutations in the PRNP gene and hereditary forms of Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease, GSS, and fatal familial insomnia. The molecular basis of this link is, however, unknown. Within the context of the protein-only model, it has been hypothesized that the familial mutations could facilitate the PrPC → PrPScconversion by the mechanism involving thermodynamic destabilization of the native α-helical structure of PrPC (27Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, the experimental support for this hypothesis is still missing. Furthermore, recent data questioned the general validity of the thermodynamic model, indicating that there is a great variability in the effect of individual disease-associated mutations on the stability of the cellular prion protein (28Swietnicki W. Petersen S.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Google Scholar, 29Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Google Scholar). Although some of these mutations indeed result in a significant destabilization of PrPC, the effects of others appear to be much more subtle. Clearly, more detailed studies are required to elucidate the relationship between mutation-induced perturbations in the biophysical and/or structural properties of prion protein and the molecular basis of hereditary prion disorders. In the present study, we have focused on the human prion protein containing a Phe198 → Ser mutation. This substitution has been linked to GSS with extensive PrP amyloid deposits in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and midbrain (15Gambetti P. Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Chen S.G. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Gabizon R. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Picardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 509-583Google Scholar, 16Giaconne G. Verga L. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Farlow M.R. Ghetti B. Tagliavini F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9349-9353Google Scholar). The key finding of the present study is that the recombinant prion protein variant F198S undergoes a time-dependent conversion to oligomeric structures that are ThT-positive and morphologically appear similar to those found in brain tissue of GSS patients (16Giaconne G. Verga L. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Farlow M.R. Ghetti B. Tagliavini F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9349-9353Google Scholar). As in the case of brain deposits, the oligomers formed in vitro include fibrillar structures as well as less ordered aggregates. Importantly, the conversion in vitro of the mutant protein occurs spontaneously and under physiologically relevant buffer conditions. This is in contrast to the wild-type huPrP; conformational conversion of the latter protein could be observed only in the presence of denaturing agents (22Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Google Scholar, 23Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Google Scholar, 24Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar, 25Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Google Scholar). In addition to morphological similarities between F198S huPrP90–231 aggregates and amyloid deposits found in GSS brain, the oligomeric form of the recombinant mutant protein shares many other physicochemical characteristics of a diseased brain PrPSc, including high content of β-sheet structure and partial resistance to proteinase K digestion. These striking similarities notwithstanding, the question remains whether the recombinant F198S huPrP90–231 oligomers described in this study are indeed structurally equivalent to the PrPSc deposits characteristic of GSS with the F198S mutation. The amide I bands representing β-sheet structure in the infrared spectrum of F198S huPrP90–231 oligomers (Fig. 4) appear at somewhat different positions than those reported for PrPScfrom scrapie-infected Syrian hamster brain tissue (12Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Google Scholar, 13Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Google Scholar). This could potentially reflect subtle differences in the arrangement (or hydrogen bonding) of β-strands in the two proteins. However, these spectral differences could also be related to species- and/or mutation-specific effects. Infrared spectroscopic data have been reported only for Syrian hamster PrPSc; no such data are yet available for human PrPSc, let alone the F198S variant from the GSS brain. Biological properties of the recombinant scrapie-like F198S huPrP90–231 oligomers, including their potential neurotoxicity and infectivity, have not yet been tested. Questions regarding the infectivity of different types of PrPSc and PrPSc-like isoforms are of special interest and importance. In this context, one should note that attempts to infect experimental animals using brain tissue homogenates from F198S GSS patients have not been successful (15Gambetti P. Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Chen S.G. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Gabizon R. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Picardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 509-583Google Scholar). It is thus possible that familial GSS with F198S mutation may represent a class of PrP-related amyloidosis that is different from transmissible forms of prion diseases. Clearly, further studies are needed to test the relationship between the oligomeric form of the recombinant PrP variant and authentic protein deposits found in F198S GSS brain. Nevertheless, the finding that a disease-related Phe198 → Ser mutation renders the recombinant prion protein highly susceptible to a conversion into a scrapie-like form is highly remarkable, bringing us a step closer toward understanding the molecular basis of familial prion disorders. In particular, the present data provide new clues regarding the mechanism of prion protein conversion from α-helical conformation to β-sheet-rich oligomers. In contrast to the wild-type human PrPC (30Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. Von Schroetter C. Garcia F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 769-774Google Scholar), no high resolution structural data are yet available for the disease-associated F198S variant. Nevertheless, inspection of the wild-type structure indicates that the replacement of Phe198 with a much smaller and polar Ser residue should result in a significant destabilization of the native protein structure (32Riek R.

Urea unfolding experiments have indeed confirmed this effect, revealing drastic reduction in the thermodynamic stability for the F198S variant as compared with the wild-type PrP (see Ref. 29Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Google Scholar and TableI). The link demonstrated in this study between mutation-dependent conformational conversion and thermodynamic stability of the prion protein is in line with observations for classical amyloid-forming proteins such as transthyretin, immunoglobulin light chain, and lysozyme (33Kelly J.W.

The pathway of amyloid formation by these proteins likely involves partially unfolded intermediates (33Kelly J.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 595-600Google Scholar, 35Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Google Scholar). In the presence of destabilizing mutations, such intermediates would become more populated. Folding intermediates have also been postulated to play a key role in the PrPC → PrPSc conversion (27Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, unlike for some other amyloidogenic proteins (33Kelly J.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 595-600Google Scholar, 35Booth D.R. Sunde M.

Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar, 38Hosszu L.P. Baxter N.J. Jackson G.S. Power A. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Collinge J. Nat. Struct.

This has led to speculation that it is the unfolded state of the prion protein that is directly converted to PrPSc (19Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Google Scholar, 38Hosszu L.P. Baxter N.J. Jackson G.S. Power A. Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Collinge J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 740-743Google Scholar). Recent kinetic stopped flow data have, however, disputed this model, demonstrating that human prion protein folds by a three-state mechanism involving a monomeric folding intermediate (40Apetri A.C. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44589-44592Google Scholar). The role of this intermediate in the PrPC → PrPSc conversion is indirectly indicated by experiments showing that the α-helix to oligomeric β-sheet transition of the recombinant human prion protein is strongly promoted in the presence of low and medium concentrations of urea,i.e. under conditions that could increase the population of partially unfolded intermediates. In contrast, conditions favoring the native state (no denaturant) or those that shift equilibrium toward the fully unfolded state (high concentrations of the denaturant) were not conducive to the conversion reaction (24Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Google Scholar). The present data for the F198S huPrP90–231 variant further support and reinforce the notion that partial destabilization of the native state of PrP is critical to the transition to an oligomeric β-sheet-rich conformer. Although for the wild-type protein significant population of a conversion-conducive intermediate appears to require partially denaturing buffer conditions, in the case of the F198S variant a similar state may be populated under native conditions because of the destabilizing effect of the Phe198 → Ser mutation. Similar arguments may be applicable to other familial PrP variants carrying mutations that destabilize the native α-helical structure. It should be noted here that not all of the mutations linked to familial prion disorders have an intrinsic destabilizing effect on native PrPC structure relative to the fully unfolded state (28Swietnicki W. Petersen S.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Google Scholar, 29Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Google Scholar). However, even in the latter cases, mutations could potentially affect the stability and/or conformation of the intermediate state. Formation of conversion-conducive intermediate(s) in vivo could be further promoted by localization of the protein in specific compartments and/or mutation-dependent abnormalities in interactions with membranes, chaperones, or other components of the cellular environment. The notion that the partially unfolded state is critical to the spontaneous conversion of the recombinant PrP into a scrapie-like form is in line with the observations that partially destabilizing conditions (elevated temperature and the presence of chaotropes or chaperones) stimulate the PrPSc-induced conversion of PrPC to a proteinase K-resistant form in a cell-free conversion assay (41Kocisko D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2062753450,"Overproduction of nitric oxide by NMDA receptor stimulation is implicated in calcium deregulation and neurodegeneration of striatal neurons. We investigated the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in inducing intracellular calcium release and in modifying calcium transients evoked by NMDA. NO application (4-10 microM) reversibly and repeatedly increased the intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i in Fura-2- or fluo-3-loaded cultured mouse striatal neurons. NO-induced [Ca2+]i responses persisted in the absence of extracellular calcium, indicating that Ca2+ was released from intracellular stores. The source of calcium was distinct from [Ca2+]i-activated (ruthenium red and ryanodine sensitive) or IP3-activated (thapsigargin-sensitive) Ca2+ stores and was not dependent on cGMP production because a cell permeant analog, 8-bromo-cGMP, did not increase basal [Ca2+]i. Glucose removal potentiated the NO-induced release of [Ca2+]i. In contrast, pretreatment with either the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or cyclosporin A, a blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, prevented the [Ca2+]i increase after NO. The rise in [Ca2+]i during NO exposure was preceded by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential that was partly reversible during washout. Repeated applications of NMDA induced irreversible [Ca2+]i responses in a subpopulation of striatal cells that were greatly reduced by the NOS inhibitor N omega-nitro-l-arginine. Calcium transients were prolonged by conjoint application of NMDA and NO. We conclude that NMDA-evoked [Ca2+]i transients are modulated by endogenous NO production, which leads to release of calcium from the mitochondrial pool. An NO-activated mitochondrial permeability transition pore may lead to cell death after overstimulation of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2066851801,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met, is composed of an alpha-chain containing four Kringle domains (K1-K4) and a serine protease domain-like beta-chain. Receptor activation by HGF is contingent upon prior proteolytic conversion of the secreted inactive single chain form (pro-HGF) into the biologically active two chain form by a single cleavage at the Arg(494)-Val(495) bond. By screening a panel of serine proteases we identified two new HGF activators, plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XIa (FXIa). The concentrations of kallikrein and FXIa to cleave 50% (EC(50)) of (125)I-labeled pro-HGF during a 4-h period were 10 and 17 nm. Unlike other known activators, both FXIa and kallikrein processed pro-HGF by cleavage at two sites. Using N-terminal sequencing they were identified as the normal cleavage site Arg(494)-Val(495) and the novel site Arg(424)-His(425) located in the K4 domain of the alpha-chain. The identity of this unusual second cleavage site was firmly established by use of the double mutant HGF(R424A/R494E), which was completely resistant to cleavage by kallikrein and FXIa. Experiments with another mutant form, HGF(Arg(494) --> Glu), indicated that cleavage at the K4 site was independent of a prior cleavage at the primary, kinetically preferred Arg(494)-Val(495) site. The cleavage at the K4 site had no obvious consequences on HGF function, because it was fully capable of phosphorylating the c-Met receptor of A549 cells. This may be explained by the disulfide bond network in K4, which holds the cleaved alpha-chain together. In conclusion, the ability of plasma kallikrein and FXIa to activate pro-HGF in vitro raises the possibility that mediators of inflammation and blood coagulation may also regulate processes that involve the HGF/c-Met pathway, such as tissue repair and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2133710714,"The 34-kDa periplasmic iron-transport protein (FBP) from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (nFBP) contains Fe(III) and (hydrogen)phosphate (synergistic anion). It has a characteristic ligand-to-metal charge-transfer absorption band at 481 nm. Phosphate can be displaced by (bi)carbonate to give Fe·CO3·nFBP (λmax 459 nm). The local structures of native Fe-PO4-nFBP and Fe·CO3·nFBP were determined by EXAFS at the FeK edge using full multiple scattering analysis. The EXAFS analysis reveals that both phosphate and carbonate ligands bind to FBP in monodentate mode in contrast to transferrins, which bind carbonate in bidentate mode. The EXAFS analysis also suggests an alternative to the crystallographically determined position of the Glu ligand, and this in turn suggests that an H-bonding network may help to stabilize monodentate binding of the synergistic anion. The anions oxalate, pyrophosphate, and nitrilotriacetate also appear to serve as synergistic anions but not sulfate or perchlorate. The oxidation of Fe(II) in the presence of nFBP led to a weak Fe(III)·nFBP complex (λmax 471 nm). Iron and phosphate can be removed from FBP at low pH (pH 4.5) in the presence of a large excess of citrate.

Iron is abundant in the environment but tends to precipitate as ferric hydroxide under aerobic aqueous conditions at neutral pH where the concentration of free Fe(III) is 10−18m, 12 orders of magnitude lower than that required for bacterial growth (3Bullen J.

In humans and other mammals, iron is sequestered and transported by transferrins and lactoferrins and stored in ferritin (5Aisen P. Wessling-Resnick W. Leibold E.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The tight binding of iron by these proteins leads to a very low level of free iron in the host, which acts as an antibacterial defense mechanism. However, some pathogenic bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis,N. gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae,Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Pasteurella hemolytica, have developed highly efficient iron-uptake systems including specific iron-binding proteins (FBPs)1 to sequester iron from hosts (6Ferreirós C.M.

Therefore, structural studies of FBP are important for understanding the iron-uptake mechanism in these pathogens and could aid the design of novel bacteriostatic agents targeted on this protein. FBP has been called “bacterial transferrin” because of its remarkable similarity to transferrin. A recent crystal structure of FBP from H. influenzae (hFBP) has revealed that it is structurally homologous to one lobe of transferrin but without sequence homology (9Bruns C.M. Nowalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Fe(III) binding site in hFBP resembles the two Fe(III) binding sites in transferrin containing two cis-Tyr ligands and one His ligand but with Glu instead of the Asp residue found in transferrins (see Structure I). A striking difference is that hFBP appears to have a monodentate tetrahedral phosphate (or hydrogen phosphate) bound to Fe(III) as the synergistic anion together with a water ligand (9Bruns C.M.

Transferrin can use other carboxylates as synergistic anions but cannot use phosphate or sulfate (13Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-463Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The synergistic anion binding properties of transferrins including their role in metal binding and release have been well documented (14Bates G.W. Schlabach M.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have investigated the binding of anions and metal ions to recombinant FBP from N. gonorrhoeae by a variety of techniques including UV-visible spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), electrospray mass spectrometry, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and EXAFS. EXAFS is a technique capable of providing, in principle, metal-ligand bond lengths to the same accuracy as a small molecule crystal structure (≤0.02 Å). In the case of metalloproteins, this accuracy significantly exceeds the accuracy obtained from all but atomic resolution (<1.2 Å) crystal structures. However, this accuracy has not been routinely achieved because of limitations in theory and difficulty with the required calculations. Also, there is a limit to which similar bond lengths can be resolved, which is dependent on the data range and is typically of the order of 0.1 Å. Significant improvements in EXAFS data analysis have occurred in recent years including the use of constrained and restrained refinement (22Hasnain S.S. Strange R.W.

We apply these methods here to both the (H)PO4 and (H)CO3 adducts of Fe·nFBP. These studies are important for understanding the mechanisms for iron transport in this pathogenic bacterium. Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad Protean II Minigel system (protein) and Invitrogen H5 system (DNA). An Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system and columns were used for chromatographic separations of proteins. Pre-cast SDS-PAGE gels (10% bis-Tris) were purchased from Novex and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monosodium citrate (Aldrich), NaHCO3 (Aldrich), nitrilotriacetic acid (H3NTA, Aldrich), NaH2PO4, and Na2HPO4(BDH), tetrasodium pyrophosphate (Strem), Hepes (Aldrich), Tris (Aldrich), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Aldrich), and NaH13CO3 (MSD isotopes, >99% enriched) were used as received. Iron, phosphorus, gallium, bismuth, and cobalt atomic absorption standard solutions were purchased from Aldrich. All other chemicals were reagent grade. A freshly prepared physiological buffer was used with final concentrations of 4 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.4). Stock solutions of [Fe(III)(NTA)2], [Ga(III)(NTA)2], and [Bi(III)(NTA)] were prepared from the iron, gallium, and bismuth atomic absorption standard solutions and the stoichiometric amount of H3NTA. The pH values were raised slowly to ∼5.5 with microliter amounts of NaOH (1m). Diluted solutions were used where necessary.

A single colony from freshly transformed cells was used to inoculate 5 ml of 2YT broth (Bacto-tryptone (16 g), Bacto-yeast extract (10 g), NaCl (5 g) dissolved in distilled water (1 liter), and then adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a sterile 10-ml vial. This culture was shaken overnight at 310 K and used to inoculate 1 liter of 2YT with 100 μg/ml ampicillin in sterile 500-ml flasks. After the flask was shaken overnight at 310 K, a pink pellet of cells was isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 277 K and stored at 253 K. nFBP was purified by a modification of the method of Berish et al. (20Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2607-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pink pellet (∼5 g) was defrosted at room temperature and resuspended in 50 ml of 1m Tris (pH 8.0). 50 ml of 2% CTAB then was added followed by stirring slowly overnight at 310 K. The white insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 277 K. The supernatant (cell-free extract) was diluted to a final volume of 1 liter by adding distilled water and then filtered using Whatman number 4 paper (Fisher). The cell-free extract was applied to a RESOURCE®S cation exchange column (1 or 6 ml, AmershamBiosciences) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, washed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The filtered CTAB extract was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with low salt buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of low-to-high salt (0–1 m NaCl) over 20 column volumes in 10 mm Tris buffer. Pink fractions were collected and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. nFBP was desalted by dialysis and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon concentrator). The concentration of purified protein was determined by the BCA method using bovine serum albumin as a reference (37Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar). Apo-nFBP was prepared by treatment of holo-nFBP solutions in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon) with 250 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5) at least four times until there was negligible absorbance at 481 nm. The apo-nFBP was then washed four times with 2 ml of 0.1 m KCl. At this point, the colorless protein was exhaustively exchanged into the buffer to be used in different experiments (Centricon 10). Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a Micromass Platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. The purified holo-protein or apoprotein samples in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) were diluted with MeOH/H2O (1:1, v/v) to a final concentration of 20 μm (20 pmol/μl), and CH3COOH (final concentration 0.5%) was added to the samples before measurement. The final pH of the protein samples was ∼3.7. The mass spectrometer was scanned at intervals of 0.1 s, the scans were accumulated, the spectra were combined, and average molecular mass was determined using the MaxEnt and Transform algorithms of massLynx software. All of the UV experiments were performed with 1-cm cuvettes on a computer-controlled Shimadzu UV-1000 spectrometer with temperature control at 298 or 310 K. UV-difference spectra after the addition of metal complex to apo-FBP were recorded immediately and at different time intervals. For titration experiments, aliquots of metal complex (0.5–10 μl) were added and the solution was left to equilibrate at 298 K for 30 min. The binding or release of Fe(III) was monitored by the increase or decrease in absorbance at 481 nm. FBP samples were dissolved in 0.1m KCl in 10% D2O, 90% H2O. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 ± 0.1 when necessary using NaOH and HCl (0.1 m). The pH* values (meter readings) of NMR solutions were recorded before and after NMR measurements. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz, using 0.6 ml of FBP solution (∼1 mm) in 5-mm tubes at 298 K using ∼1,000 transients, 6-μs (50o) pulses, 1.8-s recycle time, 16,384 data points, and water suppression via presaturation. The chemical shift reference for 1H was sodium trimethylsilyl-d 4-propionate (TSP). Resolution enhancement of the spectra was achieved by processing the free induction decays with a combination of unshifted sine-bell and exponential functions (line broadening of 1.5–20 Hz) on a Silicon Graphics computer using XWIN-NMR software. Proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer operating at 202 MHz. Typically, 3,000–10,000 transients were collected using a pulse-width of 6 μs (50o), relaxation delay of 2 s, and 16,384 data points. The 31P reference was external 85% H3PO4. The spectra were processed using exponential functions (line broadening of 2–10 Hz). Two-dimensional [1H,1H], NOESY (mixing time of 100 ms), and TOCSY spectra (mixing time of 50 ms) (38Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 301-315Google Scholar, 39Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) were acquired on a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer at 298 K using 4,096 data points in the f2 dimension [1H], 32–64 increments of t 1, acquisition time of 0.2 s, 96 scans, and 512 increments in the f1 dimension in a total time of ∼21 h. Qsine functions were used in both dimensions for processing data using XWIN-NMR 2.0 software. The residual water signal was suppressed by presaturation or pulsed-field gradients. Peaks were referenced to TSP. ICP-AES was performed on a Thermo Jarrell Ash IRIS spectrometer using standard methods. Metal-loaded proteins and apoproteins were purified by using Centricon 10 (Amicon) ultrafilters and washing three times with ultrapure water followed by ultrafiltration after each washing. The final protein solution was diluted with Tris buffer (10 mm). The pH values of the solutions were adjusted with HCl or NaOH (DCl or NaOD for samples in D2O solution) and determined using a Corning 240 pH meter equipped with an Aldrich microcombination electrode calibrated with Aldrich buffer solutions at pH 4, 7, and 10. The pH meter readings for D2O solutions are recorded as pH* values, i.e.uncorrected for the effect of deuterium. X-ray spectra were recorded at the iron K edge on EXAFS station 9.3 at Daresbury Laboratory Synchrotron Radiation Source (operating at 2 GeV) using a Si<220> double crystal monochromator and vertically focusing mirror for harmonic rejection. Data for native nFBP and apo-nFBP loaded with Fe(III) in the presence of bicarbonate rather than phosphate were collected at 13 K (using a liquid helium cryostat) in fluorescence mode using a 13-element solid state germanium detector. Data were collected in k space using a k 3 -weighted regime for counting time with a total scan time of 40 min. 28 scans were collected from each sample. The edge positions were calibrated against an Fe foil. Samples were prepared as follows. Purified native nFBP was concentrated to 7 mm by ultrafiltration and washed three times with 0.1 m KCl. Fe·CO3·nFBP (2 mm) was prepared by reacting apo-nFBP with 1.2 mol eq of Fe(NTA)2 in Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of 10 mm sodium bicarbonate. The excess of Fe(NTA)2and free NTA was removed from the yellowish-pink solution by ultrafiltration washing four times with 0.1 m KCl. Data were processed using EXCALIB and SPLINE (modified for use with EXCURV) (40Ellis P. Studies of Metalloproteins Using EXAFS and XRDPh.D. thesis. University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia1995Google Scholar). The EXAFS data were converted into k space. The photoelectron wave vector k is related to the incident photon energy (E) and to the threshold energy (E o) by Equation 1, k=2m(E−Eo)ℏ︀2Equation 1 where m is the mass of an electron. The EXAFS data were analyzed using the fast curved wave (or Rehr-Albers) theory (41Rehr J.J. Albers R.C. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 41: 8139-8149Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar) including up to third order multiple scattering contributions in EXCURV98 (32Binsted N. EXCURV98: CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory Computer Program. Warrington, United Kingdom1998Google Scholar). This version of the program includes interligand scattering terms in the calculations (31Binsted N. Hasnain S.S. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1996; 3: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phase shifts were calculated using Hedin-Lundquist exchange and correlation potentials (42Hedin L. Lundquist S. Solid State Phys. 1969; 23: 1-181Google Scholar, 43Rehr J.J. de Leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5140Crossref Scopus (1829) Google Scholar) and tested against the EXAFS data for iron-protoporphyrin IX chloride (chlorohemin) (44Koenig D.F. Acta Crystallogr. 1965; 18: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and Fe-EHPG (45Bailey N.A. Cummins D. Mckenzie E.D. Worthington J.M. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1981; 50: 111-120Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All data analysis was carried out on raw EXAFS data (without Fourier filtering) weighted byk 3 to compensate for diminishing amplitude at highk. The EXAFS analysis proceeded in a number of stages. (i) Single scattering analysis of the first shell (ligand or nearest neighbor) atoms was the first stage. The Fe-PO4-nFBP data were then analyzed as follows. (ii) Constrained (rigid body) EXAFS was fit using the crystallographic coordinates of hFBP (1.6 Å resolution, PDB code 1MRP) as starting model. The EXAFS data were simulated retaining the three-dimensional coordinates with full (i.e. including interligand in addition to intraligand) multiple scattering. Protein residues were truncated, keeping only those atoms within 5 Å of central iron atom that should be relatively well ordered with respect to iron such as all atoms of the phenolate rings of Tyr-195 and Tyr-196 (n = 2 × 7), all atoms of the imidazole ring of His-9 (n = 5), all atoms of the phosphate group (n = 5), the terminal part of Glu-57 (n= 4) (CG, CD, OE1, OE2), and water (n = 1). This gave a total of 29 atoms. Treating each residue as a rigid body means that the position of all the atoms in a multi-atom ligand can be defined using only three parameters: one distance (usually the ligand atom) and two polar angles (θ and ϕ) while simultaneously maintaining the overdeterminancy of the refinement (see Table III) and maintaining the internal geometry of the residue. (iii) One parameter (Fermi energy) was refined, and Debye-Waller factors were set at values from final simulation. (iv) 13 parameters were refined: Fermi energy, 6 distances for ligand atoms, 5 angles for non-water residues, one single Debye-Waller factor for the 6 six-liganding (nearest neighbor) atoms. It was assumed that the Debye-Waller factors increased with distance from the central atom as it is physically unrealistic to allow more distant non-liganding atoms to have stronger thermal correlations with the metal atom than the nearer atoms (23Binstead N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Fonda, E., Michalowicz, A., Randaccio, L., Tauzher, G., and Vlaic, G. (2001) Eur. J. Inorg.

Debye-Waller factors were grouped together for similar distances and atom type and scaled to the refined Debye-Waller factor for the ligand atoms. (v) 14 parameters were refined as described above plus a rotation around the vector defined by CG-CD of Glu-57. The starting parameters for the rotation around the CG-CD vector were established by mapping this parameter against the related positional parameters for the Glu-57 ligand. The validity of this methodology was tested using the Fe-EHPG data (see “Results”). (vi) Similar ligand distances (δ < 0.1 Å) were grouped, giving three rather than six ligand distances, and the refinement was repeated. (vii) Restrained refinement against “ideal” bond lengths was derived from the Engh and Huber library (47Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). A total of 55 two-dimensional 1–2, 1–3, and 1–4 bond length restraints within residues were applied (23Binstead N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These restraints together with not refining ϕ values are sufficient to maintain the planarity of the phenolate and imidazole rings. A weighting of EXAFS:restraints of 0.5:0.5 was used. Further details of the procedure used were described previously (for details see Refs. 23Binstead N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S.

StAR interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates the rate-limiting transfer of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome P-450scc converts this cholesterol into pregnenolone. We tested the ability of N-62 StAR to transfer cholesterol from donor vesicles containing cholesterol but no cytochrome P-450scc to acceptor vesicles containing P-450scc but no cholesterol, using P-450scc activity as a reporter of the cholesterol content of synthetic phospholipid vesicles. N-62 StAR stimulated P-450scc activity in acceptor vesicles 5–10-fold following the addition of donor vesicles. Transfer of cholesterol to acceptor vesicles was rapid and sufficient to maintain a linear rate of pregnenolone synthesis for 10 min. The effect of N-62 StAR in stimulating P-450scc activity was specific for cholesterol transfer and was not due to vesicle fusion or P-450scc exchange between vesicles. Maximum stimulation of P-450scc activity in acceptor vesicles required preincubation of N-62 StAR with phospholipid vesicles prior to adding donor vesicles. The amount of N-62 StAR causing half-maximum stimulation of P-450scc activity in acceptor vesicles was 1.9 μm. Half-maximum stimulation required more than a 10-fold higher concentration of R182L N-62 StAR, a mutant associated with congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia. N-62 StAR-mediated transfer of cholesterol between vesicles showed low dependence on the cholesterol concentration in the donor vesicles.

The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) 1The abbreviations used are: StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein 1The abbreviations used are: StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mediates the rapid stimulation of steroidogenesis induced by the action of tropic hormones on the adrenal, testis, and ovary (1Stocco D.M.

The essential role of StAR in adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis was demonstrated by its essential role in congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (2Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J.

Early work showed that StAR is a phosphoprotein (6Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Google Scholar, 7Stocco D.M. Sodeman T.C. J. Biol.

StAR is synthesized as a short-lived 37-kDa preprotein that is cleaved to a more stable 30-kDa form upon its entry into mitochondria. However, deletion of the mitochondrial leader, which prohibits mitochondrial entry, does not diminish the activity of StAR, suggesting that StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane (9Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt H.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Google Scholar, 10Arakane F. Kallen C.B. Watari H.

Although the structure of StAR has not been determined, the crystal structure of the StAR-like domain of MLN64 (15Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2002; 9: 507-511Google Scholar) show a β-barrel structure that appears to define a sterol-binding pocket. Direct binding assays show that StAR can bind either one (15Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Google Scholar) or two (21Petrescu A.D. Gallegos A.M. Okamura Y. Strauss III, J.F. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36970-36982Google Scholar) molecules of cholesterol. Although this structure suggested that StAR might act as a cholesterol shuttle in the intramembranous space (15Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Google Scholar), StAR is active only on or in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and its level of activity is directly proportional to its residency time on the outer membrane (22Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Google Scholar). When the mitochondrial leader is deleted, N-62 StAR can transfer cholesterol from liposomes to the endoplasmic reticulum or to mitochondria previously treated with heat or trypsin (23Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Google Scholar). Thus the present view is that the mitochondrial leader serves to confine the activity of StAR to mitochondria and that this action requires only StAR, cholesterol, and a phospholipid membrane (24Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 131-141Google Scholar). We previously showed that StAR preferentially interacts with synthetic phospholipid membranes that are ordered and contain cholesterol (13Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Google Scholar). We have now tested the ability of StAR to transfer cholesterol from synthetic cholesterol-rich phospholipid vesicles tocholesterol-free vesicles, using cytochrome P-450scc incorporated into the cholesterol-free vesicles as a reporter system. The ability of wild type, but not mutant StAR to foster this cholesterol transfer provides compelling evidence that only StAR, cholesterol, and a phospholipid membrane and no other proteins are required for the activity of StAR.

Functional human StAR lacking 62 amino acids at the amino terminus (N-62 StAR) and a corresponding inactive mutant of StAR where arginine residue at position 182 is replaced with leucine (R182L N-62 StAR) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (27Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Google Scholar). Cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin reductase were purified from bovine adrenals (28Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 489-495Google Scholar, 29Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 497-503Google Scholar). Human adrenodoxin was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (30Woods S.T. Sadleir J. Downs T. Triantopoulos T. Headlam M.J. Tuckey R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 109-115Google Scholar). This assay tests the ability of N-62 StAR to transfer cholesterol from donor phospholipid vesicles containing cholesterol but no cytochrome P-450scc to acceptor vesicles containing cytochrome P-450scc but no cholesterol. It relies on the cholesterol concentration available to the cytochrome P-450scc being below theK m so that the rate of conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone gives a measure of the size of the cholesterol pool transferred to the P-450scc. Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared from dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin using a bath-type sonicator as described (31Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2887-2893Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified the cardiolipin content was 15 mol % of the total phospholipid. Cholesterol was included in some vesicles. Cytochrome P-450scc (0.01 μm final concentration unless otherwise specified) was incorporated into cholesterol-free vesicles by incubation for 15 min at room temperature (31Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2887-2893Google Scholar). Other components of the reaction mixture (including N-62 StAR for some incubations) were then added, and preincubation was carried out for 10 min at 35 °C. Vesicles containing cholesterol were added to start the reaction under conditions where the P-450scc was catalytically active in converting cholesterol to pregnenolone. The incubation was carried out at 35 °C and comprised cholesterol-free acceptor vesicles (510 μm phospholipid) containing cytochrome P-450scc, cholesterol-containing donor vesicles (510 μm phospholipid), 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 units/ml glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.3 μm adrenodoxin reductase, 15 μm adrenodoxin, and 50 μmNADPH in a final volume of 0.25 ml. Aliquots (25 μl) were taken from the incubation at various times after starting the reaction with donor vesicles and added to ice-cold ethanol. The pregnenolone content of samples was determined by radioimmunoassay permitting time courses for pregnenolone synthesis to be constructed (26Tuckey R.C. Cameron K.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 209-215Google Scholar). For some experiments the phospholipid concentration or the timing of the addition of N-62 StAR or donor vesicles was altered, as indicated in the figure legends. The concentration of cholesterol (S) in acceptor membranes following transfer from donor membranes was calculated from the velocity of pregnenolone synthesis using the Michaelis-Menten equation rearranged to the following form. S=Kmv/(Vmax−v)Equation 1 The V max and K m values were determined separately by incorporating the P-450scc into dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing 15 mol % cardiolipin and a range of cholesterol concentrations (25Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 379-384Google Scholar, 29Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 497-503Google Scholar). From two replicate experiments the mean V max was 22.4 pmol of pregnenolone/min/pmol of P-450scc, and the mean K mwas 0.070 mol of cholesterol/mol of phospholipid. To measure transfer between vesicles, neutral donor vesicles comprising dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and 0.2 mol of cholesterol/mol of phospholipid were separated from acidic acceptor vesicles comprising dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, 15 mol % cardiolipin, and 0.03 μmP-450scc by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B in a method comparable with that used by other workers (23Kallen C.B.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4940-4949Google Scholar). Acceptor vesicles were labeled with 2 nCi of di[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine to measure phospholipid transfer or 2 nCi of glycerol tri[1-14C]palmitate (tripalmitin) to measure vesicle fusion (23Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Google Scholar). Neutral donor vesicles containing cholesterol were incubated at 35 °C for 10 min with acidic acceptor vesicles containing P-450scc and 14C-tracer lipid, in the presence or absence of StAR. The reaction mixture (0.25 ml) was applied to a 0.75 × 2.8-cm DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column that retained the acidic vesicles but permitted the neutral vesicles to pass through the column unretarded (32McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2893-2900Google Scholar, 33Bar L.K. Barenholz Y. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5460-5465Google Scholar). Neutral vesicles were collected and analyzed for P-450scc activity (to measure P-450scc transfer) and14C-labeled lipid content. Labeling of acidic or neutral vesicles with di[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine showed that 98% of acidic vesicles were retained on the column, whereas neutral vesicles passed through the column unretarded with 98% recovery. The concentration of cytochrome P-450scc was measured by CO-reduced minus reduced difference spectroscopy (35Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Google Scholar). In the absence of StAR there is a small amount of cholesterol transferred from donor vesicles containing cholesterol to acceptor vesicles containing cytochrome P-450scc, as evidenced from the production of pregnenolone by P-450scc (Fig. 1). The addition of 10 μm N-62 StAR prior to preincubation stimulated the rate 4.9-fold over the background rate. In the presence of N-62 StAR, pregnenolone synthesis was linear from 2 to 10 min of incubation, but nonlinearity occurred after 10 min (not shown). Stimulation of cholesterol transfer to P-450scc was specific for N-62 StAR, because serum albumin and denatured N-62 StAR had no effect (Fig. 1). The addition of 10 μm N-62 StAR to cytochrome P-450scc in vesicles containing cholesterol had no effect on the rate of pregnenolone synthesis, demonstrating that StAR does not directly activate P-450scc (Fig. 2).Figure 2Lineweaver-Burk plot of the rate of pregnenolone synthesis by P-450scc incorporated into phospholipid vesicles. Cytochrome P-450scc (10 nm) was incorporated into vesicles prepared from dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin, and the rate of pregnenolone synthesis was determined in the absence (closed circles) or presence (open triangles) of 10 μm N-62 StAR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The catalytic rate constant (k cat) of the cytochrome P-450scc preparation used for this study was 22.4 pmol of pregnenolone/min/pmol of P-450scc, and the K m was 0.07 mol of cholesterol/mol of phospholipid (means from Fig. 2 and a replicate experiment). The k cat is 13-fold higher than the activity shown in Fig. 1 with N-62 StAR. This demonstrates that P-450scc is working below its K mfor cholesterol following addition of N-62 StAR, and activity reflects the concentration of the pool of cholesterol available to P-450scc. From the K m and k cat values for P-450scc and using the Michaelis-Menten equation (see “Experimental Procedures”), the steady state concentration of cholesterol in the acceptor vesicles required to generate the rate of pregnenolone synthesis observed in the presence of N-62 StAR is 0.006 mol of cholesterol/mol of phospholipid. This represents 3% of the cholesterol originally in the donor vesicles. The amount of cholesterol converted to pregnenolone during the 10-min incubation with N-62 StAR corresponds to 0.2% of the cholesterol originally in the donor vesicles. This analysis therefore suggests that when acceptor and donor vesicles are mixed in the presence of N-62 StAR, there is a rapid initial transfer of cholesterol to the P-450scc in acceptor vesicles. This maintains a linear rate of pregnenolone synthesis for 10 min with only a small proportion of the transferred cholesterol being converted into pregnenolone. To test the function of N-62 StAR further in cholesterol transfer between vesicles, we preincubated donor and acceptor vesicles for 5 min in the presence of N-62 StAR, prior to adding NADPH to start the side chain cleavage reaction (Fig. 3). In the absence of StAR this caused a 1.7-fold increase in the background StAR-independent P-450scc activity, compared with that seen when the reaction was started by the addition of donor vesicles. In the presence of N-62 StAR the rate following preincubation of donor and acceptor vesicles was only 14% higher than the rate observed when the reaction was started by the addition of donor vesicles. The StAR-mediated rate (minus background) was not altered by preincubation of donor and acceptor vesicles. This indicates that cholesterol is initially transferred rapidly to acceptor vesicles in the presence of StAR but that little or no further transfer occurs. By contrast, the background rate almost doubled with preincubation of donor and acceptor vesicles, suggesting that this rate is due, at least in part, to a continuous transfer of cholesterol from donor to acceptor vesicles. When cardiolipin was present only in acceptor vesicles, the N-62 StAR-independent background activity was decreased relative to having cardiolipin in both acceptor and donor vesicles (Table I). In contrast, the background activity was increased more than 10-fold when cardiolipin was only present in donor vesicles. N-62 StAR was able to stimulate P-450scc activity in acceptor vesicles whether cardiolipin was present in donor vesicles, acceptor vesicles or both, with activities being similar after background rates were subtracted.Table IEffect of cardiolipin on the stimulation of P-450scc activity by N-62 StARMembrane containing cardiolipinP-450scc activityBackgroundN-62 StARN-62 StAR − Backgroundpmol of pregnenolone/min/pmol of P450sccDonor + acceptor0.313.22.9Acceptor0.164.13.9Donor3.97.13.2Donor vesicles with a cholesterol to phospholipid motor ratio of 0.2 were added to acceptor vesicles containing 30 nm P-450scc in the presence or absence of 5 μm N-62StAR and P-450scc activity measured. When present, cardiolipin was 15 mol % of the vesicle phospholipid. Open table in a new tab Donor vesicles with a cholesterol to phospholipid motor ratio of 0.2 were added to acceptor vesicles containing 30 nm P-450scc in the presence or absence of 5 μm N-62StAR and P-450scc activity measured. When present, cardiolipin was 15 mol % of the vesicle phospholipid. To confirm that N-62 StAR stimulates P-450scc activity by specifically enhancing cholesterol transfer between donor and acceptor vesicles, rates of vesicle fusion, phospholipid exchange, and P-450scc exchange were measured in the presence and absence of N-62 StAR. These measurements utilized the ability of DEAE-Sepharose to separate neutral vesicles made of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol from acidic acceptor vesicles made of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and 15 mol % cardiolipin. N-62 StAR stimulated P-450scc activity in acceptor vesicles 4.3-fold when acceptor and donor vesicles were incubated for 10 min (TableII). Under similar conditions, vesicle fusion (measured using radiolabeled tripalmitin as a nonexchangeable marker) was small and was not stimulated by N-62 StAR. Background phosphatidylcholine transfer was higher but was also not altered by N-62 StAR. P-450scc transfer from acceptor to donor vesicles was less than the sensitivity of the assay, in both the absence and the presence of N-62 StAR, and was more than an order of magnitude too low to explain the stimulation of P-450scc activity in the presence of N-62 StAR.Table IIEffect of N-62 StAR on tripalmitin, phospholipid, and P-450scc exchange between vesiclesP-450scc activityTripalmitin transferPtdCho transferP-450scc transferpmol/min/pmol%%%Control1.62.111.5<3N-62 StAR7.01.79.4<3Donor vesicles comprising dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (molar ratio to phospholipid of 0.2) were incubated with acceptor vesicles comprising dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, 15 mol % cardiolipin, and 0.03 μm P-450scc for 10 min in the absence (control) or presence of 5 μm N-62 StAR. P-450scc activity was measured as in Fig. 3 with the reaction being started by the addition of NADPH. Acceptor vesicles were labeled with tracer tri[1-14C]palmitate or di[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine to measure tripalmitin and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) transfer to donor vesicles, respectively. P-450scc transfer was below the sensitivity of the assay. Open table in a new tab Donor vesicles comprising dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (molar ratio to phospholipid of 0.2) were incubated with acceptor vesicles comprising dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, 15 mol % cardiolipin, and 0.03 μm P-450scc for 10 min in the absence (control) or presence of 5 μm N-62 StAR. P-450scc activity was measured as in Fig. 3 with the reaction being started by the addition of NADPH. Acceptor vesicles were labeled with tracer tri[1-14C]palmitate or di[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine to measure tripalmitin and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) transfer to donor vesicles, respectively. P-450scc transfer was below the sensitivity of the assay. The concentration dependence of the N-62 StAR-mediated transfer of cholesterol from vesicles containing cholesterol to vesicles containing cytochrome P-450scc was determined where the reaction was started by the addition of donor vesicles (Fig.4). The data fit a hyperbolic curve, with 50% stimulation (K12) occurring with 1.9 ± 0.2 μm (± S.E. from curve fit) N-62 StAR and a maximum StAR-dependent activity of 10.4 ± 0.4 times background. Thus the effect of N-62 StAR is saturable. By contrast, the R182L mutant of N-62 StAR had a minimal effect on P-450scc activity in acceptor vesicles. This mutation is a cause of congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia and has no activity in transfected cells (3Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Google Scholar) or on isolated mitochondria (17Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Google Scholar, 22Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Google Scholar). A hyperbolic curve fitted to the data for R182L gives a K12 value of 22 ± 4 μm, an order of magnitude higher than the value for wild type N-62 StAR. It was not possible to measure directly the activity of R182L N-62 StAR under saturating StAR conditions because of this highK12. Adding N-62 StAR after starting the side chain cleavage reaction by the addition of donor vesicles stimulated the rate of pregnenolone synthesis 3-fold over the background rate and showed a small lag in the first minute following the addition (Fig.5 A). In contrast, adding the same concentration of N-62 StAR prior to preincubation with acceptor vesicles stimulated the rate of pregnenolone synthesis 9-fold. When N-62 StAR was preincubated with donor vesicles, and the reaction was started by adding acceptor vesicles containing P-450scc, P-450scc activity was 74% of that seen when N-62 StAR was preincubated with acceptor vesicles (Fig. 5 B). Thus N-62 StAR must be preincubated with vesicles to have a maximal effect, and preincubation with acceptor vesicles fulfills this role best. Varying the concentration of donor vesicles between 255 and 1020 μm with a constant acceptor vesicle concentration of 510 μm had little effect on N-62 StAR activity (not shown). A 9.6-fold increase in the concentration of acceptor vesicles at a constant donor vesicle concentration caused a 7-fold decrease in P-450scc activity (Fig.6). Calculation of the amount of cholesterol transferred (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that it was largely independent of the acceptor vesicle concentration (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with the activity of P-450scc being determined by the concentration of cholesterol in the membrane, as has been established previously (25Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 379-384Google Scholar, 29Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 497-503Google Scholar, 31Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2887-2893Google Scholar, 34Dhariwal M.S. Kowluru R.A. Jefcoate C.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4940-4949Google Scholar). For a given amount of cholesterol transferred, P-450scc activity decreases as the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid decreases because of an increase in the concentration of acceptor phospholipid. The cholesterol content of the donor vesicles had a relatively small influence on the activity of N-62 StAR (Fig.7). A 16-fold increase in the molar ratio of cholesterol to phospholipid caused a 2.3-fold increase in the background rate and only increased the N-62 StAR-stimulated rate of pregnenolone synthesis 2.1-fold. The concentration of P-450scc in the acceptor vesicles has a marked effect on both the background rate and the N-62 StAR-stimulated rate of pregnenolone synthesis (Fig. 8). The highest ratio of StAR activity over background rate was seen with 10 nm P-450scc but did not vary greatly over the range of P-450scc concentrations tested. With 100 nm P-450scc the rate of pregnenolone synthesis in the presence of N-62 StAR was still only 26% of the maximum velocity of the P-450scc. Therefore, the activity measured at each P-450scc concentration reflects the pool of cholesterol rapidly made available to the P-450scc in the acceptor vesicles. To achieve the activity observed with 100 nmP-450scc and 10 μm N-62 StAR would require a cholesterol concentration of 0.025 mol/mol of phospholipid in the acceptor vesicles. This indicates that 12.5% of the cholesterol originally in the donor vesicles has been transferred to the acceptor vesicles. The present study demonstrates that N-62 StAR can transfer cholesterol from donor vesicles to acceptor vesicles containing cytochrome P-450scc without the involvement of other proteins. The effect of N-62 StAR is specific for cholesterol transfer with phospholipid exchange being unaffected. Our data show that when donor vesicles are mixed with acceptor, stimulation of P-450scc activity by N-62 StAR vesicles cannot be explained by vesicle fusion nor by transfer of P-450scc from the acceptor vesicles to donor vesicles. Cholesterol transfer by N-62 StAR appears to be very rapid. Under these conditions, P-450scc activity provides a measure of the concentration of cholesterol in the membrane that contains the P-450scc. Sufficient cholesterol is transferred to acceptor vesicles in a very short time after adding donor vesicles to maintain a linear rate of pregnenolone synthesis for 10 min. Some time courses (Figs. 1 and 5 A) showed short lags in pregnenolone synthesis for 1–2 min that likely result from cholesterol transfer being incomplete. The ability of N-62 StAR to transfer cholesterol from phosphatidylcholine vesicles (liposomes) to heat-treated mitochondria has been reported (23Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Google Scholar). In that study the initial rate of cholesterol transfer was not measured, but it was largely complete within 5 min. Our study shows that the StAR-mediated transfer of cholesterol to P-450scc is a saturable process described by a hyperbolic curve. TheK12 value we observed (1.9 μm) is similar to the concentration of N-62 StAR reported to stimulate pregnenolone synthesis in MA-10 cell mitochondria and mitochondria prepared from the bovine corpus luteum (10Arakane F. Kallen C.B. Watari H. Foster J.A. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Gerton G.L. Strauss III, J.F. J..Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16339-16345Google Scholar, 36Huang M.C. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2569-2576Google Scholar). The N-62 StAR we used was expressed in E. coli (27Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Google Scholar). The purification procedure employs denaturation and refolding of the protein. This procedure appears to yield the native conformation, because the CD spectrum is indistinguishable from that obtained with N-62 StAR purified without denaturation (27Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Google Scholar), and this bacterially produced N-62 StAR is active with isolated mitochondria in vitro (17Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Google Scholar, 22Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Google Scholar, 36Huang M.C. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2569-2576Google Scholar). Direct comparison of the activity of the bacterially expressed enzyme with the form found in tissues is not possible because active full-length StAR has never been purified from a steroidogenic tissue. The R182L mutation, which causes a severe form of congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (3Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Google Scholar), increased the K12 for cholesterol transfer to P-450scc by more than 10-fold without affecting the maximum amount of cholesterol transferred. This mutant is partially misfolded (27Bose H.S. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9768-9775Google Scholar) and is inactive in transfected cells (3Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Google Scholar) and with isolated mitochondria in vitro (17Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Huang M.C. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11722-11731Google Scholar, 22Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Google Scholar). However, this mutant can bind to phospholipid vesicles at low pH but with aK D 19-fold higher than wild type N-62 StAR (13Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Google Scholar). Thus it appears that the R182L mutant can interact with membranes and transfer cholesterol in an artificial system but with much lower efficiency than wild type StAR. Similarly, in measurements of the interaction of N-62 StAR with a fluorescent cholesterol derivative, the inactive A218V mutant displayed 7.2-fold weaker binding (21Petrescu A.D. Gallegos A.M. Okamura Y. Strauss III, J.F. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36970-36982Google Scholar). Thus biological activity does not correlate directly with binding in vitro. Small unilamellar vesicles similar to those used in the present study have a slow rate of cholesterol exchange with a half-time of about 1 h, which is not increased by the presence of P-450scc. The results of our study and those of others (34Dhariwal M.S. Kowluru R.A. Jefcoate C.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4940-4949Google Scholar) show that there is little vesicle fusion over the typical time period used in the current study (34Dhariwal M.S. Kowluru R.A. Jefcoate C.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4940-4949Google Scholar). P-450scc spontaneously incorporates into these vesicles with its adrenodoxin-binding site facing the exterior (28Tuckey R.C. Stevenson P.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 489-495Google Scholar, 31Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2887-2893Google Scholar, 37Lambeth J.D. Kitchen S.E. Farooqui A.A. Tuckey R. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1876-1884Google Scholar). Rapid exchange of P-450scc between vesicles has been reported at high P-450scc concentrations (0.25–0.5 μm) but is markedly reduced by the presence of acidic phospholipids in the vesicle membrane (34Dhariwal M.S. Kowluru R.A. Jefcoate C.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4940-4949Google Scholar, 38Kisselev P. Wessel R. Pisch S. Bornscheuer U. Schmidt R.D. Schwarz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1380-1386Google Scholar). Our results showing a low StAR-independent background P-450scc activity when cardiolipin is present in the acceptor vesicle membrane support this, with P-450scc exchange between vesicles containing a low P-450scc concentration being too small to measure. It is likely that the background, StAR-independent cholesterol transfer we observed is due, at least in part, to slow cholesterol exchange, because the amount of cholesterol transferred to acceptor vesicles depends on the time they are incubated with donor vesicles. The relevance of this to the StAR-independent steroidogenesis seen in patients with congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (3Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Google Scholar) is not clear. To have full activity in terms of the amount of cholesterol transferred to P-450scc, it appears that N-62 StAR must be preincubated with a vesicle membrane. The acceptor membrane containing P-450scc seems to fulfill this role better than the donor vesicle membrane. This might relate to changes in vesicle properties, such as the asymmetry created by the presence of P-450scc. It is also possible that the membrane induces a conformational change in StAR that is a prerequisite for cholesterol binding. The crystal structures of MLN64 (15Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Google Scholar), StAR D4 (18Soccio R.E. Adams R.M. Romanowski M.J. Sehayek E. Burley S.K. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 9: 507-511Google Scholar) show that there is not enough room for cholesterol to enter the sterol-binding pocket so that a conformational change is necessary for cholesterol binding. Similarly, spectroscopic data indicate that StAR undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change (12Bose H.S. Whittal R.M. Baldwin M.A. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7250-7255Google Scholar, 13Christensen K. Bose H.S. Harris F.M. Miller W.L. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17044-17051Google Scholar, 14Song M. Shao H. Mujeeb A. James T.L. Miller W.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 151-158Google Scholar) that may be related to the conformational change needed for cholesterol binding. The amount of cholesterol transferred from donor to acceptor vesicles by N-62 StAR is relatively independent of the concentration of the donor and acceptor vesicles and the presence or absence of cardiolipin in the vesicle membranes. The cholesterol content of the donor vesicle also does not greatly influence N-62 StAR-mediated cholesterol transfer, particularly at high cholesterol concentrations; a 16-fold decrease in cholesterol concentration caused a 2.1-fold decrease in the amount of cholesterol transferred by N-62 StAR. This observation suggests that the cholesterol content of the outer mitochondrial membrane has little influence on cholesterol transfer to the inner membrane and is consistent with the finding that it is the concentration of StAR and its residency time in the outer mitochondrial membrane that primarily determine the rate of cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (22Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Google Scholar). Increasing the P-450scc concentration in acceptor vesicles increases the amount of cholesterol transferred to acceptor vesicles by N-62 StAR. Because StAR works without penetration of the inner mitochondrial membrane (22Bose H.S. Lingappa V.R. Miller W.L. Nature. 2002; 417: 87-91Google Scholar), a direct interaction of StAR and P-450scc seems unlikely. It is likely that P-450scc induces structural changes in the acceptor vesicle membrane that facilitate StAR action, as mentioned above. Our study shows that following a rapid transfer of cholesterol when the vesicles are mixed, there is little subsequent N-62 StAR-mediated cholesterol transfer even though a gradient of cholesterol remains between donor and acceptor vesicles and the concentration of N-62 StAR is saturating. The highest stoichiometry for molecules of cholesterol transported per molecule of N-62 StAR in this study was 2.8, observed with a low concentration of StAR (0.7 μm; Fig. 4). With a higher P-450scc concentration and a nearly saturating level of N-62 StAR (Fig. 6), the stoichiometry of transfer was 1.8 molecules of cholesterol/molecule of N-62 StAR. By contrast, experiments in mouse adrenal Y-1 cells suggest that each molecule of StAR may facilitate the transfer of up to 400 molecules of cholesterol (39Artemenko I.P. Zhao D. Hales D.B. Hales K.H. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46583-46596Google Scholar). The ability of StAR to transfer multiple molecules may require factors not present in the reconstituted system we are using. We thank Dr. Douglas M. Stocco (Texas Tech University Health Science Center, Lubbock, TX) for helping initiate this study."
https://openalex.org/W1975156456,"Heart failure and hypertension are associated with increases in angiotensin II (ANG II) activity. One brain area where ANG II effects may be particularly important in these situations is the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Located in the dorsomedial medulla, the NTS is the termination site of baroreceptor afferents and is essential for mediating the baroreflex. In hypertensive animals the baroreflex is impaired; this may be reversed by antagonizing ANG II AT1 receptors in the NTS. Recently, we showed that the baroreflex depressant action of ANG II in the NTS is mediated by activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and enhanced release of GABA. Using conventional pharmacological tools and a range of adenoviral-mediated expression of dominant negative proteins, we have determined the intracellular pathway(s) in the NTS by which ANG II activates eNOS. Our data indicate that ANG II acting in the NTS depresses the baroreflex via a Gq protein-mediated activation of phospholipase C, which through 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate causes release of calcium from the IP3-sensitive intracellular stores and calcium-calmodulin formation. In contrast, multiple site disruption of a pathway leading to eNOS activation via the serine/threonine kinase Akt was ineffective"

To elucidate further the mechanisms whereby PAR-1 stimulates secretion, monolayers of SCBN intestinal epithelial cells were studied in modified Ussing chambers. Short circuit current responses were determined after basolateral application of thrombin and the PAR-1-activating peptide, Ala-parafluoro-Phe-Arg-cyclohexyl-Ala-Citrulline-Tyr (Cit-NH2) in the presence or absence of a variety of signal transduction and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathway inhibitors. Increased kinase activity was monitored by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of target phosphoproteins. The PAR-1-induced chloride secretory response was significantly attenuated by inhibitors of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, Src-kinase, MEK1/2, as well as by inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase (cPL) A2, COX-1 and COX-2. PAR-1-induced activation of cPLA2, as shown by Western blot of phosphoserine residues, was blocked in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126, indicating that the MEK-ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway mediated PAR-1-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation. Our data show that PAR-1-induced chloride secretion in SCBN cells involves Src, EGF receptor trans-activation, activation of a MAPK pathway, phosphorylation of cPLA2, COX activity, but not PGF2alpha or PGE2. These findings may be of clinical importance in inflammatory diseases of the intestine where secretory dysfunction is evident and thrombin levels are elevated."

https://openalex.org/W1975106026,"An intermolecular Zn2+-binding site was identified in the structure of the T1 domain of the Shaw-type potassium channels (aKv3.1). T1 is a BTB/POZ-type domain responsible for the ordered assembly of voltage-gated potassium channels and interactions with other macromolecules. In this structure, a Zn2+ ion was found to be coordinated between each of the four assembly interfaces of the T1 tetramer by three Cys and one His encoded in the sequence motif (HX 5CX 20CC) of the T1 domain. This sequence motif is conserved among all non-Shaker-type voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels, but not in Shaker-type channels. The presence of this conserved Zn2+-binding site is a primary molecular determinant that distinguishes the tetrameric assembly of non-Shaker Kv channel subunits from that of Shaker channels. We report here that tetramerization of the Shal (rKv4.2) T1 in solution requires the presence of Zn2+, and the addition/removal of Zn2+reversibly switches the protein between a stable tetrameric or monomeric state. We further show that the conversion from tetramers to monomers is profoundly pH-dependent: as the solution pH gets lower, the dissociation rate increases significantly. The unfolding energy of the T1 tetramer as a measure of the conformational stability of the structure is also pH-dependent. Surprisingly, at a lower pH we observe a distinctly altered conformational state of the T1 tetramer trapped during the process of unfolding of the T1 tetramer in the presence of Zn2+. The conformational alteration may be responsible for increased rate of dissociation at lower pH by allowing Zn2+ to be removed more effectively by EDTA.

Voltage-gated, potassium ion selective (Kv) channels are found throughout most of the eukaryotic kingdom and display the widest range of channel properties among all voltage-gated ion channels (1Hille B.

They are involved in various physiological functions such as the regulation of action potential firing and duration, endocrine and exocrine secretion, cardiac excitability, learning and memory, as well as the control of synaptic efficacy. Functional Kv channels are formed by the tetramerization of their pore-forming α-subunits, a process regulated by the T1 domain of the channel (4Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Google Scholar, 5Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Google Scholar). Four major gene subfamilies (Shaker (Kv1), Shab (Kv2), Shaw (Kv3), and Shal (Kv4)) are designated by sequence similarity and their ability to homo- and heterotetramerize exclusively within subfamily members. In the crystal structures of Shaker (6Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Google Scholar) and Shaw T1 tetramers (7Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 1: 38-43Google Scholar), four T1 subunits form a rotationally symmetric tetramer. The interfacial interaction is highly polar, and the interface residues show a high degree of sequence conservation within a subfamily, thus providing a structural explanation for the subfamily-specific assembly of Kv channels. Most recently, studies on the T1 domain as part of the intact channels have supported the idea that a tetrameric T1 domain with essentially similar atomic details to the crystallized structure is present within the full-length functional channel (8Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Google Scholar, 9Strang C. Cushman S.J. DeRubeis D. Peterson D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28493-28502Google Scholar). The overall architecture of the T1 tetramer consists of four layer-like segments folded along the symmetry axis around the water-filled cavity termed the T1 cavity (see Fig. 1,layers 1–4 from the N terminus to the C terminus of the T1 chain, respectively). The T1 cavity, however, does not appear to be part of the ion permeation pathway (10Cushman S. Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Google Scholar), thus the cytoplasmic entryways for ions should lie between the T1 domain and the inner leaflet of the membrane, possibly forming four identical side openings through which ions can pass during ion conduction (8Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10347-10352Google Scholar, 10Cushman S. Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct.

Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Google Scholar). The C-terminal side of the T1 tetramer (layer 4) faces the inner leaflet of the membrane because the N-terminal side of the T1 tetramer (layer 1) interfaces the flat side of the Kvβ tetramer, making the N-terminal side most likely to face the cytoplasm (12Gulbis J. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Google Scholar). Zhou et al. (13Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Google Scholar) recently provided evidence to conclude that the N-terminal end of the unfolded polypeptide chain reaches the central pore cavity of the channel through this side opening. We have shown earlier that the putative membrane-facing side of T1 tetramer is conformationally flexible as compared with other parts of T1 (6Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Google Scholar, 10Cushman S. Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Google Scholar). Mutations within the T1 domain that alter the structure of the C-terminal side of the domain affect the gating properties of the channel, further arguing for a close association of this side of the domain with the transmembrane region (10Cushman S. Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Google Scholar, 14Minor D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Google Scholar). A similar conformational change occurs within T1 tetramer when it is complexed with Kvβ tetramer (12Gulbis J. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Google Scholar). The most striking difference between the Shaker channel T1 domain and the Shaw T1 domain is the presence of intersubunit-coordinated Zn2+ ions in the assembly interface in Shaw channels. These Zn2+ ions are coordinated by a C3H1 motif encoded within the conserved sequence (HX 5CX 20CC) of the T1 domain, located near the C-terminal end of the domain. This sequence is not found in any Shaker T1 domains but is highly conserved in Shal, Shaw, and Shab T1 domains, making it a characteristic difference between Shaker channels and all other Kv channels. These four amino acids are fully exposed on the subunit interface with one histidine and two cysteine residues from one subunit and a cysteine residue from the facing subunit. However, the locations of four Zn atoms within the tetramer are deeply buried inside the protein, ∼6 or 14 Å from the exterior or interior of the protein surface of the tetramer, respectively (7Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 1: 38-43Google Scholar). This location suggests that Zn2+ may not directly interact with the channel gating or permeation machinery, but rather likely alters the properties of the T1 domain itself to explain its striking conservation in non-Shaker-type channels. To elucidate the roles such Zn2+ ions might play in the non-Shaker-type Kv channels, we have examined the biochemical roles of Zn2+ in Shal T1 domain assembly and structural stability. In this report, we demonstrate that Zn2+ is absolutely essential for the stable maintenance of Kv4.2 T1 tetramer in solution. We then show that removal and addition of Zn2+ directly results in conversion between monomer and tetramer interchangeably. We further demonstrate that the conversion between tetramer and monomer is pH-dependent, and there is a distinctly altered conformation of T1 tetramer at slightly acidic pH. Such conformational plasticity can enable T1 to mediate signaling through various protein-protein interactions with the cytoplasmic components, such as with K channel-interacting proteins (KchIP) (15An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Google Scholar), or Src tyrosine kinases (16Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2093Google Scholar), and Kvβ (17Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Google Scholar), to regulate Kv channels. These results clearly support that a probable conformational linkage propagating through the T1 tetramer can act as a signaling mediator for protein-protein interactions (18Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Google Scholar), thus implicating T1 as an essential structural platform for channel regulation through interactions with cytoplasmic proteins. Consistent with this idea, structural models to regulate conductance of bacterial channels through conformational changes of cytoplasmic domains have been recently reported (19Roosild T. Miller S. Booth I. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 14: 781-791Google Scholar,20Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar). A modified pET20b vector carrying the His-tagged version of rKv4.2 T1 domain (residues 41–161) were transformed into BL21(DE3) P-LysS cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in the LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and were induced with 1 mmIPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid at 22 °C for 4–5 h when the A 600 reached 1–2.0. The cells were pelletted and then sonicated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-ME, and 50 μm ZnSO4. The soluble fraction was collected for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid/His-tag purification (Qiagen). For the preparation of apo-protein, the purified T1 sample was dialyzed for over 36 h in the Tris buffer containing 2 mm EDTA. The tetrameric and monomeric forms were then separated through a fast protein liquid chromatography S75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in their buffers containing either 50 μm ZnSO4 or 2 mm EDTA, respectively, for further experiments. MES was used to buffer for pH values 6.0 and 6.5, HEPES for pH values 7.0 and 7.5, Tris for pH values 8.0 and 8.5, and 3-[1,1-dimethyl-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid (AMPSO) for pH 9.0 and 9.5. The protein was stored at 4 °C until use. 1 mg/ml of protein was loaded on to Beckman Optima-XLA in Tris, pH 8.0, buffer containing either 2 mm EDTA or 50 μm ZnSO4. The protein was run at three different speeds overnight. The data were analyzed by the program Origin (adapted for the Optima XLA by Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). All the fluorescence measurements were done on a fluorimeter (Photon Technology International). The excitation/emission monochrome slit widths were 1 nm. The excitation wavelength was 283 nm for both the wavelength scans and the time-based scans. The emission wavelength was at 339 nm, and the average value was obtained over 10 s. Monomerization of T1 tetramer was initiated by incubating 50 μg of protein in the 1 ml of buffer containing 2 mm EDTA. Tetramerization of T1 monomer was initiated by incubating 50 μg of protein in 1 ml of buffer containing ZnSO4 in 200 μm excess of 2 mm EDTA. Monomerization experiments were initiated manually with the dead time of up to 4 s, with the exception of the reaction carried out at pH 6.0, which was carried out using a manual stopped-flow instrument. All the tetramerization experiments were carried out on the manual stopped-flow instrument. Fluorescence intensity was measured over time to follow the reactions. Each data point is an average of 3–6 measurements. The increase in fluorescence intensity is linearly proportional to the concentration of tetramer ([T]) and the remaining to be [M] by subtracting [T] from the constant starting concentration. The resulting data were fit to an equation with a single exponential to derive the rate, kin the unit of sec−1, in which [M] =k m[T] and [T] =k t[M], respectively. A 50-μg protein sample was dissolved in 1 ml of the corresponding denaturation buffer that ranged in urea concentration from 0 to 7.6 m and was equilibrated at room temperature for 2–6 h before measurement. The extent of denaturation was assayed by change in intrinsic fluorescence. The corresponding denaturation data were fit to the equation for the empirical two-state denaturation states by the program Kaleidograph. The first question that we sought to answer was whether the interfacial Zn2+ ions present in the T1 domain are important for subunit tetramerization. To address this question we assessed the molecular size and stability of the isolated rKv4.2 T1 domain in the presence of either Zn2+ or the Zn2+ chelator EDTA, by size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The protein is first prepared as a pure tetramer by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography from a soluble cytoplasmic fraction of Escherichia coli lysate. Protein samples were dialyzed against the chromatography buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing either 50 μm Zn2+ or 2 mm EDTA overnight prior to a size-exclusion chromatography. By atomic absorption, the proteins incubated in Zn2+contain 1 ion of Zn2+ per T1 molecule, whereas those incubated in EDTA contain essentially 0 ions of Zn2+ per T1 molecule. These results were not affected by the His6 tag because identical measurements are made with or without the His tag removed by proteolytic digestion. T1 samples elute from the fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography column Superdex 75 at 64.5 and 85.4 min in Zn2+ or EDTA, respectively (Fig.2). These are the estimated elution time for Stokes' radii of tetrameric and monomeric T1, respectively, based on the elution times for other protein standards. No other size protein peak was detected in these experiments, suggesting that the T1 domain has only 2 stable quarternary states, monomer or tetramer. These results are reproduced for samples prepared at pH values 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5. Without addition of Zn2+ or EDTA to the buffer, the T1 sample is very stable as a tetramer, which contains a stoichiometric amount of Zn2+ (one per subunit) as measured by atomic absorption. In this case the Zn2+ ions were probably picked up from the E. coli culture media during protein expression and retained within the structure by high affinity binding. As further evidence of the high affinity Zn2+ binding, EDTA is essential to dissociate T1 tetramer into monomers because dialysis against a buffer without Zn2+ for up to 3 days does not measurably dissociate tetramers. T1 monomers in EDTA solution were indefinitely stable at concentrations as high as 10 mg/ml within our experimental timeframe (days). We used uniformly 2 mm EDTA in this study, which has an expected binding constant of 10−15mfor free Zn2+ in solution. Molecular weight estimates of proteins based on Stokes' hydrodynamic size of the molecule as measured by the elution times from sizing chromatography columns can be affected by molecular shape and possible interaction between the sample and the gel matrix. Therefore, sedimentation equilibrium experiments at three different speeds were also carried out to obtain a shape-independent accurate measurement of the molecular weights of the species in the same buffers with either Zn2+ or EDTA. The data were fit with the assumption that there are only two species (monomer or tetramer) present in each of the two conditions (Fig. 3). The molecular mass estimate of the molecule in the presence of Zn2+ is 62.0 kDa, whereas it is 16.5 kDa in the presence of EDTA, respectively. These measurements agree very well with the calculated molecular mass of Kv4.2 T1 tetramers (61.6 kDa) and monomers (15.4 kDa). The excellent fit under the two-species model also suggests that there are no other stable oligomeric states such as dimers or trimers in detectable amounts. The sequence of the rKv4.2 T1 contains a single Tryptophan at position 55 (highlighted in Fig. 1). This Trp side chain is positioned near the surface-exposed exterior of the T1 tetramer at the interfacial junction between adjacent subunits and thus is likely to change in environment as the protein changes from monomer to tetramer. We therefore used this Trp as a spectroscopic probe to measure the conformational changes of the protein under different conditions. We first measured differences in the Trp fluorescence for T1 tetramers or monomers prepared as described above for size exclusion chromatography. The tetramers were excited at 283 nm, and their emission maximum was measured at 339 nm (Fig. 4). The Trp fluorescence intensity of the tetramer at 339 nm is, however, about twice that of the monomer, which has the maximum emission wavelength red-shifted to 343 nm. We could therefore use this large difference in emission to follow the kinetics of T1 domain assembly or disassembly upon Zn2+ addition or chelation. Based on the empirical two-states monomer-tetramer model, the resulting data were fit with a single exponent to derive the conversion rates:k m from tetramer to monomer andk t from monomer to tetramer. Assembly of monomers to tetramer was initiated by adding 2.2 mm of Zn2+ (200 μm in excess over EDTA) to 50 μg/ml of monomers. In the standard buffer condition at pH 7.5, the rate of T1 tetramerization, k t, is ∼0.14 per second. To measure the disassembly rate, k m, conversion of tetramers to monomers was initiated by incubating 50 μg/ml of tetramer (∼1 μm monomer concentration) with 2 mm EDTA. The disassembly rate under these conditions was ∼0.01 per second. There was no significant change in the shape and magnitude of the monomer or tetramer emission spectra at different pH levels, but the rate of conversion between the tetramer and monomer is highly pH-dependent. At lower pH, the Zn2+-coordinating ligands (imidazole group on His and sulfhydryl group on Cys) will be titrated with protons making them less favorable for binding Zn2+. As expected, the tetramerization (k t) rate increases slightly as the pH becomes more basic, consistent with the notion that deprotonation would favor metal binding (Fig.5). The tetramerization rate could not be accurately measured at pH 9 or higher because Zn2+precipitates at such basic pH levels, probably as a complex with hydroxides. The monomerization (k m) rate, however, showed a much greater pH dependence in rate between pH 6.0 and 9.0, compared with a relatively insignificant difference ink t over the same pH range. Indeed, at pH 6.0, the monomerization rate becomes ∼10-fold faster than tetramerization. Measurements below pH 6.0 could not be made because the T1 protein precipitates appreciably at such acidic pH levels. If the Zn2+-binding sites were freely accessible in solution, the rate dependence on pH for tetramerization and monomerization would be reciprocally related as dictated by the free energy change associated with pH (protonation) state. Our results indicate therefore that the physical access to Zn2+ by EDTA is a time-limiting step, which requires partial disassembly of the T1 tetramer. For such a “buried” Zn2+, the effects of solution pH or local ionic strength on the rates of disassembly will primarily reflect properties of conformational dynamics of the protein structure rather than on Zn2+-EDTA affinity alone. We conclude therefore that the profound dependence ofk m on pH reflects limited accessibility of EDTA to the Zn2+-binding sites buried within the protein, which become more accessible at acidic pH. If the conformational dynamics of the T1 tetramer are pH-dependent, as predicted above, then lower pH should also affect the free energy profile of the unfolding process for the T1 tetramer carried out in the presence of 50 μmZn2+. We used the fractional change in Trp fluorescence emission as a function of urea concentration to measure the amount of the unfolded protein to detect any changes in the thermodynamic stability of the protein fold, as measured by linear extrapolation to 0m denaturant (25Bolen D.W. Santoro M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8069-8074Google Scholar). At pH levels more acidic than 7.5, the denaturation midpoint shift progressively to the left (lower urea concentration), but the slope of transition near the mid-point of denaturation does not change (Fig. 6). An altered slope would have been indicative of the changes in cooperativity among four subunits during the unfolding process. Thus, these results are consistent with the conclusion that the T1 tetramer interface does not associate cooperatively to influence the rate of dissociation of the T1 tetramer as a function of pH, instead the conformational flexibility of the protein itself increases at lower pH. In contrast, at pH 7.0 we found that the denaturation curve is shaped in the form of two S curves, with a more sensitive change in Trp emission evident in the region below 2.5 m urea followed by second change in Trp emission above 3.0 m urea (Fig.7). Changes in the conformational energy profile by pH may indicate the existence of alternate conformations of the T1 tetramer, to which the equilibrium may shift at lower pH. Analytical centrifugation or gel filtration chromatography of the T1 domain in 2.5 m urea with Zn2+ reveals that all the protein is still tetrameric, indicating that this change in Trp emission is produced within the tetrameric T1 domain. The simplest explanation for these results is that at acidic pH an altered conformation is readily accessible in which the single Trp residue is exposed to a more aqueous environment thus changes the fluorescence emission. The transition midpoint to the intermediate conformer is ∼0.8 M urea, at pH 7.0, indicating a small energy difference to the standard T1 tetramer conformation at this pH. Based on our observation of the essential role of Zn2+ for tetramerization and the increased rate of monomerization at lower pH, we conclude that the faster dissociation of the T1 tetramer at lower pH is facilitated by the presence of an altered conformation that T1 tetramer can adopt at lower pH. The existence of Zn2+ at the assembly interface as originally visualized in the crystal structure of Shaw-type Kv channel T1 domain (7Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 1: 38-43Google Scholar) raised the question of what the role of Zn2+is in the channel protein. In this study, we have used size-exclusion chromatography, analytical centrifugation, and fluorescence spectroscopy as tools to study the role of Zn2+ in the conversion of T1 domain between monomer and tetramer and to follow the process of protein unfolding through urea denaturation. We have shown that removal of Zn2+ from the T1 tetramer by EDTA is energetically sufficient to break apart the T1 tetramer into stable monomers, although the rate of conversion is limited by the inaccessibility to the buried Zn2+ within the protein. Addition of Zn2+ to the T1 monomer rapidly and reversibly reassembles the domain into a tetramer, indicating that the monomer is a stable folded state of the protein that can exist without the presence of Zn2+. Fluorescence intensity at 339 nm reports primarily an environmental change around the single Trp-55 that is predicted to contribute to the subunit tetramerization interface (see Fig. 1 B). The increased intensity and the slight blue shift upon T1 tetramerization indicates that the single Trp, with probably a small fraction of the signal contributed by the 10 Tyr residues present in the T1 domain, moves toward a hydrophobic environment within the subunit interface of the T1 tetramer. By characterizing the molecular sizes of the T1 domain under the same solution conditions, we confirm that this change in fluorescence emission spectra is produced by protein monomerization. During the conversion to the partially or fully disassembled conformation, the T1 domain likely retains the same tertiary structure intact upon release of Zn2+ because the conversion is fully reversible, and the fluorescence intensity is further reduced upon complete unfolding by the addition of 8 m urea to the monomers. In this context, the presence of water-stable monomers is strikingly interesting to us, although it is not completely surprising based on the fact that the interface consists of highly polar amino acids (6Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Google Scholar, 7Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 1: 38-43Google Scholar). The exact role of Zn2+ for intact Kv channels are far from being understood completely. The work described in this paper clearly shows that Zn2+ binding provides sufficient energy for the tetramerization of the isolated Kv4.2 T1 domain. Furthermore, we show that the kinetic rate of disassembly to monomers is highly pH-dependent, primarily by the putative conformational alterations induced by lower pH so that the Zn2+ can be more readily removed. This conclusion is supported by our unexpected observation that a stable intermediate conformation presumably trapped in a local energy minimum is detected at slightly acidic pH after a partial denaturation by urea. It remains to be understood whether pH and Zn2+ interact under physiological conditions to modulate the tetrameric assembly of non-Shaker-type Kv channels. Mutations introduced to the Zn2+-coordinating side chains of Kv4.2 channel subunits cause inefficient formation into functional channels in the membrane, but intact channels do not respond to Zn chelators added into the cytoplasm 2C. Strang, K. Kanjilwar, D. Debruis, D. Peterson, and P. Pfaffinger, manuscript in preparation.. These results confirm the essential roles of Zn2+ for the stability and rigidity of the functional channels. Channels show more complex responses to acid treatment. A large change in the ability of the T1 domain to access this alternative conformation at pH 7.0 or below suggests that the T1 domain may act as a pH sensor under physiological conditions. Local protonation can alter the structure of the domain and potentially the stability of protein-protein interactions or channel gating properties. However, there is no evidence whether this conformational flexibility is present to endow pH-sensing ability to the domain. Nevertheless, the conformational flexibility of T1 tetramer induced by solution pH suggests a plausible mechanism by which binding of cytoplasmic proteins to the T1 tetramer can trigger a conformational change through the protonation of a specific set of amino acids locally. Such conformational alteration and its propagation through T1 tetramer can be a general mechanism by which protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm affect channel functions, for which we demonstrate Zn2+ plays an indirect but essential structural role. Our future studies are aimed at determining what roles Zn2+and the T1 domain play in defining the electrophysiological and regulatory properties of the channel itself. Despite varying degrees of emphasis on the importance and role of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in the regulation of channel properties (8Kobertz W.R. Williams C. Miller C.

Manao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Google Scholar, 11Choe S. Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Trends Biol.

Apparently, an ion channel in the cell membrane is not an isolated independent protein but rather a complex assemblage of multiple structural and regulatory proteins, the full extent of which is only recently emerging (26Hisi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G.N. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 661-669Google Scholar). The location of the T1 domain at the heart of such a multi-protein complex suggests that understanding the intricacies and roles of this domain requires complete knowledge on the context under which it naturally resides."

Using a bacterial two-hybrid approach, here we report on the in vivo interactions between MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB implicated in several distinct although linked steps in Escherichia coli. Numerous interactions among these proteins have been identified. Somewhat surprisingly, MobB, a GTPase with a yet unclear function, interacts with MogA, MoeA, and MobA. Probing the effects of various mo. mutations on the interaction map allowed us (i) to distinguish Moco-sensitive interactants from insensitive ones involving MobB and (ii) to demonstrate that molybdopterin is a key molecule triggering or facilitating MogA-MoeA and MoeA-MobA interactions. These results suggest that, in vivo, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis occurs on protein complexes rather than by the separate action of molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic proteins.

These results suggest that, in vivo, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis occurs on protein complexes rather than by the separate action of molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic proteins. Molybdenum is an essential trace element for most living systems including microorganisms, plants, and animals. Molybdenum is found associated with a diverse range of redox active enzymes that catalyze basic reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Google Scholar). With the exception of nitrogenase, molybdenum is incorporated into proteins as the molybdenum cofactor (Moco), 1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide. an ubiquitous basic structure which contains a mononuclear Mo atom coordinated to an organic cofactor named molybdopterin (MPT) (2Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of Moco is an evolutionary conserved pathway that has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli and several genetic loci grouped together under the mo. designation (moa,mob, mod, moe, and mog) have been implicated in the pleiotrophy of molybdoenzymes (3Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. ASM Press, Washington DC1996: 674-679Google Scholar). Genes encoding highly homologous proteins implicated in Moco biosynthesis have been identified in bacteria, archaea, higher plants, and higher animals including humans. Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis can be divided into three stages: (i) conversion of a guanine nucleotide into the meta-stable precursor Z, (ii) conversion of precursor Z into MPT, and (iii) chelation of molybdenum by MPT, thus forming Moco. Although this compound constitutes the active form of the cofactor present in all eukaryotic and some prokaryotic molybdoenzymes, most bacterial enzymes require a modification of this basic structure to be functionally active. This modification involves attachment of a nucleotide moiety, GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP, onto the terminal phosphate group of the MPT side chain (reviewed in Rajagopalan and Johnson (2Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Google Scholar)). Due to its intrinsic instability, the molybdenum cofactor has to remain bound to proteins during the whole biosynthetic process until its final delivery to apomolybdoenzymes. The crystal structure of most of the proteins involved in the biosynthetic pathway of Moco have been determined recently (4Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Google Scholar, 5Stevenson C.E. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Google Scholar, 6Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V.

Biochemical studies have indicated that newly formed MPT remains tightly bound to the MoaD-MoaE complex (MPT synthase) until its transfer to proteins able to bind it with higher affinity (13Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Google Scholar). MogA and MoeA proteins constitute such candidates and have been shown to bind MPT with distinct affinities (6Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Google Scholar, 11Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H.

MPT might then be transferred from MPT synthase to MogA by direct protein interaction, and an activated molybdenum species can be subsequently inserted into the MogA-bound MPT by the aid of MoeA. The MPT-Mo cofactor can either be inserted into MPT-free apoenzymes or undergo subsequent addition of a nucleotide, for example GMP in E. coli by the MobA protein. However, in vitroreconstitution studies of MPT-enzymes such as sulfite oxidase have indicated that conversion of MPT to active Moco by molybdate chelation and its subsequent incorporation can be performed in the absence of MogA and MoeA (13Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Google Scholar). Similar studies performed on MGD-enzymes such as Me2SO reductase from Rhodobacter sphaeroideshave shown that both MobB and a chaperone protein are not absolutely required for MGD insertion (15Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Google Scholar). Such observations have led us to consider alternative approaches to decipher the functions played by themo. gene products involved in the Mo incorporation and nucleotide attachment steps. This communication reports on the interactions existing in vivo between individual pairs of mo. gene products involved in the final stages of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis inE. coli. Effects of various mo. mutations on these interactions have been assessed and allowed the identification of protein complexes for which formation is dependent upon binding of a Moco intermediate. A comprehensive model is presented for the protein interaction network existing during the course of Moco biosynthesis inE. coli. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in TableI. E. coli DH5α was used as a host for plasmid constructions and maintenance. The other strains employed in this study are derivatives of E. coli BTH101 (16Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures were grown in L-broth medium under aerobic conditions. As needed, sodium molybdate or sodium tungstate was added at 1 mm final concentration. When required, 100 μg ml−1 of ampicillin, 50 μg ml−1 of chloramphenicol and 25 μg ml−1 of tetracycline are employed.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidDescriptionReference or sourceDH5αsupE44, ΔlacU169 (φ80 lacZΔM15), hsdR17,recA, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1Lab. collectionBTH101F′,cya-99, araD139, galE15,galK16, rpsL1(StrR), hsdR2,mcrA1, mcrB1(16Karimova G.

For subcloning into the pT18 vector, moeA was amplified to generate a PCR product flanked by SalI and HindIII sites. This fragment was digested and subcloned into the polylinker of the pT18 vector. For subcloning into the pT25 vector, moeA was amplified,BamHI-SacII-restricted, and subcloned into the polylinker of the pT25 vector. Similarly, for subcloning into the pT18 vector, mobB was amplified and XhoI-restricted, whereas subcloning into the pT25 vector was performed using thePstI-SmaI sites. Clones were sequenced to check for any mutation that might have been misincorporated during the amplification, and when necessary, the correct orientation of the inserts was confirmed by PCR. Subcloning of PCR fragments into the pT18 vector lead to the formation of chimeric proteins with an 18-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (225–399 amino acids) issued from the adenylate cyclase. Conversely, subcloning of PCR fragments into the pT25 vector lead to the formation of chimeric products with a 25-kDa amino-terminal fragment (1–224 amino acids) issued from the adenylate cyclase. Indeed, adenylate cyclase protein (CyaA) can be separated into two domains (designated T25 for the amino-terminal domain and T18 for the carboxyl-terminal domain), which cannot function independently. When fused to interacting proteins, the Cya domains can potentially interact and function, resulting in complementation of adenylate cyclase activity and in production of cyclic AMP. cAMP production can be indirectly measured by maltose or lactose metabolism in an E. coli cya mutant (BTH101) transformed with pT25- and pT18-derived plasmids. Maltose metabolism has been scored on indicator plates (MacConkey media supplemented with 1% maltose and 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) by the appearance of red colonies in 2–4 days at 30 °C. Otherwise, white colonies appeared when reconstitution of the adenylate cyclase was not obtained. The efficiency of complementation could be further quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activities in cells grown overnight at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (17Miller J.H. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Transduction with P1 phage was performed as described by Miller (18Miller J.H. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Using BTH101 as a recipient strain, BTH101moa254::Tn10, BTH101modB247::Tn10, and BTH101mob252::Tn10 were obtained. Mapping of the mutations was confirmed by phenotype complementation analysis. Nitrate reductase activity was assayed by procedures already described (19Lester R.L. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1006-1014Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity in whole cells was determined at mid-log phase with chloroform-sodium dodecyl sulfate-permeabilized cells as described by Miller (17Miller J.H. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase values presented are the average of at least three independent experiments. Protein-protein interactions play a major role in most of biological processes. It is becoming evident that many proteins act in large modular structures, also referred to as protein machines or molecular networks, that are involved in specialized processes like signal transduction, metabolic cascade, and biosynthetic pathways. Taking into consideration that proteins act as modular complexes, one possible approach to uncover their respective function is to identify their potential protein partner(s). The notion behind this approach is that identification of a known partner would provide a clue to the function of the protein within a complex process. One of the most commonly used genetic systems of today is the two-hybrid system, which was originally described more than a decade ago by Fields and Song (20Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar). This system was shown to be a powerful method for the identification of protein-protein interaction between known protein partners as well as for the identification of new partners using a library screening approach. To characterize protein-protein interactions, a bacterial two-hybrid system developed by Karimovaet al. (16Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Google Scholar) and based on functional reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity was employed. Complex formation of proteins of interest was readily ascertained by red color development of bacterial colonies on MacConkey media supplemented with maltose and by an elevated β-galactosidase activity. As the two measurements gave corroborating results, only the enzyme activities are presented. A positive control, pT25-Zip/pT18-Zip, which contains the sequence for a 35-amino acid leucine zipper motif of GCN4 fused to both pT25 and pT18, was tested for interaction (16Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Google Scholar). Under our assay conditions, pT25-Zip/pT18-Zip exhibited a high level of adenylate cyclase complementation (intense red color on MacConkey-maltose indicator plates in 48 h; 1500 Miller units of β-galactosidase activity, see “Experimental Procedures”). Conversely, no complementation was observed using pT18/pT25 (cells remain white on MacConkey-maltose plates after several days; 50 Miller units of β-galactosidase activity corresponding to basal level in BTH101). For our research, it was critical to establish that interactions mediated among E. coli constituents could be studied by a bacterial two-hybrid approach and not influenced by endogenous proteins. As an initial test, we assayed the known interaction between NarJ and NarG proteins that correspond to a specific chaperone type protein and the catalytic subunit of the membrane-bound nitrate reductase A, respectively. These proteins form a tight complex during the maturation of the E. coli nitrate reductase A (21Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Google Scholar). Dissociation of this complex only occurs when the molybdenum cofactor has been inserted into the NarG catalytic subunit. narJ was cloned into the bait plasmid pT18, and narG into the prey plasmid pT25. High levels of β-galactosidase were observed when both plasmids were present in the recipient cell, BTH101 (intense red color on MacConkey-maltose indicator plates within 48 h; 1200 Miller units of β-galactosidase activity). No activity was observed when either fusion plasmid was used separately or when used with Zip-derived plasmids (cells remain white on MacConkey-maltose plates after several days; 50 Miller units). When NarH corresponding to the electron transfer subunit was used with the NarJ fusion protein, no activity was detected (data not shown) as shown previously by BIACORE analysis (21Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Google Scholar). Thus, this approach allows the detection of specific interaction between NarJ and NarG. Moreover, endogenous NarG issued from the recipient strain BTH101 cannot mediate interaction between NarJ and NarH fusion proteins using the two-hybrid system. These results set the stage for analyses of the interactions existing in vivobetween mo. gene products described below. To study the interactions existing in vivoamong proteins involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis, the following genes, moeA, mogA, mobA, andmobB were subcloned individually in both pT18 and pT25 plasmids. In an initial control, the functionality of each of the fusion proteins with MoeA, MogA, and MobA were tested by phenotype complementation analysis. Due to the lack of phenotype ofmobB mutant, functionality of the corresponding fusion proteins has not been assessed. On the other hand, complete restoration of the phenotype has been systematically observed by measurement of nitrate reductase activity (> 95% activity of the wild-type strain) indicating that all of the tested plasmid constructions produce active fusion proteins despite the presence of T25 or T18 domains at the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus, respectively. Further control experiments were carried out in which each of the mo. fusion constructs were tested with either pT18-Zip or pT25-Zip. None of the transformants exhibited adenylate cyclase complementation (cells remain white on MacConkey-maltose plates after several days; 50 Miller units), demonstrating recognition specificity displayed by the Mo. fusion proteins (data not shown). Fig. 1A displays results obtained from complementation between the Mo. chimeric proteins. To discriminate false-positive from true interactions, each of the interacting pairs have been tested in both directions and have given similar results on both indicator plates and β-galactosidase measurements. Interestingly, MoeA interacts with both MogA and MobA to result in significant complementation (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–2), whereas MogA fusion proteins failed to interact with MobA (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Somewhat surprisingly, MobB interacts with MoeA, MogA, and MobA to varying extents (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6). As a representative control, MoeA does not interact with the Zip domain (Fig. 1A,lane 7). One can take advantage of this two-hybrid system in verifying the multimerization ability of each of the tested Mo. proteins. Crystal structures and biochemical experiments have indicated that MoeA exists as a dimer (10Schrag J.D. Huang W. Sivaraman J. Smith C. Plamondon J. Larocque R. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 419-431Google Scholar, 11Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar) and MogA as a trimer (6Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Google Scholar), whereas MobA is monomeric (4Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Google Scholar, 5Stevenson C.E. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Google Scholar). MobB exists as a dimer according to gel filtration experiments (22Eaves D.J. Palmer T. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 690-697Google Scholar). Transformants with pT25-MobA/pT18-MobA exhibit a basal level of β-galactosidase activities supporting a monomeric state of MobA (Fig. 2, lane 1). In contrast, cotransformation with either pT25-MobB/pT18-MobB or pT25-MoeA/pT18-MoeA leads to a very high level of adenylate cyclase complementation (Fig. 2, lanes 2–3) supporting a dimeric state of both MobB and MoeA. Finally, no adenylate cyclase complementation was observed when using MogA chimeric proteins (Fig. 2, lane 4). Some of the visualized interactions might correspond to transient complexes occurring during Moco biosynthesis. At least, two of the tested proteins MogA and MoeA being able to bind Moco intermediates with various affinities (6Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Google Scholar, 11Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar, 14Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Google Scholar), one can envision that Moco intermediates trigger or facilitate some protein interactions. To assess the effect of complete absence of Moco on the interactions existing among the four tested proteins, we constructed by P1 transduction a BTH101moa::Tn10 mutant affected at the first stage of Moco biosynthesis (See “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1B displays results obtained from adenylate cyclase complementation between the Mo. chimeric proteins in the Moco-deficient strain. Similar complementation levels were reached with MobB fusion proteins in the BTH101moa strain in comparison to the wild-type strain BTH101 (Fig. 1B,lanes 4–6). Interestingly, transformants expressing either MobA-MoeA or MogA-MoeA chimeric protein pairs exhibited greatly reduced levels of β-galactosidase activities (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–2) leading to the assumption that Moco binding onto these proteins allows them to interact in a wild-type cell. The crystal structure of the MoeA dimer has not revealed the presence of any cofactor (11Xiang S. Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Structure. 2001; 9: 299-310Google Scholar). Accordingly, absence of Moco has no effect on the complementation level observed in cotransformants expressing T25MoeA/T18-MoeA proteins (data not shown). To identify the nature of Moco intermediates that trigger or facilitate protein-protein interactions between MogA-MoeA and MoeA-MobA, the effect of molybdenum deficiency has been assessed. In a mod mutant affected on the high affinity molybdate uptake system (see for review Ref. 23Grunden A.M. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Google Scholar), Moco biosynthesis is arrested at an intermediate step resulting in the sole presence of MPT and in the absence of active Moco for both MPT- and MGD-containing enzymes. The introduction of high levels of molybdate into the growth medium, however, restores molybdoenzyme activities tomod strains. The interactions have thus been evaluated in the strain BTH101modB::Tn10 constructed by P1 transduction. No significant differences were obtained in comparison to the wild-type BTH101 strain (Fig. 3) indicating that the sole presence of MPT is sufficient to allow MogA-MoeA and MoeA-MobA interactions. Tungstate is a close analog of molybdate and has been shown to be incorporated via an unknown mechanism into the Moco biosynthetic pathway. Growth in the presence of tungstate gives rise to a biologically inactive tungsten form of the Moco that leads to the formation of inactive forms of most molybdoenzymes (24Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Guigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Google Scholar, 25Rothery R.A. Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Google Scholar, 26Hanzelmann P. Meyer O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 755-765Google Scholar). However, such a cofactor can be incorporated into E. colitrimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (27Buc J. Santini C.L. Giordani R. Czjzek M. Wu L.F. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 159-168Google Scholar) and most probably into periplasmic nitrate reductase (28Potter L.C. Millington P.D. Thomas G.H. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Cole J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 185: 51-57Google Scholar). The addition of tungstate to the growth medium for strain BTH101mod gave rise to some specific differences in comparison to the wild-type strain (Fig. 3). Among the tested interactions, only MoeA-MogA and MoeA-MobA were significantly enhanced under these conditions (Fig. 3, lanes 1–2). The most likely explanation is that tungstate leads in some extent to the formation of a tungsten form of cofactor that is unable to be incorporated efficiently to mostly resident apomolybdoenzymes such as membrane-bound nitrate reductases (24Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Guigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Google Scholar). Consequently, one could envision accumulation of Moco intermediates (MPT and MPT-W) and of Moco-dependent protein complexes such as MogA-MoeA and MoeA-MobA. Finally, two-hybrid assays were conducted into amob strain (BTH101mob::Tn10) genetically able to synthesize active Moco (MPT-Mo) for MPT-containing enzymes but defective in the GMP attachment step (29Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Google Scholar, 30Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Google Scholar). In such a strain, presence of either T18-MobA or T25-MobA fusion proteins leads to a full restoration of the phenotype revealed by nitrate reductase activity measurement (data not shown). Hence, interactions involving MobA have not been tested. No significant differences in the interaction map were obtained in comparison to the wild-type BTH101 strain (data not shown) indicating that the metal has no effect on the interactions as the sole presence of either MPT in a modstrain or MPT-Mo in the mob strain is sufficient to allow the tested interactions. Specific protein-protein interactions are central to most biological processes and probably in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis as well. A bacterial two-hybrid approach (16Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Google Scholar) was chosen here, rather than the yeast system, as it could find numerous applications forin vivo analysis of newly identified bacterial protein interactions and become an essential complementary tool to biochemical studies currently performed on Moco biosynthetic proteins. The multimerization of MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB proteins has been assayed. Complete agreement has been observed between our results and published data for dimeric proteins (MoeA and MobB) and for a monomeric protein (MobA). In contrast, an apparent discrepancy has been observed for MogA, reported to be a trimer (6Liu M.T. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1814-1822Google Scholar), and for which no complementation was obtained by the two-hybrid assay. The most likely explanation is a steric hindrance within the T18-MogA/T25-MogA heterodimer in placing in close proximity the Cya domains. Indeed, the carboxyl terminus of each subunit within the MogA trimer are located on the same side and at the opposite of the amino-terminal ends avoiding close contact between the Cya domains. Consequently, the interaction between the MogA chimeric proteins will not lead necessarily to adenylate cyclase complementation. Importantly, one has to mention that high complementation levels reached in the case of MobB or MoeA dimers suggest the formation of extremely stable complexes. Conversely, lower complementation levels obtained with other interacting pairs most likely result from transient complexes that might require additional factors to be stabilized. Multiple pairwise interactions have been identified including some unexpected ones such as those involving MobB as summarized in Fig. 4. Indeed, MobB, a GTPase protein with a yet unclear function (22Eaves D.J. Palmer T. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 690-697Google Scholar), interacts with each of the tested Mo. proteins. Although no role was observed for MobB in the in vitro activation of Me2SO reductase (15Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Google Scholar), it enhanced the activation of nitrate reductase, another MGD-containing enzyme (31Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Google Scholar). Such observations stimulated our interest in the role played by MobB and led us to reconsider its possible role in Moco biosynthesis. Examination of the mechanisms of metallocenter assembly has revealed the strictly conserved involvement of a protein with a nucleotide-binding motif (UreG, HypB, CooC) (32Moncrief M.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Google Scholar, 33Maier T. Lottspeich F. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 133-138Google Scholar, 34Jeon W.B. Cheng J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38602-38609Google Scholar). Interestingly, UreG has been shown to interact with several proteins required for the maturation of urease, a nickel enzyme (32Moncrief M.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4081-4086Google Scholar, 35Soriano A. Colpas G.J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12435-12440Google Scholar, 36Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Google Scholar). By analogy, MobB would interact with several Mo. proteins to facilitate Moco insertion. Experiments are in progress to see whether the loss of GTPase activity of MobB would affect its ability to interact. MogA and MoeA form a tight complex in vivo. It has been shown that prokaryotic moeA and mogA gene sequences are systematically fused into a single open reading frame in eukarya-like plants, fungi, Drosophila, or higher eukarya-like humans (37Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Google Scholar, 38Millar L.J. Heck I.S. Sloan J. Kana'n G.J. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 445-453Google Scholar, 39Kamdar K.P. Shelton M.E. Finnerty V. Genetics. 1994; 137: 791-801Google Scholar, 40Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Google Scholar). It is therefore highly probable that these two bacterial proteins, which are involved in a common biosynthetic step of the Moco, interact with each other. However,in vitro mixing of purified MoeA and MogA proteins under different conditions did not form detectable complexes, leading to the assumption that either these proteins do not interact or that a factor was missing under these conditions (10Schrag J.D. Huang W. Sivaraman J. Smith C. Plamondon J. Larocque R. Matte A. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 419-431Google Scholar). Hence, the effect ofmo. mutations interrupting the Moco biosynthetic pathway at different levels has been probed on the interaction map. Such experiments performed in the BTH101moa::Tn10 strain allowed to identify and distinguish, for the first time, two classes of interactants, i.e. those that require the presence of Moco from those that do not. Whereas interactions involving MobB are not sensitive to the absence of Moco, MogA-MoeA and MoeA-MobA interactions are strongly affected supporting the view that Moco intermediates facilitate complex formation and/or stabilization. Molybdenum deficiency obtained in a mod mutant as well as amob mutation impairing MGD synthesis has no effect indicating that MPT is a key molecule triggering or facilitating some specific protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, tungstate addition to the growth medium of a mod strain brings about an activation of complementation for both MogA-MoeA and MoeA-MobA interacting pairs of some 2-fold over that found in its absence. Accumulation of these Moco-dependent protein complexes is most certainly a consequence of the accumulation of Moco intermediates (MPT and MPT-W) under these conditions (41Amy N.K. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 114-124Google Scholar). Overall, such observations are in full agreement with current knowledge on the function of MogA, MoeA, and MobA. Chelation of molybdenum by MPT requires the concerted action of MogA and MoeA (42Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368Google Scholar, 43Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Google Scholar). Our data provide the evidence that a MogA-MoeA complex can only occur in presence of MPT. In eukarya, such a complex is naturally occurringvia the existence of a MogA-MoeA fusion protein (37Stallmeyer B. Nerlich A. Schiemann J. Brinkmann H. Mendel R.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 751-762Google Scholar, 39Kamdar K.P. Shelton M.E. Finnerty V. Genetics. 1994; 137: 791-801Google Scholar,40Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Google Scholar). The resulting MPT-Mo-loaded MogA-MoeA complex might constitute the Moco donor to MPT-free apoenzymes in prokaryotes. Finally, in bacteria a nucleotide has to be attached to MPT with the help of MobA resulting in the MGD cofactor, the active cofactor for most prokaryotic molybdoenzymes. One can make the assumption that the preceding MogA-MoeA complex delivers MPT-Mo to MobA via the formation of a transient complex composed at least of MoeA and MobA. Here again, according to our results such a complex would exist only in presence of Moco. Although the final steps of bacterial Moco biosynthesis have not been clearly defined, the processes of Mo insertion and of dinucleotide attachment seem to be strongly linked and our data provide a further argument to this assumption. Finally, a minimal complex composed of MoeA and MobA might be involved in MGD transfer to the apoenzymes. Such a complex delineation is reminiscent of the Moco carrier linking Moco biosynthesis to its subsequent incorporation into various apomolybdoenzymes. In E. coli, Moco has been shown to be protected by tight binding to a 40-kDa Moco carrier protein (41Amy N.K. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 114-124Google Scholar). A similar situation has been encountered in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a 50-kDa carrier protein (44Witte C.P. Igeno M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernandez E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Google Scholar, 45Aguilar M. Kalakoutskii K. Cardenas J. Fernandez E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 162-163Google Scholar). However, little is known concerning the identity of this carrier molecule. The fact that mutations affecting the activity of molybdoenzymes inE. coli mapped only in loci involved in Mo transport (mod) or Moco biosynthesis (moa, mob,moe, and mog) indicates that mo. gene products could ensure Moco protection until its delivery to the apoenzymes. Results reported here already suggest that Moco biosynthesis occurs on protein complexes rather than by the separate action of different Mo. proteins. A complex of Moco biosynthetic proteins also functioning as the Moco carrier could thus ensure Moco protection. To validate this model, a number of questions have to be answered. The most relevant one is verifying whether one or severalmo. gene products involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis such as MoeA and MobA readily interact with apomolybdoenzymes. The bacterial two-hybrid approach described here constitutes an essential tool to address such a fundamental question. Based upon the conserved fusion event occurring between eukaryotic MogA and MoeA and on the observed interaction between E. colicounterparts in the presence of Moco, one can conclude that it becomes important to facilitate substrate-product flow by the existence of a Moco-biosynthetic multienzyme complex. Formation of such complexes would ensure both the fast and protected transfer of oxygen-sensitive intermediates within the reaction sequence from MPT to active Moco and its subsequent delivery to resident apomolybdoenzymes. The channeling of substrates is a well known mechanistic process for the direct delivery of a reaction intermediate from the active site of one enzyme to the active site of a second enzyme without prior dissociation into the bulk solvent (see for review Refs. 46Miles E.W. Rhee S. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12193-12196Google Scholar, 47Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Google Scholar). There are continuing reports on the existence of complexes of sequential metabolic enzymes (48Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Google Scholar, 49Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 679-685Google Scholar, 50Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144Google Scholar, 51Larsen T.M. Boehlein S.K. Schuster S.M. Richards N.G. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16146-16157Google Scholar). These systems share common features such as the existence of multiple and separate active sites connected or not via a molecular tunnel and coordination of the individual reactions through allosteric coupling of one active site with another. Interestingly, whereas MPT binding studies on the MogA-like G domain of Cnx1 revealed single independent high affinity binding sites on each monomer in the trimer, MoeA-like E domain binds MPT with a lower affinity and in a cooperative manner (14Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Google Scholar, 40Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Google Scholar). Solving the three-dimensional structure of eukaryotic MogA-MoeA fusion protein would most certainly provide information concerning the occurrence or not of a substrate-channeling mechanism by locating each of the active sites. In summary, this report describes the first evidence for in vivo protein-protein interactions among the mo. gene products involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis in E. coli. In addition, the present work extends previous knowledge on the function of MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB by providing evidence that they display specific pairwise interactions and that some of these interactions require the binding of Moco intermediates to these proteins. Each interacting pair reflects a potential mechanism by which Moco intermediates interact with various proteins in the actual cellular environment, and as such, must be studied to achieve an unified mechanism that explains the numerous interactions existing between these mo. gene products. The results of the present study suggest that an additional level of complexity may be found in the mechanism of Moco biosynthesis and incorporation into the apoenzymes. We greatly appreciate Drs. D. Ladant (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) and L. Selig (Hybrigenics S. A., Paris, France) for providing the bacterial two-hybrid system and for their help and advice. We thank Dr. K. T. Shanmugan for generous gift of strains."

Increased tyrosine phosphorylation among a number of proteins was detected in MSV-MDCK-INV cells relative to untransformed and MSV-transformed MDCK cells, especially for the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF-R), otherwise known as c-met proto-oncogene. Cell surface expression of HGF-R was similar in the three cell lines, indicating that HGF-R is constitutively phosphorylated in MSV-MDCK-INV cells. Both the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and the HGFα antibody abolished HGF-R phosphorylation, induced retraction of pseudopodial protrusions, and promoted the establishment of cell-cell contacts as well as the apparition of numerous stabilizing stress fibers in MSV-MDCK-INV cells. Furthermore, anti-HGFα antibody abolished cell motility among MSV-MDCK-INV cells. Conditioned medium from MSV-MDCK-INV cells induced MDCK cell scattering, indicating that HGF is secreted by MSV-MDCK-INV cells. HGF titration followed by a subsequent washout of the antibodies led to renewed pseudopodial protrusion and cellular movement. We therefore show that activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of HGF-R/Met via an autocrine HGF loop is directly responsible for pseudopodial protrusion, thereby explaining the motile and invasive potential of this model epithelium-derived tumor cell line."

P-selectin null (CD62P-/-) mice show a mild and CD18 null (CD18-/-) mice a more severe neutrophil recruitment defect in some inflammatory models. To investigate the possible cooperative interactions between CD18 integrins and P-selectin in mediating neutrophil recruitment, we generated CD18-/-CD62P-/- double null mice. CD18-/-CD62P-/- mice were apparently normal at weaning and fertile but later failed to gain weight, showed increased susceptibility to infection by fecal and commensal bacteria, and survived only 5-6 months. Some CD18-/-CD62P-/- mice showed severe spontaneous skin lesions; most showed neutrophil infiltration in the lungs and liver, and positive bacterial cultures from internal organs. The number and velocity of rolling leukocytes in tumor necrosis factor alpha treated venules of CD18-/-CD62P-/- mice was similar to those in wild-type mice, but neutrophil adhesion was severely reduced. Only 25% of adhered leukocytes were neutrophils in CD18-/-CD62P-/- mice vs. >90% in wild-type, CD62P-/-, and CD18-/- single mutants.

Loss of Egr-1 expression is closely associated with tumor formation. Phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) is overexpressed in some tumors, and its overexpression causes anchorage-independent growth. Here we report that overexpression of PLCgamma1 and SH2-SH3 domain of PLCgamma1 decreased induction of Egr-1 and the Egr-1-regulated genes TSP-1 and PAI-1. Results from the nuclear run-on assay and transfection experiment with the proximal 455 base pair region of the Egr-1 promoter (-454 to +1) showed that Egr-1 transcriptional activity was suppressed in PLCgamma1-3Y1 cells whereas decay of Egr-1 mRNA was similar in both cell lines. Serum response element- and ternary complex factor Elk-1-mediated transcriptional activation of the reporter gene in response to EGF were also inhibited in PLCgamma1-3Y1 cells. Pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) partially abrogated the serum-induced suppression of Egr-1 transcription in PLCgamma1-3Y1 cells, suggesting that a CHX-sensitive factor(s) is involved in the suppression of Egr-1 transcription in PLCgamma1-3Y1 cells. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of PLCgamma1 functions as a negative modulator of the tumor suppressor Egr-1 gene expression, possibly through inhibition of Elk-1-dependent transcriptional activity."
