https://openalex.org/W2904464741,"Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) is one of the most widespread viral infections of swine, causing a remarkable economic impact because of direct losses and indirect costs for its control. As other ssDNA viruses, PCV-2 is characterized by a high evolutionary rate, leading to the emergence of a plethora of variants with different biological and epidemiological features. Over time, several attempts have been made to organize PCV-2 genetic heterogeneity in recognized genotypes. This categorization has clearly simplified the epidemiological investigations, allowing to identify different spatial and temporal patterns among genotypes. Additionally, variable virulence and vaccine effectiveness have also been hypothesized. However, the rapid increase in sequencing activity, coupled with the per se high viral variability, has challenged the previously established nomenclature, leading to the definition of several study-specific genotypes and hindering the capability of performing comparable epidemiological studies. Based on these premises, an updated classification scheme is herein reported. Recognizing the impossibility of defining a clear inter-cluster p-distance cut-off, the present study proposes a phylogeny-grounded genotype definition based on three criteria: maximum intra-genotype p-distance of 13% (calculated on the ORF2 gene), bootstrap support at the corresponding internal node higher than 70% and at least 15 available sequences. This scheme allowed defining 8 genotypes (PCV-2a to PCV-2h), which six of those had been previously proposed. To minimize the inconvenience of implementing a new classification, the most common names already adopted have been maintained when possible. The analysis of sequence-associated metadata highlighted a highly unbalanced sequencing activity in terms of geographical, host and temporal distribution. The PCV-2 molecular epidemiology scenario appears therefore characterized by a severe bias that could lead to spurious associations between genetic and epidemiological/biological viral features. While the suggested classification can establish a ""common language"" for future studies, further efforts should be paid to achieve a more homogeneous and informative representation of the PCV-2 global scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2904890094,"Increased proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are associated with acquired long QT-syndrome (LQTS) in patients with systemic inflammation, leading to higher risks for life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia such as Torsades de Pointes. However, the functional and molecular mechanisms of this association are not known. In most cases of acquired LQTS, the target ion channel is the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) encoding the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K current, IKr, which plays a critical role in cardiac repolarization. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IL-6 may cause QT prolongation by suppressing IKr. Electrophysiological and biochemical assays were used to assess the impact of IL-6 on the functional expression of IKr in HEK293 cells and adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes (AGPVM). In HEK293 cells, IL-6 alone or in combination with the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), produced a significant depression of IKr peak and tail current densities. Block of IL-6R or Janus kinase (JAK) reversed the inhibitory effects of IL-6 on IKr. In AGPVM, IL-6 prolonged action potential duration (APD) which was further prolonged in the presence of IL-6R. Similar to heterologous cells, IL-6 reduced endogenous guinea pig ERG channel mRNA and protein expression. The data are first to demonstrate that IL-6 inhibition of IKr and the resulting prolongation of APD is mediated via IL-6R and JAK pathway activation and forms the basis for the observed clinical QT interval prolongation. These novel findings may guide the development of targeted anti-arrhythmic therapeutic interventions in patients with LQTS and inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2904019004,"Conjugation is a type of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that serves as the primary mechanism responsible for accelerating the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in Gram-negative bacteria. The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the conjugation-mediated gene transfer from the extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-AB) and New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii (NDM-AB) to environmental isolates of Acinetobacter spp. Conjugation experiments demonstrated that resistance to ticarcillin and kanamycin could be transferred from four donors to two sodium azide-resistant A. baumannii strains, namely, NU013R and NU015R. No transconjugants were detected on Mueller-Hinton Agar (MHA) plates containing tetracycline. Plasmids obtained from donors as well as successful transconjugants were characterized by PCR-based replicon typing and S1-nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE). Detection of antibiotic resistance genes and integrase genes (int) was performed using PCR. Results revealed that the donor AB364 strain can transfer the blaOXA-23 and blaPER-1 genes to both recipients in association with int1. A 240-kb plasmid was successfully transferred from the donor AB364 to recipients. In addition, the aphA6 and blaPER-1 genes were co-transferred with the int1 gene from the donor strains AB352 and AB405. The transfer of a 220-kb plasmid from the donors to recipient was detected. The GR6 plasmid containing the kanamycin resistance gene (aphA6) was successfully transferred from the donor strain AB140 to both recipient strains. However, the blaNDM-1 and tet(B) genes were not detected in all transconjugants. Our study is the first to demonstrate successful in vitro conjugation, which indicated that XDR-AB contained combination mechanisms of the co-transfer of antimicrobial resistance elements with integron cassettes or with the plasmid group GR6. Thus, conjugation could be responsible for the emergence of new types of antibiotic-resistant strains."
https://openalex.org/W2903752343,"Sinking marine oil snow was found to be a major mechanism in the transport of spilled oil from the surface to the deep sea following the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill. Marine snow formation is primarily facilitated by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are mainly composed of proteins and carbohydrates secreted by microorganisms. While numerous bacteria have been identified to degrade oil, there is a paucity of knowledge on bacteria that produce EPS in response to oil and Corexit exposure in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM). In this study, we isolated bacteria from surface water of the nGoM that grow on oil or Corexit dispersant. Among the 100 strains isolated, nine were identified to produce remarkable amounts of EPS. 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that six isolates (strains C1, C5, W10, W11, W14, W20) belong to the genus Alteromonas; the others were related to Thalassospira (C8), Aestuariibacter (C12), and Escherichia (W13a). The isolates preferably degraded alkanes (17–77%), over polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (0.90–23%). The EPS production was determined in the presence of a water accommodated fraction (WAF) of oil, a chemical enhanced WAF (CEWAF), Corexit, and control. The highest production of visible aggregates was found in Corexit followed by CEWAF, WAF, and control; indicating that Corexit generally enhanced EPS production. The addition of WAF and Corexit did not affect the carbohydrate content, but significantly increased the protein content of the EPS. On the average, WAF and CEWAF treatments had nine to ten times more proteins, and Corexit had five times higher than the control. Our results reveal that Alteromonas and Thalassospira, among the commonly reported bacteria following the DwH spill, produce protein rich EPS that could have crucial roles in oil degradation and marine snow formation. This study highlights the link between EPS production and bacterial oil-degrading capacity that should not be overlooked during spilled oil clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2905017761,"In Ethiopia, the uptake of antenatal care services has been low. Moreover, there is less frequent and late attendance of antenatal care among women who attend. Using the Anderson-Newman model of health care utilization, this study identified factors that either facilitate or impede antenatal care utilization in Kersa district, Eastern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 1294 eligible women participated in the study. Data were collected using face to face interviews with a pre-tested structured questionnaire administered with a digital survey tool. Data were collected in a house to house survey of eligible women in the community. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the predisposing, enabling and need factors associated with antenatal care utilization.Out of the 1294 respondents, 53.6% (95% CI: 50.8%, 56.3%) attended antenatal care at least once during their last pregnancy. Only 15.3% attended four or more antenatal care visits and just 32.6% attended prior to the 12th week of gestation. Educational status, previous use of antenatal care and best friend's use of maternal care were significant predisposing factors associated with at least one antenatal care visit. Type of kebele, wealth index and husband's attitude towards antenatal care were significant enabling factors associated with at least one antenatal care consultation. Health Extension Workers providing home visits, perceived importance of ANC and awareness of pregnancy complications were significant need factor associated with at least one antenatal care consultation. Husband's attitude towards ANC, head of the household, awareness of pregnancy complications, and history of abortion were predictors of attending four or more antenatal care visits.More than half of the women attended at least one antenatal care visit. A sizable proportion of women had infrequent and delayed antenatal care. Intervention efforts to improve antenatal care utilization should involve the following: improving women's educational achievement, peer education programs to mobilize and support women, programs to change husbands' attitudes, ameliorate the quality of antenatal care, increasing the Health Extension Worker's home visits program, and increasing the awareness of pregnancy complications."
https://openalex.org/W2902284322,"Bone loss and immune dysregulation are among the main adverse outcomes of spaceflight challenging astronauts' health and safety. However, consequences on B-cell development and responses are still under-investigated. To fill this gap, we used advanced proteomics analysis of femur bone and marrow to compare mice flown for 1 mo on board the BION-M1 biosatellite, followed or not by 1 wk of recovery on Earth, to control mice kept on Earth. Our data revealed an adverse effect on B lymphopoiesis 1 wk after landing. This phenomenon was associated with a 41% reduction of B cells in the spleen. These reductions may contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection even if our data suggest that flown animals can mount a humoral immune response. Future studies should investigate the quality/efficiency of produced antibodies and whether longer missions worsen these immune alterations.-Tascher, G., Gerbaix, M., Maes, P., Chazarin, B., Ghislin, S., Antropova, E., Vassilieva, G., Ouzren-Zarhloul, N., Gauquelin-Koch, G., Vico, L., Frippiat, J.-P., Bertile, F. Analysis of femurs from mice embarked on board BION-M1 biosatellite reveals a decrease in immune cell development, including B cells, after 1 wk of recovery on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2904182986,"Background Malaysia has a comprehensive, publicly-funded immunization program for hepatitis B (HepB) among infants, but adults must pay for the vaccine. The number of HepB carriers among adults is expected to increase in the future; therefore, we examined the impact of five constructs (cues to action, perceived barriers, perceived benefit, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility) on adults’ willingness to pay (WTP) for HepB vaccine; secondarily, we examined the association between perceived barriers and perceived benefits. Methods Adults were selected through a stratified, two-stage cluster community sample in Selangor, Malaysia. The reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the measurement model were assessed before implementing a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to evaluate the significance of the structural paths. Results A total of 728 participants were enrolled. The five constructs all showed adequate internal reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. There was a significant, positive relationship to WTP from constructs (perceived barriers [Path coefficient (β) = 0.082, P = 0.036], perceived susceptibility [β = 0.214, P<0.001], and cues to action [β = 0.166, P<0.001]), and the model all together accounted for 8.8% of the variation in WTP. There was a significant, negative relationship between perceived barriers and perceived benefit [β = -0.261, P<0.001], which accounted for 6.8% of variation in perceived benefit. Conclusions Policy and programs should be targeted that can modify individuals’ thoughts about disease risk, their obstacles in obtaining the preventive action, and their readiness to obtain a vaccine. Such programs include educational materials about disease risk and clinic visits that can pair HepB screening and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2905067512,"Objectives To quantify changes in anticoagulant use in Australia since the introduction of Non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (NOACs) and to estimate government expenditure. Design Interrupted-time-series analysis quantifying anticoagulant dispensing, before and after first Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) NOAC listing in August 2009 for venous thromboembolism prevention; and expanded listing for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in August 2013, up to June 2016. Estimated government expenditure on PBS-listed anticoagulants. Setting and participants PBS dispensing in 10% random sample of Australians, restricted to continuous concessional beneficiaries dispensed oral anticoagulants from July 2005 to June 2016. Total PBS anticoagulant expenditure was calculated using Medicare Australia statistics. Main outcome measures Monthly dispensing and initiation of oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or apixaban). Annual PBS anticoagulant expenditure. Results An estimated 149,180 concessional beneficiaries were dispensed anticoagulants (100% warfarin) during July 2005. This increased to 292,550 during June 2016, of whom 47.0%, 27.1%, 18.7% and 7.2% were dispensed warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran, respectively. Of 16,500 initiated on anticoagulants in June 2016, 24.3%, 38.2%, 30.0% and 7.5% were initiated on warfarin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, respectively. Compared to July 2005-July 2013, from August 2013-June 2016, dispensings for all anticoagulants increased by 2,303 dispensings/month (p<0.001, 95%CI = [1,229 3,376]); warfarin dispensing decreased by 1,803 dispensings/month (p<0.001, 95%CI = [–2,606, –1,000]). Total PBS anticoagulant expenditure was $19.5 million (97.0% concessional) in 2008/09, of which 100% was warfarin and $203.3 million (86.2% concessional) in 2015/16, of which 11.2% was warfarin. Conclusions The introduction of the NOACs led to substantial increases in anticoagulant use and expenditure in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2902682482,"The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is an important pest of maize in the Americas and has recently been introduced into Africa. Fall armyworm populations have developed resistance to control strategies that depend on insecticides and transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins. The study of various resistance mechanisms at the molecular level and the development novel control strategies have been hampered by a lack of functional genomic tools such as gene editing in this pest. In the current study, we explored the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to modify the genome of FAW. We first identified and characterized the abdominal-A (Sfabd-A) gene of FAW. Sfabd-A single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 protein were then injected into 244 embryos of FAW. Sixty-two embryos injected with Sfabd-A sgRNA hatched. Of these hatched embryos, twelve developed into larvae that displayed typical aba-A mutant phenotypes such as fused segments. Of the twelve mutant larvae, three and five eventually developed into female and male moths, respectively. Most mutant moths were sterile, and one female produced a few unviable eggs when it was outcrossed to a wild-type male. Genotyping of 20 unhatched Sfabd-A sgRNA-injected embryos and 42 moths that developed from Sfabd-A sgRNA-injected embryos showed that 100% of the unhatched embryos and 50% of the moths contained indel mutations at the Sfabd-A genomic locus near the guide RNA target site. These results suggest that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is highly efficient in editing FAW genome. Importantly, this gene editing technology can be used to validate gene function to facilitate an understanding of the resistance mechanism and lead to the development of novel pest management approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2903656188,"Despite significant and successful efforts in Brazil regarding snakebites in the areas of research, antivenom manufacture and quality control, training of health professionals in the diagnosis and clinical management of bites, little is known about determinants of snakebites incidence in order to further plan interventions to reduce the impact of this medical condition. Understanding the complexity of ecological interactions in a geographical region is important for prediction, prevention and control measures of snakebites. This investigation aims to describe spatial distribution and identify environmental determinants of human envenoming by lancehead pit vipers (Bothrops genus), in the Brazilian Amazon. Aggregated data by the municipality was used to analyze the spatial distribution of Bothrops bites cases and its relationship with geographic and environmental factors. Eight geo-environmental factors were included in the analysis as independent variables: (1) tree canopy loss increase; (2) area with vegetation cover; (3) area covered by water bodies; (4) altitude; (5) precipitation; (6) air relative humidity; (7) soil moisture; and (8) air temperature. Human envenoming by lancehead pit vipers (Bothrops genus) in the Amazon region is more incident in lowlands [Adjusted regression coefficient [ARC] -0.0007 (IC95%: -0.001; -0.0006), p<0.0001], with high preserved original vegetation cover [ARC 0.0065 (IC95%: 0.0071; 0.0060), p<0.0001], with heaviest rainfall [ARC 0.0001 (IC95%: 0.00009; 0.0001), p<0.0001] and higher air relative humidity [ARC 0.0082 (IC95%: 0.0108; 0.0056), p<0.0001]. This association is interpreted as the result of the higher prey availability and further abundance of pit vipers in such landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2903179196,"Background Low-dose persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have recently been linked to immunosenescence, a key mechanism in carcinogenesis, as well as many aging-related chronic diseases. Since feces are the main excretion route of POPs, the large intestine is a potential target organ for these pollutants. We performed a case-control study to evaluate whether exposure to low-dose POPs is related to the risk of colorectal polyps and cancer. Methods A total of 277 participants were recruited from one hospital: 99 cancer patients, 102 polyp patients, and 76 control subjects. As typical examples of POPs, we measured the serum concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Results Across the tertiles of the summary measure of POPs, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of colorectal polyps and cancer were 2.8 (1.2–6.8) (Ptrend = 0.01) and 3.0 (1.0–8.8) (Ptrend = 0.02), respectively, for subjects in the highest tertile. When OCPs and PCBs were analyzed separately, OCPs were linked to an increased risk of both polyps and cancer; the adjusted ORs were 2.3 (0.9–5.7) (Ptrend = 0.05) for polyps and 3.6 (1.1–11.8) (Ptrend< 0.01) for cancer. However, PCBs were only significantly associated with a high risk of polyps but not cancer; the adjusted OR was 2.8 (1.2–6.6) (Ptrend = 0.01). Conclusion Chronic exposure to low-dose POPs may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps and cancer. Our findings suggest the carcinogenic potential of strong lipophilic chemical mixtures such as POPs which are accumulated in adipose tissue, released to circulation, and eliminated through feces."
https://openalex.org/W2904572018,"Cornus kousa the Korean dogwood has been traditionally used in East Asia as therapeutic traditional medicine however biological activities of Cornus kousa have not been investigated previously. The aim of the present study was to evaluate anti-obesity activities coupled with anti-angiogenic activities of anthocyanins rich fraction of ethanolic leaf extract of Cornus kousa (ELECk) in HUVECs and 3T3- L1 cells. Dried plants leaves were extracted with 70% ethanol and anthocyanin fraction (AnT Fr) was obtained by eluting the ethanolic extract through non-polar macroporous resin and further purification by HPLC. Antiangiogenic activities were determined by antiproliferative effect of AnT Fr on HUVECs. In the presence of various concentrations of AnT Fr, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate. Lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes were quantified by Oil-Red O staining. AnT Fr significantly suppressed angiogenesis by inhibiting proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs via downregulating VEGRF 2, PI3K, β-catenin, NF-kB, and Akt1 in a dose dependent manner. AnT Fr inhibited lipid accumulation by down-regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis promoting signaling proteins, PPARγ, CCAAT, C/EBPα, aP2, FAS, and LPL, however enhanced AMPK activation to p-AMPK in 3T3 cells quantified and expressed by western blotting. AnT Fr inhibit lipid accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis related genes and signaling proteins. The anti-obesity activities exerted by Cornus kousa are associated with antiangiogenic activities of anthocyanins rich fraction of Cornus kousa. Hence the presence of bioactive anthocyanins, Cornus kosa, is a good candidate for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulation for treating or controlling obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2904576648,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that causes serious antibiotic-resistant infections. Its population structure is marked by the appearance and dissemination of successful lineages across different settings. To begin understanding the population structure of S. aureus causing ocular and otolaryngology infections, we characterized 262 isolates by antimicrobial sensitivity testing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus were subjected to SCCmec typing and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) screening. Although we detected a high level of genetic diversity among methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) isolates, (63 sequence types-STs), the population was dominated by five lineages: ST30, ST5, ST8, ST15 and ST97. Resistance to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin was common among the major MSSA lineages, with fluctuations markedly impacted by genetic background. Isolates belonging to the predominant lineage, ST30, displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin (100%), erythromycin (71%), and clindamycin (63%). Overall, 21% of the isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), with an apparent enrichment among otitis and orbital cellulitis isolates (>40%). MRSA isolates belonged to 14 STs grouped in 5 clonal complexes (CC), however, CC5 (56.1%) and CC8 (38.6%) dominated the population. Most CC5 strains were SCCmec type II, and resembled the hospital-adapted USA100 clone. CC8 strains were SCCmec type IV, and 86% were positive for the PVL toxin, common features of the community-acquired clone USA300. CC5 strains harboring a SCCmec type IV, typical for the USA800 clone, comprised 15.5% of the population. USA100 strains were highly resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin and levofloxacin (100%), while USA300 strains were frequently resistant to erythromycin (89%) but displayed lower rates of resistance to levofloxacin (39%) and clindamycin (17%). Our data demonstrate that the ocular and otolaryngology S. aureus populations are composed of strains that are commonly resistant to clinically relevant antibiotics, and are associated with the major epidemic clonal complexes of both community and hospital origins."
https://openalex.org/W2904578997,"The trial objective was to compare the performance and animal health parameters of pigs raised according to one of 3 antibiotic (AB) protocols: standard AB medication consisting of mass treatment on days 4 and 21 and judicious AB therapy given therapeutically thereafter as group medication in water and feed or by individual injection (group T1, N = 702); modified AB medication identical to group T1 but with mass treatment only on day 4 and without subsequent therapeutic feed medication (group T2, N = 675); or an antibiotic-free (ABF) regimen (group T3, N = 702). All pigs were vaccinated with a modified-live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccine 3 days after weaning. Using a seeder pig model to mimic endemic field infection dynamics, pigs were contact-challenged with virulent PRRSV lineage 1 strain 174 four weeks after vaccination. At finishing, average daily gain (ADG) and mean feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly better (p ≤ 0.05) for the T1 and T2 groups compared to the T3 group. There were no significant differences in post-weaning ADG and FCR between the T1 and T2 groups. Mortality and removals significantly favored (p ≤0.05) the T1 and T2 groups (20.94% and 24.89%, respectively) versus the T3 group (57.98%). Net revenue per pig was $105.43, $98.79, and $33.81 for the T1, T2 and T3 groups, respectively. Under the conditions of this study, these results indicate that in a PRRSV-endemic setting involving bacterial co-infections, an ABF production strategy may leave pigs at considerable risk of exposure to severe clinical disease and that judicious use of antibiotics can significantly improve animal health."
https://openalex.org/W2903628161,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are related to positive clinical prognoses in numerous cancer types. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a mediator of the PD-1 receptor, plays an inhibitory role in cancer immune responses. PD-L1 upregulation can impede infiltrating T-cell functions in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a lung cancer subtype. However, associations between the expression of PD-L1 and infiltration of B cells (a major immunoregulatory cell) remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of infiltrating B cells in LUAD progression and its correlation with PD-L1 expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD data set was used to explore associations among B-cell infiltration, PD-L1 expression, clinical outcome, and gene landscape. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to explore putative signaling pathways and candidate genes. The drug enrichment analysis was used to identify candidate genes and the related drugs. We found that high B-cell infiltration was correlated with better prognoses; however, PD-L1 may interfere with the survival advantage in patients with high B-cell infiltration. The gene landscape was characterized comprehensively, with distinct PD-L1 levels in cell populations with high B-cell infiltration. We obtained five upregulated signaling pathways from the gene landscape: apoptosis, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signaling via nuclear factor (NF)-κB, apical surface, interferon-α response, and KRAS signaling. Moreover, four candidate genes and their related target drugs were also identified, namely interleukin-2β receptor (IL2RB), IL-2γ receptor (IL2RG), Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), and TNF. These findings suggest that tumor-infiltrating B cells could act as a clinical factor in anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W2904424948,"β-thalassemia is a worldwide distributed monogenic red cell disorder, characterized by an absent or reduced beta globin chain synthesis. The unbalance of alpha-gamma chain and the presence of pathological free iron promote severe oxidative damage, playing crucial a role in erythrocyte hemolysis, exacerbating ineffective erythropoiesis and decreasing the lifespan of red blood cells (RBC). Catalase, glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxins act together to protect RBCs from hydrogen peroxide insult. Among them, peroxiredoxins stand out for their overall abundance and reactivity. In RBCs, Prdx2 is the third most abundant protein, although Prdxs 1 and 6 isoforms are also found in lower amounts. Despite the importance of these enzymes, Prdx1 and Prdx2 may have their peroxidase activity inactivated by hyperoxidation at high hydroperoxide concentrations, which also promotes the molecular chaperone activity of these proteins. Some studies have demonstrated the importance of Prdx1 and Prdx2 for the development and maintenance of erythrocytes in hemolytic anemia. Now, we performed a global analysis comparatively evaluating the expression profile of several antioxidant enzymes and their physiological reducing agents in patients with beta thalassemia intermedia (BTI) and healthy individuals. Furthermore, increased levels of ROS were observed not only in RBC, but also in neutrophils and mononuclear cells of BTI patients. The level of transcripts and the protein content of Prx1 were increased in reticulocyte and RBCs of BTI patients and the protein content was also found to be higher when compared to beta thalassemia major (BTM), suggesting that this peroxidase could cooperate with Prx2 in the removal of H2O2. Furthermore, Prdx2 production is highly increased in RBCs of BTM patients that present high amounts of hyperoxidized species. A significant increase in the content of Trx1, Srx1 and Sod1 in RBCs of BTI patients suggested protective roles for these enzymes in BTI patients. Finally, the upregulation of Nrf2 and Keap1 transcription factors found in BTI patients may be involved in the regulation of the antioxidant enzymes analyzed in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2904837963,"The surgical standard of care for lumbar discectomy leaves the annulus fibrosus (AF) defect unrepaired, despite considerable risk for a recurrent herniation. Identification of a viable defect repair strategy has until now been elusive. The scope of this ex vivo biomechanical study was to evaluate crosslinking hydrogels as potentially promising AF defect sealants, and provide a baseline for their use in combination with collagen scaffolds that restore disc volume. This study directly compared genipin crosslinked fibrin hydrogel (FibGen) as a promising preclinical candidate against a clinically available adhesive composed of glutaraldehyde and albumin (BioGlue). Forty-two bovine coccygeal functional spine units (FSU) were randomly allocated into four groups, namely untreated (control, n = 12), repaired with either one of the tested hydrogels (BioGlue, n = 12; FibGen, n = 12), or FibGen used in combination with a collagen hydrogel scaffold (FibGen+Scaffold, n = 6). All specimens underwent a moderate mechanical testing protocol in intact, injured and repaired states. After completion of the moderate testing protocol, the samples underwent a ramp-to-failure test. Lumbar discectomy destabilized the FSU as quantified by increased torsional range of motion (28.0° (19.1, 45.1) vs. 41.39° (27.3, 84.9), p<0.001), torsional neutral zone (3.1° (1.2, 7.7) vs. 4.8° (2.1, 12.1), Z = -3.49, p < 0.001), hysteresis(24.4 J (12.8, 76.0) vs. 27.6 J (16.4, 54.4), Z = -2.61, p = 0.009), with loss of both disc height (7.0 mm (5.0, 10.5) vs 6.1 mm (4.0, 9.3), Z = -5.16, p < 0.001) and torsional stiffness (0.76 Nmdeg-1 (0.38, 1.07) vs. 0.66 Nmdeg-1 (0.38, 0.97), Z = -3.98, p < 0.001). Most FibGen repaired AF endured the entire testing procedure whereas only a minority of BioGlue repaired AF and all FibGen+Scaffold repaired AF failed (6/10 vs. 3/12 vs. 0/6 respectively, p = 0.041). Both BioGlue and FibGen+Scaffold repaired AF partially restored disc height (0.47 mm (0.07, 2.41), p = 0.048 and 1.52 mm (0.41, 2.57), p = 0.021 respectively) compared to sham treatment (0.08 mm (-0.63, 0.88)) whereas FibGen-only repaired AF had no such effect (0.04 mm (-0.73, 1.13), U = 48.0, p = 1). The AF injury model demonstrated considerable change of FSU mechanics that could be partially restored by use of an AF sealant. While inclusion of a volumetric collagen scaffold led to repair failure, use of FibGen alone demonstrated clinically relevant promise for prevention of mechanical reherniation, outperforming an FDA approved sealant in this ex vivo test series."
https://openalex.org/W2903875349,"Background A key mechanism thought to underlie Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is enhanced emotional memory consolidation. Recent evidence in healthy controls revealed that women have greater negative memory consolidation following stress relative to men. This study examined emotional memory consolidation in women and men with PTSD, and in trauma-exposed and non-trauma controls to test the hypothesis that emotionally negative memory consolidation would be greater in women with PTSD. Method One hundred and forty-seven men and women (47 with PTSD, 49 trauma-exposed controls, and 51 non-trauma controls) completed an emotional memory task where they looked at negative, neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Delayed recall and an intrusive memory diary were completed two days later. Results Women displayed greater recall, and reported more negative intrusive memories than men. A gender x group interaction effect showed that both women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women reported more intrusive memories than women without trauma exposure or men. Conclusion This study provided preliminary evidence of sex differences in intrusive memories in those with PTSD as well as those with a history of trauma exposure. Future research should include measures of sex hormones to further examine sex differences on memory consolidation in the context of trauma exposure and PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2903846747,"The use of music and specifically tempo-matched music has been shown to affect running performance. But can we maximize the synchronization of movements to music and does maximum synchronization influence kinematics and motivation? In this study, we explore the effect of different types of music-to-movement alignment strategies on phase coherence, cadence and motivation. These strategies were compared to a control condition where the music tempo was deliberately not aligned to the running cadence. Results show that without relative phase alignment, a negative mean asynchrony (NMA) of footfall timings with respect to the beats is obtained. This means that footfalls occurred slightly before the beat and that beats were anticipated. Convergence towards this NMA or preferred relative phase angle was facilitated when the first music beat of a new song started close to the step, which means that entrainment occurred. The results also show that using tempo and phase alignment, the relative phase can be manipulated or forced in a certain angle with a high degree of accuracy. Ensuring negative angles larger than NMA (step before beat) results in increased motivation and decreasing cadence. Running in NMA or preferred relative phase angles results in a null effect on cadence. Ensuring a positive phase angle with respect to NMA results in higher motivation and higher cadence. None of the manipulations resulted in change in perceived exhaustion or a change in velocity. Results also indicate that gender plays an important role when using forced phase algorithms: effects were more pronounced for the female population than for the male population. The implementation of the proposed alignment strategies and control of beat timing while running opens possibilities optimizing the individual running cadence and motivation."

We also analyzed the association between HL level and health care outcomes among individuals with CVD, i.e. frequency of general practitioner or specialist consultations, hospitalization and treatment delay.The percentage of ""problematic"" or ""inadequate"" HL, defined as ""not sufficient"" HL, was significantly higher in individuals with CVD compared to without CVD (men 41.8% vs. 33.6%, women 46.7% vs. 33.4%). Having CVD was independently associated with ""not sufficient"" HL after adjusting for age, education, income, health consciousness and social support (adjusted OR: men 1.36, women 1.64). Among participants with CVD, individuals with ""inadequate"" HL were more likely to have more than 6 general practitioner consultations (49.3% vs. 28.7%), hospitalization (46.6% vs. 36.0%) in the last 12 months and to experience delay in getting health care because of long waiting lists for an appointment (30.7% vs. 18.5%) compared to participants with ""sufficient"" HL.""Problematic"" or ""inadequate"" HL is independently associated with CVD and health care use. This is a challenge and an opportunity for both CVD prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2904993301,"Lakes are a key geographical feature in Canada and have an impact on the regional climate. In the winter, they are important for recreational activities such as snowmobiling and ice fishing and act as part of an important supply route for northern communities. The ability to accurately report lake ice characteristics such as thickness is vital, however, it is underreported in Canada and there is a lack of lake ice thickness records for temperate latitude areas such as Central Ontario. Here, we evaluate the application of previously developed temperature models and RADARSAT-2 for estimating lake ice thickness in Central Ontario and provide insight into the regions long term ice thickness variability. The ALS Environmental Science Shallow Water Ice Profiler (SWIP) was used for validation of both temperature and radar-based models. Results indicate that the traditional approach that uses temperatures to predict ice thickness during ice growth has low RMSE values of 2.3 cm and correlations of greater than 0.9. For ice decay, similar low RMSE values of 2.1 cm and high correlations of 0.97 were found. Using RADARSAT-2 to estimate ice thickness results in R2 values of 0.6 (p < 0.01) but high RMSE values of 11.7 cm. Uncertainty in the RADARSAT-2 approach may be linked to unexplored questions about scattering mechanisms and the interaction of radar signal with mid-latitude lake ice. The application of optimized temperature models to a long-term temperature record revealed a thinning of ice cover by 0.81 cm per decade."
https://openalex.org/W2902331024,"Inbred lines are important germplasm in cauliflower breeding programs. To understand the genetic diversity and relationships of cauliflower inbred lines, the use of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers will be of great value for parental line selection and breeding strategy design. In this study, the genetic diversity and relationships of 165 cauliflower inbred lines primarily derived from southeast China were assessed using SSR markers. Forty-three SSR markers were polymorphic across these inbred lines and generated a total of 111 alleles. The mean values of the number of alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne), Shannon's Information index (I), and polymorphism information content (PIC) per locus were 2.581, 1.599, 0.517 and 0.316, respectively. Genetic distance values among all pairs of the inbred lines varied from 0 to 0.67 with an average of 0.30. On the basis of genetic distance data estimated with the SSR markers, the 165 cauliflower inbred lines were classified into four main clusters (from group Ⅰ to group Ⅳ) by cluster analysis and four subpopulations (from POP 1 to POP 4) by structure analysis. The classification patterns of most cauliflower inbred lines were not consistent with their curd maturity, curd solidity or geographic origins. These results based on estimates by the SSR markers, suggested the genetic diversity of the 165 cauliflower inbred lines was relatively narrow. Therefore, pyramiding the valuable genes among different types of the cauliflower inbred lines is important to increase the genetic diversity to obtain desirable hybridization combinations. The information generated in this report will be useful for assessing germplasm and breeding in cauliflower."
https://openalex.org/W2903650215,"Posttraumatic stress-negative psychological experiences as a result of traumatic stressors-can hinder military veterans' reintegration into society and cause various mental health problems. Veterans need quality social relationships to facilitate reintegration and to cope with posttraumatic stress and related mental health problems; discrimination or other forms of interpersonal rejection can exacerbate these veterans' problems. Ostracism (i.e., being ignored and excluded) is a painful and psychologically distressing experience that may be one factor that contributes to the problems of veterans who are dealing with posttraumatic stress. To our knowledge, this connection has yet to be tested empirically. Thus, we investigated the correlation between posttraumatic stress, perceived ostracism, and other theoretically relevant variables (i.e., mental health problems, perceived social support, psychological need satisfaction) in a sample of veterans who have had at least one deployment. Our results provide preliminary empirical evidence suggesting that perceived ostracism may contribute to veteran' deployment-related psychological problems. Veterans' perceived ostracism correlated with psychological problems (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and psychological distress), and it explained additional variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms above and beyond common predictors of these symptoms (i.e., deployment stress, perceived military and civilian-based social support). Finally, perceived ostracism emerged as the most important predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms in a relative weights analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2952003646,"The aim of this study was to identify the levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCA) compared to healthy individuals. A cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach was performed at a reference center for the treatment of patients with hemoglobinopathies in northeastern Brazil. Patients were recruited between October 2015 and January 2017. Eligible participants answered a Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children and Adolescents (PAQ-C) and were instructed to use an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Fifty patients (and their 50 controls matched for age and sex) were then evaluated. We observed lower moderate (19.2 ± 11.9 and 27.1 ± 13.8 min/d; p<0.01) and vigorous PA (3.6 ± 4.1 and 7.8 ± 7.4 min/d; p<0.01) in cases than controls, respectively. There was also a significant difference among cases and controls in the following variables: total of steps (51010 ± 19600 and 59105 ± 22650; p = 0.04) and “total caloric expenditure” (1015 ± 516 and 2404 ± 1308; p<0.01), with the lowest values for the patients with SCA for all variables. Children and adolescents with SCA presented lower levels of physical activity than healthy children and adolescents, either when evaluated by PAQs or by accelerometer."
https://openalex.org/W2904340447,"Background The microbiome has a functional role in a number of inflammatory processes and disease states. While neointimal hyperplasia development has been linked to inflammation, a direct role of the microbiota in neointimal hyperplasia has not yet been established. Germ-free (GF) mice are an invaluable model for studying causative links between commensal organisms and the host. We hypothesized that GF mice would exhibit altered neointimal hyperplasia following carotid ligation compared to conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice. Methods Twenty-week-old male C57BL/6 GF mice underwent left carotid ligation under sterile conditions. Maintenance of sterility was assessed by cultivation and 16S rRNA qPCR of stool. Neointimal hyperplasia was assessed by morphometric and histologic analysis of arterial sections after 28 days. Local arterial cell proliferation and inflammation was assessed by immunofluorescence for Ki67 and inflammatory cell markers at five days. Systemic inflammation was assessed by multiplex immunoassays of serum. CONV-R mice treated in the same manner served as the control cohort. GF and CONV-R mice were compared using standard statistical methods. Results All GF mice remained sterile during the entire study period. Twenty-eight days after carotid ligation, CONV-R mice had significantly more neointimal hyperplasia development compared to GF mice, as assessed by intima area, media area, intima+media area, and intima area/(intima+media) area. The collagen content of the neointimal lesions appeared qualitatively similar on Masson’s trichrome staining. There was significantly reduced Ki67 immunoreactivity in the media and adventitia of GF carotid arteries 5 days after ligation. GF mice also had increased arterial infiltration of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages compared to CONV-R mouse arteries and a reduced proportion of mature neutrophils. GF mice had significantly reduced serum IFN-γ-inducible protein (IP)-10 and MIP-2 5 days after carotid ligation, suggesting a reduced systemic inflammatory response. Conclusions GF mice have attenuated neointimal hyperplasia development compared to CONV-R mice, which is likely related to altered kinetics of wound healing and acute inflammation. Recognizing the role of commensals in the regulation of arterial remodeling will provide a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of restenosis and support strategies to treat or reduce restenosis risk by manipulating microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2904454041,"Therapeutic hypothermia is a strategy that reduces metabolic rate and brain damage during clinically-relevant hypoxic events. Mitochondrial respiration is compromised by hypoxia, with deleterious consequences for the mammalian brain; however, little is known about the effects of reduced temperature on mitochondrial metabolism. Therefore, we examined how mitochondrial function is impacted by temperature using high resolution respirometry to assess electron transport system (ETS) function in saponin-permeabilized mouse brain at 28 and 37°C. Respirometric analysis revealed that, at the colder temperature, ETS respiratory flux was ~ 40–75% lower relative to the physiological temperature in all respiratory states and for all fuel substrates tested. In whole brain tissue, the enzyme maximum respiratory rates for complexes I-V were similarly reduced by between 37–88%. Complexes II and V were particularly temperature-sensitive; a temperature-mediated decrease in complex II activity may support a switch to complex I mediated ATP-production, which is considerably more oxygen-efficient. Finally, the mitochondrial H+-gradient was more tightly coupled, indicating that mitochondrial respiration is more efficient at the colder temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that improvements in mitochondrial function with colder temperatures may contribute to energy conservation and enhance cellular viability in hypoxic brain."
https://openalex.org/W2904400717,"Recurrent headache, abdominal and musculoskeletal pain are common in adolescents and it is therefore important to understand their impact on the transitional period from childhood to adulthood. However, studies of the prevalence over time and implications on educational outcomes are still limited, especially regarding multiple pain symptoms. The present study material consists of questionnaire surveys, completed in 2000 and 2008, including two study populations of 9th grade adolescents aged 15 living in West Sweden (n = 20 877). Pain symptoms and demographic variables were based on self-reports from the questionnaires, and school grades were obtained from Statistics Sweden after the student had finished their 9th grade. Between 2000 and 2008, the prevalence of abdominal pain increased among Swedish adolescents (largest increase in girls); the prevalence of headache increased only in girls; the prevalence of pain in upper body decreased only in boys. School grades were significantly lower among those with headache or abdominal pain. Among students with low school grades (10th percentile) the estimated difference between those having any of the symptoms or none were -27 school grade units (95% confidence interval for girls (-27.8; -26.0), for boys (-27.6; -25.5). Both symptoms being present pronounced the association. Low parental education increased the negative effect of symptoms on school grades, most pronounced in the group with the lowest grades. In conclusion, identification of pain symptoms may improve academic achievements, especially in students with multiple symptoms and with parents having low education. Further intervention studies are need."
https://openalex.org/W2904685951,"The biosynthesis of the antifungal filipin in Streptomyces filipinensis is very sensitive to phosphate regulation. Concentrations as low as 2.5 mM block filipin production. This effect is, at least in part, produced by repression of the transcription of most filipin biosynthetic genes. The role of the two-component PhoRP system in this process was investigated. The phoRP system of S. filipinensis was cloned and transcriptionally characterised. PhoP binds to two PHO boxes present in one of its two promoters. Filipin production was greatly increased in ΔphoP and ΔphoRP mutants, in agreement with a higher transcription of the fil genes, and the effect of phosphate repression on the antibiotic production of these strains was significantly reduced. No PhoP binding was observed by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSAs) with the promoter regions of the fil gene cluster thus suggesting an indirect effect of mutations. Binding assays with cell-free extracts from the wild-type and mutant strains on fil genes promoters revealed retardation bands in the parental strain that were absent in the mutants, thus suggesting that binding of the putative transcriptional regulator or regulators controlled by PhoP was PhoP dependent. Noteworthy, PhoP or PhoRP deletion also produced a dramatic decrease in sporulation ability, thus indicating a clear relationship between the phosphate starvation response mediated by PhoP and the sporulation process in S. filipinensis. This effect was overcome upon gene complementation, but also by phosphate addition, thus suggesting that alternative pathways take control in the absence of PhoRP."

The present study provides a road test of this idea, showing that this theorizing can be utilized to increase charitable giving among the affluent, when individuals do not realize that their behavior is being studied. In a naturalistic field experiment conducted as part of an annual fundraising campaign (N = 12,316), we randomly assigned individuals from an affluent sample to view messages focused on agency (vs. communion). Messages that focused on personal agency (vs. communion) increased the total amount of money that individuals in the sample donated by approximately 82%. These findings provide evidence for a simple, theoretically-grounded method of encouraging donations among those with the greatest capacity to give."
https://openalex.org/W2903628075,"The response of trees to a changing climate can be affected by transgenerational phenotypic plasticity, i.e. phenotypic variation that is conserved and transferred to the offspring. Transgenerational plasticity that is influenced by epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that do not result from changes in DNA sequence) during both sexual and asexual reproduction are of major relevance for adaptation of plants to climate change. To understand the transgenerational effects on the responses of vegetatively propagated poplar (Populus deltoides and P. trichocarpa) ramets (cuttings) to a changing environment, we tested whether the temperature and photoperiod experienced by the mother trees (genets) persistently affects the phenology of the cuttings grown in a common environment. We weekly monitored the bud phenology of the cuttings collected from the parent trees that have been growing across Europe along a >2100 km latitudinal gradient for at least 18 years. In addition, we asked whether there was variation in DNA methylation as measured by Methylation Sensitive Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (MSAPs) in the clones due to the different environmental conditions experienced by the parent trees. Our results indicate a transgenerational effect on bud phenology in the asexually reproduced offspring (vegetative cuttings). The temperatures experienced by the parent tree clones (from different geographic regions) altered the bud flush of the cuttings in the common garden. However, no significant epigenetic variation was detected in the cuttings of the parent trees within single genotypes growing under different climates. In sum, our results show that trees have the potential to respond to rapid climate change but the mechanism behind these changes needs to be further investigated by more powerful molecular methods like whole-genome bisulphite sequencing techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2903865084,"Background Re-biopsy by bronchoscopy is an important part of treatment for patients with relapsed lung cancer; however, some patients refuse to undergo a re-examination due to discomfort during their first bronchoscopy. The aim of the present study was to determine factors causing discomfort during bronchoscopy and to identify the factors that affect patients’ reluctance to undergo repeat examinations via a questionnaire administered immediately after the initial bronchoscopy. Methods and findings We evaluated 283 patients who underwent bronchoscopy at Chiba University Hospital between September 2015 and March 2017. Following bronchoscopy, the patients answered a questionnaire regarding the procedure. We identified patient characteristics and factors related to bronchoscopy that were associated with patients’ reluctance to undergo re-examination. Two hundred nine patients were ultimately enrolled in the study. The factors affecting patient tolerance for re-examination were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43–5.53), discomfort during the examination (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.13–2.56), and unexpectedness of discomfort during the examination (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.19–2.81). Patients experienced discomfort most frequently owing to throat anesthesia (n = 50 [24%]). Conclusions Comfort during bronchoscopy is an important factor influencing patient tolerance for re-examination. Expectations of discomfort during bronchoscopy, as indicated by instructions provided before examination, and throat anesthesia are also important factors. Detailed explanations about bronchoscopy and improvement of the methods of throat anesthesia could decrease patient discomfort and may help decrease patients’ reluctance to undergo re-examinations."

This study aimed to determine the relationship between IDA and sexual satisfaction and function among reproductive-aged Iranian women. In this study, 129 women (52 with IDA and 77 non-IDA) with age 18–45 in Mahshahr, Iran were recruited. Data was gathered by a demographic questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and Larson Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using an independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square, and correlation coefficient test. The results of this study showed that the means of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), serum iron and ferritin were significantly lower in the IDA group than those in the non-IDA group (p<0.01). All dimensions of sexual function and satisfaction were significantly lower in women with IDA compared to the healthy women (p<0.001). Also, all blood indices for IDA had a significant relationship with all sexual function components and sexual satisfaction (p = 0.01) except for pain with Hb and ferritin. Health care providers should provide screening, education, and counseling about anemia and sexual function in reproductive age women."
https://openalex.org/W2902918401,"Clinicians commonly recommend increased hydration to patients with voice disorders. However, effects on clinical voice outcome measures have been inconsistent. Hydration-induced change within different layers of vocal fold tissue is currently unknown. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising method of noninvasively measuring water content in vocal folds. We sought to image and quantify changes in water content within vocal fold mucosa and thyroarytenoid muscle after dehydration and rehydration. Excised porcine larynges were imaged using proton density (PD) weighted MRI (1) at baseline and (2) after immersion in one of five hypertonic, isotonic, or hypotonic solutions or in dry air. Larynges dehydrated in hypertonic solutions or dry air were rehydrated and imaged a third time. Scans revealed fluid-rich vocal fold mucosa that was distinct from muscle at baseline. Baseline normalized signal intensity in mucosa and muscle varied by left vs. right vocal fold (p < 0.01) and by anterior, middle, or posterior location (p < 0.0001). Intensity changes in the middle third of vocal fold mucosa differed by solution after immersion (p < 0.01). Hypertonic solutions dehydrated the middle third of mucosa by over 30% (p < 0.001). No difference from baseline was found in anterior or posterior mucosa or in muscle after immersion. No association was found between intensity change in mucosa and muscle after immersion. After rehydration, intensity did not differ by solution in any tissue, and was not different from baseline, but post-rehydration intensity was correlated with post-immersion intensity in both mucosa and muscle (p < 0.05), suggesting that degree of change in vocal fold water content induced by hypertonic solutions ex vivo persists after rehydration. These results indicate that PD-MRI can be used to visualize large mammalian vocal fold tissue layers and to quantify changes in water content within vocal fold mucosa and thyroarytenoid muscle independently."

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of FC in Palestinian refugee preschool children and to determine if stress and trauma exposure are risk factors of FC in these children. Methods From November 2013 until May 2014, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in West Bank, Gaza and Jordan. Mothers of 862 Palestinian refugee children aged 7–48 months were interviewed on defecation pattern, socio-economic factors and the child’s exposure to traumatic events. Results Twelve percent of the Palestinian refugee children fulfilled the criteria for FC. The prevalence of constipation was significantly lower in Gaza compared to Jordan (2% vs. 17%, p <0,001). Living in Gaza was associated with lower odds of FC (OR 0,08, 95% CI 0,03–0,20). Trauma exposure was associated with higher odds of FC (OR 1,19, 95% CI 1,06–1,35), however only a small number of children had been exposed to traumatic events. Conclusion The overall prevalence of FC in Palestinian preschool children is comparable to prevalence rates among older children worldwide. In this age group stressful life events and trauma exposure seem not to play an important role in the development of FC."
https://openalex.org/W2904690680,"Serine proteases constitute the major protein content of mast cell secretory granules. Here we present the extended cleavage specificity of two such proteases from the golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Analysis by phage display technique showed that one of them (HAM1) is a classical chymase with a specificity similar to the human mast cell chymase. However, in contrast to the human chymase, it does not seem to have a particular preference for any of the three aromatic amino acids, Phe, Tyr and Trp, in the P1 position of substrates. HAM1 also efficiently cleaved after Leu similarly to human and many other mast cell chymases. We observed only a 3-fold lower cleavage activity on Leu compared to substrates with P1 aromatic amino acids. Chymotryptic enzymes seem to be characteristic for connective tissue mast cells in mammalian species from opossums to humans, which indicates a very central role of these enzymes in mast cell biology. HAM1 also seems to have the strongest preference for negatively charged amino acids in the P2´position of all mast cell chymases so far characterized. The second hamster chymase, HAM2, is an elastolytic in its activity, similarly to the α-chymases in rats and mice (rMCP-5 and mMCP-5, respectively). The presence of an α-chymase that developed elastase activity thereby seems to be a relatively early modification of the α-chymase within the rodent branch of the mammalian evolutionary tree."
https://openalex.org/W2903859144,"Self-care is important for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients’ disease prognosis, but there is a common phenomenon of self-regulation failure in T2DMs. In order to figure this problem out, the current study explored the interaction between self-regulation resource depletion and diabetes self-care based on the limited resource model of self-regulation. 104 patients were surveyed using the Self-Regulatory Fatigue Scale (SRF-S) and the Diabetes Self-care Scale (DSCS) in study 1. Study 2 recruited 30 T2DM patients and 30 healthy controls, and used a sequential-task paradigm to test the effect of self-regulation resource depletion on them. Participants in study 3 were 60 T2DM patients under different levels of self-regulation resource depletion manipulation, and their self-regulation performance was recorded and compared. Study 1 indicated that the correlation between self-regulation resource depletion and exercise and diet was significant and negative, suggesting that patients with greater self-regulation resource depletion performed poorly in exercise and diet. In Study 2, T2DM patients exhibited a poorer performance on the Spatial Incompatibility Task than the participants in the control group, suggesting that their self-regulation resource was insufficient. Study 3 indicated that there was no difference in Spatial Incompatibility Task performance, reaction time or error number among patients who were requested to complete a dietary record for one week and patients who were only requested to record eating times. This research demonstrated that low levels of diabetes self-care execution was associated with patients’ deficiency in self-regulatory resource, and self-care as a series of goal-directed behaviors consumed patients’ self-regulatory resources before these behaviors became a habit."

https://openalex.org/W2904637054,"Background Anterior temporal lobe hyperintensities detected by brain MRI are a recognized imaging hallmark of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Because similar findings may be present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the brain MRI in these two diseases is often misinterpreted. We compared the MRI findings between the two entities to examine whether they display distinctive characteristics. Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study reviewed medical records of patients with DM1 or CADASIL admitted to Asan Medical Center between September 1999 and September 2017. We compared the frequency and grades of white matter changes in specific spatial regions between the groups according to age-related white matter change scores. We also evaluated the presence of cerebral microbleeds. Results A total of 29 patients with DM1 and 68 with CADASIL who had undergone MRI were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of white matter hyperintensities was 20 (69%) and 66 (97%) in DM1 and CADASIL, respectively (p < 0.001), whereas the frequency of anterior temporal lobe hyperintensities was comparable between the groups (10 [34.5%] in DM1 vs. 35 [51.5%] in CADASIL, p = 0.125). The brain MRI of patients with DM1 revealed more limited involvement of the frontal, parieto-occipital, external capsule and basal ganglia regions compared with imaging in patients with CADASIL. Cerebral microbleeds were not observed in any case of DM1 but were present in 31 of 45 (68.9%) cases of CADASIL. Conclusions Anterior temporal lobe involvement in DM1 is not infrequent compared with CADASIL. However, because brain MRI in patients with DM1 lacks other distinctive features seen in CADASIL, imaging might assist in differentiating these two conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2905403518,"Successful T-dependent humoral responses require the production of antibody-secreting plasmablasts, as well as the formation of germinal centers which eventually form high-affinity B cell memory. The ability of B cells to differentiate into germinal center and plasma cells, as well as the ability to tailor responses to different pathogens, is driven by transcription factors. In T cells, the T-box transcription factors T-bet and Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulate effector and memory T cell differentiation, respectively. While T-bet has a critical role in regulating anti-viral B cell responses, a role for Eomes in B cells has yet to be described. We therefore investigated whether Eomes was required for B cell differentiation during either Th1 or Th2 cell-biased immune responses. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of Eomes specifically in B cells did not affect B cell differentiation in response to vaccination, as well as following viral or helminth infection. In contrast to its established role in CD8+ T cells, Eomes did not influence memory B cell differentiation. Finally, the use of an Eomes reporter mouse confirmed the lack of Eomes expression during immune responses. Thus, germinal center and plasma cell differentiation and the formation of isotype-switched memory B cells in response to infection are independent of Eomes expression."

The relation between the duration of gaze fixation on different parts of the person’s sad face (e.g., eyes, mouth) and theory of mind skills was examined. Eye tracking data indicated that before the actor experienced the negative event, toddlers divided their fixation equally between the actor’s happy face and other distracting objects, but looked longer at the face after the ball was stolen and she expressed sadness. The strongest predictor of increased focus on the sad face versus other elements of the scene was toddlers’ ability to predict others’ emotional reactions when outcomes fulfilled (happiness) or failed to fulfill (sadness) desires, whereas toddlers’ visual perspective-taking skills predicted their more specific focusing on the actor’s eyes and, for boys only, mouth. Furthermore, gender differences emerged in toddlers’ fixation on parts of the scene. Taken together, these findings suggest that top-down processes are involved in the scanning of emotional facial expressions in toddlers."
https://openalex.org/W2904574144,"Microbiome studies focused on ecologically relevant vertebrate models like reptiles have been limited. Because of their relatively small home range, fast maturation, and high fecundity, lizards are an excellent reptilian terrestrial indicator species. For this study we used the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, to assess the impact of military relevant contaminants on fecal microbiome composition. Fourteen day sub-acute exposures were conducted via oral gavage with 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and inorganic lead at doses of 60 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Body weights and food consumption were monitored and fecal samples were collected for high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analytical chemistry at days 0 and 15. At the end of the study, liver and gut were harvested for body burden data. Chemical analysis confirmed accumulation of TNT, TNT transformation products, and lead in liver tissue and fecal samples. Bacterial community analysis of fecal material revealed significant differences between day 0 and day 15 of TNT exposed anoles with an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) within the genus Erwinia representing 32% of the microbial community in TNT exposed anoles. Predictable changes in gut microbiome composition could offer an easily assayed, noninvasive biomarker for specific chemical exposure providing enhanced scientific support to risk assessments on military installations."
https://openalex.org/W2904873825,"This study was undertaken to evaluate a novel method for stabilizing and preserving the original proportion of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal blood for extended periods of time without using crosslinking agents, such as formaldehyde, which compromise DNA integrity and extraction efficiency. Blood was drawn from pregnant donors into K3EDTA and Blood Exo DNA ProTeck® (ProTeck) tubes. Blood drawn into both tubes were aliquoted and stored at three different temperatures. At indicated times sample aliquots were processed for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extraction. Plasma cfDNA and cffDNA quantified by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay which amplify RASSF1A gene promoter region. ProTeck reagent is formaldehyde free and inhibits blood cell metabolism in blood samples during storage. Cell-free DNA concentration increased over time in blood plasma stored in K3EDTA tubes at 4, 22 and 30°C. Blood stored in ProTeck tubes, cfDNA concentration was stable at 4, 22 and 30°C for 21, 28 and 7 days, respectively. In K3EDTA tubes cffDNA proportion decreases steadily over time whereas in ProTeck tubes cffDNA proportion remained stable. This novel technology stabilizes cffDNA proportion in maternal blood samples at 4, 22 and 30°C for 21, 28 and 7 days, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2904391079,"Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) is an oil-bearing plant used for biodiesel production. Construction of its standard karyotype and identification of the euchromatin/heterochromatin distribution associated with gene expression and meiotic recombination are essential to fully characterize its genome. Here, we developed a J. curcas karyotype based on meiotic pachytene chromosomes. In addition, a karyotype of J. integerrima, a useful species for jatropha breeding, was also constructed. Five out of eleven J. curcas chromosomes were metacentric, but only two were metacentric in J. integerrima. Almost all of the heterochromatin was distributed around the pericentric regions. The interstitial and distal regions were euchromatic without heterochromatic knobs, except for small heterochromatin regions associated with the subtelomeric repeat sequence JcSat1. These pericentric heterochromatin distribution patterns, together with chromosome structure data and the results of FISH probing with rDNA and JcSat1, allowed us to classify all chromosomes of both species. The two species had two 35S rDNA loci and one 5S rDNA locus; one 35S rDNA locus in J. integerrima was located on the interstitial region of the short arms. In addition, JcSat1 was found at only the heterochromatic ends of the J. curcas chromosome, not the J. integerrima chromosome. Despite the same chromosome number, the two pachytene chromosome-based karyotypes suggest variation in chromosome structure and distribution of repetitive DNAs in these two species."
https://openalex.org/W2903951058,"We were interested in how specific cultural value and adolescent social behavior would influence each other over time. Thus the present study explored the longitudinal and bidirectional relations between adolescents’ power distance value and prosocial behavior toward powerful people over a year. A sample of 434 Chinese adolescents participated in the investigation (initial mean age = 11.27; 54.15% females). The results based on cross-lagged models showed that, earlier prosocial behavior toward powerful people was positively correlated to subsequent power distance value, but not vice versa. The findings point toward an understanding of the important role of adolescent social behavior on his/her cultural value development, and also shed light on future research in terms of the interplay between cultural values and individual’s social behaviors in other cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2904871459,"Intracellular inclusions of aggregated tau appear in neurons and glial cells in a range of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Inhibition of pathological changes in tau is a therapeutic target for tauopathy. We recently synthesized a novel curcumin derivative, named Shiga-Y5, and showed that Shiga-Y5 inhibited cognitive impairment and amyloid deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Here we investigated whether Shiga-Y5 inhibited cognitive impairment and tau accumulation in a mouse model of tauopathy, rTg4510. The rTg4510 mouse is a bitransgenic mouse model that uses a system of responder and activator transgenes to express human four-repeat tau with the P301L mutation. This strain is obtained by crossing tetO-MAPT*P301L mouse line (on a FVB/NJ background) with CaMKII-tTA mouse line (on a C57BL/6J background). Male rTg4510 mice and wild-type mice were fed with a standard chow diet with or without Shiga-Y5 (500 ppm) for 4 months. Behavioral tests were conducted from 5.5 months of age, and the mice were sacrificed at 6 months of age. There were no significant changes in behavioral performance in rTg4510 mice fed with SY5-containing chow diet compared with rTg4510 mice fed with control chow diet. Histological and biochemical analyses also showed no significant alterations in tau accumulation by the treatment with SY5. One of noticeable finding in this study was that rTg4510 mice on a F1 female FVB/NJ x male C57BL/6J background showed more severe tau accumulation than rTg4510 mice on a F1 female C57BL/6J x male FVB/NJ background. Further studies to clarify the mechanisms underlying tau aggregation may help to develop therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing this pathological feature."
https://openalex.org/W2902381976,"To examine the possibility of diagnosing the double burden of malnutrition using estimated deviation values in low- and lower-middle-income countries.A modified version of the Japanese Diagnostic Tool was used. Data on 194 countries were analyzed, including data from the United Nations International Children's Fund, World Health Organization and World Bank. After conducting a Box-Cox transformation, deviation values were calculated. The degree to which the values deviated relative to a deviation cutoff value of 50 was assessed. Focusing on countries with low- and middle-income economic levels, we examined the utility of this tool to show characteristic nutritional problems in each country.The deviation values had normal, distorted, bimodal, or trimodal distributions. In the lower-middle-income countries, almost all countries had values ranging from 40 to 60 for education and water environments (urban and rural), and the differences were minimal. However, different causes of noncommunicable disease-related deaths were considered, and the primary cause appeared to be related to lifestyle factors, particularly alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking. In comparison, the deviation values related to death among low-income countries also appeared to be related to differences in education and sanitation in urban and rural areas.The study results can help to determine the status of nutritional inequalities and plan country-specific strategies to reduce the double burden of malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2903359527,"Mevalonate kinase (MK) is a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, which produces the biosynthetic precursors for steroids, including cholesterol, and isoprenoids, the largest class of natural products. Currently available crystal structures of MK from different organisms depict the enzyme in its unbound, substrate-bound, and inhibitor-bound forms; however, until now no structure has yet been determined of MK bound to its product, 5-phosphomevalonate. Here, we present crystal structures of mevalonate-bound and 5-phosphomevalonate-bound MK from Methanosarcina mazei (MmMK), a methanogenic archaeon. In contrast to the prior structure of a eukaryotic MK bound with mevalonate, we find a striking lack of direct interactions between this archaeal MK and its substrate. Further, these two MmMK structures join the prior structure of the apoenzyme to complete the first suite of structural snapshots that depict unbound, substrate-bound, and product-bound forms of the same MK. With this collection of structures, we now provide additional insight into the catalytic mechanism of this biologically essential enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2903776906,"Since multi-view data are available in many real-world clustering problems, multi-view clustering has received considerable attention in recent years. Most existing multi-view clustering methods learn consensus clustering results but do not make full use of the distinct knowledge in each view so that they cannot well guarantee the complementarity across different views. In this paper, we propose a Distinction based Consensus Spectral Clustering (DCSC), which not only learns a consensus result of clustering, but also explicitly captures the distinct variance of each view. It is by using the distinct variance of each view that DCSC can learn a clearer consensus clustering result. In order to optimize the introduced optimization problem effectively, we develop a block coordinate descent algorithm which is theoretically guaranteed to converge. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
https://openalex.org/W2905309535,"Objective In low resource settings, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) by allied health workers, has been suggested as an alternative for cervical cancer screening. However, there are concerns about the objectivity and time to diagnostic concordance with specialists. We evaluated the secular trend in interobserver agreement between nurse providers and a gynecologist/colposcopist over a five-year period. Methods Nurses provided VIA screening with digital cervivography to 4,961 participants in five screening clinics from October 2010 to May 2014 in Nigeria in this observational study. Cervigraphs were reviewed at meetings where a gynaecologist/colposcopist made an assessment from the cervigraphs. We used weighted kappa statistics to calculate agreement in diagnosis between nurse providers and the gynecologist/colposcopist; linear regression models to examine overall trend and investigate potential clinic characteristics that may influence agreement; and time series models to characterize month to month variations. Results Mean age of participants was 37±8 years. Overall agreement was 0.89 at Site D, 0.78 and 0.73 at Sites A and C respectively, 0.50 for Site E and 0.34 for Site C. The number of trainings attended by nurse providers(β = 0.47,95%CI:0.02–0.93, p = 0.04), high level of engagement by site gynecologists(β = 0.11,95%CI:0.01–0.21,p = 0.04) were associated with increased agreement; while increasing distance from the coordinating site(β = -0.47,95%CI:-0.92–0.02,p = 0.04) was associated with decreased agreement. There were no associations between number of years screening clinics were operational(β = 0.01,95%CI: -0.01–0.03,p = 0.29), cumulative experience of nurse providers(β = 0.04,95%CI:-0.03–0.12,p = 0.19) and agreement. There were no significant increases in weighted kappa statistics over time for all sites considered. Monthly variations were significant for only one of two sites considered in time series models (AR1 term = -0.40, 95%CI:-0.71–0.09,p = 0.01). Conclusion Our results showed a lack of objectivity, persistent variation and lack of convergence of diagnostic capabilities of nurse led VIA cervical cancer screening with the diagnostic capabilities of a specialist in a cervical cancer screening program in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2905458530,"NWC is an uncharacterised protein containing three strongly conserved domains not found in any other known protein. Previously, we reported that the NWC protein is detected in cells in the germinal layer in murine testes (strain: C57BL/6), and its knockout results in no obvious phenotype. We determined the NWC expression pattern during spermatogenesis, and found this protein in spermatocytes and round spermatids, but not in epididymal sperm. Although NWC knockout males are fertile, we further characterised their reproductive potential employing non-standard mating that better simulates the natural conditions by including sperm competition. Such an approach revealed that the sperm of knockout males fail to successfully compete with control sperm. After analysing selected characteristics of the male reproductive system, we found that NWC knockout sperm had a reduced ability to fertilize cumulus-intact eggs during IVF. This is the first report describing a subtle phenotype of NWC knockout mice that could be detected under non-standard mating conditions. Our results indicate that NWC plays an important role in spermatogenesis and its deficiency results in the production of functionally impaired sperm."
