https://openalex.org/W2025338188,"Background Histology is a key element for the multidisciplinary diagnosis of fibrotic diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (f-DPLD) when the clinical-radiological picture is nondiagnostic. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) have been shown to be useful for obtaining large and well-preserved biopsies of lung parenchyma, but experience with TBLC in f-DPLD is limited. Objectives To evaluate safety, feasibility and diagnostic yield of TBLC in f-DPLD. Method Prospective study of 69 cases of TBLC using flexible cryoprobe in the clinical-radiological setting of f-DPLD with nondiagnostic high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features. Results Safety: pneumothorax occurred in 19 patients (28%). One patient (1.4%) died of acute exacerbation. Feasibility: adequate cryobiopsies were obtained in 68 cases (99%). The median size of cryobiopsies was 43.11 mm2 (range, 11.94–76.25). Diagnostic yield: among adequate TBLC the pathologists were confident (“high confidence”) that histopathologic criteria sufficient to define a specific pattern in 52 patients (76%), including 36 of 47 with UIP (77%) and 9 nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (6 fibrosing and 3 cellular), 2 desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitis–interstitial lung disease, 1 organizing pneumonia, 1 eosinophilic pneumonia, 1 diffuse alveolar damage, 1 hypersensitivity pneumonitis and 1 follicular bronchiolitis. In 11 diagnoses of UIP the pathologists were less confident (“low confidence”). Agreement between pathologists in the detection of UIP was very good with a Kappa coefficient of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69–0.97). Using the current consensus guidelines for clinical-radiologic-pathologic correlation 32% (20/63) of cases were classified as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), 30% (19/63) as possible IPF, 25% (16/63) as other f-DPLDs and 13% (8/63) were unclassifiable. Conclusions TBLC in the diagnosis of f-DPLD appears safe and feasible. TBLC has a good diagnostic yield in the clinical-radiological setting of f-DPLD without diagnostic HRCT features of usual interstitial pneumonia. Future studies should consider TBLC as a potential alternative to SLBx in f-DPLD."
https://openalex.org/W1963898650,"Neuropathological studies, using a variety of techniques, have reported a decrease in Purkinje cell (PC) density in the cerebellum in autism. We have used a systematic sampling technique that significantly reduces experimenter bias and variance to estimate PC densities in the postmortem brains of eight clinically well-documented individuals with autism, and eight age- and gender-matched controls. Four cerebellar regions were analyzed: a sensorimotor area comprised of hemispheric lobules IV–VI, crus I & II of the posterior lobe, and lobule X of the flocculonodular lobe. Overall PC density was thus estimated using data from all three cerebellar lobes and was found to be lower in the cases with autism as compared to controls, an effect that was most prominent in crus I and II (p<0.05). Lobule X demonstrated a trend towards lower PC density in only the males with autism (p = 0.05). Brain weight, a correlate of tissue volume, was found to significantly contribute to the lower lobule X PC density observed in males with autism, but not to the finding of lower PC density in crus I & II. Therefore, lower crus I & II PC density in autism is more likely due to a lower number of PCs. The PC density in lobule X was found to correlate with the ADI-R measure of the patient's use of social eye contact (R2 = −0.75, p = 0.012). These findings support the hypothesis that abnormal PC density may contribute to selected clinical features of the autism phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2022277343,"Traditional breeding for high-yielding rice has been dependent on the widespread use of fertilizers and the cultivation of gibberellin (GA)-deficient semi-dwarf varieties. The use of semi-dwarf plants facilitates high grain yield since these varieties possess high levels of lodging resistance, and thus could support the high grain weight. Although this approach has been successful in increasing grain yield, it is desirable to further improve grain production and also to breed for high biomass. In this study, we re-examined the effect of GA on rice lodging resistance and biomass yield using several GA-deficient mutants (e.g. having defects in the biosynthesis or perception of GA), and high-GA producing line or mutant. GA-deficient mutants displayed improved bending-type lodging resistance due to their short stature; however they showed reduced breaking-type lodging resistance and reduced total biomass. In plants producing high amounts of GA, the bending-type lodging resistance was inferior to the original cultivars. The breaking-type lodging resistance was improved due to increased lignin accumulation and/or larger culm diameters. Further, these lines had an increase in total biomass weight. These results show that the use of rice cultivars producing high levels of GA would be a novel approach to create higher lodging resistance and biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2147625203,"Introduction Traditionally, assessment in axial Spondyloarthritis (aSpA) includes the evaluation of the capacity to execute tasks, conceptualized as physical function. The role of physical activity, defined as movement-related energy expenditure, is largely unknown and almost exclusively studied using patient-reported outcome measures. The aims of this observational cross-sectional study are to compare physical activity between patients with aSpA and healthy controls (HC) and to evaluate the contribution of disease activity to physical activity differences between groups. Methods Forty patients with aSpA were matched by age, gender, period of data acquisition in terms of days and season to 40 HC. Physical activity was measured during five consecutive days (three weekdays and two weekend days) using ambulatory monitoring (SenseWear Armband). Self-reported disease activity was measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). Differences in physical activity between patients with aSpA and HC were examined with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and a mixed linear model. Difference scores between patients and HC were correlated with disease activity. Results Average weekly physical activity level (Med(IQR); HC:1.54(1.41–1.73); aSpA:1.45(1.31–1.67),MET) and energy expenditure (HC:36.40(33.43–41.01); aSpA:34.55(31.08–39.41),MET.hrs/day) were significantly lower in patients with aSpA. Analyses across intensity levels revealed no significant differences between groups for inactivity and time spent at light or moderate physical activities. In contrast, weekly averages of vigorous (HC:4.02(1.20–12.60); aSpA:0.00(0.00–1.20),min/d), very vigorous physical activities (HC0.00(0.00–1.08); aSpA:0.00(0.00–0.00),mind/d) and moderate/(very)vigorous combined (HC2.41(1.62–3.48); aSpA:1.63(1.20–2.82),hrs/d) were significantly lower in patients with aSpA. Disease activity did not interact with differences in physical activity between patients with aSpA and HC, evidenced by non-significant and very low correlations (range: −0.06–0.17) between BASDAI and HC-aSpA patients' difference scores. Conclusions Patients with aSpA exhibit lower physical activity compared to HC and these differences are independent of self-reported disease activity. Further research on PA in patients with aSpA should be prioritized."

The formation of α-synuclein filaments can be reproduced in vitro by incubation of recombinant protein, but the filament growth is very slow and highly variable and so unsuitable for fast high throughput anti-aggregation drug screening. To overcome this obstacle we have investigated whether the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique, used for fast amplification of prion protein aggregates, could be adapted for growing α-synuclein aggregates and thus suitable for screening of drugs to affect α-synuclein aggregation for the treatment of the yet incurable α-synucleinopathies. Circular dichroism, electron microscopy, and native and SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to demonstrate α-synuclein aggregate formation by PMCA, and the strain imprint of the α-synuclein fibrils was studied by proteinase K digestion. We also demonstrated that α-synuclein fibrils are able to seed new α-synuclein PMCA reactions and to enter and aggregate in cells in culture. In particular, we have generated a line of “chronically infected” cells, which transmit α-synuclein aggregates even after multiple passages. To evaluate the sensitivity of the PMCA system as an α-synuclein anti-aggregating drug screening assay a panel of 10 drugs was tested. Anti-amyloid compounds proved efficient in inhibiting α-synuclein fibril formation induced by PMCA.

Our results show that α-synuclein PMCA is a fast and reproducible system that could be used as a high throughput screening method for finding new α-synuclein anti-aggregating compounds. α-Synucleinopathies are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of the abundant CNS protein α-synuclein that is expressed predominantly in nerve cells and is concentrated at presynaptic nerve terminals, where it plays a role in synaptic vesicle transport (1.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Del Tredici K. Braak H. 100 years of Lewy pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2013; 9: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Aggregated α-synuclein forms the neuronal inclusions of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (Lewy bodies and neurites) and the oligodendroglial inclusions of multiple system atrophy (glial cytoplasmic inclusions) (1.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Del Tredici K. Braak H. 100 years of Lewy pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2013; 9: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Evidence that α-synuclein aggregation causes these diseases has accumulated through a variety of neuropathological, biochemical, and genetic studies (2.Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.

In particular, dominantly inherited mutations and duplications and triplications of SNCA, the α-synuclein gene, cause familial forms of Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy (5.Houlden H. Singleton A.B. The genetics and neuropathology of Parkinson's disease.Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 124: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and α-synuclein has been identified as a risk factor for Parkinson disease in all genome-wide association studies done to date (6.Singleton A.B. Farrer M.J. Bonifati V. The genetics of Parkinson's disease: progress and therapeutic implications.Mov. Disord. 2013; 28: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Despite being a point of intense research, the critical question of how to prevent, stop, or revert the aggregation of α-synuclein remains unresolved. α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein with little ordered structure that binds to lipid membranes. It comprises seven repeats, in the positively charged amino-terminal region and the hydrophobic middle part, with the carboxyl-terminal region being negatively charged. Monomeric α-synuclein adopts an α-helical structure upon binding to lipid membranes containing acidic phospholipids. This conformation involves amino acids 1–98, with residues 99–140 being considered unstructured (7.Uversky V.N. Eliezer D. Biophysics of Parkinson's disease: structure and aggregation of α-synuclein.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2009; 10: 483-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In recent years, the mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation has been compared with that of the prion protein, whose misfolding causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (8.Prusiner S.B. Novel proteinaceous infectious particles cause scrapie.Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4096) Google Scholar). Common biochemical hallmarks are the propensity to aggregate, insolubility in mild detergents, and partial resistance to protease digestion (9.Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E.

BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli was transformed with human full-length α-synuclein in pRK172, and the protein was then purified as described (13.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Identification of two distinct synucleins from human brain.FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer, lysed 4 °C (with 25 kg/square inch using a cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd.) and centrifuged). α-Synuclein protein was purified from the lysate supernatant by anion exchange using HiTrap Capto adhere (GE Healthcare), (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration, and anion exchange using Mono Q GL (GE Healthcare). The pooled protein fractions collected from the purification steps were concentrated and solvent-exchanged using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters with 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore). Aliquots of protein were stored at −20 °C prior to use. A 10-μl aliquot was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for amino acid analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis, performed in-house (LMB-MRC, UK), and confirmed at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility, University of Cambridge, UK. PMCA was carried out by subjecting recombinant wild-type full-length human α-synuclein to repeated cycles of sonication and incubation. α-Synuclein was prepared as indicated (13.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Identification of two distinct synucleins from human brain.FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and diluted to a final 90 μm concentration in conversion buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science; in 1×PBS). For PMCA, 60-μl aliquots from 200 μl of the 90 μm reaction mixtures were transferred into 200-μl PCR tubes (Axygen) containing 37 ± 3 mg of 1.0-mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products), and samples were subjected to cycles of 20-s sonication and 30-min incubation at 37 °C, for different times depending on the experiment, using a Misonix 4000 sonicator at 70 power setting. All reactions were performed in triplicate. When drugs or seeds were used, 2 μl of concentrated drugs were added into 200 μl of the PMCA reaction mixture. Seeded reactions (for the study of substrate concentrations and the serial PMCA) were done by diluting 1:100 of 90 μm α-synuclein fibrils, previously generated by PMCA, into fresh soluble α-synuclein recombinant substrate. From each sample, 5 μl was added to 495 μl of ThT solution (20 μm ThT, 50 mm glycine in H2O, pH 8.5, with KOH). Fluorescence was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrophotometer LSS5 with 450-nm excitation and 480-nm emission settings. Conformational changes in α-synuclein PMCA samples were monitored using a CD spectrometer (Jasco J-810), taking an average of five scans at 100 nm/min over the spectral range of 190–260 nm. The samples, first tested for ThT fluorescence, were loaded into a 0.5-mm path length quartz cuvette (Hellma) and scanned in Peltier temperature-controlled unit (Jasco), at 20 °C. The CD spectrum of the buffer alone was also evaluated and found to produce negligible spectra. The relative increase in secondary structure, corresponding to α-synuclein aggregation, was determined based on the decrease in negative absorbance, with a peak ∼200 nm and subsequent simultaneous increases in negative absorbance with a peak ∼ 218 nm, consistent with a change of structure from disordered monomers to β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils. The morphology of α-synuclein aggregates in PMCA samples was examined by transmission electron microscopy using a Phillips model EM208S microscope operated at 80 keV. Three-μl aliquots of 24 h PMCA or 8-day incubated samples were placed directly on carbon-coated 400-mesh grids, briefly washed with ddH2O, and negatively stained with 1–2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid. Observations were made over a wide range of magnifications up to ×110,000 using a built-in CCD camera. Three-μl aliquots of α-synuclein PMCA or non-PMCA control samples were either mixed with 1 μl of 4× loading buffer (NuPAGE LDS®; Invitrogen) and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min (for SDS gels) or mixed with 1 μl of 4× native loading buffer (NativePAGE®; Invitrogen), and 3.5 μl of the mixture was loaded into 4–12% SDS (Bis-Tris)- or native gels (Invitrogen). Either low molecular mass standard (Bio-Rad) or SeeBlue Plus2 (Invitrogen) protein ladders were used as molecular mass markers for Bis-Tris gels, whereas NativeMark® unstained protein standards were used for native gels. In some cases gels were stained using only Coomassie Blue, whereas in other experiments proteins were transferred onto PVDF Immobilon membranes (Millipore), and α-synuclein was visualized by incubation with monoclonal or polyclonal anti-α-synuclein antibodies. Chemiluminescence was induced by ECL-Plus (Pierce) and recorded with the Alliance software (Uvitec Cambridge). Aliquots of 20 μl of α-synuclein PMCA samples or controls (non-PMCA) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 4 μl of 0, 15, 60, or 600 μg/ml PK (Roche Applied Science) in conversion buffer with a final concentration of 0, 2.5, 10, or 100 μg/ml PK. Enzymatic reactions were terminated by adding 6 μl of 4× loading buffer (NuPAGE LDS®) and heating for 10 min at 95 °C. Fifteen-μl samples were loaded onto 4–12% or 12% Bis-Tris gels, and SeeBlue Plus2 was used as molecular mass standard. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or electrotransferred for immunoblotting. Drugs were added to 90 μm α-synuclein fibrils, previously generated by PMCA in a final 50 μm concentration and incubated at 37 °C with agitation at 750 rpm for 30 min. Samples were cooled, and 5 μl was taken to determine the presence of α-synuclein fibrils using the ThT assay as described previously. Congo red, curcumin, quinacrine, resveratrol, lacmoid acid, tannic acid, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin (all Sigma) were diluted in DMSO at various concentrations and then diluted also in DMSO at 1 and 5 mm concentrations. Of these aliquots, 2 μl were added to 198 μl of PMCA reactions for final 10 and 50 μm concentrations. The anti-α-synuclein antibodies Syn1 (BD Biosciences), 5C2 (Novus Biologicals), Per7 (14.Jakes R.

The epitopes of the anti-α-synuclein antibody are: Per7, 1–120; 5C2, 61–95; LB509, 115–122; Per4, carboxyl-terminal; Syn1, 91–99. SH-SY5Y (5 × 105) cells stably overexpressing human full-length α-synuclein (15.Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. α-Synuclein metabolism and aggregation is linked to ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome.FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) were seeded with either sonicated α-synuclein PMCA fibrils or monomeric recombinant α-synuclein (used as control) at a 3 μg/ml concentration in the cell media. Confluent cells were split 4 days after infection, and in every following passage a cell aliquot was plated on glass coverslips and immunostained fluorescently to detect α-synuclein aggregates. Ten fields per sample were counted in three different experiments. In view of the propensity of α-synuclein to aggregate in vitro we set out to establish an α-synuclein PMCA to generate recombinant wild-type α-synuclein fibril assembly. The PMCA technique combines cycles of incubation at 37 °C (to grow fibrils) and sonication (to break fibrils into smaller growing fractions) of samples containing Triton X-100 for solubility, avoiding precipitation of the aggregates. We compared the kinetics of full-length α-synuclein fibril growth by PMCA with the traditional incubation/shaking method, over 8 days and at nine different time points. ThT 480-nm emission was used as the readout for fibril assembly (16.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Fluorometric determination of amyloid fibrils in vitro using the fluorescent dye, thioflavin T1.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 1A) show that PMCA induces a faster kinetic of filamentous aggregate formation compared with incubation and shaking. Fibril formation was detected following 6 h of PMCA with the maximal signal reached between 12 and 24 h following the beginning of the reaction. By the time α-synuclein fibrils were obtained by PMCA, and using the same concentration of recombinant protein, no fibrils were seen with the incubation/shaking method. With the latter method some ThT signal was observed after 4 days but with high variability. Furthermore, no ThT signal was present when PMCA was performed using β- instead of α-synuclein (Fig. 1B). After 24/48 h there was a decline in the PMCA-induced ThT signal. To clarify the reasons for this decrease the biochemical characteristics of the samples at 1 and 8 days following PMCA were studied by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting. The results showed that following 8 days of PMCA no monomeric α-synuclein was detectable, and all of the protein was concentrated in a high molecular mass smear (data not shown). It is likely that ThT does not have easy access to big aggregates, as those present in our system at this time point, and hence the reduced signal, although more work is needed to confirm this hypothesis. To explore the effect of seeding on the initial substrate concentration and time required for fibril formation, we investigated the kinetics of fibril formation of 30 and 90 μm (Fig. 1, C and D) recombinant α-synuclein substrates in the absence or presence of 0.9 μm α-synuclein fibrils in a 24-h PMCA or in a regular incubation reaction. When recombinant α-synuclein fibrils were added to the reaction at both concentrations, a small increase in the ThT signal was observed with the incubation method, whereas using PMCA fibrils formed as fast as 2 h, with the maximum level reached between 4 and 8 h (Fig. 1, C and D). The results of the 24-h 90 μm PMCA samples shown (Fig. 1, A, B, and D), have a ThT signal average of 210.3 ± 20.4 with a 9.7% standard deviation, exhibiting high reproducibility between experiments. The biochemical characteristics of the α-synuclein material generated by PMCA were investigated by several techniques to confirm aggregate formation. Circular dichroism (CD) was performed to compare the product of PMCA α-synuclein and non-PMCA control samples (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the spectra showed an increase in β-sheet content in α-synuclein PMCA samples compared with the non-PMCA-treated α-synuclein that remained mainly unfolded. Negative staining electron microscopy was performed on the samples. Fibrils of heterogeneous sizes were present in high amounts in the PMCA α-synuclein sample reaction whereas in the incubated sample filaments were less abundant and longer (Fig. 2B). Native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C) was also used to compare samples subjected or not to 24-h PMCA. Both Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting with specific α-synuclein antibodies showed that only after PMCA were large aggregates of α-synuclein present. The proteinase K resistance of recombinant α-synuclein PMCA samples compared with non-PMCA samples was then determined (Fig. 2D). Non-PMCA-treated protein was easily digested by 10 μg/ml PK whereas the α-synuclein PMCA sample was resistant to digestion up to 100 μg/ml PK. Immunoblotting of 2.5 μg/ml PK-digested samples with antibodies against five α-synuclein epitopes located in the amino-terminal, central, and carboxyl-terminal part of the protein was performed. The result suggested that the amino-terminal fragment of the protein was resistant to PK digestion (Fig. 2E). Finally the existence of “strain-like” modifications in the fibril formation by performing serial PMCAs was investigated, but the pattern of bands after PK digestion remained constant after eight passages (Fig. 2F). Our aim was to set up a rapid system for screening compounds affecting α-synuclein aggregation. We therefore investigated the effects on PMCA aggregation of α-synuclein of compounds previously described to affect amyloid aggregation differently. Congo red and curcumin were selected because their effect has been widely studied in prions and they have been also reported to interact with α-synuclein filamentous aggregates (17.Rudyk H.

We initially established that DMSO, used to dilute the drugs, did not affect α-synuclein PMCA, then we tested two different concentrations of each drug, 10 and 50 μm, to determine presence and potency of their inhibition in a 16-h PMCA reaction. The drug screening results (Fig. 3A) showed a great percentage of inhibition of ThT signal (70–90%) by Congo red and curcumin at both concentrations tested, lower inhibition (35–40%) with EGCG, tannic acid, and lacmoid, and no inhibition with the remaining drugs. To avoid artifacts, the results were confirmed by SDS-PAGE before and after PK digestion followed by Coomassie Blue staining. This revealed that also resveratrol (which has fluorescence emission in the presence of β-sheet structures that overlaps with the emission of ThT (25.Ahn J.S. Lee J.H. Kim J.H. Paik S.R.

Furthermore, we studied the disaggregating properties of the same battery of drugs in preformed PMCA α-synuclein fibrils. The same drugs that inhibited the aggregation of α-synuclein during PMCA (Fig. 3C) were also able to disaggregate preformed α-synuclein aggregates. To confirm the efficacy of the compounds selected by PMCA, we set up a cellular system from which to obtain α-synuclein aggregates. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with human full-length α-synuclein were exposed to α-synuclein PMCA material and then split on confluence (Fig. 4A). The presence of α-synuclein aggregates was investigated by immunofluorescence with anti-α-synuclein antibodies, and the result showed accumulation of α-synuclein for up to 10 divisions following the initial exposure to the aggregates (Fig. 4C). The percentage of cells with accumulated α-synuclein remained fairly constant at approximately 25% during the passages, and without further exposure, indicating that the cells were chronically infected (Fig. 4B). α-Synuclein is a critical protein in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases called α-synucleinopathies. Several missense mutations, duplications and triplications of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA) are associated with hereditary forms of Parkinson disease. Additionally, all sporadic Parkinson cases as well as those associated with α-synuclein mutations have aggregated α-synuclein in Lewy bodies. These aggregates are believed to be involved in toxicity and contribute to the loss of neuronal function (for review, see Ref. 30.Pienaar I.S. Burn D. Morris C. Dexter D.

Significance: Designing potential Aβ aggregation inhibitors will help fight Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease belongs to a class of pathologies, generically known as amyloidoses, whose common feature is the switching of endogenous proteins or peptides from their physiological soluble configuration to a pathological fibrillar insoluble state (1.Prusiner S.B. et al.Shattuck lecture.

The main proteinaceous component of amyloid deposition, detected in Alzheimer disease patient brains, is the so-called amyloid β peptide (Aβ), 2The abbreviations used are: Aβamyloid β peptideAPPamyloid precursor proteinBSBpβ-sheet breaker peptideTautaurineMDmolecular dynamicsThTthioflavin TESI-MSelectrospray ionization-MSFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. normally from 39 to 43 amino acids long, that is produced by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). amyloid β peptide amyloid precursor protein β-sheet breaker peptide taurine molecular dynamics thioflavin T electrospray ionization-MS N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl root mean square deviation. The Aβ self-association process that appears to be responsible for amyloidogenesis and highly toxic fibril formation is preceded by a conformational modification in which the peptide partially loses its random coil or α-helical native structure that is locally replaced by a β-sheet structure (3.Serpell L. et al.Alzheimer's amyloid fibrils.

The observation that short synthetic peptides called β-sheet breaker peptides (BSBps) are able to establish a direct interaction with soluble oligomers or amyloid aggregates, destabilizing the amyloidogenic conformer and thus precluding amyloid polymerization (6.Soto C. et al.Plaque busters. Strategies to inhibit amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease.Mol. Med.

Shen C.L. Kiessling L.L. Murphy R.M. et al.A strategy for designing inhibitors of β-amyloid toxicity.J. Biol.

The main idea driving these investigations is that fibril formation could be strongly suppressed if the residues belonging to the hydrophobic central region of the Aβ1–40 sequence could interact with short peptides (9.Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. et al.Substitutions of hydrophobic amino acids reduce the amyloidogenicity of Alzheimer's disease β A4 peptides.J. Mol.

These authors have studied the effect of Ac-LPFFD-NH2 (also known in the literature as iAβ5p) on the Aβ aggregation process. The Ac-LPFFD-NH2 (customized with N- and C-terminal protections) specifically differs from the 17–21 (LVFFA) Aβ1–40 fragment by having valine and alanine residues substituted by a proline and an aspartic acid residue, respectively. iAβ5p has been shown to possess a number of promising properties like the ability of crossing the blood-brain barrier and inhibiting (and disassembling) the formation of amyloid fibrils in vitro as well as in vivo. It has also been shown to prevent Aβ neurotoxicity in cell culture by blocking amyloid deposition and inducing dissolution of preformed plaques in amyloidosis rat brain models (11.Soto C. Kindy M.S.

Des. 2012; 79: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported new iAβ5p analogues with several chemical modifications introduced to improve BSBps activity and metabolic stability. In particular the taurine customized Tau-LPFFD-NH2 peptide turned out to better bind Aβ1–40 and to be more resistant to proteolysis. To gain some insight in the effectiveness of such chemical modifications, it is necessary to understand at an atomistic level the nature of the interaction between Aβ1–40 and different types of BSBps. With the purpose of establishing what determines the BSBp-specific chemical activity, we performed extensive classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on model systems where Aβ1–40 in water is in interaction with different BSBps, specifically Ac-LPFFD-NH2, Tau-LPFFD-NH2, and the newly proposed Ac-LPFFN-NH2. MD simulations represent a powerful tool in the study of many interesting biological systems as they provide a description of the system physicochemical properties in terms of microscopic degrees of freedom. In particular MD simulations (classical (16.Allen M. Tildesley D. Computer Simulations of Liquids. Clarendon Press, Oxford1987Google Scholar), density functional theory (DFT) (17.Hohenberg P.

Jansen K. La Penna G. Minicozzi V. Morante S. Rossi G.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9490-9495Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the case of the Aβ peptide, MD results have been employed not only to guide experiments but have also been instrumental in designing potential Aβ aggregation inhibitors (22.Novick P.A. Lopes D.H. Branson K.M. Esteras-Chopo A. Graef I.A. Bitan G. Pande V.S. et al.Design of β-amyloid aggregation inhibitors from a predicted structural motif.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 3002-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A key strategic feature of this work was to combine theoretical information from MD simulations with experimental results coming from a number of complementary techniques, such as thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, far UV circular dichroism (CD), and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). From this comparison it emerges that, among the three different kinds of BSBps we have studied and simulated, Ac-LPFFN-NH2 appears to be the most efficient BSBp in slowing down and possibly preventing Aβ1–40 aggregation. We regard this conclusion as an important result that encourages the use of MD simulations as a valuable tool for selecting potential lead compounds against fibril formation. We start by discussing the computational methods employed to perform classical MD simulations of systems made by one Aβ1–40 in water in interactions with different BSBps. In the next subsections we will describe the experimental techniques we have set up to check the results of the theoretical investigations. We have performed extensive classical MD simulations of four different model systems. Three of them are prepared by dissolving in water 1 Aβ1–40 and 10 copies of the 3 different BSBps we have considered, namely Ac-LPFFD-NH2 and two variants of it, one obtained by substituting the acetyl group with taurine (Tau-LPFFD-NH2) and the second by substituting the aspartic acid with an asparagine (Ac-LPFFN-NH2). For comparison, a fourth model system with Aβ1–40 in water in the absence of BSBps is simulated. We list in Table 1 the detailed chemical composition of the four systems we have studied with the nicknames we will be using all along the paper.TABLE 1Simulated systems: nicknames (left column); simulated systems composition (right column)System nameCompositionabetaAβ1–40 + 3 Na++ waterlpffdAβ1–40 + 10 Ac-LPFFD-NH2 + 3 Na++ watertaulpffdAβ1–40 + 10 Tau-LPFFD-NH2 + 3 Na++ waterlpffnAβ1–40 + 10 Ac-LPFFN-NH2 + 3 Na++ water Open table in a new tab The Aβ1–40 configuration that is used as a starting point in all the simulations is taken from the NMR structure of Crescenzi et al.

It displays 2 α-helix regions (residues from 8–25 and residues 28–38) linked by a turn region (residues 26–27). In each one of the three systems, the 10 copies of BSBps are initially inserted in an all-trans configuration. Their position and orientation are randomly chosen but are kept the same in the three systems. The simulation box is filled with a number of water molecules so as to have an ∼400 mm Aβ1–40 concentration. An appropriate number of Na+ counter-ions is also added to have globally neutral systems. Classical MD simulations are performed using the GROMACS package (24.Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. et al.GROMACS. A message-passing parallel molecular dynamics implementation.Comp.

Simulations are performed at neutral pH 3By “neutral pH” we mean that the protonation state of the peptide is chosen so as to have N terminus, arginine, and lysine protonated and positively charged and the C terminus, glutamic, and aspartic acid deprotonated and negatively charged. This choice corresponds to the expected protonation state of free amino acids at neutral pH. in the NpT-ensemble. The temperature is kept constant (and equal to 300 K) by using the v-rescale thermostat (30.Bussi G. Donadio D. Parrinello M. et al.Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling.J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126: 014101Crossref PubMed Scopus (9103) Google Scholar) with a 0.1-ps coupling time. Pressure is kept constant at 1 bar by using the Berendsen barostat (31.Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M.

Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23436) Google Scholar) with a 1-ps coupling time and an isothermal compressibility of 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1. The single point charge (SPC) model is used for water molecules. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed to the system, and the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm is employed in dealing with the long-range Coulomb interactions (32.Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. et al.Particle mesh Ewald. An Nlog(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20807) Google Scholar). The MD integration time step is 2 fs. A non-bond pair list (with a 1.4-nm cutoff) is updated every 10 steps. For each system in the study we collected trajectories as long as 80 ns. The simulation strategy we used, identical in all the four cases, is the following. First of all, each system was relaxed in a vacuum via a steepest descent minimization. Then, after the appropriate number of counter-ions and water molecules was added, the solvent was relaxed by a few steps (10 ps) of NVT MD at 200 K leaving the solute untouched. At this point the whole system, solute and solvent, was equilibrated as a whole for 50 ps in the NVT ensemble at 300 K, and the final 80-ns-long NpT MD simulation at 300 K was started. To eliminate from the analysis possible unphysical transients due to lack of equilibration, only the last 50 ns were employed to extract structural information on the simulated systems. The analysis of MD trajectories was carried out by using both standard GROMACS tools as well as some expressly designed homemade codes. Aβ1–40 was purchased from the PolyPeptide Laboratories France SAS. The Aβ17–21 and Aβ25–35 fragments are synthesized by conventional solid phase chemistry (33.Atherton E. Sheppard R. Solid Phase Synthesis. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar) starting from Fmoc-Ala- and Fmoc-Met-Wang resin (150- mmol scale, 250 mg), respectively. Ac-LPFFD-NH2, Ac-LPFFN-NH2, and Tau-LPFFD-NH2 peptides are synthesized on Rink amide resin (65-mmol scale, 100 mg). Fmoc-amino acids-OH (Fmoc-AA-OH), diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), and hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (3 eq, respectively) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone are used for couplings. The Fmoc-taurylsulfonyl chloride, required for the preparation of the Tau-containing derivative, was prepared according to Liskamp and co-workers (34.Brouwer A.J. Monnee M.C.F. Liskamp R.M.J. et al.An efficient synthesis of N-protected β-aminoethanesulfonyl chlorides. Versatile building blocks for the synthesis of oligopeptidosulfonamides.Synthesis. 2000; 11: 1579-1584Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and coupled to the resin-bound protected pentapeptide in dichloromethane in the presence of 4-methylmorpholine (7 eq). The coupling mixture was shaken overnight. After cleavage, the crude peptides were purified by reverse phase-HPLC on a Waters 600E liquid chromatography system by using a Waters Bondapac C-18 column (1.9 × 30 cm, 5 μm, 300 Å) for semi-preparative scale with elution at 8 ml/min by a linear gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 30 min. Peptide purity is >97% by analytical HPLC (Waters μ-Bondapack C-18 column, 0.39 × 30 cm, 5 μm, 300 Å). The peptides were characterized on a Q-TOF MICRO spectrometer (Micromass, now Waters, Manchester, UK) equipped with an ESI source, in the positive ion mode, and data were analyzed using the MassLynx software (Waters). In Table 2 we compared the theoretical expected numbers with the values of m/z for the [M+H]+molecular ions associated to the Aβ17–21, Aβ25–35, Ac-LPFFD-NH2, Tau-LPFFD-NH2, and Ac-LPFFN-NH2 peptides.TABLE 2m/z experimental and theoretical values of Aβ17–21, Aβ25–35, and BSBpsPeptide fragmentsMolecular formulam/z for [M+H]+TheoreticalObservedAβ17–21C32H45N5O6596.3448596.3497Aβ25–35C45H81N13O14S1060.58241060.5815Ac-LPFFD-NH2C35H46N6O8679.3455679.3429Tau-LPFFD-NH2C35H49N7O9S744.3391744.3379Ac-LPFFN-NH2C35H47N7O7678.3615678.3658 Open table in a new tab Aβ1–40 aggregation was studied using a ThT binding assay (35.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. et al.Fluorometric determination of amyloid fibrils in vitro using the fluorescent dye thioflavine T.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). ThT fluorescence intensity was followed continuously in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 B spectrofluorimeter thermostated at 293 K with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 450 and 484 nm, respectively. Fluorescence changes were monitored in a 1-ml cuvette under continuous stirring at 484 nm every 6 s with 5-s integration times over at least 3000 min. 1 mm ThT stock solution in water was prepared, aliquoted, and stored at 253 K. Before each experiment, an aliquot of ThT stock solution was thawed at 277 K shielded from light. A solution of 16.0 μm lyophilized Aβ1–40 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (1 ml final volume), alone or in the presence of a 12 m excess Ac-LPFFD-NH2 or Ac-LPFFN-NH2, was transferred to a 1-ml cuvette, and 10 μl of 1 mm ThT was added. Dead time for measurements of fluorescence changes did not exceed 12 s. In the absence of Aβ1–40, intensity at 484 nm of ThT alone was identical to that measured in the presence of any of the tested BSBps and did not change over 3000 min (data not shown). Far UV CD (190–250 nm) measurements were performed with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette thermostated at 293 K. The results are expressed in terms of the mean residue ellipticity [ϴ] assuming a mean residue weight of 110 daltons per amino acid residue. Ac-LPFFD-NH2 or Ac-LPFFN-NH2 were dissolved in ultra high quality water, lyophilized, and stored at 253 K. For far UV CD spectral measurements, each lyophilized compound was dissolved in ultra high quality water. Aliquots of lyophilized Aβ1–40 were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 16.0 μm final concentration in the absence or presence of a 12 m excess of BSBp, and the far UV CD spectral changes, occurring upon fibril formation, were monitored at 293 K at increasing times from 0 to 50 h. The far UV CD spectra of Ac-LPFFD-NH2 or Ac-LPFFN-NH2 monitored from 0 to 50 h did not show any change as a function of time. Far UV CD spectra of Aβ1–40 in the presence or in the absence of BSBps were analyzed by singular value decomposition (36.Henry E.R.

All the mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a Q-TOF MICRO spectrometer (Waters) equipped with an ESI source in the positive ion mode, adjusting the operating parameters as follows: rate of sample infusion into the mass spectrometer 20 μl/min, capillary voltage 2.8 kV, source temperature 353 K, source pressure 1.30 mbar, cone voltage 35 V, collision energy 10 eV. Full scan MS spectra were recorded in the m/z range between 800 and 2500, with 100 acquisitions per spectrum. Data were analyzed using the MassLynx software developed by Waters. Aβ1–40 spectra were obtained from samples dissolved in water at a 50 μm final concentration and pH 3.5. After the binding equilibrium was established, methanol (20% v/v) was added to the mixture just before injection to obtain a stable electrospray signal. The final volume of the sample was 200 μl. As a reference, a sample containing only Aβ1–40 was prepared. The spectra of the 17–21 and 25–35 fragments were also taken in the same conditions except that a neutral pH was used. To minimize statistical errors, each experiment was repeated at least three times under the same experimental conditions. To identify the specific Aβ1–40-BSBps structural features arising in the different physicochemical situations we have studied, we have found it useful to look at the evolution with the MD simulation time of a number of geometrical indicators and chemical properties. Detailed and direct information on the time evolution of the Aβ1–40 configuration can be extracted from the study of the root mean square displacement, r.m.s.d., evolution defined by the formula r.m.s.d(t)=[1N∑Ni=1N|ri(t)−ri(t0)|2]1/2Eq. 1 where N is the number of selected (see after) atoms of Aβ1–40, whose displacement with respect to the initial (t = t0) configuration we wish to compute. As a reference configuration we take the initial Protein Data Bank Aβ1–40 peptide structure, where the peptide is in a fully α-helix secondary structure. The coordinates {ri(t); i = 1, …, N} in Equation 1 were obtained after minimizing r.m.s.d.(t) over the rigid roto-translations of the current atomic configuration. r.m.s.d. was computed with the help of the g_rms (39.Maiorov V.N. Crippen G.M. et al.Size-independent comparison of protein three-dimensional structures.Proteins. 1995; 22: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) GROMACS tool. In Fig. 1 the time behavior (from 30 ns on) of the r.m.s.d. of the Aβ1–40 backbone atoms is displayed. For completeness, in the right panel of Fig. 1 we show the whole evolution where the transient phase is also visible. We note that Aβ1–40 in the lpffn system (green curve) shows the lowest values of r.m.s.d. This finding confirms that the Aβ1–40 backbone undergoes the smallest structural change when in the presence of Ac-LPFFN-NH2. It is interesting to note that around 50 ns the r.m.s.d. of Aβ1–40 in the abeta system suddenly jumps to a higher value that remains the highest till the end of our simulation. The r.m.s.d. jump occurs in coincidence with the appearance of a short β-sheet strand (see panel a of Fig. 2). Taken together, the two results suggest that the intramolecular β-sheet forms at the expense of a quite dramatic change of the global Aβ1–40 configuration. Such a change was not observed when, as shown in panels b and c of Fig. 2, an intermolecular β-sheet formed between Aβ1–40 and one of the BSBps in the lpffd and taulpffd systems or when an intermolecular β-sheet was formed between two BSBps, as happens in the case of the lpffn system (see panel d of Fig. 2). As will be confirmed under “Secondary Structure Analysis” below, this short β-sheet strand is located in front of the conserved 17–21 Aβ1–40α-helix segment. The residue mobility, σR, of each amino acid along the sequence can be computed from the formula, σR=[1T∑i1NR∑i|rj(t)−〈rj〉|2]1/2Eq. 2 where T is the time length of the MD trajectory (here the last 50 ns), {rj(t); i = 1, …, NR} are the positions of the NR atoms belonging to the residue R at time t, and 〈rj〉 is the average position of each residue atom along the trajectory. The residue mobility was computed making use of the g_rmsf GROMACS tool. In Fig. 3, σR was plotted agai"

It is unclear whether very young age at MS onset, when the nervous system is still myelinating, affects MS lesion accrual or regional distribution.To compare the frequency, volume and distribution of T2 and T1 lesions in children and adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Lesions were segmented on T2- and T1-weighted MRI images from 29 children and 29 adults with RRMS, matched for disease duration.All subjects exhibited T2-weighted brain lesions. Children had higher whole-brain T2-weighted-lesion-volume (T2LV) compared to adults (mean (SD) in cm(3): 12.76(2.7) vs. 10.03(3.4), p<0.0013). The supratentorial-T2LV was similar in children and adults (8.45(1.7) vs. 7.94(1.7), mean (SD), p = 0.2582), but adults were more likely to have supratentorial lesions (96.5% vs. 68.9%, p<0.012). Children were more likely to have infratentorial-T2-weighted lesions (75.9% vs. 43.4%, p<0.03), specifically in the brainstem (62.1% vs. 26.7%, p<0.019) and the pons (48.3% vs. 17.24%, p<0.024), had higher infratentorial-T2-weighted-lesion counts (4.1(5.6) vs. 1.45(2.3), p<0.021), a greater infratentorial-T2LV (4.31(2.7) vs. 2.08(2.4), p<0.0013), and a greater infratentorial-T1-weighted-lesion-volume (T1LV) (3.7(2.5) vs. 1.08(1.9), p<0.0007). Whole-brain-T1LV was higher in children (9.3(2.5) vs. 6.43(2.1), p>0.001). Adult MS patients had higher supratentorial-T1LV (5.5(0.92) vs. 6.41(2.1), mean (SD), p<0.034), whereas children were more likely to have infratentorial-T1-weighted lesions (58.6% vs. 23.3%, p<0.015).Onset of MS during childhood is associated with a higher volume of brain lesions in the first few years of disease relative to adults. Children with MS are more likely than adults to have T2 and T1 lesions in the infratentorial white matter, raising the possibility of preferential immune targeting of more mature myelin. Children with MS have a lower supratentorial T1 lesion burden, possibly reflecting more effective remyelination and repair in brain regions that are still engaged in active primary myelination."
https://openalex.org/W2089665647,"Species diversity in large herbivore communities is often explained by niche segregation allowed by differences in body mass and digestive morphophysiological features. Based on large number of gut samples in fall and winter, we analysed the temporal dynamics of diet composition, quality and interspecific overlap of 4 coexisting mountain herbivores. We tested whether the relative consumption of grass and browse differed among species of different rumen types (moose-type and intermediate-type), whether diet was of lower quality for the largest species, whether we could identify plant species which determined diet quality, and whether these plants, which could be “key-food-resources” were similar for all herbivores. Our analyses revealed that (1) body mass and rumen types were overall poor predictors of diet composition and quality, although the roe deer, a species with a moose-type rumen was confirmed as an “obligatory non grazer”, while red deer, the largest species, had the most lignified diet; (2) diet overlap among herbivores was well predicted by rumen type (high among species of intermediate types only), when measured over broad plant groups, (3) the relationship between diet composition and quality differed among herbivore species, and the actual plant species used during winter which determined the diet quality, was herbivore species-specific. Even if diets overlapped to a great extent, the species-specific relationships between diet composition and quality suggest that herbivores may select different plant species within similar plant group types, or different plant parts and that this, along with other behavioural mechanisms of ecological niche segregation, may contribute to the coexistence of large herbivores of relatively similar body mass, as observed in mountain ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2006884661,"This study aimed to evaluate the survival rate of women with breast cancer (BC) comparing persistence versus interruption and adherence versus non-adherence to adjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) in Asian population. Newly-diagnosed BC women from 2003 to 2010 were retrospectively identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. HT prescriptions were extracted to define treatment interruption and medication possession ratio. Their impacts on mortality were estimated by Cox regression with time dependent covariates. Interruption (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.46; P<0.0001) and non-adherence (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.32, 1.59; P<0.0001) to adjuvant HT were significantly associated with increased mortality. Interruption to tamoxifen in younger patients and in patients receiving surgery (OP) with adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) was associated with increasing mortality rate when compared with their counterparts. Non-adherence to AIs in both younger and senior age groups and in OP with CT group also resulted in increasing risk. Treatment interruption and non-adherence to adjuvant HT were found to be associated with the increasing all-cause mortality of the Asian BC women; a greater impact of interruption and non-adherence on mortality was especially found in the younger BC population."
https://openalex.org/W1990637089,"Cell migration plays a central role in the invasion and metastasis of tumors. As cells leave the primary tumor, they undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate as single cells. Epithelial tumor cells may also migrate in a highly directional manner as a collective group in some settings. We previously discovered that myoferlin (MYOF) is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and depletion of MYOF results in a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and reduced invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the biomechanical mechanisms governing cell motility during MYOF depletion are poorly understood. We first demonstrated that lentivirus-driven shRNA-induced MYOF loss in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA-231MYOF-KD) leads to an epithelial morphology compared to the mesenchymal morphology observed in control (MDA- 231LTVC) and wild-type cells. Knockdown of MYOF led to significant reductions in cell migration velocity and MDA- 231MYOF-KD cells migrated directionally and collectively, while MDA-231LTVC cells exhibited single cell migration. Decreased migration velocity and collective migration were accompanied by significant changes in cell mechanics. MDA-231MYOF-KD cells exhibited a 2-fold decrease in cell stiffness, a 2-fold increase in cell-substrate adhesion and a 1.5-fold decrease in traction force generation. In vivo studies demonstrated that when immunocompromised mice were implanted with MDA- 231MYOF-KD cells, tumors were smaller and demonstrated lower tumor burden. Moreover, MDA- 231MYOF-KD tumors were highly circularized and did not invade locally into the adventia in contrast to MDA- 231LTVC-injected animals. Thus MYOF loss is associated with a change in tumor formation in xenografts and leads to smaller, less invasive tumors. These data indicate that MYOF, a previously unrecognized protein in cancer, is involved in MDA-MB-231 cell migration and contributes to biomechanical alterations. Our results indicate that changes in biomechanical properties following loss of this protein may be an effective way to alter the invasive capacity of cancer cells."

The results showed that carboxyl groups and sulfate esters were presented in SNC after hydrolysis with H2SO4, while no sulfate esters were detected in SNC during HCl-hydrolysis. TEM results showed that, compared to H2SO4-hydrolyzed sample, a wider size distribution of SNC prepared by HCl-hydrolysis were observed. Zeta-potentials were −23.1 and −5.02 mV for H2SO4- and HCl-hydrolyzed SNC suspensions at pH 6.5, respectively. Nevertheless, the zeta-potential values decreased to −32.3 and −10.2 mV as the dispersion pH was adjusted to 10.6. After placed 48 h at pH 10.6, zeta-potential increased to −24.1 mV for H2SO4-hydrolyzed SNC, while no change was detected for HCl-hydrolyzed one. The higher zeta-potential and relative small particle distribution of SNC caused more stable suspensions compared to HCl-hydrolyzed sample."
https://openalex.org/W2010465116,"In natural populations, individuals may be infected with multiple distinct pathogens at a time. These pathogens may act independently or interact with each other and the host through various mechanisms, with resultant varying outcomes on host health and survival. To study effects of pathogens and their interactions on host survival, we followed 548 zebu cattle during their first year of life, determining their infection and clinical status every 5 weeks. Using a combination of clinical signs observed before death, laboratory diagnostic test results, gross-lesions on post-mortem examination, histo-pathology results and survival analysis statistical techniques, cause-specific aetiology for each death case were determined, and effect of co-infections in observed mortality patterns. East Coast fever (ECF) caused by protozoan parasite Theileria parva and haemonchosis were the most important diseases associated with calf mortality, together accounting for over half (52%) of all deaths due to infectious diseases. Co-infection with Trypanosoma species increased the hazard for ECF death by 6 times (1.4–25; 95% CI). In addition, the hazard for ECF death was increased in the presence of Strongyle eggs, and this was burden dependent. An increase by 1000 Strongyle eggs per gram of faeces count was associated with a 1.5 times (1.4–1.6; 95% CI) increase in the hazard for ECF mortality. Deaths due to haemonchosis were burden dependent, with a 70% increase in hazard for death for every increase in strongyle eggs per gram count of 1000. These findings have important implications for disease control strategies, suggesting a need to consider co-infections in epidemiological studies as opposed to single-pathogen focus, and benefits of an integrated approach to helminths and East Coast fever disease control."
https://openalex.org/W2027298878,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. VEEV infection is characterized by extensive inflammation and studies from other laboratories implicated an involvement of the NF-κB cascade in the in vivo pathology. Initial studies indicated that at early time points of VEEV infection, the NF-κB complex was activated in cells infected with the TC-83 strain of VEEV. One upstream kinase that contributes to the phosphorylation of p65 is the IKKβ component of the IKK complex. Our previous studies with Rift valley fever virus, which exhibited early activation of the NF-κB cascade in infected cells, had indicated that the IKKβ component underwent macromolecular reorganization to form a novel low molecular weight form unique to infected cells. This prompted us to investigate if the IKK complex undergoes a comparable macromolecular reorganization in VEEV infection. Size-fractionated VEEV infected cell extracts indicated a macromolecular reorganization of IKKβ in VEEV infected cells that resulted in formation of lower molecular weight complexes. Well-documented inhibitors of IKKβ function, BAY-11-7082, BAY-11-7085 and IKK2 compound IV, were employed to determine whether IKKβ function was required for the production of infectious progeny virus. A decrease in infectious viral particles and viral RNA copies was observed with inhibitor treatment in the attenuated and virulent strains of VEEV infection. In order to further validate the requirement of IKKβ for VEEV replication, we over-expressed IKKβ in cells and observed an increase in viral titers. In contrast, studies carried out using IKKβ(-/-) cells demonstrated a decrease in VEEV replication. In vivo studies demonstrated that inhibitor treatment of TC-83 infected mice increased their survival. Finally, proteomics studies have revealed that IKKβ may interact with the viral protein nsP3. In conclusion, our studies have revealed that the host IKKβ protein may be critically involved in VEEV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2006676191,"Pseudozyma antarctica is a non-pathogenic phyllosphere yeast known as an excellent producer of mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), multi-functional extracellular glycolipids, from vegetable oils. To clarify the genetic characteristics of P. antarctica, we analyzed the 18 Mb genome of P. antarctica T-34. On the basis of KOG analysis, the number of genes (219 genes) categorized into lipid transport and metabolism classification in P. antarctica was one and a half times larger than that of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (140 genes). The gene encoding an ATP/citrate lyase (ACL) related to acetyl-CoA synthesis conserved in oleaginous strains was found in P. antarctica genome: the single ACL gene possesses the four domains identical to that of the human gene, whereas the other oleaginous ascomycetous species have the two genes covering the four domains. P. antarctica genome exhibited a remarkable degree of synteny to U. maydis genome, however, the comparison of the gene expression profiles under the culture on the two carbon sources, glucose and soybean oil, by the DNA microarray method revealed that transcriptomes between the two species were significantly different. In P. antarctica, expression of the gene sets relating fatty acid metabolism were markedly up-regulated under the oily conditions compared with glucose. Additionally, MEL biosynthesis cluster of P. antarctica was highly expressed regardless of the carbon source as compared to U. maydis. These results strongly indicate that P. antarctica has an oleaginous nature which is relevant to its non-pathogenic and MEL-overproducing characteristics. The analysis and dataset contribute to stimulate the development of improved strains with customized properties for high yield production of functional bio-based materials."
https://openalex.org/W1986749685,"Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major obstacle in cancer therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the molecular mechanism and efficacy of honokiol in inducing apoptosis and enhancing paclitaxel chemotherapy in pre-clinical multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer models, including lineage-derived human MDR (KB-8-5, KB-C1, KB-V1) and their parental drug sensitive KB-3-1 cancer cell lines. In vitro analyses demonstrated that honokiol effectively inhibited proliferation in KB-3-1 cells and the MDR derivatives (IC50 ranging 3.35±0.13 µg/ml to 2.77±0.22 µg/ml), despite their significant differences in response to paclitaxel (IC50 ranging 1.66±0.09 ng/ml to 6560.9±439.52 ng/ml). Honokiol induced mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-mediated apoptosis in MDR KB cells, which was associated with inhibition of EGFR-STAT3 signaling and downregulation of STAT3 target genes. Combined treatment with honokiol and paclitaxel synergistically augmented cytotoxicity in MDR KB cells, compared with treatment with either agent alone in vitro. Importantly, the combined treatment significantly inhibited in vivo growth of KB-8-5 tumors in a subcutaneous model. Tumor tissues from the combination group displayed a significant inhibition of Ki-67 expression and an increase in TUNEL-positive cells compared with the control group. These results suggest that targeting multidrug resistance using honokiol in combination with chemotherapy drugs may provide novel therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2052882937,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by an abrupt decline in renal function, resulting in an inability to secrete waste products and maintain electrolyte and water balance, and is associated with high risks of morbidity and mortality. This study retrospectively analyzed clinical data, treatment, and prognosis of 271 hospitalized patients (172 males and 99 females) diagnosed with AKI from December, 2008 to December, 2011. In addition, this study explored the association between the cause of AKI and prognosis, severity and treatment of AKI. The severity of AKI was classified according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Renal recovery was defined as a decrease in a serum creatinine level to the normal value. Prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes accounted for 36.5% (99 patients), 46.5% (126 patients) and 17.0% (46 patients), respectively, of the incidence of AKI. Conservative, surgical, and renal replacement treatments were given to 180 (66.4%), 30 (11.1%) and 61 patients (22.5%), respectively. The overall recovery rate was 21.0%, and the mortality rate was 19.6%. Levels of Cl(-), Na(+) and carbon dioxide combining power decreased with increasing severity of AKI. Cause and treatment were significantly associated with AKI prognosis. Likewise, the severity of AKI was significantly associated with cause, treatment and prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that respiratory injury and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were associated with AKI patient death. Cause, treatment and AKIN stage are associated with the prognosis of AKI. Respiratory injury and MODS are prognostic factors for death of AKI patients."

The engineering requirements to minimise these threats results in an extremely heavy and cumbersome clothing ensemble that increases the internal heat generation of the wearer, while the clothing's thermal properties reduce heat dissipation. This study aimed to evaluate the heat strain encountered wearing EOD protective clothing in simulated environmental extremes across a range of differing work intensities. Eight healthy males [age 25 ± 6 years (mean ± sd), height 180 ± 7 cm, body mass 79 ± 9 kg, VO2max 57 ± 6 ml(.) kg(-1.)min(-1)] undertook nine trials while wearing an EOD9 suit (weighing 33.4 kg). The trials involved walking on a treadmill at 2.5, 4 and 5.5 km ⋅ h(-1) at each of the following environmental conditions, 21, 30 and 37 °C wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) in a randomised controlled crossover design. The trials were ceased if the participants' core temperature reached 39 °C, if heart rate exceeded 90% of maximum, if walking time reached 60 minutes or due to fatigue/nausea. Tolerance times ranged from 10-60 minutes and were significantly reduced in the higher walking speeds and environmental conditions. In a total of 15 trials (21%) participants completed 60 minutes of walking; however, this was predominantly at the slower walking speeds in the 21 °C WBGT environment. Of the remaining 57 trials, 50 were ceased, due to attainment of 90% maximal heart rate. These near maximal heart rates resulted in moderate-high levels of physiological strain in all trials, despite core temperature only reaching 39 °C in one of the 72 trials."
https://openalex.org/W2032021721,"Biological systems perform computations at multiple scales and they do so in a robust way. Engineering metaphors have often been used in order to provide a rationale for modeling cellular and molecular computing networks and as the basis for their synthetic design. However, a major constraint in this mapping between electronic and wet computational circuits is the wiring problem. Although wires are identical within electronic devices, they must be different when using synthetic biology designs. Moreover, in most cases the designed molecular systems cannot be reused for other functions. A new approximation allows us to simplify the problem by using synthetic cellular consortia where the output of the computation is distributed over multiple engineered cells. By evolving circuits in silico, we can obtain the minimal sets of Boolean units required to solve the given problem at the lowest cost using cellular consortia. Our analysis reveals that the basic set of logic units is typically non-standard. Among the most common units, the so called inverted IMPLIES (N-Implies) appears to be one of the most important elements along with the NOT and AND functions. Although NOR and NAND gates are widely used in electronics, evolved circuits based on combinations of these gates are rare, thus suggesting that the strategy of combining the same basic logic gates might be inappropriate in order to easily implement synthetic computational constructs. The implications for future synthetic designs, the general view of synthetic biology as a standard engineering domain, as well as potencial drawbacks are outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2037677271,"Background and aims Obesity and its associated cardiometabolic co-morbidities are increasing worldwide. Since thyroid hormone mimetics are capable of uncoupling the beneficial metabolic effects of thyroid hormones from their deleterious effects on heart, bone and muscle, this class of drug is considered as adjacent therapeutics to weight-lowering strategies. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of TRC150094, a thyroid hormone mimetic. Materials and Methods This 4-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in India and The Netherlands. Forty subjects were randomized at a 1∶1 ratio to receive either TRC150094 dosed at 50 mg or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) were performed before and after treatment. Results At baseline, subjects were characterized by markedly impaired hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. TRC150094 dosed 50 mg once daily was safe and well tolerated. Hepatic nor peripheral insulin sensitivity improved after TRC150094 treatment, expressed as the suppression of Endogenous Glucose Production from 59.5 to 62.1%; p = 0.477, and the rate of glucose disappearance from 28.8 to 26.4 µmol kg−1min−1, p = 0.185. TRC150094 administration did not result in differences in fasting plasma free fatty acids from 0.51 to 0.51 mmol/L, p = 0.887 or in insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis from 57 to 54%, p = 0.102. Also, intrahepatic triglyceride content was unaltered. Conclusion Collectively, these data show that, in contrast to the potent metabolic effects in experimental models, TRC150094 at a dose of 50 mg daily does not improve the metabolic homeostasis in subjects at an increased cardiometabolic risk. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether TRC150094 has beneficial effects in patients with more severe metabolic derangement, such as overt diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia.

Data of detailed analyses of so called ""post-and-core-systems"" with respect to morphological characteristics of the resin-dentin interface in combination with bond strength measurements of fiber posts luted with these materials are scarce. The present study aimed to analyze four different post-and-core-systems with two different adhesive approaches (self-etch and etch-and-rinse).Human anterior teeth (n = 80) were endodontically treated and post space preparations and post placement were performed using the following systems: Rebilda Post/Rebilda DC/Futurabond DC (Voco) (RB), Luxapost/Luxacore Z/Luxabond Prebond and Luxabond A+B (DMG) (LC), X Post/Core X Flow/XP Bond and Self Cure Activator (Dentsply DeTrey) (CX), FRC Postec/MultiCore Flow/AdheSE DC (Ivoclar Vivadent) (MC). Adhesive systems and core materials of 10 specimens per group were labeled using fluorescent dyes and resin-dentin interfaces were analyzed using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Bond strengths were evaluated using a push-out test. Data were analyzed using repeated measurement ANOVA and following post-hoc test.CLSM analyses revealed significant differences between groups with respect to the factors hybrid layer thickness (p<0.0005) and number of resin tags (p = 0.02; ANOVA). Bond strength was significantly affected by core material (p = 0.001), location inside the root canal (p<0.0005) and incorporation of fluorescent dyes (p = 0.036; ANOVA). CX [7.7 (4.4) MPa] demonstrated significantly lower bond strength compared to LC [14.2 (8.7) MPa] and RB [13.3 (3.7) MPa] (p<0.05; Tukey HSD) but did not differ significantly from MC [11.5 (3.5) MPa].It can be concluded that bond strengths inside the root canal were not affected by the adhesive approach of the post-and-core-system. All systems demonstrated homogenous hybrid layer formation and penetration into the dentinal tubules in spite of the complicating conditions for adhesion inside the root canal."
https://openalex.org/W2118110441,"Most breast cancers are estrogen receptor-positive and treated with antiestrogens, but aberrant signaling networks can induce drug resistance. One of these networks involves the scaffolding protein BCAR1/p130CAS, which regulates cell growth and migration/invasion. A less investigated scaffolding protein that also confers antiestrogen resistance is the SH2 domain-containing protein BCAR3. BCAR1 and BCAR3 bind tightly to each other through their C-terminal domains, thus potentially connecting their associated signaling networks. However, recent studies using BCAR1 and BCAR3 interaction mutants concluded that association between the two proteins is not critical for many of their interrelated activities regulating breast cancer malignancy. We report that these previously used BCAR mutations fail to cause adequate loss-of-function of the complex. By using structure-based BCAR1 and BCAR3 mutants that lack the ability to interact, we show that BCAR3-induced antiestrogen resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cells critically depends on its ability to bind BCAR1. Interaction with BCAR3 increases the levels of phosphorylated BCAR1, ultimately potentiating BCAR1-dependent antiestrogen resistance. Furthermore, antiestrogen resistance in cells overexpressing BCAR1/BCAR3 correlates with increased ERK1/2 activity. Inhibiting ERK1/2 through overexpression of the regulatory protein PEA15 negates the resistance, revealing a key role for ERK1/2 in BCAR1/BCAR3-induced antiestrogen resistance. Reverse-phase protein array data show that PEA15 levels in invasive breast cancers correlate with patient survival, suggesting that PEA15 can override ERK1/2 activation by BCAR1/BCAR3 and other upstream regulators. We further uncovered that the BCAR3-related NSP3 can also promote antiestrogen resistance. Thus, strategies to disrupt BCAR1-BCAR3/NSP3 complexes and associated signaling networks could ultimately lead to new breast cancer therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2143512492,"Reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks is an important task in functional genomics. Data obtained from experiments that perturb genes by knockouts or RNA interference contain useful information for addressing this reconstruction problem. However, such data can be limited in size and/or are expensive to acquire. On the other hand, observational data of the organism in steady state (e.g. wild-type) are more readily available, but their informational content is inadequate for the task at hand. We develop a computational approach to appropriately utilize both data sources for estimating a regulatory network. The proposed approach is based on a three-step algorithm to estimate the underlying directed but cyclic network, that uses as input both perturbation screens and steady state gene expression data. In the first step, the algorithm determines causal orderings of the genes that are consistent with the perturbation data, by combining an exhaustive search method with a fast heuristic that in turn couples a Monte Carlo technique with a fast search algorithm. In the second step, for each obtained causal ordering, a regulatory network is estimated using a penalized likelihood based method, while in the third step a consensus network is constructed from the highest scored ones. Extensive computational experiments show that the algorithm performs well in reconstructing the underlying network and clearly outperforms competing approaches that rely only on a single data source. Further, it is established that the algorithm produces a consistent estimate of the regulatory network."

In this context we performed a phase II, open label, multicenter, non-comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of repeated intra-lesional administrations of TG1042 (adenovirus-interferon-γ) in patients with relapsing primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL). Method Thirteen patients have been enrolled and received intralesional injections of TG1042 containing 5×1010 viral particles into up to six lesions simultaneously. Injections were performed on days 1, 8 and 15 of each of four consecutive 28 day cycles. Results Eleven (85%) out of 13 enrolled patients showed an objective response after injections of TG1042. Seven patients (54%) exhibited complete and four (31%) displayed partial response. The median time to disease progression in the study population was 23.5 months (range 6.25 to 26+). Most commonly observed adverse events were minor to moderate flu-like symptoms, fatigue and injection site reactions. Conclusions Our study showed that treatment with TG1042 was associated with a clinical benefit in the majority of the patients with relapsing CBCL, including tumor regression, a clinically meaningful duration of response and a good treatment tolerance.

https://openalex.org/W1964194799,"The Tudor warship the Mary Rose has reached an important transition point in her conservation. The 19 year long process of spraying with polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been completed (April 29th 2013) and the hull is air drying under tightly controlled conditions. Acidophilic bacteria capable of oxidising iron and sulfur have been previously identified and enriched from unpreserved timbers of the Mary Rose, demonstrating that biological pathways of iron and sulfur oxidization existed potentially in this wood, before preservation with PEG. This study was designed to establish if the recycled PEG spray system was a reservoir of microorganisms capable of iron and sulfur oxidization during preservation of the Mary Rose. Microbial enrichments derived from PEG impregnated biofilm collected from underneath the Mary Rose hull, were examined to better understand the processes of cycling of iron. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was utilised to demonstrate the biological contribution to production of sulfuric acid in the wood. Using molecular microbiological techniques to examine these enrichment cultures, PEG was found to mediate a shift in the microbial community from a co-culture of Stenotrophomonas and Brevunidimonas sp, to a co-culture of Stenotrophomonas and the iron oxidising Alicyclobacillus sp. Evidence is presented that PEG is not an inert substance in relation to the redox cycling of iron. This is the first demonstration that solutions of PEG used in the conservation of the Mary Rose are promoting the oxidation of ferrous iron in acidic solutions, in which spontaneous abiotic oxidation does not occur in water. Critically, these results suggest PEG mediated redox cycling of iron between valence states in solutions of 75% PEG 200 and 50% PEG 2000 (v/v) at pH 3.0, with serious implications for the future use of PEG as a conservation material of iron rich wooden archaeological artefacts."
https://openalex.org/W2052053516,"Evolution of Avian Influenza (AI) viruses--especially of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 subtype--is a major issue for the poultry industry. HPAI H5N1 epidemics are associated with huge economic losses and are sometimes connected to human morbidity and mortality. Vaccination (either as a preventive measure or as a means to control outbreaks) is an approach that splits the scientific community, due to the risk of it being a potential driving force in HPAI evolution through the selection of mutants able to escape vaccination-induced immunity. It is therefore essential to study how mutations are selected due to immune pressure. To this effect, we performed an in vitro selection of mutants from HPAI A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1), using immune pressure from homologous polyclonal sera. After 42 rounds of selection, we identified 5 amino acid substitutions in the Haemagglutinin (HA) protein, most of which were located in areas of antigenic importance and suspected to be prone to selection pressure. We report that most of the mutations took place early in the selection process. Finally, our antigenic cartography studies showed that the antigenic distance between the selected isolates and their parent strain increased with passage number."

We aimed to examine the association between serum bilirubin concentration (total, direct, and indirect) and the risk of incident CKD. Methods and Findings Longitudinal cohort study of 12,823 Korean male workers 30 to 59 years old without CKD or proteinuria at baseline participating in medical health checkup program in a large worksite. Study participants were followed for incident CKD from 2002 through 2011. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated by using the CKD-EPI equation. CKD was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Parametric Cox models and pooled logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for incident CKD. We observed 238 incident cases of CKD during 70,515.8 person-years of follow-up. In age-adjusted models, the hazard ratios for CKD comparing quartiles 2–4 vs. quartile 1 of serum direct bilirubin were 0.93 (95% CI 0.67–1.28), 0.88 (0.60–1.27) and 0.60 (0.42–0.88), respectively. In multivariable models, the adjusted hazard ratio for CKD comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of serum direct bilirubin levels was 0.60 (95% CI 0.41–0.87; P trend = 0.01). Neither serum total nor indirect bilirubin levels were significantly associated with the incidence of CKD. Conclusions Higher serum direct bilirubin levels were significantly associated with a lower risk of developing CKD, even adjusting for a variety of cardiometabolic parameters. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association and to establish the role of serum direct bilirubin as a marker for CKD risk."

Each year they cover several hundreds of thousands of kilometers during travels across the sea. Little is known about the dispersal flights and migration of young albatrosses. We tracked, by satellite telemetry, the departure dispersal of 13 juvenile wandering albatrosses from the Crozet Islands and compared them with tracks of 7 unrelated adults during the interbreeding season. We used the satellite tracks to identify different behavioural steps of the inherited migration program used by juvenile wandering albatrosses during their first solo-migration. Our results show that the juvenile wandering albatrosses from Crozet Islands moved to sex-specific foraging zones of the ocean using at departures selectively the wind. The results suggest that the inherited migration program used by the juvenile wandering albatrosses encode several distinct steps, based on inherited preferred departure routes, differences in migration distance between sexes, and selective use of winds. During long transportation flights the albatrosses were influenced by winds and both adult and juveniles followed approximate loxodrome (rhumbline) routes coinciding with the foraging zone and the specific latitudes of their destination areas. During the long segments of transportation flights across open seas the juveniles selected routes at more northerly latitudes than adults."

China used to be one of the major trading countries with significant bird trade with foreign countries; on the other hand, China is a country with unique avian fauna, many Important Bird Areas and critically endangered bird species. What is the role of the country in world wild bird trade? What kind of insights can we extract from trade records for improving future management of wild bird trade in the country? We retrieved and analyzed international trade records of the CITES listed bird species of China from 1981 to 2010 from the CITES Trade Database maintained by United Nations Environment Program and World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). We found that: (1) International trade of live birds in China peaked during the late 1990s, then decreased to the level before the surge of trade in a few years, the trade dynamics of wild birds may be affected by governmental policy and the outbreak of avian influenza during the period. (2) Most frequently traded CITES Appendix listed birds in China were parrots, most of which were exotic species to the country. (3) Birds were mainly traded for commercial purpose. Exotic birds in trade were mainly captive-bred while the most Chinese birds traded internationally were captured from the wild. Since many bird species in international trade are threatened to extinction, China should take stricter measures on importing of wild-captured birds and should collaborate with the countries of original in the international bird trade to avoid unsustainable harvesting of wild birds. It is urgent for China to carry out population surveys on those domestic bird species once in significant international trade and to make better conservation decisions based on population status of those birds. In addition, more scientific researchers should be encouraged to participate in the wildlife trade management to avoid misreporting trade data or biased analyses of the trade records."

Insecticidal knock-down was used to comprehensively sample spiders from 175 trees from 2001 to 2003 in the Białowieża forest and three remote forests in Poland. We identified 140 species from 9273 adult spiders. Spider communities were distinguished between deciduous and coniferous trees. The richest fauna was collected from Quercus where beta diversity was also highest. A tree-species-specific pattern was clearly observed for Alnus, Carpinus, Picea and Pinus trees and also for those tree species that were fogged in only four or three replicates, namely Betula and Populus. This hitherto unrecognised association was mainly due to the community composition of common species identified in a Dufrene-Legendre indicator species analysis. It was not caused by spatial or temporal autocorrelation. Explaining tree-species specificity for generalist predators like spiders is difficult and has to involve physical and ecological tree parameters like linkage with the abundance of prey species. However, neither did we find a consistent correlation of prey group abundances with spiders nor could differences in spider guild composition explain the observed pattern. Our results hint towards the importance of deterministic mechanisms structuring communities of generalist canopy spiders although the casual relationship is not yet understood."
https://openalex.org/W2046892900,"HCV NS3/4A protein is an attractive therapeutic target responsible for harboring serine protease and RNA helicase activities during the viral replication. Small molecules binding at the interface between the protease and helicase domains can stabilize the closed conformation of the protein and thus block the catalytic function of HCV NS3/4A protein via an allosteric regulation mechanism. But the detailed mechanism remains elusive. Here, we aimed to provide some insight into the inhibitor binding mode and allosteric regulation mechanism of HCV NS3/4A protein by using computational methods. Four simulation systems were investigated. They include: apo state of HCV NS3/4A protein, HCV NS3/4A protein in complex with an allosteric inhibitor and the truncated form of the above two systems. The molecular dynamics simulation results indicate HCV NS3/4A protein in complex with the allosteric inhibitor 4VA adopts a closed conformation (inactive state), while the truncated apo protein adopts an open conformation (active state). Further residue interaction network analysis suggests the communication of the domain-domain interface play an important role in the transition from closed to open conformation of HCV NS3/4A protein. However, the inhibitor stabilizes the closed conformation through interaction with several key residues from both the protease and helicase domains, including His57, Asp79, Asp81, Asp168, Met485, Cys525 and Asp527, which blocks the information communication between the functional domains interface. Finally, a dynamic model about the allosteric regulation and conformational changes of HCV NS3/4A protein was proposed and could provide fundamental insights into the allosteric mechanism of HCV NS3/4A protein function regulation and design of new potent inhibitors."

We hypothesized that the functional polymorphisms in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 may be associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in the Chinese population. This hospital-based case-control study included 664 PCa patients and 702 cancer-free controls. Nine SNPs in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were genotyped using the TaqMan assay. The genetic associations between the pathogenesis and progression of PCa were assessed by logistic regression. We found that the genotype and allele frequency distribution of rs6218, rs35767 and rs5742612 were significantly different when comparing PCa cases to controls (P = 0.005, 0.005 and 0.020, respectively). In the combined analysis, individuals with 2-6 risk alleles had an elevated risk of PCa compared to those with 0-1 risk alleles. We also found that the association between the combined risk alleles and the risk of PCa appeared stronger in the following subgroups: individuals older than 71 years of age (OR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.05-1.91, P = 0.020), nonsmokers (OR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.21-2.32, P = 0.002), nondrinkers (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.02-1.61, P = 0.002), and those with a negative family history of PCa (OR = 1.28, 95%CI = 1.02-1.71, P = 0.022). Our results indicate that the three SNPs (rs6218, rs35767 and rs5742612) and the joint genotypes with 2-6 risk alleles, may contribute to the susceptibility to PCa, but not the progression, in the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2011669118,"Andrographolides, the diterpene lactones, are major bioactive phytochemicals which could be found in different parts of the medicinal herb Andrographis paniculata. A number of such compounds namely andrographolide (AG), neoandrographolide (NAG), and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (DDAG) have already attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential therapeutic effects in hard-to-treat diseases such as cancers and HIV. Recently, they have also been considered as substrates for the discovery of novel pharmaceutical compounds. Nevertheless, there is still a huge gap in knowledge on the genetic pattern of the biosynthesis of these bioactive compounds. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the genetic mechanisms controlling the biosynthesis of these phytochemicals using a diallel analysis. The high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the three andrographolides in 210 F1 progenies confirmed that the biosynthesis of these andrographolides was considerably increased via intraspecific hybridization. The results revealed high, moderate and low heterosis for DDAG, AG and NAG, respectively. Furthermore, the preponderance of non-additive gene actions was affirmed in the enhancement of the three andrographolides contents. The consequence of this type of gene action was the occurrence of high broad-sense and low narrow-sense heritabilities for the above mentioned andrographolides. The prevalence of non-additive gene action suggests the suitability of heterosis breeding and hybrid seed production as a preferred option to produce new plant varieties with higher andrographolide contents using the wild accessions of A. paniculata. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the occurrence of population bottlenecks in the Malaysian accessions of A. paniculata was unveiled by observing a low level of additive genetic variance (VA) for all the andrographolides."

https://openalex.org/W1988843244,"Background The course of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection is influenced by a complex interplay between viral and host factors. HIV infection stimulates several proinflammatory genes, such as cyclooxigense-2 (COX-2), which leads to an increase in prostaglandin (PG) levels in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients. These genes play an indeterminate role in HIV replication and pathogenesis. The effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on HIV infection is quite controversial and even contradictory, so we sought to determine the role of PGE2 and the signal transduction pathways involved in HIV infection to elucidate possible new targets for antiretrovirals. Results Our results suggest that PGE2 post-infection treatment acts in the late stages of the viral cycle to reduce HIV replication. Interestingly, viral protein synthesis was not affected, but a loss of progeny virus production was observed. No modulation of CD4 CXCR4 and CCR5 receptor expression, cell proliferation, or activation after PGE2 treatment was detected. Moreover, PGE2 induced an increase in intracellular cAMP (cyclic AMP) levels through the EP2/EP4 receptors. PGE2 effects were mimicked by dbcAMP and by a specific Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP) agonist, 8-Cpt-cAMP. Treatment with PGE2 increased Rap1 activity, decreased RhoA activity and subsequently reduced the polymerization of actin by approximately 30% compared with untreated cells. In connection with this finding, polarized viral assembly platforms enriched in Gag were disrupted, altering HIV cell-to-cell transfer and the infectivity of new virions. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that PGE2, through Epac and Rap activation, alters the transport of newly synthesized HIV-1 components to the assembly site, reducing the release and infectivity of new cell-free virions and cell-to-cell HIV-1 transfer."

We sought to determine whether a 3-marker index would improve the classification of iron disorders in CKD anaemia. Methods We studied the association between Hb level and iron indexes combining 2 or 3 of the following markers: serum ferritin (<40 ng/mL), transferrin saturation (TSAT<20%) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC<50 µmol/L) in 1011 outpatients with non-dialysis CKD participating in the Nephrotest study. All had glomerular filtration rates measured (mGFR) by 51Cr-EDTA renal clearance; 199 also had hepcidin measures. Results The TSAT-TIBC-ferritin index explained Hb variation better than indexes combining TSAT-TIBC or ferritin-TSAT. It showed hypotransferrinaemia and non-inflammatory functional iron deficiency (ID) to be more common than either absolute or inflammatory ID: 20%, 19%, 6%, and 2%, respectively. Hb was lower in all abnormal, compared with normal, iron profiles, and decreased more when mGFR was below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (interaction p<0.0001). In patients with mGFR<30 mL/min/1.73 m2, the Hb decreases associated with hypotransferrinaemia, non-inflammatory functional ID, and absolute ID were 0.83±0.16 g/dL, 0.51±0.18 and 0.89±0.29, respectively. Compared with normal iron profiles, hepcidin was severely depressed in absolute ID but higher in hypotransferrinaemia. Conclusions The combined TSAT-TIBC-ferritin index identifies hypotransferrinaemia and non-inflammatory functional ID as the major mechanisms of iron disorders in CKD anaemia. Both disorders were associated with a greater decrease in Hb when mGFR was <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Taking these iron profiles into account may be useful in stratifying patients in clinical trials of CKD anaemia and might improve the management of iron therapy."

Patients who had extracapsular spreading of the lymph node metastases or positive resection margins or who refused to undergo PORT were excluded. The prescribed dose of PORT was 60-66 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was optional. Patient characteristics, treatment parameters and clinical outcome were recorded. The primary end point was overall survival, and the secondary endpoint was disease status.There were 138 eligible cases, and the median follow-up period was 35 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 56%. Univariate analysis revealed that pathologic T4 status (pT4), bone marrow invasion, and lymphatic invasion were significantly correlated with poor outcome (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that pT4, lymphatic invasion, and the no concurrent chemotherapy were independent poor prognostic factors (p<0.05). Fifty-four patients had tumor recurrence. The 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was 59%. Skin invasion, pT4, and bone marrow invasion were correlated with poor prognosis in the univariate analysis (p<0.05). Only pT4 (p<0.01) and no concurrent chemotherapy (p = 0.03) were independently correlated with poor recurrence-free survival.For OSCC patients with multiple-node metastases without extracapsular spreading or positive resection margins, PORT without concurrent chemotherapy correlated to inferior outcome. Multiple lymph node metastases might be considered an indication for concurrent chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2321907658,"For forty-three clinical test values presumably associated to common complex human diseases, we carried out a genome-wide association study using 600K SNPs in a general Japanese population of 1,639 individuals (1,252 after quality control procedures) drawn from a regional cohort, followed by a replication study for statistically significant SNPs (p = 1.95 × 10(-9)-8.34 × 10(-39)) using an independent population of 1,671 from another cohort. In this single two-stage study, we newly found strong and robust associations of common variants at the ABO histo-blood glycosyltransferase locus in 9q32 with the plasma levels of pancreatic lipase (P-LIP), in addition to successful confirmation of the known ABO association of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) independent of the ACE1 gene in 17q23.2 with the ACE level. Our results are compatible with the previously reported association between the ABO gene and pancreatic cancer, and show that the effect of these common variants at the ABO locus on the P-LIP and ACE levels is largely opposing and pleiotropic."
https://openalex.org/W2070235200,"A new peptide precursor, termed Sj7170, was characterized from the venomous gland cDNA library of the scorpion Scorpiops jendeki. Sj7170 was deduced to be a 62-amino acid peptide cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. The recombinant Sj7170 peptide (rSj7170) with chromatographic purity was produced by a prokaryotic expression system. Enzyme inhibition assay in vitro and in vivo showed that rSj7170 specifically inhibited the activity of α-chymotrypsin at micromole concentrations. In addition, Sj7170 not only promoted cell proliferation and colony formation by up-regulating the expression of cyclin D1 in vitro but also enhanced tumor growth in nude mice. Finally, Sj7170 accelerated cellular migration and invasion by increasing the expression of the transcription factor Snail and then inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, Sj7170 changed cell morphology and cytoskeleton of U87 cells by the GTPase pathway. Taken together, Sj7170 is a unique dual-function peptide, i.e. a specific α-chymotrypsin inhibitor and a potent tumorigenesis/metastasis activator. Our work not only opens an avenue of developing new modulators of tumorigenesis/metastasis from serine protease inhibitors but also strengthens the functional link between protease inhibitors and tumor activators.

https://openalex.org/W1981723504,"Background Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) is an endemic neurological disease in Northeast Siberia and generally considered to be a chronic encephalomyelitis of unknown origin actually spreading in the Sakha (Yakutian) Republic. Methodology and Principle Findings In search for the pathophysiology and causative agent of VE, we performed a cross-sectional study on clinical, serological and neuroimaging data on chronic VE patients during two medical expeditions to three villages within the Viliuiski river basin in the Republic of Sakha in 2000 and to the capital Yakutsk in 2006. The severity of the core clinical picture with predominant sensory ataxia, gait apraxia, lower limb spasticity, cognitive impairment and bladder dysfunction correlated with the degree of MRI findings showing enlargement of inner ventricular spaces as in communicating hydrocephalus. Laboratory studies revealed transient eosinophilia during the preceding acute meningitis-like phase, but no ongoing inflammatory process in the CSF. We found immune reactions against Toxocara canis in the majority of chronic VE patients but rarely in controls (P = 0.025; Fisher's exact test). Histological analysis of subacute to subchronic VE brain samples showed eosinophilic infiltrations with no signs of persistent Toxocara canis infection. Conclusions and Significance Our data showed that pressure by the communicating hydrocephalus as a mechanical factor is the major pathogenic mechanism in chronic VE, most likely triggered by eosinophilic meningitis. There are no signs for an ongoing inflammatory process in chronic VE. The past eosinophilic reaction in VE might be caused by Toxocara ssp. infection and might therefore represent the first hint for an initial cause leading to the development of chronic VE. Our data provide a framework for future studies and potential therapeutic interventions for this enigmatic epidemic neurological disease potentially spreading in Sakha Republic."
https://openalex.org/W2071471239,"The folding of linear polymers into discrete three-dimensional structures is often required for biological function. The formation of long-lived intermediates is a hallmark of the folding of large RNA molecules due to the ruggedness of their energy landscapes. The precise thermodynamic nature of the barriers (whether enthalpic or entropic) that leads to intermediate formation is still poorly characterized in large structured RNA molecules. A classic approach to analyzing kinetic barriers are temperature dependent studies analyzed with Eyring's transition state theory. We applied Eyring's theory to time-resolved hydroxyl radical (•OH) footprinting kinetics progress curves collected at eight temperature from 21.5°C to 51°C to characterize the thermodynamic nature of folding intermediate formation for the Mg2+-mediated folding of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I ribozyme. A common kinetic model configuration describes this RNA folding reaction over the entire temperature range studied consisting of primary (fast) transitions to misfolded intermediates followed by much slower secondary transitions, consistent with previous studies. Eyring analysis reveals that the primary transitions are moderate in magnitude and primarily enthalpic in nature. In contrast, the secondary transitions are daunting in magnitude and entropic in nature. The entropic character of the secondary transitions is consistent with structural rearrangement of the intermediate species to the final folded form. This segregation of kinetic control reveals distinctly different molecular mechanisms during the two stages of RNA folding and documents the importance of entropic barriers to defining rugged RNA folding landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2092474420,"We develop a method for systematically constructing Lagrangian functions for dissipative mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical systems. We derive the equations of motion for some typical electromechanical systems using deterministic principles that are strictly variational. We do not use any ad hoc features that are added on after the analysis has been completed, such as the Rayleigh dissipation function. We generalise the concept of potential, and define generalised potentials for dissipative lumped system elements. Our innovation offers a unified approach to the analysis of electromechanical systems where there are energy and power terms in both the mechanical and electrical parts of the system. Using our novel technique, we can take advantage of the analytic approach from mechanics, and we can apply these powerful analytical methods to electrical and to electromechanical systems. We can analyse systems that include non-conservative forces. Our methodology is deterministic, and does does require any special intuition, and is thus suitable for automation via a computer-based algebra package."
https://openalex.org/W2029033830,"The transport of calcium to the extracellular space carried out by plasma membrane Ca(2+) pumps (PMCAs) is essential for maintaining low Ca(2+) concentrations in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. The activity of PMCAs is controlled by autoinhibition. Autoinhibition is relieved by the binding of Ca(2+)-calmodulin to the calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory sequence, which in the human PMCA is located in the C-terminal segment and results in a PMCA of high maximal velocity of transport and high affinity for Ca(2+). Autoinhibition involves the intramolecular interaction between the autoinhibitory domain and a not well defined region of the molecule near the catalytic site. Here we show that the fusion of GFP to the C terminus of the h4xb PMCA causes partial loss of autoinhibition by specifically increasing the Vmax. Mutation of residue Glu(99) to Lys in the cytosolic portion of the M1 transmembrane helix at the other end of the molecule brought the Vmax of the h4xb PMCA to near that of the calmodulin-activated enzyme without increasing the apparent affinity for Ca(2+). Altogether, the results suggest that the autoinhibitory interaction of the extreme C-terminal segment of the h4 PMCA is disturbed by changes of negatively charged residues of the N-terminal region. This would be consistent with a recently proposed model of an autoinhibited form of the plant ACA8 pump, although some differences are noted."
https://openalex.org/W2037892251,"Purpose To establish if a positive impingement sign in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) may result from entrapment of the fat pad located at the anterior head-neck junction of the upper femur. This fat pad is routinely removed before any cam lesion excision. Methods We report a prospective study of 142 consecutive hip arthroscopies for symptomatic FAI where the aim was to remove the arthroscopically identified area of impingement, not necessarily to create a spherical femoral head. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 92; 34 females, 58 males), where a cam-type bony FAI lesion was identified and excised in addition to the fat pad which overlay it, and Group 2 (n = 50; 29 females, 21 males) where the only identified point of impingement was a prominent fat pad. In this situation the fat pad was excised in isolation and the underlying bone preserved. Patients were assessed preoperatively, at six weeks, six months, one year and two years with a modified Harris hip score (mHHS). Results Both groups were comparable preoperatively for mean age, mean alpha angle and mean anterior offset ratio. Both groups improved significantly after surgery at all time points. However, Group 1 (fat pad and bone resection) demonstrated 16.0% improvement in mHHS by two years while for Group 2 (fat pad resection only) the improvement was 18.9% (p = 0.628). Conclusions The fat pad found at the anterior head/neck junction of the hip joint can be a source of pain and we propose fat pad entrapment as a new, previously undescribed diagnosis. Our findings also suggest that a large number of cam lesions are being excised unnecessarily and that further efforts should be made to understand the role of the fat pad as a source of groin discomfort.

https://openalex.org/W2050839463,"Small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) represent highly aggressive tumors with an overall five-year survival rate in the range of 5 to 10%. Here, we show that four out of five SCLC cell lines reversibly develop a neuron-like phenotype on extracellular matrix constituents such as fibronectin, laminin or thrombospondin upon staurosporine treatment in an RGD/integrin-mediated manner. Neurite-like processes extend rapidly with an average speed of 10 µm per hour. Depending on the cell line, staurosporine treatment affects either cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase or induction of polyploidy. Neuron-like conversion, although not accompanied by alterations in the expression pattern of a panel of neuroendocrine genes, leads to changes in protein expression as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. It is likely that SCLC cells already harbour the complete molecular repertoire to convert into a neuron-like phenotype. More extensive studies are needed to evaluate whether the conversion potential of SCLC cells is suitable for therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2088730989,"The World Health Organization recommends anthelminthic treatment for pregnant women after the first trimester in soil-transmitted helminth (STH) endemic regions to prevent adverse maternal-fetal consequences. Although studies have shown the high prevalence of infection in the Philippines, no research has evaluated deworming practices. We hypothesized that pregnant women are not receiving deworming treatment and we aimed to identify barriers to World Health Organization guideline implementation. We conducted key informant interviews with local Department of Health (DOH) administrators, focus group discussions with nurses, midwives, and health care workers, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys with women of reproductive age to elicit perspectives about deworming during pregnancy. Key informant interviews revealed that healthcare workers were not deworming pregnant women due to inadequate drug supply, infrastructure and personnel as well as fear of teratogenicity. Focus group discussions showed that healthcare workers similarly had not implemented guidelines due to infrastructure challenges and concerns for fetal malformations. The majority of local women believed that STH treatment causes side effects (74.8%) as well as maternal harm (67.3%) and fetal harm (77.9%). Women who were willing to take anthelminthics while pregnant had significantly greater knowledge as demonstrated by higher Treatment Scores (mean rank 146.92 versus 103.1, z = -4.40, p<0.001) and higher Birth Defect Scores (mean rank 128.09 versus 108.65, z = -2.43, p = 0.015). This study concludes that World Health Organization guidelines are not being implemented in the Philippines. Infrastructure, specific protocols, and education for providers and patients regarding anthelminthic treatment are necessary for the successful prevention of STH morbidity and mortality among pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2158853388,"Previous studies demonstrate that soluble HIV proteins impact both hepatocyte function and HCV replication in vitro. It has also been reported that HIV can productively infect hepatocytes. We therefore investigated the impact of HIV infection of hepatocytes on HCV expression. The Huh7.5JFH1 cell line that constitutively expresses infectious HCV was infected with the lab-adapted strains HIVNL4-3 or HIVYK-JRCSF. HCV expression was quantified via HCV core antigen ELISA, Western blot, and strand-specific real-time PCR for positive-sense and negative-sense HCV RNA. After HIVNL4-3 infection of Huh7.5JFH1 cells, positive-sense and negative-sense HCV RNA levels were elevated compared to HIV uninfected cells. Increased HCV RNA synthesis was also observed after infection of Huh7.5JFH1 cells with HIVYK-JRCSF. HIV-induced HCV core production was decreased in the presence of the anti-HIV drugs AZT, T20, and raltegravir, although these medications had a minimal effect on HCV expression in the absence of HIV. HCV core, NS3, and NS5A protein expression were increased after HIV infection of Huh7.5JFH1 cells. Chemically inactivated HIV had a minimal effect on HCV expression in Huh7.5JFH1 cells suggesting that ongoing viral replication was critical. These data demonstrate that HIV induces HCV RNA synthesis and protein production in vitro and complement previous in vivo reports that HCV RNA levels are elevated in individuals with HIV/HCV co-infection compared to those with HCV mono-infection. These findings suggest that HIV suppression may be a critical factor in controlling liver disease, particularly if the underlying liver disease is not treated."
https://openalex.org/W1988369917,"High-frequency return, trading volume and transaction number are digitally coded via a nonparametric computing algorithm, called hierarchical factor segmentation (HFS), and then are coupled together to reveal a single stock dynamics without global state-space structural assumptions. The base-8 digital coding sequence, which is capable of revealing contrasting aggregation against sparsity of extreme events, is further compressed into a shortened sequence of state transitions. This compressed digital code sequence vividly demonstrates that the aggregation of large absolute returns is the primary driving force for stimulating both the aggregations of large trading volumes and transaction numbers. The state of system-wise synchrony is manifested with very frequent recurrence in the stock dynamics. And this data-driven dynamic mechanism is seen to correspondingly vary as the global market transiting in and out of contraction-expansion cycles. These results not only elaborate the stock dynamics of interest to a fuller extent, but also contradict some classical theories in finance. Overall this version of stock dynamics is potentially more coherent and realistic, especially when the current financial market is increasingly powered by high-frequency trading via computer algorithms, rather than by individual investors."
