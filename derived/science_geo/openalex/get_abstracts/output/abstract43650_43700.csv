https://openalex.org/W2005914718,"A 30 amino acid peptide (referred to as tau 2) that functions as an activation domain has been localized in the carboxyl terminus of the human glucocorticoid receptor. This sequence, when fused to yeast GAL4 as part of the ligand binding domain, generates a hormone-inducible activator. Tau 2 functions in a position-independent fashion and leads to a progressive gain of function when multimerized. A similar and independent activity has also been identified in the amino terminus of the receptor. These two sequences, although structurally unrelated, are both acidic in character and thus may have certain properties in common with yeast activator sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1982326391,"The cellular cues that guide neuronal growth cones toward their targets are highly conserved in such diverse organisms as insects and vertebrates. Evidence presented here suggests that the molecular mechanisms underlying these events may be equally conserved. This article describes the structure and function of fasciclin II, a glycoprotein expressed on a subset of fasciculating axons in the grasshopper embryo. Antibody perturbation experiments suggest that fasciclin II functions in mediating one form of neuronal recognition: selective fasciculation. Fasciclin II is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and is homologous in structure and function to the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM and to several other vertebrate cell adhesion molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1559768539,"Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that mitochondrial bound hexokinase is markedly elevated in highly glycolytic hepatoma cells (Parry, D. M., and Pedersen, P.L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10904-10912). A pore-forming protein, porin, within the outer membrane appears to comprise at least part of the receptor site (Nakashima, R.A., Mangan, P.S., Colombini, M., and Pedersen, P.L. (1986). Biochemistry 25, 1015-1021). In studies reported here experiments were carried out to assess the functional significance of mitochondrial bound tumor hexokinase. Two approaches were used to determine whether the bound enzyme has preferred access to mitochondrially generated ATP relative to cytosolic ATP. The first approach compared the time course of glucose 6-phosphate formation by AS-30D hepatoma mitochondria under conditions where ATP was regenerated endogenously via oxidative phosphorylation or exogenously by added pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate. The second approach involved the measurement of the specific radioactivity of glucose 6-phosphate formed following the addition of [gamma-32P]ATP to either phosphorylating or nonphosphorylating AS-30D mitochondria. Both approaches provided results which show that the source of ATP for bound hexokinase is derived preferentially from the ATP synthase residing within the inner mitochondrial membrane compartment rather than from the medium (i.e. from the cytosolic compartment). These results provide the first direct demonstration that the exceptionally high level of hexokinase bound to mitochondria of highly glycolytic tumor cells has preferred access to mitochondrially generated ATP, a finding that may have rather profound metabolic significance for such tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1573653133,"The glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Ep), the primary regulator of erythropoiesis, is synthesized by the kidney and secreted as the mature protein with three N-linked and one O-linked oligosaccharide chains. To investigate the role(s) of each carbohydrate moiety in the biosynthesis and function of Ep, we have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of a cDNA for human Ep to alter the amino acids at each of the carbohydrate attachment sites. Each mutated cDNA construct was expressed in stably transfected sublines of a kidney cell line, baby hamster kidney. We show, by preventing attachment of N-linked carbohydrate at asparagines 38 or 83, or preventing O-linked glycosylation at serine 126, that glycosylation of each of these specific sites is critical for proper biosynthesis and secretion of Ep. Fractionation of cellular extracts demonstrated that the mutant proteins lacking glycosylation at each of these three sites, (38, 83, and 126) were associated mainly with membrane components or were degraded rapidly. Less than 10% of these three mutant proteins were processed properly and secreted from the cells. The Ep protein lacking N-linked glycosylation at asparagine 24 is synthesized and secreted as efficiently as native Ep. The carbohydrates at positions 24 and 38 may be involved in the biological activity of Ep, since the absence of either of the oligosaccharide side chains at these positions reduced the hormone's biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W1546939997,"Sperm whale metmyoglobin, which has tyrosine residues at positions 103, 146, and 151, dimerizes in the presence of H2O2. Equine metmyoglobin, which lacks Tyr-151, and red kangaroo metmyoglobin, which lacks Tyr-103 and Tyr-151, do not dimerize in the presence of H2O2. The dityrosine content of the sperm whale myoglobin dimer shows that it is primarily held together by dityrosine cross-links, although more tyrosine residues are lost than are accounted for by dityrosine formation. Digestion of the myoglobin dimer with chymotrypsin yields a peptide with the fluorescence spectrum of dityrosine. The amino acid composition, amino acid sequence, and mass spectrum of the peptide show that cross-linking involves covalent bond formation between Tyr-103 of one myoglobin chain and Tyr-151 of the other. Replacement of the prosthetic group of sperm whale myoglobin with zinc protoporphyrin IX prevents H2O2-induced dimerization even when intact horse metmyoglobin is present in the incubation. This suggests that the tyrosine radicals required for the dimerization reaction are generated by intra- rather than intermolecular electron transfer to the ferryl heme. Rapid electron transfer from Tyr-103 to the ferryl heme followed by slower electron transfer from Tyr-151 to Tyr-103 is most consistent with the present results."
https://openalex.org/W1539622248,"The binding of phosphate analogs to F-ADP-actin filaments and their effect on the dynamics of the polymer have been investigated. Orthovanadate binds to F-actin with the same affinity as phosphate and, at low saturation levels, stabilizes the filament structure in a Pi-like fashion; at higher concentration, it promotes destabilization of the filament. BeF-3 and A1F-4 bind to F-ADP-actin in competition with Pi, with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of F-actin subunit and an affinity 3 orders of magnitude higher than Pi (KD = 2 and 25 microM for BeF-3 and A1F-4, respectively). BeF-3 and A1F-4 mimic Pi in stabilizing F-actin and slow down the rate of actin dissociation from filaments 150-fold. Only 1% of F-ADP-BeF3 subunits provide extensive stabilization of the filament. A quantitative analysis of the stabilization by BeF-3 is proposed. While Pi appears in rapid equilibrium with F-ADP-actin, BeF-3 binds to and dissociates from F-ADP-actin at very slow rates (k+ = 4 M-1 S-1; k = 8.10(-6) S-1). In addition, although functionally similar to the reconstituted F-ADP-Pi species, F-ADP-BeF3 has a different conformation as indicated by the 17% quenching of pyrenyl fluorescence linked to BeF-3 binding. We suggest that BeF-3 may be a good analog of the transition state F-ADP-P* and that Pi release following cleavage of ATP on F-actin might be rate-limited by the isomerization of F-ADP-P*."

Indeed, the ability of many animals to reach out, grasp, and manipulate objects is a feat of biological engineering unmatched by even state-of-the-art robots. But how are the objects of our attention chosen and how are the eyes and hands directed to it? Recent progress in behavioral neurophysiology has clarified some of the brain mechanisms at work."
https://openalex.org/W2088817968,"Some internal adenosine residues in messenger RNA are methylated posttranscriptionally in the nucleus. Most of the methylated adenosine residues in prolactin mRNA are in the 3′ untranslated region. The site of methylation in the 3′ end of prolactin mRNA was determined. This methylation reaction is highly specific; of the three adenosine residues in consensus sequences located in the 3′ end, only one is methylated. An in vitro methylation system was developed in which bovine prolactin mRNA, synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase, was accurately methylated in a HeLa cell nuclear extract. The adenosine residue that was methylated in vitro was the same as the one methylated in vivo. This cell-free system, which accurately methylates the N6-position of adenosine residues in mRNA, will allow further study of the mechanism of adenosine methylation."

https://openalex.org/W1985233226,The rat lens undergoes dramatic growth during early postnatal development. Lens weight increased by a factor of 23 in 26 days. Growth rate per day oscillated between 0 and 87 percent. A new culture system was designed to study the oscillations in growth during development. Lens growth and transparency in vitro required pulsatile delivery of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in HL-1 serum-free medium. Continuous delivery of HL-1 medium with PDGF or pulsatile delivery of HL-1 medium without PDGF resulted in lens opacity and no growth. These results provide direct evidence that PDGF stimulates an epithelial tissue and that oscillations in growth occur during normal development of the rat lens.
https://openalex.org/W1576598132,"The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the ILTat 1.3 variant of Trypanosoma brucei has two asparagine-linked glycan moieties, as well as a phosphatidylinositol glycan membrane anchor. We have investigated the structure and processing of each of these oligosaccharides through analysis of the intact protein and of glycopeptides. Processing has been examined by comparing glycan structures purified from an immature intracellular form (58 kDa) of VSG with those of the mature form (59 kDa) found on the parasite surface. We find exclusively high mannose oligosaccharides (Man4-7-GlcNAc2) at Asn-432 in both the immature 58-kDa and mature 59-kDa forms. In contrast, the core oligosaccharide of Asn-419 (Man3-GlcNAc2) appears to be nearly quantitatively processed to a complex biantennary structure [Gal-GlcNAc-Man)2-Man-GlcNAc2) during VSG maturation. The asparagine-linked structures at Asn-419, but not those at Asn-432, are resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H within 30 s of biosynthesis. This suggests possible novel and selective mechanisms for glycosylation in African trypanosomes. Finally, we show that the carboxyl-terminal glycolipid is galactosylated (3-4 residues) relatively late in VSG biosynthesis. Phosphatidylinositol glycans have been identified on a growing number of eukaryotic membrane proteins. This report provides a direct demonstration of the processing of such a glycolipid anchor following its attachment to protein."
https://openalex.org/W1984670735,"Despite its potential toxicity, H2O2 is used as an extracellular oxidant by Stronglylocentrotus purpuratus eggs to cross-link their fertilization envelopes. These eggs contain 5 mM 1-methyl-N alpha,N alpha-dimethyl-4-mercaptohistidine (ovothiol C), which reacts with H2O2. In consuming H2O2 and being reduced by glutathione, ovothiol acts as a glutathione peroxidase and replaces the function of the enzyme in eggs. The ovothiol system is more effective than egg catalase in destroying H2O2 at concentrations produced during fertilization and constitutes a principal mechanism for preventing oxidative damage at fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W1521282119,"Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase in extracts of bovine aortic tissue eluted from DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange resins as two distinct peaks of activity. This elution pattern was preserved when the peaks were combined, precipitated with ammonium sulfate, dialyzed, and rechromatographed. Proteolysis did not appear to account for the two forms of kinase because (i) aging of the extract did not cause interconversion of the two forms, and (ii) both forms retained cGMP sensitivity unlike the proteolytically formed monomer. In addition, treatment with saturating concentrations of cGMP (10 microM) did not cause interconversion of the two forms. The first peak of cGMP-dependent protein kinase eluting from DEAE-cellulose (form 1) had a slightly greater mobility on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels than the second peak (form 2). On native, nondenaturing gradient polyacrylamide gels, however, form 2 displayed the greater electrophoretic mobility. Furthermore, form 1, when bound to cAMP-agarose, appeared to exchange more rapidly with cGMP than form 2 when subjected to affinity chromatography. Peptide maps generated from the two forms by protease treatment were very similar, although trypsin produced a unique peptide in form 1 and Streptomyces griseus protease gave rise to unique peptides in forms 1 and 2. Phosphorylation did not appear to account for the physical differences because both enzymes could be phosphorylated to similar extents and dephosphorylation using alkaline phosphatase did not result in the conversion of one form to the other. These results suggest that either differences in primary structure or post-translational modification, other than phosphorylation, are responsible for the presence of two forms of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in aortic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1589445605,"Abstract We report on the properties of a partially purified tRNA intron endonuclease from the archaebacterium Halobacterium volcanii. This enzyme is capable of precise excision of the 104-nucleotide intron from halo-bacterial pre-tRNA(Trp) substrates generated in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase transcription. The reaction requires divalent cations (Mg2+ or Ca2+) or spermidine, is inhibited by monovalent cations, and produces 5'-hydroxyl and 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini. Unlike the universal substrate recognition properties characteristic of the eukaryotic tRNA intron endonucleases, this enzyme is specific for halophilic tRNA(Trp) substrates. The partially purified enzyme is not capable of removing the intron from a yeast pre-tRNA(Phe) substrate. Analysis of the enzyme's ability to cleave tRNA(Trp) substrates lacking exon sequences demonstrated that the mature tRNA-like structure is not required in the substrate. A substrate retaining the intact intron and only the anticodon stem and loop exon regions was efficiently cleaved. Deletions within the intron indicated that the intron was not a primary site for recognition by the endonuclease; however, its presence affects the efficiency of the cleavage reaction. The possible relationship of this enzyme to other RNA endonucleases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559515036,"Preparations enriched in part-smooth (lacking ribosomes), part-rough (with ribosomes) transitional elements of the endoplasmic reticulum when incubated with ATP plus a cytosol fraction responded by the formation of blebbing profiles and approximately 60-nm vesicles. The 60-nm vesicles formed resembled closely transition vesicles in situ considered to function in the transfer of membrane materials between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The transition elements following incubation with ATP and cytosol were resolved by preparative free-flow electrophoresis into fractions of differing electronegativity. The main fraction contained the larger vesicles of the transitional membrane elements, while a less electronegative minor shoulder fraction was enriched in the 60-nm vesicles. If the vesicles concentrated by preparative free-flow electrophoresis were from material previously radiolabeled with [3H]leucine and then added to Golgi apparatus immobilized to nitrocellulose, radioactivity was transferred to the Golgi apparatus membranes. The transfer was rapid (T1/2 of about 5 min), efficient (10-30% of the total radioactivity of the transition vesicle preparations was transferred to Golgi apparatus), and independent of added ATP but facilitated by cytosol. Transfer was specific and apparently unidirectional in that Golgi apparatus membranes were ineffective as donor membranes and endoplasmic reticulum vesicles were ineffective as recipient membranes. Using a heterologous system with transition vesicles from rat liver and Golgi apparatus isolated from guinea pig liver, coalescence of the small endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles with Golgi apparatus membranes was demonstrated using immunocytochemistry. Employed were polyclonal antibodies directed against the isolated rat transition vesicle preparations. When localized by immunogold procedures at the electron microscope level, regions of rat-derived vesicles were found fused with cisternae of guinea pig Golgi apparatus immobilized to nitrocellulose strips. Membrane transfer was demonstrated from experiments where transition vesicle membrane proteins were radioiodinated by the Bolton-Hunter procedure. Additionally, radiolabeled peptide bands not present initially in endoplasmic reticulum appeared following coalescence of the derived vesicles with Golgi apparatus. These bands, indicative of processing, required that both Golgi apparatus and transition vesicles be present and did not occur in incubated endoplasmic reticulum preparations or on nitrocellulose strips to which no Golgi apparatus were added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1494345508,The apolipoprotein C-II gene from a patient with a deficiency of apoC-II was cloned and sequenced. A single base deletion of a guanosine at position 2943 in exon three of the gene of the proband was identified by sequence analysis. This point mutation results in a shift of the reading frame and introduces a premature termination codon (TGA) at a position in the gene immediately following amino acid 17 of the mature C-II apolipoprotein. This single base deletion results in the loss of a normally occurring HphI restriction enzyme site in the apoC-II gene. Amplification of the mutant DNA sequence by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion with HphI established that the patient is a homozygote for the base deletion. No apoC-II was detectable in the patient's plasma by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. We propose that the guanosine deletion is the primary genetic defect in this kindred leading to premature termination and formation of a nonfunctional truncated 17-amino acid C-II apolipoprotein which ultimately results in apoC-II deficiency.
https://openalex.org/W2140093413,"The binding of the amino steroid, 22-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3 beta-ol (22-ABC), to rabbit liver cytochrome P-450 3c was studied using purified P-450 3c and liver microsomes prepared from rifampicin-treated B/J rabbits. 22-ABC binds to purified cytochrome P-450 3c producing a type II spectral change reflecting the coordination of the amine with the heme iron of the protein. In the absence of allosteric effectors, the binding is characterized by a Ks of 5 microM. In the presence of alpha-naphthoflavone or progesterone, the Ks decreases to 0.8 microM, indicating that these two compounds serve as positive effectors of the binding of 22-ABC to cytochrome P-450 3c. The antibiotic rifampicin induces cytochrome P-450 3c in rabbit liver microsomes, and the benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, estradiol 2-hydroxylase, and progesterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activities of these microsomes are stimulated by alpha-naphthoflavone. Moreover, the progesterone 6 beta-hydroxylase activity catalyzed by these microsomes exhibits a dependence on substrate concentration that is consistent with activation of the enzyme by the substrate, progesterone. The magnitude of the type II spectral change elicited by 22-ABC for microsomes prepared from rifampicin-treated B/J rabbits is greater than that observed for microsomes from untreated rabbits. For microsomes from rifampicin-treated rabbits, the apparent binding constant for 22-ABC was decreased 5-fold in the presence of alpha-naphthoflavone. We propose that the effects of alpha-naphthoflavone and progesterone on the binding of 22-ABC to cytochrome P-450 3c mimic the effects of the two positive effectors on the metabolism of substrates by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1510046662,"Abstract Cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase cDNAs were cloned from a lambda gt11 rat liver cDNA library. The complete coding sequence and the 3' non-coding sequence of the cytosolic isozyme mRNA were obtained from two overlapping cDNA clones. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial enzyme cDNAs were found to be identical to the recently published complete sequence (Mattingly, J. R., Jr., Rodriguez-Berrocal, F. J., Gordon, J., Iriarte, A., and Martinez-Carrion, M. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 149, 859-865). A single mRNA (2.4 kb (kilobase pair] hybridizing to the mitochondrial cDNA probe was detected by Northern blot analysis, whereas the cytosolic cDNA probe labeled one major (2.1 kb) and two minor (1.8 and 4 kb) mRNAs. The 1.8-kb and the 2.1-kb cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase mRNAs differ in their 3' ends and probably result from the use of either of the two polyadenylation signals present in the 3' noncoding region of the major cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase mRNA. Glucocorticoid hormones increased the activity of cytosolic but not mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase in both liver and kidney. The increase in the enzyme activity was accompanied by an increase in the amount of the three corresponding mRNAs, while the mitochondrial enzyme mRNA was not significantly modified."
https://openalex.org/W2057849569,"We examined the interactions of lipid vesicles (liposomes) labeled with various fluorescent markers with the intracellular membranes of semi-intact (“perforated”) fibroblasts. When incubations were performed in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, both vesicle lipids and entrapped water soluble markers were transferred to the Golgi apparatus of treated cells, indicative of membrane fusion. Fusion occurred using unilamellar vesicles 30–80 nm in diameter and composed of phosphatidylcholine alone, but was inhibited when equimolar amounts of either phosphatidylserine or sphingomyelin were present in the vesicles. Lipid vesicle-Golgi membrane fusion was also inhibited by pretreatment of the perforated cells with N-ethylmaleimide. These findings suggest that lipid vesicles may be useful for delivery of labeled lipids, macromolecules, and dyes to the Golgi apparatus, and for modeling the interactions of transport vesicles with the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2157773792,"Chemical modification of amino acid residues was used to probe the ligand recognition site of A1 adenosine receptors from rat brain membranes. The effect of treatment with group-specific reagents on agonist and antagonist radioligand binding was investigated. The histidine-specific reagent diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) induced a loss of binding of the agonist R-N6-[3H] phenylisopropyladenosine ([3H]PIA), which could be prevented in part by agonists, but not by antagonists. DEP treatment induced also a loss of binding of the antagonist [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX). Antagonists protected A1 receptors from this inactivation while agonists did not. This result provided evidence for the existence of at least 2 different histidine residues involved in ligand binding. Consistent with a modification of the binding site, DEP did not alter the affinity of [3H]DPCPX, but reduced receptor number. From the selective protection of [3H] PIA and [3H]DPCPX binding from inactivation, it is concluded that agonists and antagonists occupy different domains at the binding site. Sulfhydryl modifying reagents did not influence antagonist binding, but inhibited agonist binding. This effect is explained by modification of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate inactivated both [3H]PIA and [3H]DPCPX binding, but the receptors could not be protected from inactivation by ligands. Therefore, no amino group seems to be located at the ligand binding site. In addition, it was shown that no further amino acids with polar side chains are present. The absence of hydrophilic amino acids from the recognition site of the receptor apart from histidine suggests an explanation for the lack of hydrophilic ligands with high affinity for A1 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1563736449,"A method was developed to purify glutathione transferase from bovine placenta by affinity chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The dimeric enzyme is composed of identical subunits with a molecular weight of 23,000; its isoelectric point is 6.9. In contrast to previously described isoenzymes of glutathione transferase, the protein we have purified exists in two forms, an active reduced form and a less active oxidized form. These can be reversibly transformed into each other but behave differently in sedimentation analysis, gel chromatography, and gel electrophoresis. These differences may reflect a change in the molecular shape of glutathione transferase. Chemical modification with iodoacetate, iodoacetamide (presumably of thiol groups), phenylglyoxal, and butadione (presumably of arginyl groups), and their inhibitory effects on the activity were investigated. From substrate specificity studies and N-terminal sequence analysis it is obvious that this glutathione transferase must belong to the isoenzyme class pi. The purified enzyme could be crystallized from 1.4 M ammonium sulfate solution, pH 8.0, in the presence of S-hexyl-glutathione. The crystals are tetragonal, with space group P4(1)2(1)2 or P4(3)2(1)2.

https://openalex.org/W1515991651,"Abstract The carbohydrate binding specificity of Allomyrina dichotoma lectin II was investigated by analyzing the behavior of various complex type oligosaccharides and human milk oligosaccharides on an A. dichotoma lectin II-agarose column. Basically, the lectin interacts with the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc group. Substitution of their terminal galactose residues by Neu5Ac alpha 2----6 will enhance their affinity to the lectin. By contraries, substitution at the C-2 or C-3 position of their terminal galactose with other sugars including sialic acid deprives their affinity to the lectin. With this characteristic, the immobilized lectin column can be used to separate complex type oligosaccharides with the Neu5Ac alpha 2----6Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc group from their isomeric oligosaccharides with the Neu5Ac alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc group, where Neu5Ac is N-acetylneuraminic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1522739205,"We have used site-directed in vitro mutagenesis to alter the codon ACT of human apoCIII gene, specifying Thr-74, to GCT (Ala-74). The normal and mutant apoCIII genes were then placed under the control of the mouse metallothionein 1 promoter in a bovine papilloma virus vector and were used for cell transfection and selection of stable cell lines. Blotting analysis of RNA isolated from several independent cell clones showed that both the normal and mutant genes produced apoCIII mRNA in amounts larger than that found in human fetal liver. Pulse-chase analysis of cell clones expressing the normal and mutant apoCIII genes showed that only the normal apoCIII is modified intracellularly to produce a disialated form (apoCIIIs2). Cell clones expressing the normal apoCIII gene secrete exclusively the disialated form, whereas those expressing the mutant gene secrete the unmodified form. The amount of mutant apoCIII protein produced by C127 cell clones expressing the mutant gene was reduced as compared to that produced by the control cells. Density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of the secreted apoCIII showed that the flotation properties of the secreted normal and mutant proteins were similar. These findings suggest that the intracellular glycosylation of apoCIII is not required for its intracellular transport and secretion. Furthermore, lack of glycosylation has no effect on the relative affinities of apoCIII for plasma very low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins."

Many of the hydration and tautomeric constants and microscopic pK values of these compounds have also been measured under the same conditions. These values are discussed with reference to Hammett's and Marshall's equations and a general equation that predicts these equilibrium constants in the media under discussion has been formulated.

https://openalex.org/W1536340739,"The production of singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) by the photosensitizing dye merocyanine 540 (MC540) bound to phosphatidylcholine liposomes has been demonstrated by direct detection of 1O2 luminescence at 1268 nm. 1O2 phosphorescence emission was enhanced in deuterated buffer and upon saturation of the sample with oxygen and could be quenched by the addition of sodium azide to the external medium. No 1O2 luminescence was detected in nitrogen-saturated samples, in the absence of dye, or with MC540 in aqueous solution. Photobleaching of liposome-bound MC540 was also observed to be dependent on oxygen concentration. These studies are consistent with 1O2 intermediacy in the mechanism of MC540-mediated photosensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1500278704,"Abstract A heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent, 125I-N-(3-iodo-4-azidophenylpropionamido-S-(2-thiopyridyl) cysteine (125-ACTP), has been synthesized. 125I-ACTP has been used to derivative reduced sulfhydryls of the retinal G protein, transducin (Gt), to form a mixed disulfide bond under mild, nondenaturing conditions (pH 7.4, 4 degrees C). The resulting disulfide was easily cleaved using reducing reagents. A 200-fold molar excess of 125I-ACTP relative to Gt resulted in the incorporation of 1-1.3 mol of the 125I-N-(3-iodo-4-azidophenylpropionamido)cysteine moiety of ACTP into Gt alpha. In contrast to 125I-ACTP, dithionitrobenzoate and dithiopyridone derivatized six sulfhydryls in native Gt. Incubation of a 10-fold molar excess of 125I-ACTP relative to Gt resulted in the derivatization of 0.75-0.9 and 0.1 mol of reduced sulfhydryls/mol Gt alpha and beta, respectively. Gt gamma was not derivatized by 125I-ACTP. Thus, Gt alpha was preferentially derivatized by 125I-ACTP. Tryptic digestion and amino acid sequencing of Gt alpha indicated that both Cys-347 near the carboxyl terminus and Cys-210 between the second and third consensus sequences forming the GTP-binding site were derivatized by 125I-ACTP in a ratio of approximately 70 and 30%, respectively. Thus, both Cys-210 and Cys-347 are labeled, even though derivatization by 125I-ACTP does not exceed 1 mol of SH/mol Gt alpha. It appears that derivatization of one sulfhydryl, either Cys-210 or Cys-347, excludes labeling of the second cysteine either by steric hindrance or induced conformational change making the second cysteine inaccessible to 125I-ACTP. Consistent with this finding was the observation that pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Cys-347 inhibited 125I-ACTP derivatization of Cys-210. Derivatization of Gt alpha at either Cys-210 or Cys-347 by 125I-ACTP inhibited rhodopsin-catalyzed guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding to Gt, mimicking the effect of ADP-ribosylation of Cys-347 by pertussis toxin. ACTP contains a radioiodinated phenylazide moiety which, upon activation, can cross-link the derivatized cysteine to an adjacent polypeptide domain. Following reduction of the disulfide, the [125I] iodophenyl moiety will be transferred to the azide-inserted polypeptide. When photoactivation of the phenylazide moiety of 125I-ACTP after sulfhydryl derivatization was performed, insertion of the Cys-347 which contains Cys-210, was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This modification involves the presence of phosphate, previously thought to exist only on amino acid residues in the EGF receptor, on oligosaccharides of the receptor. We have utilized several independent approaches to determine that mannose phosphate is present on the EGF receptor in A-431 cells. Following metabolic labeling with 32P, immunoisolation of the EGF receptor, and digestion with Pronase radioactivity was determined to be present on high mannose type oligosaccharides by concanavalin A chromatography. Also, after acid hydrolysis of in vivo 32P-labeled EGF receptor, radioactivity was detected that co-migrated with mannose 6-phosphate on two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis. This radiolabeled material co-eluted with a mannose 6-phosphate standard from a high pressure liquid chromatography anion exchange column. Last, an acid hydrolysate of [3H]mannose-labeled EGF receptor contained two radiolabeled fractions, as analyzed by thin layer electrophoresis, and the radioactivity in one of these fractions was substantially reduced by alkaline phosphatase treatment prior to electrophoresis. These experiments indicate that the mature EGF receptor in A-431 cells contains mannose phosphate. This is a novel modification for membrane receptors and has only been reported previously for lysosomal enzymes and a few secreted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1500530517,"Polysialoglycoprotein (PSGP) of unfertilized eggs of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) consists of tandem repeats (about 25) of a glycotridecapeptide, Asp-Asp-Ala-Thr*-Ser*-Glu-Ala-Ala-Thr*-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly (* denotes the attachment site of a polysialoglycan chain) (Kitajima, K., Inoue, Y., and Inoue, S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5262-5269). By using oligodeoxynucleotide probes based on the above sequence, we isolated a genomic clone for apoPSGP which contains 39-base pair repeats (5′-GACGACGCCACCTCTGAAGCT-GCGACCGGCCCGTCTGGC-3′) encoding the tridecapeptide. Using a fragment of this genomic DNA as a probe, we next screened a cDNA library constructed with mRNA from immature ovaries of rainbow trout. Nucleotide sequencing analyses of cDNA clones thus obtained revealed that apoPSGP is encoded by multiple mRNA species consisting of diverged numbers (6-32) of the 39-base repeat encoding the tridecapeptide unit and homologous 5′- and 3′-bordering regions. The encoded protein consists of three distinct regions: the N-region consisting of a putative signal peptide and a pro-peptide, the R-region containing diverged numbers of the tandem repeat of 13-amino acid residues, and the C-region with six amino acid residues. Southern blot analysis showed that multiple mRNAs are transcribed from multiple genes for apoPSGP containing diverged numbers of the 39-base pair repeat. Thus, the genes for apoPSGP constitute a multigene family. Expression of the mRNAs is stage and organ specific, i.e. they are expressed only in immature ovaries and not in mature ovaries or in any other organ."
https://openalex.org/W1545065116,"The promoter structure of the known small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes contains two major effectors of transcriptional activity: a proximal sequence element and a distal sequence element. In addition to these two functional elements (called elements B and D), the human U1 snRNA gene contains at least three minor elements (elements A, C, and E) that contribute to overall transcriptional efficiency (Murphy, J.T., Skuzeski, J.M., Lund, E., Steinberg, T.H., Burgess, R.R., and Dahlberg, J.E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1795-1803). To elucidate further the function of these transcription elements, we carried out a computer search to look for sequences in the U1 gene homologous to known transcription factor consensus sequences. Where such homology was found, DNase I and MPE-Fe(II) (methidiumpropyl-EDTA-Fe(II] footprinting was employed to study the interactions of these promoter regions with proteins partially purified from extracts of HeLa cells or human placenta. Footprints were observed over element D (the distal element) corresponding to sequences homologous to the octanucleotide binding protein (OCTA) and activator protein 1 (AP1). Protection was also observed over element B (the proximal element) corresponding to possible sites for stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1), enhancer core, major late transcription factor (MLTF), and a U1-specific transcription factor. Prior to this study, no specific transcription factor footprints had been observed over proximal elements of any snRNA gene. Footprints were also found over elements A and E. The results of the computer search and the footprinting are discussed in light of what is known about snRNA promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1505602983,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) purified from leaves of the crassulacean acid metabolism plant (Crassula argentea) was chemically modified by the specific arginyl reagent 2,3-butanedione. Modification resulted in enzyme inactivation which followed pseudo first-order kinetics. Participation of arginyl residues involved in the binding of or response to both phosphoenolpyruvate and malate, respectively, was established. Inactivation and protection studies suggest the presence of three sites involved in the binding of the substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, the activator, glucose 6-phosphate, and the inhibitor, malate. Studies using both fluorescence measurements of binding and steady-state kinetic methods indicate that phosphoenolpyruvate can bind both to the active site and to the activator site. Evidence for stimulation of the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase upon the binding of substrate to the activation site was provided by kinetic studies using AMP, previously shown to be a specific ligand for the activation site."
https://openalex.org/W1556663915,"Chicken embryos homozygous for the autosomal recessive gene nanomelia exhibit cartilage defects, synthesize low levels of cartilage chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), and are missing the CSPG core protein (Argraves, W. S., McKeown-Longo, P. J., and Goetinck, P. F. (1981) FEBS Lett. 131, 265). In our studies of nanomelic chondrocytes in culture, we detected neither sulfate-labeled CSPG nor its Mr 370,000 core protein. However, in immunoprecipitation reactions using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against the cartilage CSPG core protein, we identified a protein of Mr 300,000 that contains an epitope found in the hyaluronic acid-binding region of the normal core protein. This protein was also detected among products synthesized by chondrocytes obtained from phenotypically normal embryos resulting from matings between parents heterozygous for nanomelia. Sensitivity to endoglycosidase H indicated that the product is a glycoprotein with attached mannose-rich oligosaccharides. Pulse-chase studies revealed the disappearance of the glycoprotein after 6 h of chase, but no detectable formation of proteoglycan. Our results suggest that although nanomelic chondrocytes are deficient in the production of normal CSPG and its core protein, they do synthesize a smaller, immunologically related glycoprotein that does not undergo the post-translational processing characteristic of the normal cartilage core protein."
https://openalex.org/W1570067265,"Synthesis of gp115 by aorta smooth muscle cells and tendon fibroblasts isolated from chick embryos was investigated. gp115 was specifically immunoprecipitated by both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies from cell lysates and culture medium of matrix free cells metabolically labeled with [3H]leucine and [35S]methionine. The component of gp115 isolated from the cell lysate had an apparent Mr in reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels lower (105,000) than the protein isolated from the culture medium (Mr = 115,000). In immunoblot experiments, the latter corresponded in apparent Mr to the form isolated from chick tissues. gp115 was glycosylated in vitro; it was labeled with [3H]fucose, and when cells were cultured and labeled in the presence of tunicamycin, a lower Mr form with an apparent Mr = 90,000 was immunoprecipitated in both the cell lysate and the culture medium. In pulse-chase experiments, the intracellular and the extracellular forms were clearly suggestive of a direct precursor-product relationship in the absence of intermediate forms. The kinetics of secretion appeared very slow compared with that of other proteins of the extracellular matrix investigated in the same system; about 50-70% of gp115 in the form of the Mr = 105,000 species was still cell-associated after 4 h, whereas the half-time for secretion of fibronectin, type VI collagen, and tropoelastin was about 60 min, 3 h, and 60 min, respectively. Newly synthesized and processed cell-associated gp115 migrated in both reduced and non-reduced gels as a monomer. On the contrary, the secreted protein was present in the culture medium as large aggregates that did not enter the gel in the absence of reducing agents."

https://openalex.org/W1572019340,"A survey of 40 protein and nucleic acid chemistry facilities has provided data about the capabilities of core facilities and the cost of the services they provide. Approximately 43% of the $158,000 average annual operating budget for a typical university facility is derived from service charges. After correcting for the various degrees of subsidization of the different facilities, it was found that it costs a typical university facility $65 to carry out an acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis on a protein. A 25-residue peptide can be synthesized and cleaved for $2078, whereas sequencing the same peptide costs $874. A 25-residue oligonucleotide can be synthesized for $258. The total work output per month of an average facility corresponds to 65 amino acid analyses, 15 amino acid sequencing runs, three peptide syntheses, and 16 oligonucleotide syntheses. Depending on the approach used, from 85 to nearly 200 pmol of protein are required to obtain an accurate amino acid composition. To sequence the first 15 amino acids in a protein typically requires 150 pmol compared with 1.2 nmol of protein required to first carry out a tryptic digest and then isolate and sequence the first 15 residues in one of the resulting tryptic peptides.— Williams, K.

https://openalex.org/W1604838976,"Previous studies employing circular dichroism and resonance energy transfer techniques have demonstrated that the signal peptide of mitochondrial preornithine carbamyltransferase (pOCT) has the potential to interact with the surface of an anionic phospholipid membrane via a short amphiphilic helical domain. Here we have used predictive secondary structure computations as a guide to localize the putative membrane binding region in the pOCT signal sequence and demonstrate that replacement of leucine residues at positions 5, 8, and 9 with the less hydrophobic residue, alanine, significantly reduces the rate of precursor import (4-5-fold compared to wild type); the amino acid substitutions had little effect, however, on the ability of a mitochondrial matrix extract to process the mutant precursor polypeptide. The mutant precursor bound to anionic liposomes with a lower affinity compared to wild-type pOCT and was inhibited to a lesser extent than pOCT during import into mitochondria in the presence of varying concentrations of liposomes. Taken together, the results suggest that this small region of the pOCT signal sequence, containing a limited number of critical hydrophobic residues, contributes to the optimal rate of precursor import, perhaps by functioning as a membrane surface-seeking entity."
https://openalex.org/W1595601675,"In the presence of tyrosine, phenylalanine hydroxylase, which has been activated with lysolecithin, catalyzes the oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin at a rate 10-20% that of the parallel reaction with phenylalanine. Unlike the reaction with phenylalanine, there is no net concomitant hydroxylation of tyrosine, although the amino acid is still a necessary component. Tyrosine appears to form an abortive complex with the activated enzyme, the pterin cofactor and molecular oxygen. The Km for tetrahydrobiopterin is identical for the reactions with phenylalanine and tyrosine, whereas the Km for tyrosine is approximately 3 1/2 times greater than the Km for phenylalanine. The tyrosine-dependent oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin proceeds at both pH 6.8 and 8.2 and shows a similar dependence on the pH as that of the physiological reaction. Tetrahydrobiopterin can be replaced by the artificial cofactor, 6-methyltetrahydropterin, in the tyrosine-dependent oxidation at both pH 6.8 and 8.2. As in the parallel reaction with phenylalanine, both the Km for the cofactor and the Km for the aromatic amino acid increase with this substitution."

Researchers and ""patient groups"" must be mobilized to struggle against these organizations in order to prevent a disaster from overtaking biomedical research in the United States."
