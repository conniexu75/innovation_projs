https://openalex.org/W3006594036,"Quantum cascade lasers are compact, electrically pumped light sources in the technologically important mid-infrared and terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum1,2. Recently, the concept of topology3 has been expanded from condensed matter physics into photonics4, giving rise to a new type of lasing5-8 using topologically protected photonic modes that can efficiently bypass corners and defects4. Previous demonstrations of topological lasers have required an external laser source for optical pumping and have operated in the conventional optical frequency regime5-8. Here we demonstrate an electrically pumped terahertz quantum cascade laser based on topologically protected valley edge states9-11. Unlike topological lasers that rely on large-scale features to impart topological protection, our compact design makes use of the valley degree of freedom in photonic crystals10,11, analogous to two-dimensional gapped valleytronic materials12. Lasing with regularly spaced emission peaks occurs in a sharp-cornered triangular cavity, even if perturbations are introduced into the underlying structure, owing to the existence of topologically protected valley edge states that circulate around the cavity without experiencing localization. We probe the properties of the topological lasing modes by adding different outcouplers to the topological cavity. The laser based on valley edge states may open routes to the practical use of topological protection in electrically driven laser sources."

Here we sequenced DNA from diverse ecosystems and found hundreds of phage genomes with lengths of more than 200 kilobases (kb), including a genome of 735 kb, which is—to our knowledge—the largest phage genome to be described to date. Thirty-five genomes were manually curated to completion (circular and no gaps). Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and previously undescribed CRISPR–Cas systems, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modification enzymes, translation-initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. The CRISPR–Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In addition, some phages may repurpose bacterial CRISPR–Cas systems to eliminate competing phages. We phylogenetically define the major clades of huge phages from human and other animal microbiomes, as well as from oceans, lakes, sediments, soils and the built environment. We conclude that the large gene inventories of huge phages reflect a conserved biological strategy, and that the phages are distributed across a broad bacterial host range and across Earth’s ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W3119257446,"A quantum internet that connects remote quantum processors1,2 should enable a number of revolutionary applications such as distributed quantum computing. Its realization will rely on entanglement of remote quantum memories over long distances. Despite enormous progress3-12, at present the maximal physical separation achieved between two nodes is 1.3 kilometres10, and challenges for longer distances remain. Here we demonstrate entanglement of two atomic ensembles in one laboratory via photon transmission through city-scale optical fibres. The atomic ensembles function as quantum memories that store quantum states. We use cavity enhancement to efficiently create atom-photon entanglement13-15 and we use quantum frequency conversion16 to shift the atomic wavelength to telecommunications wavelengths. We realize entanglement over 22 kilometres of field-deployed fibres via two-photon interference17,18 and entanglement over 50 kilometres of coiled fibres via single-photon interference19. Our experiment could be extended to nodes physically separated by similar distances, which would thus form a functional segment of the atomic quantum network, paving the way towards establishing atomic entanglement over many nodes and over much longer distances."
https://openalex.org/W3100415935,"Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a diverse family of microporous inorganic solids, known for their gas storage ability1, metal-ion immobilization2, proton conduction3, and stimuli-dependent magnetic4,5, electronic6 and optical7 properties. This family of materials includes the double-metal cyanide catalysts8,9 and the hexacyanoferrate/hexacyanomanganate battery materials10,11. Central to the various physical properties of PBAs is their ability to reversibly transport mass, a process enabled by structural vacancies. Conventionally presumed to be random12,13, vacancy arrangements are crucial because they control micropore-network characteristics, and hence the diffusivity and adsorption profiles14,15. The long-standing obstacle to characterizing the vacancy networks of PBAs is the inaccessibility of single crystals16. Here we report the growth of single crystals of various PBAs and the measurement and interpretation of their X-ray diffuse scattering patterns. We identify a diversity of non-random vacancy arrangements that is hidden from conventional crystallographic powder analysis. Moreover, we explain this unexpected phase complexity in terms of a simple microscopic model that is based on local rules of electroneutrality and centrosymmetry. The hidden phase boundaries that emerge demarcate vacancy-network polymorphs with very different micropore characteristics. Our results establish a foundation for correlated defect engineering in PBAs as a means of controlling storage capacity, anisotropy and transport efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3005659813,"Introduction The main strategy for decreasing maternal morbidity and mortality has been antenatal care (ANC). ANC aims to monitor and maintain the health and safety of the mother and the fetus, detect all complications of pregnancy and take the necessary actions, respond to complaints, prepare for birth, and promote a healthy lifestyle. This study aims to analyze interregional disparities in ≥4 ANC visits during pregnancy in Indonesia. Methods Data was acquired from the 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS). The unit of analysis was women aged 15–49 years old, and a sample of 15,351 women was obtained. In addition to ANC as the dependent variable, the other variables analyzed in this study were a place of residence, age, husband/partner, education, parity, wealth status, and health insurance. For the final analysis, binary logistic regression was used to determine disparity. Results With the Papua region as a reference, all regions showed a gap except for the Maluku region, which was not significantly different in the use of ANC compared to the Papua region. Women in the Nusa Tenggara have 4.365 times the chance of making ≥4 ANC visits compared to those in the Papua region (95% CI 3.229–5.899). Women in Java-Bali have 3.607 times the chance of making ≥4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region (95% CI 2.741–4.746). Women in Sumatra have 1.370 times the chance of making ≥4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region (95% CI 1.066–1.761). Women in Kalimantan have 2.232 times the chance of making ≥4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region (1.664–2.994). Women in Sulawesi have 1.980 times more chance of making ≥4 ANC visits compared to women in the Papua region (1.523–2.574). In addition to the region category, other variables that contributed to the predictor were age, husband/partner, education, parity, wealth and insurance. Conclusion There were disparities in ANC utilization between the various regions of Indonesia. The structured policy is needed to reach regions that have low coverage of ≥4 ANC. Policymakers need to use the results of this study to take the necessary policies. Policies that focus on service equality to reduce disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3005644271,"A very important problem in combinatorial optimization is the partitioning of a network into communities of densely connected nodes; where the connectivity between nodes inside a particular community is large compared to the connectivity between nodes belonging to different ones. This problem is known as community detection, and has become very important in various fields of science including chemistry, biology and social sciences. The problem of community detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the number of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities. This drastically increases the solution space for heuristics to work on, compared to traditional graph partitioning problems. In many of the scientific domains in which graphs are used, there is the need to have the ability to partition a graph into communities with the “highest quality” possible since the presence of even small isolated communities can become crucial to explain a particular phenomenon. We have explored community detection using the power of quantum annealers, and in particular the D-Wave 2X and 2000Q machines. It turns out that the problem of detecting at most two communities naturally fits into the architecture of a quantum annealer with almost no need of reformulation. This paper addresses a systematic study of detecting two or more communities in a network using a quantum annealer."
https://openalex.org/W3006486405,"In OA chondrocytes, there is diminished mitochondrial production of ATP and diminished extracellular adenosine resulting in diminished adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) stimulation and altered chondrocyte homeostasis which contributes to the pathogenesis of OA. We tested the hypothesis that A2AR stimulation maintains or enhances mitochondrial function in chondrocytes. The effect of A2AR signaling on mitochondrial health and function was determined in primary murine chondrocytes, a human chondrocytic cell line (T/C-28a2), primary human chondrocytes, and a murine model of OA by transmission electron microscopy analysis, mitochondrial stress testing, confocal live imaging for mitochondrial inner membrane polarity, and immunohistochemistry. In primary murine chondrocytes from A2AR-/- null mice, which develop spontaneous OA by 16 weeks, there is mitochondrial swelling, dysfunction, and reduced mitochondrial content with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden and diminished mitophagy, as compared to chondrocytes from WT animals. IL-1-stimulated T/C-28a2 cells treated with an A2AR agonist had reduced ROS burden with increased mitochondrial dynamic stability and function, findings which were recapitulated in primary human chondrocytes. In an obesity-induced OA mouse model, there was a marked increase in mitochondrial oxidized material which was markedly improved after intraarticular injections of liposomal A2AR agonist. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that A2AR ligation is mitoprotective in OA."
https://openalex.org/W3006039366,"Molecular data are now commonly used in taxonomy for delimiting cryptic species. In the case of giraffes, which were treated as a single species (Giraffa camelopardalis) during half of a century, several molecular studies have suggested a splitting into four to seven species, but the criteria applied for taxonomic delimitation were not fully described. In this study, we have analysed all multi-locus DNA sequences available for giraffes using multispecies coalescent (MSC: *BEAST, BPP and STACEY), population genetic (STRUCTURE, allelic networks, haplotype network and bootstrapping, haplowebs and conspecificity matrix) and phylogenetic (MrBayes, PhyML, SuperTRI) methods to identify the number of species. Our results show that depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses, recognizing from two to six species, can be considered for the genus Giraffa. Our results confirm that MSC methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as they delimit geographic structure rather than species. The 3-species hypothesis, which recognizes G. camelopardalis sensu strico A, G. giraffa, and G. tippelskirchi, is highly supported by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and MSC analyses. The three species show high levels of nucleotide divergence in both nuclear (0.35–0.51%) and mitochondrial sequences (3–4%), and they are characterised by 7 to 12 exclusive synapomorphies (ES) detected in nine of the 21 nuclear introns analysed for this study. By contrast, other putative species, such as G. peralta, G. reticulata, G. thornicrofti or G. tippelskirchi sensu stricto, do not exhibit any ES in the nuclear genes. A robust mito-nuclear conflict was found for the position and monophyly of G. giraffa and G. tippelskirchi, which is interpreted as the result of a mitochondrial introgression from Masai to southeastern giraffe during the Pleistocene and nuclear gene flow mediated by male dispersal between southern populations (subspecies G. g. giraffa and G. g. angolensis)."
https://openalex.org/W3006296195,"Non-Hispanic blacks have higher mortality rates than non-Hispanic whites whereas Hispanics have similar or lower mortality rates than non-Hispanic blacks and whites despite Hispanics’ lower education and access to health insurance coverage. This study examines whether allostatic load, a proxy for cumulative biological risk, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD)-specific mortality risks in US adults; and whether these associations vary with race/ethnicity and further with age, sex and education across racial/ethnic groups. Data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988–1994) and the 2015 Linked Mortality File were used for adults 25 years or older (n = 13,673 with 6,026 deaths). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the associations of allostatic load scores (2 and ≥3 relative to ≤1) with a) all-cause and b) CVD-specific mortality risk among NHANES III participants before and after controlling for selected characteristics. Allostatic load scores are associated with higher all-cause and CVD-specific mortality rates among U.S. adults aged 25 years or older, with stronger rates observed for CVD-specific mortality. All-cause mortality rates for each racial/ethnic group differed with age and education whereas for CVD-specific mortality rates, this difference was observed for sex. Our findings of high allostatic load scores associated with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality among US adults call attention to monitor conditions associated with the allostatic load’s biomarkers to identify high-risk groups to help monitor social inequities in mortality risk, especially premature mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3005632180,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in various biological processes. However, the roles of lncRNAs in macrophage polarization remain largely unexplored. In this study, thousands of lncRNAs were identified that are differentially expressed in distinct polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages. Among them, Dnmt3aos (DNA methyltransferase 3A, opposite strand), as a known lncRNA, locates on the antisense strand of Dnmt3a. Functional experiments further confirmed that Dnmt3aos were highly expressed in M(IL-4) macrophages and participated in the regulation of Dnmt3a expression, and played a key role in macrophage polarization. The DNA methylation profiles between the Dnmt3aos knockdown group and the control group in M(IL-4) macrophages were determined by MeDIP-seq technique for the first time, and the Dnmt3aos-Dnmt3a axis-mediated DNA methylation modification-regulated macrophage polarization- related gene IFN-γ was identified. Our study will help to enrich our knowledge of the mechanism of macrophage polarization."
https://openalex.org/W3006226797,"Recent evidence suggests that the quantity and quality of conscious experience may be a function of the complexity of activity in the brain and that consciousness emerges in a critical zone between low and high-entropy states. We propose fractal shapes as a measure of proximity to this critical point, as fractal dimension encodes information about complexity beyond simple entropy or randomness, and fractal structures are known to emerge in systems nearing a critical point. To validate this, we tested several measures of fractal dimension on the brain activity from healthy volunteers and patients with disorders of consciousness of varying severity. We used a Compact Box Burning algorithm to compute the fractal dimension of cortical functional connectivity networks as well as computing the fractal dimension of the associated adjacency matrices using a 2D box-counting algorithm. To test whether brain activity is fractal in time as well as space, we used the Higuchi temporal fractal dimension on BOLD time-series. We found significant decreases in the fractal dimension between healthy volunteers (n = 15), patients in a minimally conscious state (n = 10), and patients in a vegetative state (n = 8), regardless of the mechanism of injury. We also found significant decreases in adjacency matrix fractal dimension and Higuchi temporal fractal dimension, which correlated with decreasing level of consciousness. These results suggest that cortical functional connectivity networks display fractal character and that this is associated with level of consciousness in a clinically relevant population, with higher fractal dimensions (i.e. more complex) networks being associated with higher levels of consciousness. This supports the hypothesis that level of consciousness and system complexity are positively associated, and is consistent with previous EEG, MEG, and fMRI studies."
https://openalex.org/W3006174098,"Dengue is a viral disease caused by an arbovirus of the genus Flavivirus transmitted in Brazil by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762). Simultaneous circulation of the four viral serotypes (DENV1, 2, 3 and 4) has been occurring since 2010 and determines a scenario of hyperendemicity of the disease in the country. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological situation of dengue in Brazil in the last three decades. This is a descriptive, observational study that used data of dengue notifications of the National Surveillance System from 1990 to 2017, available in the Epidemiological Bulletins and publications of the Ministry of Health. Dengue incidence increased in all Brazilian regions and the interepidemic periods are distinct in the different regions. The greatest epidemics was recorded in 2015 (1,688,688 cases), with an incidence of 826.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, which illustrates the occurrence of dengue in the last decade with increasingly higher epidemic peaks and shortening of the interepidemic periods. The incidence and mortality indices point to the need to improve the organization of response to dengue epidemics. This study provides information on the epidemiology of dengue in the country and can be used in the formulation of public health policies to reduce the impacts of viral transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3005970542,"Across a broad spectrum of memory tasks, retention is superior following a night of sleep compared to a day of wake. However, this result alone does not clarify whether sleep merely slows the forgetting that would otherwise occur as a result of information processing during wakefulness, or whether sleep actually consolidates memories, protecting them from subsequent retroactive interference. Two influential studies suggested that sleep protects memories against the subsequent retroactive interference that occurs when participants learn new yet overlapping information (interference learning). In these studies, interference learning was much less detrimental to memory following a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness, an indication that sleep supports this important aspect of memory consolidation. In the current replication study, we repeated the protocol of and, additionally, we examined the impact of intrinsic motivation on performance in sleep and wake participants. We were unable to replicate the finding that sleep protects memories against retroactive interference, with the detrimental effects of interference learning being essentially the same in wake and sleep participants. We also found that while intrinsic motivation benefitted task acquisition it was not a modulator of sleep-wake differences in memory processing. Although we cannot accept the null hypothesis that sleep has no role to play in reducing the negative impact of interference, the findings draw into question prior evidence for sleep’s role in protecting memories against interference. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of replicating key findings in the study of sleep’s impact on memory processing before drawing strong conclusions that set the direction of future research."
https://openalex.org/W3005953448,"Privacy protection in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has always been a research hotspot, especially the issue of vehicle authentication, which is critical to ensure the safe communication of vehicles. However, using the real identity in the process of authentication can easily result in a leak of the privacy information of the vehicles. Therefore, most existing privacy-protection schemes use anonymous authentication and require one-to-one communication between vehicles and the trusted authority (TA). However, when the number of vehicles is too large, network congestion can take place. In addition, the process of updating the anonymous by the TA or the vehicle itself, can result in both poor real-time performance and leakage of the system master key. To solve these problems, this study proposes a fog-computing-based anonymous-authentication scheme for VANETs; the scheme reduces the communication burden of the TA by enabling self-authentication between vehicles and road-side units (RSUs), thus improving the vehicle-authentication efficiency. For updating the anonymous, we design a fog-computing-based pseudonym-updating and -tracking strategy, which guarantees real-time communication and reduces the instances of re-authentication interactions for legitimate vehicles. The experimental results show that the scheme not only meets the privacy-protection requirements of VANETs but also offers better performance than that of the existing anonymous-authentication schemes."
https://openalex.org/W3006311244,"Tephritid fruit flies are among the most destructive horticultural pests posing risks to Australia's multi-billion-dollar horticulture industry. Currently, there are 11 pest fruit fly species of economic concern in Australia. Of these, nine are native to this continent (Bactrocera aquilonis, B. bryoniae, B. halfordiae, B. jarvisi, B. kraussi, B. musae, B. neohumeralis, B. tryoni and Zeugodacus cucumis), while B. frauenfeldi and Ceratitis capitata are introduced. To varying degrees these species are costly to Australia's horticulture through in-farm management, monitoring to demonstrate pest freedom, quarantine and trade restrictions, and crop losses. Here, we used a common species distribution model, Maxent, to assess climate suitability for these 11 species under baseline (1960-1990) and future climate scenarios for Australia. Projections indicate that the Wet Tropics is likely to be vulnerable to all 11 species until at least 2070, with the east coast of Australia also likely to remain vulnerable to multiple species. While the Cape York Peninsula and Northern Territory are projected to have suitable climate for numerous species, extrapolation to novel climates in these areas decreases confidence in model projections. The climate suitability of major horticulture areas currently in eastern Queensland, southern-central New South Wales and southern Victoria to these pests may increase as climate changes. By highlighting areas at risk of pest range expansion in the future our study may guide Australia's horticulture industry in developing effective monitoring and management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3005942860,"Tissue fibrosis is a pathological condition characterized by uncontrolled fibroblast activation that ultimately leads to organ failure. The TGFβ1 pathway, one of the major players in establishment of the disease phenotype, is dependent on the transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ. We were interested whether fibroblasts can be sensitized to TGFβ1 by activation of the GPCR/YAP/TAZ axis and whether this mechanism explains the profibrotic properties of diverse GPCR ligands. We found that LPA, S1P and thrombin cooperate in human dermal fibroblasts with TGFβ1 to induce extracellular matrix synthesis, myofibroblast marker expression and cytokine secretion. Whole genome expression profiling identified a YAP/TAZ signature behind the synergistic profibrotic effects of LPA and TGFβ1. LPA, S1P and thrombin stimulation led to activation of the Rho-YAP axis, an increase of nuclear YAP-Smad2 complexes and enhanced expression of profibrotic YAP/Smad2-target genes. More generally, dermal, cardiac and lung fibroblast responses to TGFβ1 could be enhanced by increasing YAP nuclear levels (with GPCR ligands LPA, S1P, thrombin or Rho activator) and inhibited by decreasing nuclear YAP (with Rho inhibitor, forskolin, latrunculin B or 2-deoxy-glucose). Thus, we present here a conceptually interesting finding that fibroblast responses to TGFβ1 can be predicted based on the nuclear levels of YAP and modulated by stimuli/treatments that change YAP nuclear levels. Our study contributes to better understanding of fibrosis as a complex interplay of signalling pathways and proposes YAP/TAZ as promising targets in the treatment of fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2999940765,"Background Standardised packaging for factory made (FM) and roll your own (RYO) tobacco was fully implemented in the UK in May 2017. Around the same time, several changes to the tax system were applied (a Minimum Excise Tax (MET) for FM products and tax increases weighted towards RYO products). The tobacco industry claims that standardised packaging will lower prices (a disincentive for quitting) by commoditising the product, yet had itself taken advantage of the previous tax regime to achieve large profits from premium brands while also keeping some products’ prices relatively low. Here we evaluate the impact of standardised packaging, the MET and the RYO focussed tax changes on price and industry profitability. Methods and findings Nielsen electronic point of sale (EPOS) data (May 2015 to April 2018) were used to calculate real (inflation adjusted) monthly price per stick overall, by cigarette type (FM and RYO) and by seven market segments. Trend estimation, using additive mixed models, assessed weighted average price (weighted by volume of sales) and tobacco industry net revenue changes. The beginning and end of the data series were compared in terms of: (a) average monthly price growth, (b) average monthly net revenue growth, and (c) undershifting and overshifting patterns after tax changes. FM and RYO real prices changed little over the 3-year period—overall prices rose by about 1p per stick. There was no evidence of commoditisation with prices of all FM segments (but not RYO) rising faster after the implementation of standardised packaging than immediately beforehand. The prices of the cheapest FM brands rose with the implementation of the MET. RYO price increases did not close the gap to FM pricing levels despite RYO focussed tax increases. Tax changes following the implementation of standardised packaging and the MET were more widely and quickly passed on to smokers in the form of higher prices than the tax change pre-implementation. The main limitations are first that because we do not know the exact mechanism by which Nielsen scales up sample data to provide UK estimates, we could only use data for a set three year period during which the same adjustments are made. Second, the tax and standardised packaging events were sometimes too close in time to separate their consequences statistically. Third, tobacco prices may also be affected by external factors such as changes in smokers’ disposable income or availability of electronic nicotine delivery systems. Conclusions There was no long-term lowering of tobacco prices after the implementation of standardised packaging as predicted by the industry. The introduction of the MET was successful in increasing the price of the cheapest FM cigarettes and narrowing the price gap between FM brands. The RYO tax increases were, however, insufficient to narrow the price gap between RYO and FM. Overall, undershifting became less extensive indicating that tobacco industry manipulation of the tax system which had previously kept cheap products available had declined. This suggests that standardised packaging and a MET will likely contribute to further declines in UK tobacco use."
https://openalex.org/W3006108684,"Background Serum vitamin D insufficiency is a public health issue, especially among older women. Sun exposure is fundamental in the production of vitamin D, but older women have less optimal sun exposure. Therefore, factors such as body composition and diet become more essential in sustaining sufficient serum levels of vitamin D. The objective of the current study is to determine factors contributing towards serum vitamin D insufficiency among 214 older women. Methods The respondents had their body weight, height, waist circumference and body fat percentage measured, as well as interviewed for their socio-demographic characteristics, sun exposure and dietary intake. Fasting blood samples were obtained from the respondents to measure their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration. Results There were 82.7% (95% CI: 77.6%, 87.8%) of the respondents that had serum vitamin D insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) with an average of 37.4 ± 14.3nmol/L. In stepwise multiple linear regression, high percentage of body fat (ß = -0.211, p <0.01) and low consumption of milk and dairy products (ß = 0.135, p <0.05) were the main contributors towards insufficient serum vitamin D levels, but not socio-demographic characteristics, other anthropometric indices, sun exposure and diet quality. Conclusion Older women with high body fat percentage and low dairy product consumption were more likely to have serum vitamin D insufficiency. Older women should ensure their body fat percentage is within a healthy range and consume more milk and dairy products in preventing serum vitamin D insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3006593822,"The Sinacanthida ordo nov. and Mongolepidida are spine- and scale-based taxa whose remains encompass some of the earliest reported fossils of chondrichthyan fish. Investigation of fragmentary material from the Early Silurian Tataertag and Ymogantau Formations of the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China) has revealed a diverse mongolepidid and sinacanthid fauna dominated by mongolepids and sinacanthids in association with abundant dermoskeletal elements of the endemic ‘armoured’ agnathans known as galeaspids. Micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and histological sections were used to identify seven mongolepid genera (including Tielikewatielepis sinensis gen. et sp. nov., Xiaohaizilepis liui gen. et sp. nov. and Taklamakanolepis asiaticus gen. et sp. nov.) together with a new chondrichthyan (Yuanolepis bachunensis gen. et sp. nov.) with scale crowns consisting of a mongolepid-type atubular dentine (lamellin). Unlike the more elaborate crown architecture of mongolepids, Yuanolepis gen. nov. exhibits a single row of crown elements consistent with the condition reported in stem chondrichthyans from the Lower Devonian (e.g. in Seretolepis, Parexus). The results corroborate previous work by recognising lamellin as the main component of sinacanthid spines and point to corresponding developmental patterns shared across the dermal skeleton of taxa with lamellin and more derived chondrichthyans (e.g. Doliodus, Kathemacanthus, Seretolepis and Parexus). The Tarim mongolepid fauna is inclusive of coeval taxa from the South China Block and accounts for over two-thirds of the species currently attributed to Mongolepidida. This demonstrates considerable overlap between the Tarim and South China components of the Lower Silurian Zhangjiajie Vertebrate Fauna."
https://openalex.org/W3006073532,"A central and still open question regarding the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, concerns the processes that underlie the generation of MHC-presented autoantigenic epitopes that become targets of autoimmune attack. Proteasomal degradation is a key step in processing of proteins for MHC class I presentation. Different types of proteasomes can be expressed in cells dictating the repertoire of peptides presented by the MHC class I complex. Of particular interest for type 1 diabetes is the proteasomal configuration of pancreatic β cells, as this might facilitate autoantigen presentation by β cells and thereby their T-cell mediated destruction. Here we investigated whether so-called inducible subunits of the proteasome are constitutively expressed in β cells, regulated by inflammatory signals and participate in the formation of active intermediate or immuno-proteasomes. We show that inducible proteasomal subunits are constitutively expressed in human and rodent islets and an insulin-secreting cell-line. Moreover, the β5i subunit is incorporated into active intermediate proteasomes that are bound to 19S or 11S regulatory particles. Finally, inducible subunit expression along with increase in total proteasome activities are further upregulated by low concentrations of IL-1β stimulating proinsulin biosynthesis. These findings suggest that the β cell proteasomal repertoire is more diverse than assumed previously and may be highly responsive to a local inflammatory islet environment."
https://openalex.org/W3005930576,"Functional traits have emerged as a key to understand species responses to environmental conditions. The concerted expression of multiple traits gives rise to the phenotype of each individual, which is the one interacting with the environment and evolving. However, patterns of trait covariation and how they vary in response to environmental conditions remain poorly understood, particularly at the intraspecific scale. Here, we have measured traits at different scales and in different organs, and analysed their covariation in a large number of conspecifics distributed in two contrasting environments. We expected significant correlations among traits, not only within clusters of traits as found in global, multispecies studies, but also among clusters, with more relationships within clusters, due to genetic constraints, and among clusters due to more coordinated phenotypes than community level, multispecies studies. We surveyed 100 Pinus sylvestris trees in a Mediterranean mountainous area distributed in two contrasting elevations. We measured 13 functional traits, in three clusters (leaf, stem and whole-plant traits), and analysed their variation and coordination. We found significant coordination among traits belonging to different clusters that reveals coordinated phenotypes. However, we found fewer correlations within trait clusters than initially expected. Trait correlation structures (number, intensity and type of correlations among traits) differed among individuals at different elevations. We observed more correlations within trait clusters at low elevation compared to those at high elevation. Moreover, the higher number of correlations among different trait clusters and the lower trait variation at the higher elevation suggests that variability decreases under more stressful conditions. Altogether, our results reveal that traits at intraspecific scale are coordinated in a broad network and not only within clusters of traits but also that this trait covariation is significantly affected by environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3005943638,"Dental calculus (DC) is the most widespread oral problem in domestic dogs. Chewing items are used to remove DC from the tooth surface; they also favor oral health and animal welfare. Raw beef bone mastication also shortly reduces DC in adult dogs. However, it can cause oral lesions and hence is not popular. This study evaluated the impact of bone mastication on the dental roots, enamel, and gingiva of dogs. Twelve adult Beagle dogs were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups in a completely randomized block design: cortical bone (CB) or spongy bone (SB). Intraoral radiographs were obtained on days 0 and 14, and calculus assessment was performed using images captured on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 14; an integration program was used to measure the proportion between the area covered by calculus and the total area of teeth. DC was completely removed from the first and second premolars and molars from both the arcades in less than 3 days of supplementation, indicating that these teeth were frequently used for chewing (P < 0.10). Bones were highly effective for DC removal and gingival inflammation reduction. Despite the hardness of bones, no lesions or teeth root and enamel fracture, or esophageal or intestinal obstructions-complications related to bone ingestion-were noted. However, SB showed some gingival lesions (n = 4) and bone remnants between teeth (n = 2). Gingival lesions were caused by the daily and continuous supply of new pieces of bone for 13 days. Specific pieces of bone should be used for oral home care programs because they shortly remove almost 90% of DC, allowing longer intervals between periodontal cleaning procedures. Long-term studies are required to evaluate the use of bones and evaluate their impact on teeth and periodontium after prolonged supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W3005957628,"Introduction It is well known that a difficulty in forming lexical representations is a strong predictor of reading and spelling difficulties even after controlling for the effects of other cognitive skills. Our study had two main interrelated aims. First, we wanted to examine whether the ability to learn new written words (lexical learning) varies as a function of the orthographic consistency of the language of the learner. Second, we wanted to evaluate the cognitive abilities involved in orthographic lexical learning and whether they differed as a function of language consistency. Method 163 Italian children and 128 English children performed a lexical learning task as well as tasks assessing several cognitive skills potentially related to the ability to establish orthographic representations. Results We found that children learning an orthographic inconsistent orthography (English) were better able to learn novel written words presented in association with pictures than children learning a consistent orthography (Italian). This was true for both younger and older primary school children and also when children were matched for school grade. Lexical learning may be better in English children because the many irregularities of this language promote storing in memory whole-word representations and processing larger orthographic units. In Italian, instead, reading can be accomplished successfully on the basis of grapheme-phoneme conversion rules and on processing smaller orthographic units. This interpretation was supported by the pattern of cognitive skills associated with lexical learning skills in the two languages. Variations in lexical learning were explained by spatial visual memory and phonological awareness tasks in both languages, but phonological STM explained further variance in Italian, while a task tapping visuo-attentional capacity explained further variance in English. Conclusion Learning a language with inconsistent orthography is associated with better lexical learning skills in children at different stages of primary school; the pattern of cognitive skills associated with lexical learning skills is also partially modulated by orthographic consistency."
https://openalex.org/W3006068817,"In commercial wild capture pelagic fisheries it is common practice to crowd catches to high densities to allow efficient pumping onboard. Crowding during the final stages of purse seine capture for small pelagic species often results in intense and sustained behavioural escape responses. Such a response may trigger a shift in energy production from aerobic to anaerobic pathways and result in metabolic acid accumulation and exhaustion of intracellular reserves of ATP. Where there is insufficient time or opportunity to recover to physiological equilibrium before death, pre-mortem stress may be an important determinant of fillet quality, as has been shown for a variety of farmed fish species. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge related to the flesh quality implications of capture stress for wild captured species in European waters. Here we show that crowding results in a physiological stress response that has consequences for flesh quality in the wild captured species Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). Using small schools in tanks and aquaculture net pens in three separate experiments, we found crowding results in physiological changes in mackerel consistent with an acute stress response and anaerobic metabolism. Consequently, we found crowded fish had more acidic pre- and post-mortem muscle pH as well as indications of faster onset and strength of rigor mortis and increased cathepsin B & L activity. We examined fillet flesh quality after two and seven days of ice storage and found reduced green colouration, increased gaping (separation of muscle myotomes) and reduced textural firmness associated with fish which had been crowded. However, the effects on quality were dependant on experiment and/or storage time. These results indicate the potential of crowding capture stress to influence the flesh quality of an economically important species and may have important implications for the wild capture pelagic fishing industry."

There are currently no approved treatments for this disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine if citicoline was safe for the treatment of tremor and balance abnormalities and to stabilize cognitive decline in patients with FXTAS. Ten participants with diagnosed FXTAS were administered 1000 mg of citicoline once daily for 12 months. Outcome measures and neurological examination were performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome was the FXTAS Rating Scale score. Secondary outcomes included change in a battery of neuropsychological tests, an instrumented Timed up and go test, computerized dynamic posturography, 9-hole pegboard test, and balance confidence and psychiatric symptom questionnaires. Safety was also evaluated. Citicoline treatment resulted in minimal adverse events in all but one subject over the course of the study. There was a significant improvement in the Beck Anxiety Inventory (p = 0.03) and the Stroop Color-Word test (p = 0.03), with all other measures remaining stable over the course of 12 months. This open-label pilot trial of citicoline for individuals with FXTAS showed that it is safe and well tolerated in this population. Registration: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

https://openalex.org/W3005535814,"Objectives Reliable biomarkers for renal fibrosis are needed for clinical care and for research. Existing non-invasive biomarkers are imprecise, which has limited their utility. Methods We developed a method to quantify fibrosis by subject size-adjusted CT Hounsfield units. This was accomplished using CT measurements of renal cortex in previously irradiated non-human primates. Results Renal cortex mean CT Hounsfield units that were adjusted for body size had a very good direct correlation with renal parenchymal fibrosis, with an area under the curve of 0.93. Conclusions This metric is a promising and simple non-invasive biomarker for renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3006516731,"The Rab GTPase activating protein known as Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160 or TBC1D4) regulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, the heart, and white adipose tissue (WAT). A novel rat AS160-knockout (AS160-KO) was created with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Because female AS160-KO versus wild type (WT) rats had not been previously evaluated, the primary objective of this study was to compare female AS160-KO rats with WT controls for multiple, important metabolism-related endpoints. Body mass and composition, physical activity, and energy expenditure were not different between genotypes. AS160-KO versus WT rats were glucose intolerant based on an oral glucose tolerance test (P<0.001) and insulin resistant based on a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC; P<0.001). Tissue glucose uptake during the HEC of female AS160-KO versus WT rats was: 1) significantly lower in epitrochlearis (P<0.05) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL; P<0.01) muscles of AS160-KO compared to WT rats; 2) not different in soleus, gastrocnemius or WAT; and 3) ~3-fold greater in the heart (P<0.05). GLUT4 protein content was reduced in AS160-KO versus WT rats in the epitrochlearis (P<0.05), EDL (P<0.05), gastrocnemius (P<0.05), soleus (P<0.05), WAT (P<0.05), and the heart (P<0.005). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by isolated epitrochlearis and soleus muscles was lower (P<0.001) in AS160-KO versus WT rats. Akt phosphorylation of insulin-stimulated tissues was not different between the genotypes. A secondary objective was to probe processes that might account for the genotype-related increase in myocardial glucose uptake, including glucose transporter protein abundance (GLUT1, GLUT4, GLUT8, SGLT1), hexokinase II protein abundance, and stimulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. None of these parameters differed between genotypes. Metabolic phenotyping in the current study revealed AS160 deficiency produced a profound glucoregulatory phenotype in female AS160-KO rats that was strikingly similar to the results previously reported in male AS160-KO rats."
https://openalex.org/W3005807040,"Little is known about the molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus in Chinese neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We describe the molecular epidemiology of S. aureus isolated from neonates on admission to Beijing Children's Hospital.From May 2015-March 2016, nasal swabs were obtained on admission from 536 neonates. Cultures were also obtained from body sites with suspected infections. S. aureus isolates were characterized by staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec) type, staphylococcal protein A (spa) type, multilocus sequence type (MLST), sasX gene, antimicrobial susceptibility and cytotoxicity. Logistic regression assessed risk factors for colonization.Overall, 92 (17%) infants were colonized with S. aureus and 20 (3.7%) were diagnosed with culture-positive S. aureus infection. Of the colonized infants, 70% (64/92) harbored methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 30% (28/92) harbored methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) while 70% (14/20) of infected infants were culture-positive for MRSA, 30% (6/20) were culture-positive for MSSA. Risk factors for colonization included female sex, age 7-28 days, higher birthweight (3270 IQR [2020-3655] grams) and vaginal delivery (p<0.05). The most common MRSA and MSSA clones were community-associated ST59-SCCmecIVa-t437 (60%) and ST188-t189 (15%), respectively. The sasX gene was not detected. Some MSSA isolates (16%) were penicillin-susceptible and some MRSA isolates (18%) were oxacillin-susceptible. MRSA and MSSA had similar cytotoxicity, but colonizing strains were less cytotoxic than strains associated with infections.S. aureus colonization was common in infants admitted to our NICU and two community-associated clones predominated. Several non-modifiable risk factors for S. aureus colonization were identified. These results suggest that screening infants for S. aureus upon admission and targeting decolonization of high-risk infants and/or those colonized with high-risk clones could be useful to prevent transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3006438204,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 subtype (M1 ) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 subtype (M2 ) presynaptic muscarinic receptor subtypes increase and decrease, respectively, neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions. M2 involves protein kinase A (PKA), although the muscarinic regulation to form and inactivate the PKA holoenzyme is unknown. Here, we show that M2 signaling inhibits PKA by downregulating Cβ subunit, upregulating RIIα/β and liberating RIβ and RIIα to the cytosol. This promotes PKA holoenzyme formation and reduces the phosphorylation of the transmitter release target synaptosome-associated protein 25 and the gene regulator cAMP response element binding. Instead, M1 signaling, which is downregulated by M2 , opposes to M2 by recruiting R subunits to the membrane. The M1 and M2 reciprocal actions are performed through the anchoring protein A kinase anchor protein 150 as a common node. Interestingly, M2 modulation on protein expression needs M1 signaling. Altogether, these results describe the dynamics of PKA subunits upon M2 muscarinic signaling in basal and under presynaptic nerve activity, uncover a specific involvement of the M1 receptor and reveal the M1 /M2 balance to activate PKA to regulate neurotransmission. This provides a molecular mechanism to the PKA holoenzyme formation and inactivation which could be general to other synapses and cellular models."
https://openalex.org/W3006229362,"The use of plant tissue analysis as a tool for attaining low cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava roots, has hardly been investigated. Just as the quality of crops is improved through the use of plant tissue analysis, the same can probably be done to consistently attain the lowest possible cyanogenic glucoside levels in cassava roots. High levels of cyanogenic glucosides in consumed fresh cassava roots or in their products have the potential of causing cyanide intoxication, hence the need to lower them. An experiment was thus conducted to assess the occurrence of meaningful relationships between plant nutritional status and cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava roots. Total hydrogen cyanide (HCN) levels in cassava roots were used to assess cyanogenic glucoside production. Using NPK fertiliser application to induce changes in plant nutritional status, the main objective of the study was investigated using the following sub-objectives; (1) to determine the effects of increased NPK fertiliser application on cassava root HCN levels; (2) and to show the occurrence of relationships between changes in nutrient levels in plant ‘indicator tissue’ and HCN levels in cassava roots. The study was a field experiment laid out as a split-plot in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. It was repeated in two consecutive years, with soil nutrient deficiencies only being corrected in the second year. The varieties Salanga, Kalinda, Supa and Kiroba were used in the experiment, while the NPK fertiliser treatments included; a control with no fertiliser applied; a moderate NPK treatment (50 kg N + 10 kg P + 50 kg K /ha); and a high NPK treatment (100 kg N + 25 kg P + 100 kg K /ha). A potassium only treatment (50 kg K/ha) was also included, but mainly for comparison. The root HCN levels of Salanga, Kalinda and Kiroba were significantly influenced by NPK fertiliser application in at least one of the two field experiments, while those of Supa remained uninfluenced. Changes in plant nutritional status in response to fertiliser application were thus shown to influence cyanogenic glucoside production. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis for the first field experiment, generally showed that the root HCN levels of some cassava varieties could have been ‘reduced’ by decreasing concentrations of nitrogen, potassium and magnesium in plants, or by improving plant calcium concentrations along with NPK fertiliser application. However, in the second field experiment (with corrected soil nutrient deficiencies) the regression analysis generally showed that the root HCN levels of some cassava varieties could have been ‘reduced’ by improving either one or a combination of the nutrients phosphorous, zinc and potassium in plants along with NPK fertiliser application. Although the results obtained in the two experiments had been contradicting due to slight differences in how they were conducted, the study had nonetheless demonstrated the occurrence of meaningful relationships between plant nutritional status and cyanogenic glucoside production; confirming the possible use of plant tissue analysis in predicting fertiliser needs for the consistent attainment of low cyanogenic glucosides in cassava roots."
https://openalex.org/W3006603397,"Background Timely and appropriate health care seeking for diarrhea of under-five children is important to reduce severe and life-threatening complications. However, different findings indicate that mothers of under-five children often delay in seeking care which in turn contributes to the death of large number of children without ever reaching a health facility. Therefore, a proper pinpointing of determinants of delay in seeking care informs intervention strategies for health service planners. Objectives Of this study was to identify the determinants of delay in care seeking for diarrheal disease among mothers/caregivers of under-five children in public health facilities of Arba Minch town, South Ethiopia, 2019. Methods Facility based case control study was conducted from March 4 to April 30, 2019. Total sample size was 400. Cases were selected by systematic random sampling technique while controls were mothers of under-five children with signs and symptoms of diarrhea who came to the same health facility within 24 hours following cases. Data was collected by using pretested structured questionnaire by three data collectors and entered into EpiData V4 and exported to SPSS V23 for further analysis. Bivariable logistic regression was done to identify variables candidate for Multivariable LR at p-value<0.25. Multivariable logistic regression was done and p-value <0.05 and 95%CI of AOR was used to declare statistical significance. Result Female sex[AOR = 1.93, (95%CI: 1.11,3.36)], child age <24 months[AOR = 4.47,95%CI:2.51,7.97)], mothers’/caregivers without formal education[AOR = 6.90, (95%CI:3.10,15.37)], and attended primary school [AOR = 3.12,(95%CI:1.44,6.73)], poorest household wealth index category[AOR = 2.81, (95%CI:1.20,6.58) and poor household wealth index category [AOR = 2.61,(95%CI: 1.12, 6.09)], mothers/caregivers who did not visit health facility to first episode diarrhea [AOR = 4.55, (95%CI:2.41,8.59)], mothers/caregivers who were satisfied in the last six month visit [AOR = 0.29, (95%CI:0.15,0.55)], and poor perceived health care professionals respect[AOR = 4.91, (95%CI:2.64,9.15)] were important determinants of delay in seeking care. Conclusions Sex and age of the child, educational status of the mother/caregiver, poor wealth index category, not visiting health facility at first response, satisfaction with the care and examination, and respect of health care professionals were important determinants of delay in seeking care among mothers/caregivers of under-five children with diarrhea illness. All concerned body should focus interventions on poor and less educated mothers/caregivers with emphasis on female children and <24 months. Health workers are needed to provide respectful service to promote satisfaction level of clients."

We aimed to assess the effect of diuretics on urine output, vasopressor dose, acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence, and need for renal replacement therapies (RRT) among patients who receive vasopressors.This is a single-center retrospective study of all adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit between January 2006 and December 2016 and received >6 hours of vasopressor therapy and at least one concomitant dose of diuretic. We excluded patients from cardiac care units. Hourly urine output and vasopressor dose for 6 hours before and after the first dose of diuretic therapy was compared. Rates of AKI development and RRT initiation were assessed with a propensity-matched cohort of patients who received vasopressors but did not receive diuretics.There was an increasing trend of prescribing diuretics in patients receiving vasopressors over the course of the study. We included 939 patients with median (IQR) age of 68(57, 78) years old and 400 (43%) female. The average hourly urine output during the first six hours following time zero in comparison with average hourly urine output during the six hours prior to time zero was significantly higher in diuretic group in comparison with patients who did not receive diuretics [81 (95% CI 73-89) ml/h vs. 42 (95% CI 39-45) ml/h, respectively; p<0.001]. After propensity matching, the rate of AKI within 7 days of exposure and the need for RRT were similar between the study and matched control patients (66 (15.6%) vs. 83 (19.6%), p = 0.11, and 34 (8.0%) vs. 37 (8.7%), p = 0.69, respectively). Mortality, however, was higher in the group that received diuretics. Ninety-day mortality was 191 (45.2%) in the exposed group VS 156 (36.9%) p = .009.While the use of diuretic therapy in critically ill patients receiving vasopressor infusions augmented urine output, it was not associated with higher vasopressor requirements, AKI incidence, and need for renal replacement therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3005652547,"In order to study driving performance at the opening section of median strip (hereafter OSMS) on the freeway capacity expansion project, this study separately controlled 9 different simulated experimental scenarios of OSMS length and freeway traffic flow. 25 participants were recruited to perform 225 simulated driving tests using the driving simulator, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the driving characteristics which can represent the safety context. The results show that the safety parameters of driving are different when the length of OSMS and the traffic flow are different. When the traffic flow is low or moderate, the OSMS length can significantly affect the speed of the vehicle and the maximum values of time to collision. The higher the traffic flow, the smaller the minimum values of time headway. As the length of the OSMS decreases, the vehicles are more generally concentrated at the end of the opening area with the minimum values of time headway. The study also found that when the traffic volume is high, the impact of the OSMS length on driving performance will be weakened. In addition, the OSMS length and the traffic flow have little impact on driving comfort. Additionally, when the traffic flow is low or moderate, the opening length can significantly affect the driving behavior and safety of the vehicle. However, when the traffic volume is high, the impact of the opening length on them will be relatively weakened to some extent. Therefore, it is advised that in the case of freeways with large traffic volume, merely extending the length of the opening section does not necessarily optimize safety. Rather, the actual traffic density of the road should be carefully considered before a design length is adopted."
https://openalex.org/W3005813293,"This study examined the capsular phenotype and genotype of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD)-associated Neisseria meningitidis recovered in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) between 1996 and 2015. This time period encompasses both pre- (when IMD was hyperendemic in the RoI) and post- meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine introduction. In total, 1327 isolates representing over one-third of all laboratory-confirmed cases of IMD diagnosed each epidemiological year (EY), were characterised. Serogroups B (menB) and C (menC) predominated throughout, although their relative abundance changed; with an initial increase in the proportion of menC in the late 1990s followed by their dramatic reduction post-MCC vaccine implementation and a concomitant dominance of menB, despite an overall decline in IMD incidence. While the increase in menC was associated with expansion of specific clonal-complexes (cc), cc11 and cc8; the dominance of menB was not. There was considerable variation in menB-associated cc with declines in cc41/44 and cc32, and increases in cc269 and cc461, contributing to a significant increase in the clonal diversity of menB isolates over the study. This increase in diversity was also displayed among the serosubtyping data, with significant declines in proportions of menB isolates expressing p1.4 and p1.15 antigens. These data highlight the changing diversity of IMD-associated meningococci since 1996 in the RoI and emphasise the need for on-going surveillance particularly in view of the recent introduction of a menB vaccine."

Moreover, we demonstrate that macroprices change in clusters, and we identify these clusters. Firms are not symmetric. Overall, our analysis suggests that the inertia arising from input/output linkages in production explains the behavior of aggregate prices."
https://openalex.org/W3006324278,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children and adolescents is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Early detection of vascular dysfunction is key to patient management yet current assessment techniques are invasive and not suitable for pediatric patient populations. A novel approach using isometric handgrip exercise during magnetic resonance imaging (IHE-MRI) has recently been developed to evaluate coronary endothelial function non-invasively in adults. This project aimed to assess endothelium-dependent coronary arterial response to IHE-MRI in children with T1DM and in age matched healthy controls.Healthy volunteers and children with T1DM (>5 years) were recruited. IHE-MRI cross-sectional coronary artery area measurements were recorded at rest and under stress. Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed for comparison. Student's t-tests were used to compare results between groups.Seven children with T1DM (3 female, median 14.8 years, mean 14.8 ± 1.9 years) and 16 healthy controls (7 female, median 14.8 years, mean 14.2 ± 2.4 years) participated. A significant increase in stress-induced cross-sectional coronary area was measured in controls (5.4 mm2 at rest to 6.39 mm2 under stress, 18.8 ± 10.7%, p = 0.0004). In contrast, mean area change in patients with T1DM was not significant (7.17 mm2 at rest to 7.59 mm2 under stress, 10.5% ± 28.1%, p = n.s.). There was no significant difference in the results for neither PWV nor CIMT between patients and controls, (5.3±1.5 m/s vs.4.8±0.7 m/s and 0.4±0.03mm vs.0.46 mm ± 0.03 respectively, both p = n.s.).Our pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using a totally non-invasive IHE-MRI technique in children and adolescents with and without T1DM. Preliminary results suggest a blunted endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotor function in children with T1DM (>5 years). Better knowledge and new methodologies may improve surveillance and care for T1DM patients to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3004955663,"It is not currently possible to reliably visualise and track immune cells in the human central nervous system or eye. Previous work demonstrated that indocyanine green (ICG) dye could label immune cells and be imaged after a delay during disease in the mouse retina. We report a pilot study investigating if ICG can similarly label immune cells within the human retina. Twelve adult participants receiving ICG angiography as part of routine standard of care were recruited. Baseline retinal images were obtained prior to ICG administration then repeated over a period ranging from 2 hours to 9 days. Matched peripheral blood samples were obtained to examine systemic immune cell labelling and activation from ICG by flow cytometry with human macrophage cultures as positive controls. Differences between the delayed near infrared ICG imaging and 488 nm autofluorescence was observed across pathologies, likely arising from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Only one subject demonstrated ICG signal on peripheral blood myeloid cells and only three distinct cell-sized signals appeared over time within the retina of three participants. No significant increase in immune cell activation markers were detected after ICG administration. ICG accumulated in the endosomes of macrophage cultures and was detectable above a minimum concentration, suggesting cell labelling is possible. ICG can label RPE and may be used as an additional biomarker for RPE health across a range of retinal disorders. Standard clinical doses of intravenous ICG do not lead to robust immune cell labelling in human blood or retina and further optimisation in dose and route are required."
https://openalex.org/W3005725996,"Significant advancements in the field of protein structure prediction have necessitated the need for objective and robust evaluation of protein structural models by comparing predicted models against the experimentally determined native structures to quantitate their structural similarities. Existing protein model versus native similarity metrics either consider the distances between alpha carbon (Cα) or side-chain atoms for computing the similarity. However, side-chain orientation of a protein plays a critical role in defining its conformation at the atomic-level. Despite its importance, inclusion of side-chain orientation in structural similarity evaluation has not yet been addressed. Here, we present SPECS, a side-chain-orientation-included protein model-native similarity metric for improved evaluation of protein structural models. SPECS combines side-chain orientation and global distance based measures in an integrated framework using the united-residue model of polypeptide conformation for computing model-native similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPECS is a reliable measure for evaluating structural similarity at the global level including and beyond the accuracy of Cα positioning. Moreover, SPECS delivers superior performance in capturing local quality aspect compared to popular global Cα positioning-based metrics ranging from models at near-experimental accuracies to models with correct overall folds-making it a robust measure suitable for both high- and moderate-resolution models. Finally, SPECS is sensitive to minute variations in side-chain χ angles even for models with perfect Cα trace, revealing the power of including side-chain orientation. Collectively, SPECS is a versatile evaluation metric covering a wide spectrum of protein modeling scenarios and simultaneously captures complementary aspects of structural similarities at multiple levels of granularities.

https://openalex.org/W3005750700,"Background CMV infection of the fetus or neonate can lead to devastating disease, and there are no effective prevention strategies to date. Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator, supports antiviral immune responses, and plays an important role in placental immunity. Methods Retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of low maternal vitamin D on congenital and early postnatal transmission of CMV among HIV-infected, non-breastfeeding women and their HIV exposed but negative infants from an urban HIV clinic. Vitamin D panel was performed on stored maternal plasma obtained near time of delivery. Infant CMV testing at 0–6 months included urine and oral cultures, and/or serum polymerase chain reaction testing. Results Cohort included 340 mother-infant pairs (births 1991–2014). Among 38 infants (11%) with a CMV+ test between 0–6 months, 4.7% (14/300) had congenital CMV transmission (CMV+ test 0–3 weeks), and 7.6% (24/315) had peri/postnatal CMV (CMV+ test >3 weeks-6 months). Women with lower calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), the active form of vitamin D, were more likely to have an infant with congenital (OR 12.2 [95% CI 1.61–92.2] P = 0.02) and peri/postnatal (OR 9.84 [95% CI 2.63–36.8] P = 0.0007) infections in multivariate analyses, independent of maternal HIV viral load and CD4 count. Conclusion This study demonstrates an association between inadequate maternal calcitriol during pregnancy and increased congenital and early postnatal acquisition of CMV among non-breastfeeding women with HIV and their HIV negative infants."
https://openalex.org/W3005888133,"As Bacillus anthracis spores pose a proven bio-terror risk, the treatment focus has shifted from exposed populations to anthrax patients and the need for effective antibiotic treatment protocols increases. The CDC recommends carbapenems and Linezolid (oxazolidinone), for the treatment of anthrax, particularly for the late, meningeal stages of the disease. Previously we demonstrated that treatment with Meropenem or Linezolid, either as a single treatment or in combination with Ciprofloxacin, fails to protect rabbits from anthrax-meningitis. In addition, we showed that the failure of Meropenem was due to slow BBB penetration rather than low antibacterial activity. Herein, we tested the effect of increasing the dose of the antibiotic on treatment efficacy. We found that for full protection (88% cure rate) the dose should be increased four-fold from 40 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg. In addition, B. anthracis is a genetically stable bacterium and naturally occurring multidrug resistant B. anthracis strains have not been reported. In this manuscript, we report the efficacy of classical β-lactams as a single treatment or in combination with β-lactamase inhibitors in treating anthrax meningitis. We demonstrate that Ampicillin based treatment of anthrax meningitis is largely efficient (66%). The high efficacy (88–100%) of Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulonic acid) and Unasyn (Ampicillin and Sulbactam) makes them a favorable choice due to reports of β-lactam resistant B. anthracis strains. Tazocin (Piperacillin and Tazobactam) proved inefficient compared to the highly efficient Augmentin and Unasyn."

We here show that DRD2 interacts with CHL1 in mouse brain, as evidenced by co-immunostaining, proximity ligation assay, co-immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assay with recombinant extracellular CHL1 domain fused to Fc (CHL1-Fc). Direct binding of CHL1-Fc to the first extracellular loop of DRD2 was shown by ELISA. Using HEK cells transfected to co-express CHL1 and the short (DRD2-S) or long (DRD2-L) DRD2 isoforms, co-localization of CHL1 and both isoforms was observed by immunostaining and proximity ligation assay. Moreover, CHL1 inhibited agonist-triggered internalization of DRD2-S. Proximity ligation assay showed close interaction between CHL1 and DRD2 in neurons expressing dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP32) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in tissue sections of adult mouse striatum. In cultures of striatum or ventral midbrain, CHL1 was also closely associated with DRD2 in DARPP32- or TH-immunopositive cells, respectively. In the dorsal striatum of CHL1-deficient mice, lower levels of DRD2 and phosphorylated TH were observed, when compared to wild-type littermates. In the ventral striatum of CHL1-deficient mice, levels of phosphorylated DARPP32 were reduced. We propose that CHL1 regulates DRD2-dependent presynaptic and postsynaptic functions."
https://openalex.org/W3006501162,"Aim of the study Bystander-initiated basic life support (BLS) for the treatment of prehospital cardiac arrest increases survival but is frequently not performed due to fear and a lack of knowledge. A simple flowchart can improve motivation and the quality of performance. Furthermore, guidelines do recommend a chest compression (CC)-only algorithm for dispatcher-assisted bystander resuscitation, which may lead to increased fatigue and a loss of compression depth. Consequently, we wanted to test the hypothesis that CCs are more correctly delivered in a flowchart-assisted standard resuscitation algorithm than in a CC-only algorithm. Methods With the use of a manikin model, 84 laypersons were randomized to perform either flowchart-assisted standard resuscitation or CC-only resuscitation for 5min. The primary outcome was the total number of CCs. Results The total number of correct CCs did not significantly differ between the CC-only group and the standard group (63 [±81] vs. 79 [±86]; p = 0.394; 95% CI of difference: 21–53). The total hand-off time was significantly lower in the CC-only group than in the standard BLS group. The relative number of correct CCs (the fraction of the total number of CCs achieving 5-6cm) and the level of exhaustion after BLS did not significantly differ between the groups. Conclusion Standard BLS did not lead to an increase in correctly delivered CCs compared to CC-only resuscitation and exhibited significantly more hand-off time. The low rate of CCs in both groups indicates the need for an increased focus on performance during BLS training."
https://openalex.org/W3005623488,"The link between anger and bodily states is readily apparent based on the autonomic and behavioral responses elicited. In everyday life angry people react in different ways, from being agitated with an increased heart rate to remaining silent or detached. Neuroimaging evidence supports the role of mid-posterior insula and midcingulate cortex/MCC as key nodes of a sensorimotor network that predominantly responds to salient stimuli, integration of interoceptive and autonomic information, as well as to awareness of bodily movements for coordinated motion. However, there is still a lack of clarity concerning how interindividual variability in bodily states reactions drives the connectivity within these key nodes in the sensorimotor network during anger processing. Therefore, we investigated whether individual differences in body-centered emotional experience, that is an active (inward prone) or inactive (outward prone) emotion-body connection disposition, would differently affect the information flow within these brain regions. Two groups of participants underwent fMRI scanning session watching video clips of actors performing simple actions with angry and joyful facial expressions. The whole-brain group-by-session interaction analysis showed that the bilateral insula and the right MCC were selectively activated by inward group during the angry session, whereas the outward group activated more the precuneus during the joyful session. Accordingly, dynamic causal modeling analyses (DCM) revealed an excitatory modulatory effect exerted by anger all over the insulae-MCC connectivity in the inward group, whereas in the outward group the modulatory effect exerted was inhibitory. Modeling the variability related to individual differences in body-centered emotional experience allowed to better explain to what extent subjective dispositions contributed to the insular activity and its connectivity. In addition, from the perspective of a hierarchical model of neurovisceral integration, these findings add knowledge to the multiple ways which the insula and MCC dynamically integrate affective and bodily aspects of the human experience."
https://openalex.org/W3006224274,"Since activation of the sympathetic nervous system is associated with both impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, or namely with diabetes, evaluation of such activation in ordinary clinical settings may be important. Therefore, we evaluated the relationships between urinary concentrations of the catecholamine metabolites, urinary normetanephrine (U-NM) and urinary metanephrine (U-M), and glucose metabolism in a general population. From 1,148 participants in the 2016 population-based Iwaki study of Japanese, enrolled were 733 individuals (gender (M/F): 320/413; age: 52.1±15.1), who were not on medication affecting serum catecholamines, not diabetic, and had complete data-set and blood glucose levels appropriate for the evaluation of insulin secretion and resistance, using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-β and HOMA-R, respectively). Univariate linear regression analyses revealed significant correlations between both U-NM and U-M, and HOMA-β, but adjustment for multiple factors correlated with HOMA indices abolished these (β = -0.031, p = 0.499, and β = -0.055, p = 0.135, respectively). However, the correlation between U-NM and HOMA-R observed using univariate linear regression analysis (β = 0.132, p<0.001) remained significant even after these adjustments (β = 0.107, p = 0.007), whereas U-M did not correlate with HOMA-R. Furthermore, use of the optimal cut-off value of U-NM for the prediction of insulin resistance (HOMA-R >1.6) determined by ROC analysis (0.2577 mg/gCr) showed that individuals at risk had an odds ratio of 2.65 (confidence interval: 1.42–4.97) after adjustment for the same factors used above. Higher U-NM concentrations within the physiologic range are a significant risk factor for increased insulin resistance in a general Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W3006659217,"Puma (Puma concolor) management in the western United States is highly contentious, particularly with regard to the use of sport hunting as a management tool. Since the 1970s, puma in ten western states have been managed by state fish and game agencies through the use of a sport hunt. The rationale presented by wildlife managers is that sport hunting, in addition to providing recreational hunting opportunities, also reduces threats to human safety and livestock safety, and increases populations of the puma’s ungulate prey, namely deer (Odocoileus sp.) and elk (Cervus elepus). We evaluated these claims using the state of California as a control, which has prohibited sport hunting since 1972, and employing data obtained from state and federal agencies with authority and control over puma management. Specifically, we tested four hypotheses: 1) sport hunting will suppress puma populations, 2) sport hunting will reduce the number of problematic puma-human encounters; 3) sport hunting will reduce puma predation on domestic livestock, and 4) sport hunting will reduce the impact of puma predation on wild ungulate numbers, resulting in increased hunting opportunities for the sport hunt of ungulates. Our results indicated, respectively, that relative to the 10 states where puma are hunted, California had 1) similar puma densities, 2) the 3rd lowest per capita problematic puma-human encounters, 3) similar per capita loss of cattle (P = 0.13) and a significantly lower (t = 5.7, P < 0.001) per capita loss of sheep, and 4) similar average deer densities while changes in annual deer populations correlated with changes in other states (F = 95.4, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.68). In sum, our analysis of the records obtained from state and federal wildlife agencies found no evidence that sport hunting of pumas has produced the management outcomes sought by wildlife managers aside from providing a sport hunting opportunity. Consequently, and particularly because other research suggests that sport hunting actually exacerbate conflicts between pumas and humans, we recommend that state agencies re-assess the use of sport hunting as a management tool for pumas."
https://openalex.org/W3005844873,"This study uses YouTube content to explore trends in nursing start-ups. YouTube content can be used to understand the current trends regarding interest and awareness in various fields. The study was conducted in three stages: text mining, Delphi survey, and comparison. The frequency and degree centrality of keywords were analyzed in the text mining stage. In the Delphi survey, the 100 most frequent keywords were classified using a synthesis framework for nursing start-ups. In the comparison stage, the results of text mining and the Delphi survey were matched using a 2x2 matrix. Text mining identified “area,” “business,” “competence,” “idea,” and “success” as the most commonly used keywords. The keywords that showed the highest level of classification agreement in Delphi were “motivation,” “advice,” “obstacle,” “business,” “charisma,” and “result.” In the comparison using a 2x2 matrix, “dream,” “idea,” “opportunity,” “leadership,” “success,” “benefit,” and “satisfaction” emerged. The results indicate that interest in nursing start-ups develops at an early stage. In order to encourage nursing start-ups, it is necessary to strengthen business skills such as finance and budgeting, establish active policy support for such start-ups, and develop new nursing start-up items appropriate for the Fourth Industrial Revolution."
https://openalex.org/W3005935668,"There is a correlation between the endocannabinoid system and hepatic fibrosis based on the activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors; where CB1 has profibrogenic effects. Gene therapy with a plasmid carrying a shRNA for CB1 delivered by hydrodynamic injection has the advantage of hepatic tropism, avoiding possible undesirable effects of CB1 pharmacological inhibition.To evaluate hydrodynamics-based liver transfection in an experimental model of liver cirrhosis of a plasmid with the sequence of a shRNA for CB1 and its antifibrogenic effects.Three shRNA (21pb) were designed for blocking CB1 mRNA at positions 877, 1232 and 1501 (pshCB1-A, B, C). Sequences were cloned in the pENTR™/U6. Safety was evaluated monitoring CB1 expression in brain tissue. The silencing effect was determined in rat HSC primary culture and CCl4 cirrhosis model. Hydrodynamic injection in cirrhotic liver was through iliac vein and with a dose of 3mg/kg plasmid. Serum levels of liver enzymes, mRNA levels of TGF-β1, Col IA1 and α-SMA and the percentage of fibrotic tissue were analyzed.Hydrodynamic injection allows efficient CB1 silencing in cirrhotic livers and pshCB1-B (position 1232) demonstrated the main CB1-silencing. Using this plasmid, mRNA level of fibrogenic molecules and fibrotic tissue considerably decrease in cirrhotic animals. Brain expression of CB1 remained unaltered.Hydrodynamics allows a hepatotropic and secure transfection in cirrhotic animals. The sequence of the shCB1-B carried in a plasmid or any other vector has the potential to be used as therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3006529518,"The rod shape of bacilli is maintained by bacterial cytoskeletal protein MreB, an actin homolog that acts in concert with the inner membrane protein RodZ. We previously reported RodZ binds RNA to control the posttranscriptional regulation of invE (virB), which controls the type III secretion system essential for the virulence of Shigella. Here, we show that purified RodZ forms ""superstructures"" of high molecular mass that dissociate into a midsized ""basal complex"" in the presence of nonionic detergent, or to a monomer in the presence of dithiothreitol. We used mass spectrometry to show that the basal complex was a hexamer. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays combined with gel filtration detected the RNA-binding activity in fractions containing molecules larger than the basal hexamer. The superstructure was consistently detected with MreB in crude cell lysates of S. sonnei that were fractionated using gel filtration. Immunofluorescence microscopy using two different super-resolution settings showed that wild-type RodZ was distributed in cells as separate dots. Consistent with the superstructure comprising homohexamers, majority of the dots distributed among areas of discrete values. In addition, simultaneous immunodetection of MreB provided the first evidence of colocalization with RodZ as larger patch like signals. These findings indicate that native RodZ forms clusters of various sizes, which may correspond to a superstructure comprising multiple hexamers required for the RNA-binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W3006567070,"Development of the songbird brain provides an excellent experimental model for understanding the regulation of sex differences in ontogeny. Considering the regulatory role of the hypothalamus in endocrine, in particular reproductive, physiology, we measured the structural (volume) and molecular correlates of hypothalamic development during ontogeny of male and female zebra finches. We quantified by relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rqPCR) the expression of 14 genes related to thyroid and steroid hormones actions as well as 12 genes related to brain plasticity at four specific time points during ontogeny and compared these expression patterns with the expression of the same genes as detected by transcriptomics in the telencephalon. These two different methodological approaches detected specific changes with age and demonstrated that in a substantial number of cases changes observed in both brain regions are nearly identical. Other genes however had a tissue-specific developmental pattern. Sex differences or interactions of sex by age were detected in the expression of a subset of genes, more in hypothalamus than telencephalon. These results correlate with multiple known aspects of the developmental and reproductive physiology but also raise a number of new functional questions."
