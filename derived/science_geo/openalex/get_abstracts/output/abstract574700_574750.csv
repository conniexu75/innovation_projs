https://openalex.org/W2558041282,"The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. However, a functional link between gut bacteria and neurodegenerative diseases remains unexplored. Synucleinopathies are characterized by aggregation of the protein α-synuclein (αSyn), often resulting in motor dysfunction as exemplified by Parkinson's disease (PD). Using mice that overexpress αSyn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and αSyn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of αSyn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD."

We demonstrate that prolonged interferon signaling orchestrates PDL1-dependent and PDL1-independent resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and to combinations such as radiation plus anti-CTLA4. Persistent type II interferon signaling allows tumors to acquire STAT1-related epigenomic changes and augments expression of interferon-stimulated genes and ligands for multiple T cell inhibitory receptors. Both type I and II interferons maintain this resistance program. Crippling the program genetically or pharmacologically interferes with multiple inhibitory pathways and expands distinct T cell populations with improved function despite expressing markers of severe exhaustion. Consequently, tumors resistant to multi-agent ICB are rendered responsive to ICB monotherapy. Finally, we observe that biomarkers for interferon-driven resistance associate with clinical progression after anti-PD1 therapy.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is rapidly becoming an effective therapeutic option for several cancer types (Topalian et al., 2015Topalian S.L. Drake C.G. Pardoll D.M. Immune checkpoint blockade: a common denominator approach to cancer therapy.Cancer Cell. 2015; 27: 450-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). Despite this success, resistance and relapse are common. One important mechanism of resistance is the upregulation of PDL1 (Topalian et al., 2015Topalian S.L. Drake C.G. Pardoll D.M.

Ciobanu V. et al.PD-1 blockade induces responses by inhibiting adaptive immune resistance.Nature. 2014; 515: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (4394) Google Scholar), a ligand for the T cell inhibitory receptor PD1. T cell inhibitory receptors (TCIRs), or immune checkpoint receptors, such as PD1, promote tolerance to self-antigens and limit immune-mediated pathology that can result from persistent antigen and chronic inflammation (Pauken and Wherry, 2015Pauken K.E. Wherry E.J. Overcoming T cell exhaustion in infection and cancer.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). PD1 serves this negative regulatory function by promoting T cell exhaustion. Exhausted T cells (TEX) have reduced proliferative and functional capacity that includes diminished cytokine and cytolytic activity. This dysfunctional state can be partially reversed, or reinvigorated, to improve effector function. Hence, the clinical activity of PD1/PDL1 blockade in cancer may be related to the reinvigoration of TEX that develops as a result of a pre-existing immune response or to preventing the development of TEX after therapy is initiated. An additional hallmark of TEX is the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA4, TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and others (Blackburn et al., 2009Blackburn S.D. Shin H. Haining W.N. Zou T. Workman C.J. Polley A. Betts M.R. Freeman G.J. Vignali D.A.A. Wherry E.J. Coregulation of CD8+ T cell exhaustion by multiple inhibitory receptors during chronic viral infection.Nat.

Overcoming T cell exhaustion in infection and cancer.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The co-expression of multiple TCIRs on TEX suggests that these additional inhibitory pathways may drive PD1/PDL1-independent resistance mechanisms that can be targeted to improve responses. Across several cancer types, up to 50% of patients with PDL1+ tumors are either resistant or relapse after PD1/PDL1 blockade (Herbst et al., 2014Herbst R.S. Soria J.-C. Kowanetz M. Fine G.D. Hamid O.

However, how to rationally combine ICB agents with each other or other therapies is not obvious. In particular, the TEX population appears heterogeneous in TCIR expression, exhaustion-related markers, and reinvigoration potential (Blackburn et al., 2008Blackburn S.D. Shin H. Freeman G.J.

For example, in chronic viral infections, TEX expressing high levels of multiple TCIRs are considered less susceptible to reinvigoration by PD1/PDL1 blockade. Thus, approaches to effectively prevent the development of or reinvigorate a broader and more recalcitrant subset of TEX may have therapeutic importance for immunotherapy. The balance between immune-mediated tumor elimination and escape is influenced by many factors. Interferons (IFNs) are typically considered important in the generation of an anti-tumor immune response. Type I IFN (IFN-I) promotes dendritic cell function and CD8 T cell cross-priming, whereas interferon-gamma (IFNG), a type II IFN, influences both host and tumor cells to favor rejection of highly immunogenic tumors (Mittal et al., 2014Mittal D. Gubin M.M. Schreiber R.D. Smyth M.J. New insights into cancer immunoediting and its three component phases--elimination, equilibrium and escape.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2014; 27: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Both IFNs appear to be particularly critical for early T cell priming and activation events with less effect on tumor response when either is antagonized at later times (Diamond et al., 2011Diamond M.S. Kinder M. Matsushita H. Mashayekhi M. Dunn G.P. Archambault J.M. Lee H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Kalinke U. et al.Type I interferon is selectively required by dendritic cells for immune rejection of tumors.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1989-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In contrast, under conditions of prolonged IFN signaling and persistent antigen exposure, accumulating evidence indicates that IFNs can have immunosuppressive roles (Minn and Wherry, 2016Minn A.J. Wherry E.J. Combination Cancer Therapies with Immune Checkpoint Blockade: Convergence on Interferon Signaling.Cell. 2016; 165: 272-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For example, in cancer, the upregulation of PDL1 by IFNG is an “adaptive resistance” mechanism. Here, tumor cells respond to IFNG as part of a negative feedback event to inhibit the immune response (Spranger et al., 2013Spranger S. Spaapen R.M. Zha Y. Williams J. Meng Y. Ha T.T. Gajewski T.F. Up-Regulation of PD-L1, IDO, and Tregs in the Melanoma Tumor Microenvironment Is Driven by CD8+ T Cells.Sci. Transl.

Med. 2012; 4: 127ra37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Countering adaptive resistance appears to be a major therapeutic effect of PD1/PDL1 blockade. In total, these observations suggest that opposing immunomodulatory functions of IFNs may influence the balance between immune-mediated elimination and immune escape. Recently, we examined the molecular and immune determinants of response to the combination of anti-CTLA4 and radiation (RT) for metastatic melanoma (Twyman-Saint Victor et al., 2015Twyman-Saint Victor C. Rech A.J. Maity A. Rengan R. Pauken K.E. Stelekati E. Benci J.L. Xu B. Dada H. Odorizzi P.M. et al.Radiation and dual checkpoint blockade activate non-redundant immune mechanisms in cancer.Nature. 2015; 520: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Although the combination regimen can result in durable responses with RT contributing to T cell repertoire diversification and ICB driving oligo-clonal T cell expansion, a majority of mice and patients treated with RT + anti-CTLA4 were either resistant or relapsed. The upregulation of PDL1 in the tumor was determined to be an important resistance mechanism to RT + anti-CTLA4 and was associated with persistent T cell exhaustion or poor reinvigoration as measured in the post-treatment blood of mice and patients. However, although the addition of anti-PD1/PDL1 to RT + anti-CTLA4 improved responses in mice, resistance and/or relapse still occurred, indicating the existence of additional immunosuppressive pathways. Previously, we demonstrated in a mouse model and a clinical trial for metastatic melanoma that high levels of PDL1 expressed on cancer cells are an important resistance mechanism to RT and anti-CTLA4. Because PDL1 can also be expressed on infiltrating immune cells in the tumor, we sought to investigate the contribution of these other sources of PDL1 to resistance. In tumors from mice subcutaneously implanted with Res 499, a subline of B16-F10 (B16) melanoma that relapsed 3 weeks after RT + anti-CTLA4 (Figure 1A), high levels of PDL1 originate from both melanoma cells and CD45+ immune cells and is partially dependent on host IFNG (Figure 1B). A variety of immune cells expressed PDL1; however, the highest level was observed on F4/80+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (Figure S1A), which was confirmed by depletion with an anti-CSF1R antibody (Figures 1C and S1B). Thus, IFNG drives high levels of PDL1 on both melanoma cells and immune cells, consistent with adaptive resistance.Figure S1PDL1 Expression on Cancer Cells and Immune Cells and Association with Survival after RT + Anti-CTLA4, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Histogram plot of relative PDL1 expression on the indicated immune cell populations in Res 499 tumors.(B) Percentage of CD45+ immune cells that are F4/80+ in Res 499 tumor 10 days after starting anti-CSF1R.(C and D) (C) Overall survival of metastatic melanoma patients treated on a clinical trial of RT + anti-CTLA4 was modeled by random survival forest using the percentage of PDL1+ melanoma cells or macrophages, or the PDL1 IHC staining intensity score (0-3) on melanoma cells, macrophages, or both.

Survival estimates are from out-of-bag samples (samples not used to build the model). To examine the relative contribution of PDL1 on melanoma and/or immune cells to resistance, we disrupted PDL1 on Res 499 cells by CRISPR, depleted TAMs with anti-CSF1R, or disrupted PDL1 in Res 499 and blocked the remaining PDL1/PD1 interactions with anti-PD1. The largest improvement in survival after RT + anti-CTLA4 was observed when PDL1 was inhibited on both Res 499 and non-melanoma cells (Figure 1D); however, resistance persisted in ∼40% of mice, indicating that even when both melanoma and immune cell PDL1 are inhibited, a large proportion of mice still relapse. Re-transplantation of these relapsed PDL1KO Res 499 cells (denoted as JB2) confirmed reversion of resistance back to wild-type Res 499 levels, indicating that JB2 cells had stably acquired PDL1-independent resistance (Figures 1E and 1F). To corroborate these findings, we examined tumors from patients treated on our clinical trial of RT + anti-CTLA4 and modeled overall survival as a function of PDL1 surface staining intensity and positivity on melanoma cells and macrophages. Both melanoma cell and macrophage PDL1 status independently contribute to survival, with higher PDL1 intensity scores on each cell type predicting for worse outcome (Figures S1C and S1D). However, similar to mice, although patients with low PDL1 expression on melanoma cells and macrophages have improved survival (Figure 1G), a significant fraction still has ∼40%–50% risk for death (Figure 1G, left). Moreover, several patients who progressed after RT + anti-CTLA4 subsequently received anti-PD1 but nonetheless experienced further disease progression irrespective of PDL1 status on cancer cells and/or macrophages (Figure 1H). Taken together, these clinical and preclinical results demonstrate that, although PDL1 on melanoma and immune cells is an important adaptive resistance mechanism, resistance frequently persists despite blocking these cellular sources of PDL1. The profound resistance that can develop even when melanoma cells lack PDL1 prompted us to focus on additional PDL1-independent resistance pathways controlled by cancer cells (hereafter also referred to as tumor cells). IFNG drives PDL1 expression, which may be regulated by either type I or II IFNs. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether IFNs could orchestrate resistance beyond the upregulation of PDL1. Both Res 499 and JB2 were derived from tumors that initially responded to RT + ICB but subsequently relapsed several weeks after initiation of therapy. Type I and II IFN transcripts are present in both B16 and Res 499 whole tumors (Figure 1I) and can increase significantly after therapy, in particular IFNG (Figure 1J). To potentially mimic IFN conditions in the tumor microenvironment post-therapy, we treated parental B16 cells with various doses of either IFNG or IFN-I for 2 weeks in culture, followed by removal of IFN and continuous culture for another week. Treating B16 cells with prolonged IFNG (B16γ) was sufficient to confer resistance to RT + anti-CTLA4 to levels approaching Res 499 (Figures 2A and 2B ). In contrast, prolonged IFN-I signaling did not confer resistance (Figure S2A), and signaling through type III IFNs was not detected (Figure S2B). These results demonstrate that exposure to persistent IFNG is sufficient to render sensitive melanoma resistant to RT + anti-CTLA4.Figure S2Tumor IFN Signaling Drives PDL1-Independent Resistance, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Survival after RT + anti-CTLA4 for mice with B16 tumors or tumors from B16 cells chronically treated with type I IFNB (B16b) (n = 5-10).(B) PDL1 expression on Res 499 cells after treatment with indicated doses of IFNL (μg/mL).(C and D) (C) Expression of PDL1 (an ISG responsive to type I and II IFN signaling) on B16 and B16 cells with IFNGR knockout, or (D) B16 and B16 cells knocked-out for both IFNAR and IFNGR after treatment with IFNG or IFNG and IFNB, respectively.(E) Tumor volumes prior to the start of treatment for each treatment schedule (Figure 2C).(F) Tumor volumes after the indicated treatment schedule with anti-CTLA4 + anti-PDL1 for mice with B16 tumors or B16 tumors with IFNGR knockout or IFNGR and IFNAR knockout (IFNA/GRKO).(G and H) (G) Res 499 and Res 499 cells with IFNGR knockout after treatment with IFNG, or (H) Res 499 and Res 499 cells with IFNAR knockout after treatment with IFNB.(I) Res 499 and Res 499 cells with IFNAR and IFNGR knockout after treatment with IFNG and IFNB.(J) Expression of PDL1 and TNFRSF14 on JB2 cells with IFNAR and IFNGR knockout after treatment with IFNB and IFNG.

Prolonged tumor growth accompanied by an ineffective T cell response would be expected to result in persistent IFN exposure in vivo. Therefore, to examine whether acquisition of resistance in vivo can occur after prolonged tumor growth and IFN exposure, we used three different treatment schedules that first allowed tumors to grow to substantially larger sizes prior to therapy (Figure 2C). For the treatment, anti-PDL1 instead of RT was combined with anti-CTLA4 to eliminate rapid cytoreduction from RT and to examine for PDL1-independent resistance. As expected, mice with B16 tumors responded to a standard dosing schedule at day 5 but failed to respond when therapy was delayed until day 10 (Figure 2D). In contrast, mice bearing B16 tumors with knockout of the IFNG receptor (IFNGRKO) (Figure S2C) maintained their ability to respond despite the delay. Importantly, IFNGRKO had no effect on B16 tumors when therapy was not delayed (Figure 2D, D5 schedule), supporting the notion that signaling through the tumor IFNG receptor was not influencing primary resistance but rather driving PDL1-independent adaptive resistance. Even though prolonged IFN-I signaling in vitro did not appear sufficient to confer resistance, we investigated whether the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) might influence B16 tumor response when ablated with IFNGR. In the absence of therapy, double IFNGR and IFNAR knockout (IFNA/GRKO) tumors (Figure S2D) displayed similar tumor growth as control tumors (Figure S2E) and similar to IFNGRKO tumors (Figure S2F). However, when treatment was delayed until day 13 (but not earlier), IFNA/GRKO appeared more effective than IFNGRKO at sustaining responsiveness to therapy (Figure 2E). This effect of IFN was observed only after prolonged tumor growth and therapy delay, prompting us to examine the role of each IFN receptor in maintaining resistance. To distinguish a role for type I and/or II tumor IFN signaling in maintaining as opposed to initiating resistance, we utilized Res 499 tumors with IFNGRKO or IFNAR knockout (IFNARKO) (Figures S2G and S2H). This revealed that disrupting either IFN receptor did not alter Res 499 tumor growth in the absence of treatment (Figure 2F) but restored response of these resistant tumors to RT + anti-CTLA4 to levels similar to parental B16 tumors (Figures 2G and 2B). Examination of in vivo transcriptomic changes demonstrated that each receptor partially diminished expression of top upregulated genes representing transcriptomic features acquired by Res 499 tumors as a consequence of relapsing after RT + anti-CTLA4 (Figure 2H). IFNA/GRKO (Figure S2I) led to the largest decrease in genes associated with resistance and had the largest effect on multiple biological processes related to IFN signaling, as well as other pathways (Figure S3A). Given the more comprehensive effect of IFNA/GRKO, we knocked out both IFN receptors in JB2 cells to directly establish their role in maintaining PDL1-independent resistance (Figure S2J). Indeed, despite JB2 cells lacking PDL1 and having acquired resistance through PDL1-independent means, IFNA/GRKO restored response of JB2 tumors to RT + anti-CTLA4 (Figure 2I). Thus, these results indicate that type I and II IFN signaling contributes to maintaining a PDL1-independent resistance state. The effect of prolonged IFNG signaling in vitro and in vivo on PDL1-independent resistance suggests possible epigenetic influence. Indeed, persistent IFNG stimulation resulted in elevated levels of constitutive STAT1 as observed in B16γ cells even after continuous culture in the absence of exogenous IFNG (Figure 3A). To investigate if elevated STAT1 might be associated with how the epigenome responds to in vivo signals in the tumor microenvironment, we performed ATAC-seq on sorted melanoma cells to assess differences in open chromatin regions (OCRs). This revealed that prior chronic IFNG exposure alters the in vivo epigenome of B16 to partially resemble that of Res 499 (Figure 3B). Analysis of differential OCRs in B16γ and Res 499 relative to B16 demonstrated that a significant fraction (45.9%) of differential OCRs acquired by B16γ overlapped with those acquired by Res 499 (Figure 3C). A de novo motif search showed that many motifs within the differential OCRs found in B16γ and Res 499 significantly matched to STAT1 sites (Figure S3B), and many were shared between B16γ and Res 499 (Figure 3C, p = 5.3 × 10−47 for overlap by hypergeometric test). ATAC-seq revealed DNA footprinting centered at discovered STAT1 motifs, and these footprints increased in Res 499 and B16γ relative to B16, consistent with increased STAT1 occupancy within these OCRs (Figure 3D). This increase in inferred STAT1 occupancy and STAT1 levels in B16γ was correlated with the in vivo acquisition of transcriptomic features associated with relapse from RT + anti-CTLA4 (Figure S3C, left). Indeed, these transcriptomic features showed a high degree of STAT1 dependency, as demonstrated by STAT1KO in Res 499 tumors (Figure S3C, right). STAT1KO in Res 499 also inhibited resistance to RT + anti-CTLA4 (Figures 3E and 3F), and STAT1KO together with PDL1KO (Figure S3D) led to better tumor response compared to either knockout alone, consistent with STAT1 regulating PDL1-independent resistance. Thus, prolonged IFNG alters the melanoma epigenome in vivo to partially resemble that of resistant tumors. STAT1 occupancy may underlie a significant proportion of these changes to influence transcriptomic features of resistant tumors and to regulate PDL1-independent resistance pathways. Genome-wide effects of persistent IFN signaling and acquisition of PDL1-independent resistance appeared to converge onto enhanced STAT1 expression and/or activity. Thus, we reasoned that genes associated with STAT1 could provide insight into effectors involved in PDL1-independent resistance. Due to the large number of genes differentially expressed in Res 499 compared to B16, we integrated transcriptomic data from mice and patients to examine only genes that included (1) annotated type I and II IFNs; (2) ISGs that we previously described to be robustly expressed across human cancers (Weichselbaum et al., 2008Weichselbaum R.R. Ishwaran H. Yoon T. Nuyten D.S.A. Baker S.W. Khodarev N. Su A.W. Shaikh A.Y. Roach P. Kreike B. et al.An interferon-related gene signature for DNA damage resistance is a predictive marker for chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18490-18495Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); and (3) common TCIRs, their ligands, and immunosuppressive effectors such as IDO1. Analysis of unsorted Res 499 and B16 tumors revealed that, in resistant tumors, Stat1 preferentially correlated with genes encoding multiple TCIR ligands that included TNFRSF14 (HVEM), LGALS9 (Galectin-9), and MHC class II (MHCII)—ligands for CD160 and BTLA, HVARC2 (TIM3), and LAG3, respectively (Figure 3G). A similar pattern was observed with the ISGs Ifit1 and Mx1. Using expression data from TCGA, we sought to corroborate the significance of the TCIR ligands and ISGs that preferentially associate with STAT1 in resistant mouse tumors. Because many of the examined genes may simply correlate with the presence of a T cell infiltrate, we also added CD8A, GZMA, and PRF1, which can act as a surrogate for T cell infiltration and cytolytic activity (Rooney et al., 2015Rooney M.S.

Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity.Cell. 2015; 160: 48-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). Despite a high degree of correlation among most of the examined genes (Figure 3H), network analysis reveals that STAT1 is the only gene that connects the IFNG/CD8 T cell infiltrate genes, ISGs, and a cluster of TCIR and TCIR ligands through PDL1 (Figure 3I). To mimic the effect of elevated PDL1 found in Res 499 compared to B16, we examined how correlations between STAT1 and other genes in the network change when PDL1 gene expression is high versus when it is low (Figure 3J). Indeed, when PDL1 is high, STAT1 more strongly and significantly correlates with TNFRSF14, LGALS9, MHCII, CD86, and the ISGs MX1 and IFIT1 compared to when CD8A levels are high, suggesting that these associations are not simply due to higher T cell infiltration. Thus, in both Res 499 tumors and human melanoma tumors with high PDL"

This diurnal microbial behavior drives, in turn, the global programming of the host circadian transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolite oscillations. Surprisingly, disruption of homeostatic microbiome rhythmicity not only abrogates normal chromatin and transcriptional oscillations of the host, but also incites genome-wide de novo oscillations in both intestine and liver, thereby impacting diurnal fluctuations of host physiology and disease susceptibility. As such, the rhythmic biogeography and metabolome of the intestinal microbiota regulates the temporal organization and functional outcome of host transcriptional and epigenetic programs."

The structure suggests a possible mechanism by which electrons are transferred from NADH to cytochrome c and provides a platform for future functional dissection of respiration. In animals, the energy contained in organic compounds can be released via specific metabolic pathways to generate ATP by the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system via a unique mechanism termed chemiosmosis (Acín-Pérez et al., 2004Acín-Pérez R. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Fernández-Silva P. Moreno-Loshuertos R. Pérez-Martos A. Bruno C. Moraes C.T. Enríquez J.A. Respiratory complex III is required to maintain complex I in mammalian mitochondria.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In mammals, the OXPHOS system in mitochondria is composed of three types of proton-pumping complexes, electron carrier pools, non-proton-pumping complex II and various complex-II-like auxiliary electron donors, and ATP synthase (Acín-Pérez et al., 2008Acín-Pérez R. Fernández-Silva P. Peleato M.L. Pérez-Martos A. Enriquez J.A. Respiratory active mitochondrial supercomplexes.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Decades of extensive structural and functional investigations have depicted a general picture of how these large proton-pumping complexes could perform their duties. Respiratory complex I (CI; NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), consisting of 44 different subunits with a total molecular weight of ∼980 kDa, can transfer two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and simultaneously pump four protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space (IMS) in a single cycle (Althoff et al., 2011Althoff T. Mills D.J. Popot J.L. Kühlbrandt W. Arrangement of electron transport chain components in bovine mitochondrial supercomplex I1III2IV1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4652-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Respiratory complex III (CIII; cytochrome bc1 complex), functioning as a dimer with each 240 kDa monomer containing 11 subunits, transfers two electrons from the QH2 provided by CI or CII-like enzymes to two cytochrome c (Cyt.c) molecules while pumping two protons from the matrix to the IMS (Belevich et al., 2007Belevich I. Bloch D.A. Belevich N. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Exploring the proton pump mechanism of cytochrome c oxidase in real time.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2685-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Respiratory complex IV (CIV; cytochrome c oxidase), existing as a 210-kDa monomer with 14 subunits, delivers four electrons from four Cyt.c molecules to one oxygen molecule, forming two water molecules, and pumping four protons into IMS at the same time (Benard et al., 2008Benard G. Faustin B. Galinier A. Rocher C. Bellance N. Smolkova K. Casteilla L. Rossignol R. Letellier T. Functional dynamic compartmentalization of respiratory chain intermediate substrates: implications for the control of energy production and mitochondrial diseases.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 1543-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proton-pumping-coupled electron transfer reactions are shown below (Sazanov, 2015Sazanov L.A. A giant molecular proton pump: structure and mechanism of respiratory complex I.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar):CI:NADH+H++Q+4H+(matrix)→NAD++QH2+4H+(IMS)CIII:2Cyt.c(oxidized)+QH2+2H+(matrix)→2Cyt.c(reduced)+Q+4H+(IMS)CIV:4Cyt.c(reduced)+8H+(matrix)+O2→4Cyt.c(oxidized)+2H2O+4H+(IMS) Since Shägger and his colleagues identified the respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) via blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) (Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. Supercomplexes in the respiratory chains of yeast and mammalian mitochondria.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), an exciting concept of the organization of respiratory chain complexes has emerged, i.e., individual respiratory complexes can further assemble into different types of SCs (Blaza et al., 2014Blaza J.N. Serreli R. Jones A.J. Mohammed K. Hirst J. Kinetic evidence against partitioning of the ubiquinone pool and the catalytic relevance of respiratory-chain supercomplexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The SCs containing CI, CIII dimer, and different copy numbers of CIV, which are capable to performing respiratory reactions, are also called the respirasomes. The distribution of various SC types in living organisms can vary depending on tissue types and cell conditions, such as the level of energy demands (Acín-Pérez et al., 2008Acín-Pérez R. Fernández-Silva P. Peleato M.L. Pérez-Martos A. Enriquez J.A. Respiratory active mitochondrial supercomplexes.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The specific correlation between SC distribution types and cell conditions calls for further investigation. Introduction of the SC concept led to intensive studies revealing the biological significance of forming an SC organization in OXPHOS. First, the assembly of CIII and CIV into CI can promote the assembly and stability of CI (Enríquez, 2016Enríquez J.A. Supramolecular organization of respiratory complexes.Annu. Rev.

Second, the formation of SCs can significantly reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013Lapuente-Brun E. Moreno-Loshuertos R. Acín-Pérez R.

Fourth, SCs can raise the efficiency of electron transfer through substrate channeling (Schäfer et al., 2006Schäfer E. Seelert H. Reifschneider N.H. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Vonck J.

In the present study, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and a sub-region refinement method, we obtained the structure of mammalian SCI1III2IV1 at near-atomic resolution. Our structure not only reveals the precise arrangement of CI, CIII, and CIV but also suggests possible mechanisms by which electrons are transferred from NADH to Cyt.c. The 1.7-MDa SCI1III2IV1 was solubilized with digitonin from porcine hearts and purified to apparent homogeneity for final sample preparation and structural determination as previously described (Gu et al., 2016Gu J. Wu M. Guo R. Yan K. Lei J. Gao N. Yang M. The architecture of the mammalian respirasome.Nature. 2016; 537: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). After 2D and 3D classification of 424,000 particles, 162,000 particles were subjected to high-resolution refinement, resulting in a 3D density map with an overall resolution of 4.0 Å by the “gold standard” Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion (Figures 1A and S1B–S1G). The density map can be clearly divided into three parts corresponding to CI, CIII, and CIV (Figure 1A). Sub-region refinement with step-by-step reduction of the soft masks corresponding to SCI1III2, CI, CIII dimer, and CIV results in further improvement of the density maps to 3.9, 3.6, 3.6, and 6.4 Å, respectively (gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion) (Figures S1D and S2). Subsequent docking of the cryo-EM maps and models of CI (PDB: 5GPN) (Gu et al., 2016Gu J. Wu M. Guo R. Yan K. Lei J. Gao N. Yang M. The architecture of the mammalian respirasome.Nature. 2016; 537: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), CIII (PDB: 1BGY) (Iwata et al., 1998Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M.

The final resolution of CI, CIII and CIV are 3.6, 3.6 and 6.4 Å, respectively. The mammalian respiratory SCI1III2IV1 is the largest and most complicated enzyme in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has a dimension of ∼190 Å in height and 300 Å in length (Figure 1A). The 3.6-Å density maps of CI and CIII alone allowed us to build the model with side chains clearly visible for the majority of residues from all subunits, except NDUFA12 and NDUFV3 of CI. The two-fold axis of the CIII dimer is oriented perpendicularly to the membrane arm of CI (Figure 1). The rectangular density of CIV monomer was positioned at the distal end of the membrane arm of CI and was adjacent to the CIII dimer, and we assigned the CIV monomer (PDB: 1OCC) (Tsukihara et al., 1996Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. The whole structure of the 13-subunit oxidized cytochrome c oxidase at 2.8 A.Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar) into the 6.4-Å map (Figures 1B and 1C). In the SC structures, the density for the side chains was well resolved in the tightly packed subunits, while the ones at the distal end of the peripheral regions were resolved at a relatively lower resolution due to their less ordered conformation (Figures 1B and S2). In the structure, we were able to accurately place 14 core subunits and 30 supernumerary subunits in CI, 22 subunits in CIII, and do rigid body fit of the 13 subunits in CIV (Figures 1C and S3A). In total, the structure of CI contains 44 subunits with 78 transmembrane helices (TMHs) (60 from the core subunits and 18 from the supernumerary subunits). CIII contains 22 subunits with 26 TMHs, and CIV has 13 subunits with 28 TMHs. We also located 11 and 12 phospholipids in CI and CIII and 6 and 2 heme molecules in CIII and CIV, respectively (Figures 1C and S3). The overall structure of CI is ∼190 Å in height and 250 Å in length. Out of the 45 subunits (two copies of NDUFAB1) of CI, 44 subunits were assigned in the 3.6-Å-resolution density map. The existence of NDUFV3 could not be detected which might be due to the flexibility (Figure 2; Table S1). Almost all residues were modeled into the structure, except residues of NDUFA12, due to their relatively poor density quality (Figures 2A and S4; Table S1). It was reported that the 14 conserved core subunits of CI form an L-shaped structure (Baradaran et al., 2013Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A.

The seven matrix domain core subunits, surrounded by ten supernumerary subunits, protrude out of the membrane to form the matrix arm. The seven membrane arm core subunits are buried in the mitochondrial inner membrane. 21 additional supernumerary subunits encircle this core, and 14 of these supernumerary components have at least one TM domain each (Figures 2B and S4; Table S1). More interestingly, in addition to the 44 polypeptides, the density also allowed us to assign an flavin mononucleotide (FMN) molecule in NDUFV1, eight FeS clusters for the electron transfer cascade in the matrix region, an NADPH molecule in NDUFA9, a Zn2+ ion in NDUFS6, two decanoyl (C10)-4′-phosphopantetheine (D4PP) group in two acyl carrier protein complexes (NDUFAB1-NDUFA6, and NDUFAB1-NDUFB9) (Figures S5A–S5D), three phosphatidylcholines (PCs), four phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and four cardiolipins in the membrane arm (Figure S3). Together, the overall structure of CI is shaped like a “foot” in a “sandal,” in which the L-shaped 14 core subunits form a foot slipping into a sandal-like cage packed by the 30 supernumerary subunits (Figure 2).Figure S4Structures of Individual Subunits of Sus scrofa CI Subunits, Related to Figure 2Show full caption3D structures of Sus scrofa CI individual subunits.

Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the Hippo pathway in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. We demonstrate that, in three different murine syngeneic tumor models (B16, SCC7, and 4T1), loss of the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2) in tumor cells inhibits tumor growth. Tumor regression by LATS1/2 deletion requires adaptive immune responses, and LATS1/2 deficiency enhances tumor vaccine efficacy. Mechanistically, LATS1/2-null tumor cells secrete nucleic-acid-rich extracellular vesicles, which induce a type I interferon response via the Toll-like receptors-MYD88/TRIF pathway. LATS1/2 deletion in tumors thus improves tumor immunogenicity, leading to tumor destruction by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Our observations uncover a key role of the Hippo pathway in modulating tumor immunogenicity and demonstrate a proof of concept for targeting LATS1/2 in cancer immunotherapy."

In this study, we determined the structure of zebrafish CFTR in the absence of ATP by electron cryo-microscopy to 3.7 Å resolution. Human and zebrafish CFTR share 55% sequence identity, and 42 of the 46 cystic-fibrosis-causing missense mutational sites are identical. In CFTR, we observe a large anion conduction pathway lined by numerous positively charged residues. A single gate near the extracellular surface closes the channel. The regulatory domain, dephosphorylated, is located in the intracellular opening between the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), preventing NBD dimerization and channel opening. The structure also reveals why many cystic-fibrosis-causing mutations would lead to defects either in folding, ion conduction, or gating and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention."

We previously described abnormalities in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathway as a cause of ASD.

Our data elucidate a neurological syndrome defined by SLC7A5 mutations and support an essential role for the BCAA in human brain function. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a group of syndromes of heterogeneous etiologies characterized by impairment in social interactions, verbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. A number of twin and family studies have shown that genetics play a significant role in the development of ASD (Bailey et al., 1995Bailey A. Le Couteur A. Gottesman I. Bolton P. Simonoff E. Yuzda E. Rutter M. Autism as a strongly genetic disorder: evidence from a British twin study.Psychol. Med. 1995; 25: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar, Folstein and Rutter, 1977Folstein S. Rutter M. Genetic influences and infantile autism.Nature. 1977; 265: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the genetic architecture of ASD is very complex and mutations in a single gene rarely account for a significant proportion of ASD patients. Despite their genetic heterogeneity, ASD may be less diverse functionally. Indeed, in many instances the great number of genes implicated in neurological disorders converges on a smaller number of biological pathways (De Rubeis et al., 2014De Rubeis S. He X. Goldberg A.P. Poultney C.S. Samocha K. Cicek A.E. Kou Y. Liu L. Fromer M. Walker S. et al.DDD StudyHomozygosity Mapping Collaborative for AutismUK10K ConsortiumSynaptic, transcriptional and chromatin genes disrupted in autism.Nature. 2014; 515: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). We recently identified mutations in the gene branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) in several patients with ASD, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy (Novarino et al., 2012Novarino G. El-Fishawy P. Kayserili H. Meguid N.A. Scott E.M. Schroth J. Silhavy J.L. Kara M. Khalil R.O. Ben-Omran T. et al.Mutations in BCKD-kinase lead to a potentially treatable form of autism with epilepsy.Science. 2012; 338: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). BCKDK is the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), a group of essential amino acids comprising valine, leucine, and isoleucine. The most direct consequence of BCKDK mutations is a hyper-catabolism of the BCAAs, resulting in abnormally low levels of serum and brain BCAAs (Novarino et al., 2012Novarino G. El-Fishawy P. Kayserili H. Meguid N.A. Scott E.M. Schroth J. Silhavy J.L. Kara M. Khalil R.O. Ben-Omran T. et al.Mutations in BCKD-kinase lead to a potentially treatable form of autism with epilepsy.Science. 2012; 338: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The brain is dependent on a constant supply of BCAAs from the periphery. Should BCAAs be substantially important for the brain, factors facilitating BCAA uptake might be critical for the proper function of the CNS. The large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is encoded by the SLC7A5 gene (Verrey, 2003Verrey F. System L: heteromeric exchangers of large, neutral amino acids involved in directional transport.Pflugers Arch. 2003; 445: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The transporter is localized at the blood brain barrier (BBB) and forms a heterodimer with the glycoprotein CD98, encoded by the SLC3A2 gene. Here, we studied a mouse model in which Slc7a5 was deleted from the BBB and found that Slc7a5 is particularly important to set brain BCAA levels within a normal range. Mice with defective BCAA transport at the BBB show abnormal activation of the amino acid response (AAR) pathway and a corresponding reduction in mRNA translation along with neuronal activity imbalance and behavioral problems. To probe whether SLC7A5 is essential also in humans, we performed genetic analysis of a cohort of neurological pediatric patients. We identified and functionally validated mutations in SLC7A5 in several patients with ASD and motor coordination problems. Notably, neurological abnormalities can be treated in adult mice by 3-week long intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) BCAA delivery. Earlier in vitro studies described the sodium-independent LAT1 as a large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transporter, including the BCAAs (Mastroberardino et al., 1998Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Amino-acid transport by heterodimers of 4F2hc/CD98 and members of a permease family.Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The light subunit of the carrier, encoded by SLC7A5, is sufficient to transport LNAAs (Napolitano et al., 2015Napolitano L. Scalise M. Galluccio M. Pochini L. Albanese L.M. Indiveri C. LAT1 is the transport competent unit of the LAT1/CD98 heterodimeric amino acid transporter.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 67: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The contribution of SLC7A5 to brain LNAA/BCAA homeostasis in vivo, however, remains completely unknown. To understand the physiological role of Slc7a5 in vivo, we employed a conditional (floxed) Slc7a5 knock out mouse line (Slc7a5fl) (Sinclair et al., 2013Sinclair L.V. Rolf J. Emslie E. Shi Y.B. Taylor P.M. Cantrell D.A. Control of amino-acid transport by antigen receptors coordinates the metabolic reprogramming essential for T cell differentiation.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In wild-type (WT) animals, Slc7a5 is considerably expressed in the plasma membrane of the endothelial cells of the BBB during development and in adulthood but it is mostly undetectable in other tissues (Figures 1A and S1A–S1C ). Thus, we crossed the Slc7a5fl mouse with the Tie2Cre mouse line, expressing the Cre recombinase starting from embryonic day (E) 11.5 in the endothelial cells of blood vessels and BBB (Figure S1D) (Kisanuki et al., 2001Kisanuki Y.Y. Hammer R.E. Miyazaki J. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Yanagisawa M. Tie2-Cre transgenic mice: a new model for endothelial cell-lineage analysis in vivo.Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). As expected, endothelial cells of the BBB of Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice show complete lack of expression of Slc7a5 (Figure 1A).Figure S1Slc7a5 and Tie2Cre Expression at the BBB, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative images of cortical slices stained with Slc7a5 (left) and the endothelial cell marker MECA 32 (middle) antibodies.

Note GFP staining in the endothelial cells of the BBB (right). Images were obtained from the cerebral cortex of 2 days old (P2) mice. The exchange between blood and cerebrospinal fluid of a wide range of metabolically important molecules, including amino acids, is known to be constrained already at early developmental stages, arising with the BBB formation. However, some studies reported that many amino acids, including the BCAAs, are transported into the developing brain at much higher rate than in adulthood (Braun et al., 1980Braun L.D. Cornford E.M. Oldendorf W.H. Newborn rabbit blood-brain barrier is selectively permeable and differs substantially from the adult.J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Lefauconnier and Trouvé, 1983Lefauconnier J.M. Trouvé R. Developmental changes in the pattern of amino acid transport at the blood-brain barrier in rats.Brain Res. 1983; 282: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whether this reflects a greater metabolic demand of the developing brain or the immaturity of the BBB is unknown (Watson et al., 2006Watson R.E. Desesso J.M. Hurtt M.E. Cappon G.D. Postnatal growth and morphological development of the brain: a species comparison.Birth Defects Res. B Dev. Reprod. Toxicol. 2006; 77: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence, we asked how removal of Slc7a5 from the BBB affects brain amino acid levels at different developmental stages. We found that E14.5 Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice don’t show major changes in brain LNAA and BCAA levels (Figure 1B), suggesting that either at E14.5 the BBB is still immature, with amino acids leaking into the brain, or another transporter may regulate LNAA and BCAA fluxes across the BBB during early development. In contrast, after birth and in adult stages, brain BCAA (especially leucine and isoleucine) levels are abnormally low in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl animals (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that Slc7a5 expression is essential to regulate BCAA uptake by the brain. Surprisingly, the brain levels of several other LNAAs (e.g., tyrosine and tryptophan) in Slc7a5 mutants are comparable to the ranges observed in control (Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/+) animals, while a few other amino acids (e.g., histidine, serine, and phenylalanine) show an elevated level in mutants compared to controls. In particular, brain histidine concentration is several fold higher in the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice than in control animals (Figures 1B–1D). This result supports the idea that SLC7A5 works as an antiporter, and histidine is the main counter amino acid (Figure S2) (Napolitano et al., 2015Napolitano L. Scalise M. Galluccio M. Pochini L. Albanese L.M. Indiveri C. LAT1 is the transport competent unit of the LAT1/CD98 heterodimeric amino acid transporter.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 67: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of Slc7a5 expression at the BBB, the mammalian brain accumulates histidine while failing to gather normal amounts of BCAAs. Importantly, neither the serum amino acid profile nor the level of brain neurotransmitters are affected in the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl animals (Figure S2C; Table S1). While this last result contradicts previous hypotheses (del Amo et al., 2008del Amo E.M. Urtti A. Yliperttula M. Pharmacokinetic role of L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 and LAT2.Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2008; 35: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), it is in agreement with our in vitro experiments showing that SLC7A5 does not facilitate the movement of neurotransmitters (Figures S2A and S2B). In vitro, SLC7A5 transports not only the BCAAs but also other LNAAs, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (Napolitano et al., 2015Napolitano L. Scalise M. Galluccio M. Pochini L. Albanese L.M. Indiveri C. LAT1 is the transport competent unit of the LAT1/CD98 heterodimeric amino acid transporter.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2015; 67: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, brain levels of these amino acids were not reduced in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice but rather slightly increased (Figure 1D). This suggests that additional BBB-located transporters might efficiently compensate for Slc7a5 loss by mediating the passage of several LNAAs, but not of BCAAs. Indeed, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse brain revealed a significant upregulation of Slc7a1 and Slc7a3 genes (Figures 2A and 2B ) encoding for the amino acid transporters Cat1 and Cat3 (Fotiadis et al., 2013Fotiadis D. Kanai Y. Palacín M. The SLC3 and SLC7 families of amino acid transporters.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 139-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that in vivo Cat1 and Cat3 may contribute to preserve brain levels of LNAAs, other than BCAAs, in the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of genes implicated in serine biosynthesis in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice (Figure 2B), explaining the modest but significant increase in brain serine level observed in the mutant animals (Figure 1D). An increase in the expression of genes encoding for amino acid transporters and serine biosynthetic enzymes has been previously linked to the activation of the AAR, a process implemented by individual cells to respond to amino acid deprivation (Kilberg et al., 2009Kilberg M.S. Shan J. Su N. ATF4-dependent transcription mediates signaling of amino acid limitation.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Consistently, RNA-seq analysis of Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mouse brain revealed the upregulation of a number of other amino acid-related genes (e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases) (Figures 2A and 2B). Among them, we noticed a significant upregulation of mRNAs encoding for the amino acid responsive transcription factors Atf4 and Atf5 and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein, 4ebp1 (Figure 2A), all part of the AAR pathway. Atf4 and Atf5 have been implicated in the regulation of the CNS development and function. Specifically, Atf4 modulates synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation (Chen et al., 2003Chen A. Muzzio I.A. Malleret G. Bartsch D. Verbitsky M. Pavlidis P. Yonan A.L. Vronskaya S. Grody M.B. Cepeda I. et al.Inducible enhancement of memory storage and synaptic plasticity in transgenic mice expressing an inhibitor of ATF4 (CREB-2) and C/EBP proteins.Neuron. 2003; 39: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), while Atf5 has been implicated in cell growth and development, especially in the nervous system (Angelastro et al., 2003Angelastro J.M. Ignatova T.N. Kukekov V.G. Steindler D.A. Stengren G.B. Mendelsohn C. Greene L.A. Regulated expression of ATF5 is required for the progression of neural progenitor cells to neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4590-4600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of Atf4 and/or Atf5 has been implicated in cognitive dysfunctions and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, including altered emotional behavior (Green et al., 2008Green T.A. Alibhai I.N. Unterberg S. Neve R.L. Ghose S. Tamminga C.A. Nestler E.J. Induction of activating transcription factors (ATFs) ATF2, ATF3, and ATF4 in the nucleus accumbens and their regulation of emotional behavior.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and behavioral inflexibility (Trinh et al., 2012Trinh M.A. Kaphzan H. Wek R.C. Pierre P. Cavener D.R. Klann E. Brain-specific disruption of the eIF2α kinase PERK decreases ATF4 expression and impairs behavioral flexibility.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 676-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, our gene expression analysis did not reveal any abnormality ascribable to increased histidine levels, suggesting that, despite histidine being the most affected amino acid by Slc7a5 deletion, changes in its level do not lead to severe molecular defects. Similarly, we did not detect changes attributable to alterations of other amino acids such as phenylalanine. Amino acid deprivation and activated AAR signaling pathway are associated with suppression of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. In the past few years, several genes regulating mRNA translation have been implicated in cognitive deficits (Gkogkas et al., 2013Gkogkas C.G. Khoutorsky A. Ran I. Rampakakis E. Nevarko T. Weatherill D.B. Vasuta C. Yee S. Truitt M. Dallaire P. et al.Autism-related deficits via dysregulated eIF4E-dependent translational control.Nature. 2013; 493: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, Santini et al., 2013Santini E. Huynh T.N. MacAskill A.F. Carter A.G. Pierre P. Ruggero D. Kaphzan H. Klann E. Exaggerated translation causes synaptic and behavioural aberrations associated with autism.Nature. 2013; 493: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of Slc7a5 knock out at the BBB on translation and associated pathways in the brain. To assess the impact of leucine and isoleucine deficiency on mRNA translation in the brain of Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice, we first performed western blot analysis of neocortical lysates obtained from wild-type and mutant animals. Specifically, we evaluated the expression and activity status of a number of proteins involved in the regulation of protein synthesis (Figure 2C). We observed a significant increase in the total levels of 4EBP1 protein (Figure 2C), consistent with increased 4EBP1 mRNA levels seen in our RNA-seq data (Figure 2A) and of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) (Figure 2C), indicating that removal of Slc7a5 from the BBB and the consequent decrease in brain BCAA concentration may lead to the suppression of cap-dependent translation initiation. In contrast, in none of our experiments did we detect abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Figure 2C), whose activity was shown to be regulated by leucine levels in vitro (Wolfson et al., 2016Wolfson R.L. Chantranupong L. Saxton R.A. Shen K. Scaria S.M. Cantor J.R. Sabatini D.M. Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.Science. 2016; 351: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). This may suggest that in vivo, under chronic leucine deficiency, the mTOR complex is alternatively regulated. To test whether abnormal regulation of 4EBP1 and eIF2α in mice lacking Slc7a5 leads to changes in translation efficiency in the brain, we performed polysome profiling of wild-type and Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl cortices. Importantly, in Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mouse cortical lysates, we observed a significant shift of ribosomes from actively translating polysomes toward the monosomal fraction (Figure 2D), the hallmark of decreased translation initiation. We conclude that BCAA shortage and associated effects of 4EBP1 levels and increased eIF2α phosphorylation elicit deficient translation initiation in the brain. Behavioral impairments resulting from abnormal regulation of cap-dependent translation have been previously described (Banko and Klann, 2008Banko J.L. Klann E. Cap-dependent translation initiation and memory.Prog. Brain Res. 2008; 169: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Santini et al., 2013Santini E. Huynh T.N. MacAskill A.F. Carter A.G.

Thus, we tested Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice for global behavioral changes. Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice are born at Mendelian ratio and appear normal in size but display kyphosis (44% of mutant mice) and hind limb clasping (89% of mutant mice). In an open field, Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice show reduced explorative behavior and lower velocity (Figure 3A). Rearing, a form of vertical exploration, was significantly reduced in the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice (Figure 3B). Nonetheless, Slc7a5 mutant mice and wild-type littermates have similar habituation time course (Figure S3A), suggesting that the diminished activity results from locomotion defects rather than a faster habituation to the field. Therefore, we tested the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice for fine motor coordination and locomotion problems.

Because in our previous work, we implicated BCAA deficiency in ASD (Novarino et al., 2012Novarino G. El-Fishawy P. Kayserili H. Meguid N.A. Scott E.M. Schroth J. Silhavy J.L. Kara M. Khalil R.O. Ben-Omran T. et al.Mutations in BCKD-kinase lead to a potentially treatable form of autism with epilepsy.Science. 2012; 338: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we tested Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl for autism-like phenotypes. Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl do not show excessive grooming or perseverative behaviors (Figure S3B), activities that can be, however, severely complicated by the presence of motor deficits in the mutants. Thus, we tested Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice for social interaction abnormalities. We first employed a three-chamber social arena to probe the mutant animals for self-initiated interactions with a wild-type unfamiliar mouse. This analysis revealed that while wild-type mice have more close interactions with an unfamiliar mouse than an object, the Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice show no preference between these two (Figure 3F). We then tested juvenile animals for social play and found that Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl mice tend to stay farther apart from their cage-mate and display a decreased number of nose-to-nose contacts (Figure 3G). Finally, we measured isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by mouse pups separated from the mother. Tie2Cre;Slc7a5fl/fl pups display an increased number of USVs starting from P8 when compared with their wild-type littermates (Figure 3H), a behavior observed in other autism models (Gkogkas et al., 2013Gkogkas C.G.

Dallaire P. et al.Autism-related deficits via dysregulated eIF4E-dependent translational control.Nature. 2013; 493: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the excessive number of USVs emitted by the mutant pups may be due to an increased repetition of a specific repertoire of vocalization patterns (Romano et al., 2013Romano E.

https://openalex.org/W2559180185,"The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine and serves as an ideal system for understanding biological macromolecular assembly. Direct observation of ribosome assembly in vivo is difficult, as few intermediates have been isolated and thoroughly characterized. Herein, we deploy a genetic system to starve cells of an essential ribosomal protein, which results in the accumulation of assembly intermediates that are competent for maturation. Quantitative mass spectrometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveal 13 distinct intermediates, which were each resolved to ∼4–5 Å resolution and could be placed in an assembly pathway. We find that ribosome biogenesis is a parallel process, that blocks of structured rRNA and proteins assemble cooperatively, and that the entire process is dynamic and can be “re-routed” through different pathways as needed. This work reveals the complex landscape of ribosome assembly in vivo and provides the requisite tools to characterize additional assembly pathways for ribosomes and other macromolecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W2557307285,"Engineered nanoparticles are becoming increasingly incorporated into technology and consumer products. In 2014, over 300 tons of copper oxide nanoparticles were manufactured in the United States. The increased production of nanoparticles raises concerns regarding the potential introduction into the environment or human exposure. Copper oxide nanoparticles commonly release copper ions into solutions, which contribute to their toxicity. We quantified the inhibitory effects of both copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on C. elegans toxicological endpoints to elucidate their biological effects. Several toxicological endpoints were analyzed in C. elegans, including nematode reproduction, feeding behavior, and average body length. We examined three wild C. elegans isolates together with the Bristol N2 laboratory strain to explore the influence of different genotypic backgrounds on the physiological response to copper challenge. All strains exhibited greater sensitivity to copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate, as indicated by reduction of average body length and feeding behavior. Reproduction was significantly reduced only at the highest copper dose, though still more pronounced with copper oxide nanoparticles compared to copper sulfate treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles and copper sulfate on neurons, cells with known vulnerability to heavy metal toxicity. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was observed in up to 10% of the population after copper oxide nanoparticle exposure. Additionally, mutants in the divalent-metal transporters, smf-1 or smf-2, showed increased tolerance to copper exposure, implicating both transporters in copper-induced neurodegeneration. These results highlight the complex nature of CuO nanoparticle toxicity, in which a nanoparticle-specific effect was observed in some traits (average body length, feeding behavior) and a copper ion specific effect was observed for other traits (neurodegeneration, response to stress)."
https://openalex.org/W2558138943,"Emerging evidence suggests that the adenosine (Ado) receptors may play crucial roles in tumor progression. Here, we show that Ado increases proliferation and migration in a triple negative breast cancer model, the MDA-MB 231 cell line. The use of specific agonists and antagonists evidenced that these effects depend on the activation of the A2B receptor, which then triggers an intracellular response mediated by the adenylate cyclase/PKA/cAMP signaling pathway. Ado also increases the expression of NaV1.5 channels, a potential biomarker in breast cancer. Together, these data suggest important roles of the A2B receptors and NaV1.5 channels in the Ado-induced increase in proliferation and migration of the MDA-MB 231 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2557857210,"Typically, balance training has been used as an intervention paradigm either as static or as reactive balance training. Possible differences in functional outcomes between the two modalities have not been profoundly studied. The objective of the study was to investigate the specificity of neuromuscular adaptations in response to two balance intervention modalities within test and intervention paradigms containing characteristics of both profiles: classical sensorimotor training (SMT) referring to a static ledger pivoting around the ankle joint vs. reactive balance training (RBT) using externally applied perturbations to deteriorate body equilibrium. Thirty-eight subjects were assigned to either SMT or RBT. Before and after four weeks of intervention training, postural sway and electromyographic activities of shank and thigh muscles were recorded and co-contraction indices (CCI) were calculated. We argue that specificity of training interventions could be transferred into corresponding test settings containing properties of SMT and RBT, respectively. The results revealed that i) postural sway was reduced in both intervention groups in all test paradigms; magnitude of changes and effect sizes differed dependent on the paradigm: when training and paradigm coincided most, effects were augmented (P<0.05). ii) These specificities were accompanied by segmental modulations in the amount of CCI, with a greater reduction within the CCI of thigh muscles after RBT compared to the shank muscles after SMT (P<0.05). The results clearly indicate the relationship between test and intervention specificity in balance performance. Hence, specific training modalities of postural control cause multi-segmental and context-specific adaptations, depending upon the characteristics of the trained postural strategy. In relation to fall prevention, perturbation training could serve as an extension to SMT to include the proximal segment, and thus the control of structures near to the body's centre of mass, into training."
https://openalex.org/W2559656577,"Increasingly, scholarly articles contain URI references to ""web at large"" resources including project web sites, scholarly wikis, ontologies, online debates, presentations, blogs, and videos. Authors reference such resources to provide essential context for the research they report on. A reader who visits a web at large resource by following a URI reference in an article, some time after its publication, is led to believe that the resource's content is representative of what the author originally referenced. However, due to the dynamic nature of the web, that may very well not be the case. We reuse a dataset from a previous study in which several authors of this paper were involved, and investigate to what extent the textual content of web at large resources referenced in a vast collection of Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM) articles published between 1997 and 2012 has remained stable since the publication of the referencing article. We do so in a two-step approach that relies on various well-established similarity measures to compare textual content. In a first step, we use 19 web archives to find snapshots of referenced web at large resources that have textual content that is representative of the state of the resource around the time of publication of the referencing paper. We find that representative snapshots exist for about 30% of all URI references. In a second step, we compare the textual content of representative snapshots with that of their live web counterparts. We find that for over 75% of references the content has drifted away from what it was when referenced. These results raise significant concerns regarding the long term integrity of the web-based scholarly record and call for the deployment of techniques to combat these problems."
https://openalex.org/W2558572009,"Ant-plant associations are an outstanding model to study the entangled ecological interactions that structure communities. However, most studies of plant-animal networks focus on only one type of resource that mediates these interactions (e.g, nectar or fruits), leading to a biased understanding of community structure. New approaches, however, have made possible to study several interaction types simultaneously through multilayer networks models. Here, we use this approach to ask whether the structural patterns described to date for ant-plant networks hold when multiple interactions with plant-derived food rewards are considered. We tested whether networks characterized by different resource types differ in specialization and resource partitioning among ants, and whether the identity of the core ant species is similar among resource types. We monitored ant interactions with extrafloral nectaries, flowers, and fruits, as well as trophobiont hemipterans feeding on plants, for one year, in seven rupestrian grassland (campo rupestre) sites in southeastern Brazil. We found a highly tangled ant-plant network in which plants offering different resource types are connected by a few central ant species. The multilayer network had low modularity and specialization, but ant specialization and niche overlap differed according to the type of resource used. Beyond detecting structural differences across networks, our study demonstrates empirically that the core of most central ant species is similar across them. We suggest that foraging strategies of ant species, such as massive recruitment, may determine specialization and resource partitioning in ant-plant interactions. As this core of ant species is involved in multiple ecosystem functions, it may drive the diversity and evolution of the entire campo rupestre community."
https://openalex.org/W2559641185,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism in which Gram negative bacterial pathogens sense their population density through acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) and regulate the expression of virulence factors. Enzymatic degradation of AHLs by lactonases, known as quorum quenching (QQ), is thus a potential strategy for attenuating QS regulated bacterial infections. We characterised the QQ activity of soil isolate Lysinibacillus sp. Gs50 and explored its potential for controlling bacterial soft rot of crop plants. Lysinibacillus sp. Gs50 inactivated AHL, which could be restored upon acidification, suggested that inactivation was due to the lactone ring hydrolysis of AHL. Heterologous expression of cloned gene for putative hydrolase (792 bp) designated adeH from Lysinibacillus sp. Gs50 produced a ~29 kDa protein which degraded AHLs of varying chain length. Mass spectrometry analysis of AdeH enzymatic reaction product revealed that AdeH hydrolyses the lactone ring of AHL and hence is an AHL lactonase. Multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequence of AdeH showed that it belongs to the metallo- β- lactamase superfamily, has a conserved ""HXHXDH"" motif typical of AHL lactonases. KM for AdeH for C6HSL was found to be 3.089 μM and the specific activity was 0.8 picomol min-1μg-1. AdeH has not so far been reported from any Lysinibacillus sp. and has less than 40% identity with known AHL lactonases. Finally we found that Lysinibacillus sp. Gs50 can degrade AHL produced by Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc), a common cause of soft rot. This QQ activity causes a decrease in production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes of Pcc and attenuates symptoms of soft rot in experimental infection of potato, carrot and cucumber. Our results demonstrate the potential of Lysinibacillus sp. Gs50 as a preventive and curative biocontrol agent."
https://openalex.org/W2559169640,"The Postgraduate Year (PGY) Program allows doctors-in-training to learn about the diagnosis, treatment and nursing of various common, general diseases. These items form the core curriculum and are mostly learned through caring for patients and clinical teaching. Doctors-in-training are evaluated for their knowledge through written tests or assignments, based on which the effectiveness of their training is also assessed; however, this generally produces a negative learning attitude among them. So we introduced the flipped classroom into PGY training program to change PGY students’ learning behavior. Although the flipped classroom is highly valued and has been practiced by teachers in schools of various levels, very few attempts have been made until now to report the learning outcomes achieved through the flipped classroom by means of rigorous research methods. Therefore we tried to employed Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980) theory of reasoned action and Bandura’s self-efficacy to predict and explain the participants’ behavioral intention when participating in the core curriculum learning of the flipped classroom and to assess the change in students’ learning behavior and learning effectiveness. From August 2013 to July 2014, 39 PGY students from the General Surgery of the Tri-Service General Hospital were selected as the participants of this study. The control group included 43 students of the previous year, that is, the year before the intervention of the flipped classroom. A comparative analysis was performed. The questionnaire’s related matrices indicated highest correlation between self-efficacy and behavioral intention (r = 0.491, P < 0.01), followed by attitude (r = 0.365, P < 0.01) and subjective norms (r = 0.360, P < 0.01.) All three showed positive correlations with behavioral intention; among attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, the pairwise correlations also reached significance level. The flipped classroom can indeed change PGY students’ the learning behavior from “passive learning” to “active learning.”"
https://openalex.org/W2558725357,"Objectives In recent years, the government of the Philippines embarked upon an ambitious Universal Health Care program, underpinned by the rapid scale-up of subsidized insurance coverage for poor and vulnerable populations. With a view of reducing the stubbornly high maternal mortality rates in the country, the program has a strong focus on maternal health services and is supported by a national policy of universal facility-based delivery (FBD). In this study, we examine the impact that recent reforms expanding health insurance coverage have had on FBD. Results Data from the most recent Philippines 2013 Demographic Health Survey was employed. This study applies quasi-experimental methods using propensity scores along with alternative matching techniques and weighted regression to control for self-selection and investigate the impact of health insurance on the utilization of FBD. Findings Our findings reveal that the likelihood of FBD for women who are insured is between 5 to 10 percent higher than for those without insurance. The impact of health insurance is more pronounced amongst rural and poor women for whom insurance leads to a 9 to 11 per cent higher likelihood of FBD. Conclusions We conclude that increasing health insurance coverage is likely to be an effective approach to increase women’s access to FBD. Our findings suggest that when such coverage is subsidized, as it is the case in the Philippines, women from poor and rural populations are likely to benefit the most."

Methods A 4 channel transmit and 16 channel receive array was constructed on a conformal polycarbonate former. Transmit field efficiency and homogeneity were simulated and validated, along with the Specific Absorption Rate, using mapping techniques and electromagnetic simulations. Receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), temporal SNR (tSNR) across EPI time series, g-factors for accelerated imaging and noise correlations were evaluated and compared with a commercial 32 channel whole head coil. The performance of the coil was further evaluated with human subjects through functional MRI (fMRI) studies at standard and submillimeter resolutions of upto 0.8mm isotropic. Results The transmit and receive sections were characterized using bench tests and showed good interelement decoupling, preamplifier decoupling and sample loading. SNR for the 16 channel coil was ∼ 1.5 times that of the commercial coil in the human occipital lobe, and showed better g-factor values for accelerated imaging. fMRI tests conducted showed better response to Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activation, at resolutions of 1.2mm and 0.8mm isotropic. Conclusion The 4 channel phased array transmit coil provides homogeneous excitation across the visual cortex, which, in combination with the dual row 16 channel receive array, makes for a valuable research tool for high resolution anatomical and functional imaging of the visual cortex at 7T."
https://openalex.org/W2558222424,"Interactions among dietary ingredients are often assumed non-existent when evaluating the nutritive value and health effects of dietary fiber. Specific fibers can distinctly affect digestive processes; therefore, digestibility and fermentability of the complete diet may depend on fiber types present. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of readily fermentable fibers (β-glucans and resistant starch) on the degradation of feed ingredients containing more persistent, recalcitrant, fibers. Six semi-synthetic diets with recalcitrant fibers from rapeseed meal (pectic polysaccharides, xyloglucans, and cellulose) or corn distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS; (glucurono)arabinoxylans and cellulose) with or without inclusion of β-glucans (6%) or retrograded tapioca (40%) substituted for corn starch were formulated. Six ileal-cannulated pigs (BW 28±1.4 kg) were assigned to the diets according to a 6×6 Latin square. β-glucan-extract increased apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of non-glucosyl polysaccharides (accounting for ~40% of the fiber-fraction) from rapeseed meal (6%-units, P<0.001), but did not affect non-glucosyl polysaccharides from DDGS. Retrograded tapioca reduced ATTD of non-glucosyl polysaccharides from rapeseed meal and DDGS (>10%-units, P<0.001), indicating that the large amount of resistant starch entering the hindgut was preferentially degraded over recalcitrant fibers from rapeseed meal and DDGS, possibly related to reduced hindgut-retention time following the increased intestinal bulk. Fermentation of fiber sources was not only dependent on fiber characteristics, but also on the presence of other fibers in the diet. Hence, interactions in the gastrointestinal tract among fibrous feed ingredients should be considered when evaluating their nutritive value."

Natural products suggest a potential role in prevention of these disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and anti-cancer properties of Chinese bayberry leaves (Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc.) flavonoids (BLF) comprehensively through the combination of in vitro digestion, chemical and cellular antioxidant assays. Based on the LC/MS data, the major flavonoids of BLF were myricitrin and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. BLF owned strong chemical and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) with its CAA value at 4253.884 ± 435.366 μmol of QE/100 g DW. After the in vitro digestion, the total flavonoids content, myricitrin and quercetin 3-rhamnoside decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Lower levels of the total flavonoid content and cellular uptake of myricitrin and quercetin 3-rhamnoside might contribute to the lower CAA value of digested BLF (DBLF). However, DBLF still owns considerable chemical antioxidant activities and CAA compared with many plants. Furthermore, both BLF and DBLF exhibited dose-dependent relationship against HepG2 proliferation. Taken together, BLF has a great potential to be developed as a natural antioxidant for promoting public health."
https://openalex.org/W2559674378,"Background and Aims Anthracyclines are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents which may cause long-term cardiac damage (chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity) and heart failure. The pathogenesis of anthracycline cardiotoxicity remains incompletely understood and individual susceptibility difficult to predict. We sought clinical features which might contribute to improved risk assessment. Methods Subjects were women with early breast cancer, free of pre-existing cardiac disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance before and >12 months after anthracycline-based chemotherapy (>3 months post-Trastuzumab). Variables associated with subclinical cardiotoxicity (defined as a fall in left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥5%) were identified by logistic regression. Results One hundred and sixty-five women (mean age 48.3 years at enrollment) completed the study 21.7 months [IQR 18.0–26.8] after starting chemotherapy. All received anthracyclines (98.8% epirubicin, cumulative dose 400 [300–450] mg/m2); 18% Trastuzumab. Baseline blood pressure was elevated (≥140/90mmHg, mean 147.3/86.1mmHg) in 18 subjects. Thirty-four subjects (20.7%) were identified with subclinical cardiotoxicity, independent predictors of which were the number of anthracycline cycles (odds ratio, OR 1.64 [1.17–2.30] per cycle), blood pressure ≥140/90mmHg (OR 5.36 [1.73–17.61]), body surface area (OR 2.08 [1.36–3.20] per standard deviation (0.16m2) increase), and Trastuzumab therapy (OR 3.35 [1.18–9.51]). The resultant predictive-model had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.78 [0.70–0.86]. Conclusions We found subclinical cardiotoxicity to be common even within this low risk cohort. Risk of cardiotoxicity was associated with modestly elevated baseline blood pressure–indicating that close attention should be paid to blood pressure in patients considered for anthracycline based chemotherapy. The association with higher body surface area suggests that indexing of anthracycline doses to surface area may not be appropriate for all, and points to the need for additional research in this area."

The cases were women with preeclampsia while healthy pregnant women were the controls. The medical and obstetrics history was gathered using questionnaires. The serum levels of calcium, magnesium, zinc and copper were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometer.There was no significant difference between the two groups in their age, gestational age, parity and body mass index. Zinc and copper levels were not significantly different between the two groups. In comparison with the controls, women with preeclampsia had a significantly lower median (inter-quartile) serum calcium [7.6 (4.0─9.6) vs. 8.1 (10.6─14.2), mg/dl, P = 0.032] and higher levels of magnesium [1.9 (1.4─2.5) vs. 1.4 (1.0─1.9) mg/dl; P = 0.003].

Neutrophil survival and activation are essential for inflammation resolution and contributes directly to the pathogenesis of many infectious and inflammatory conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of marathon races on surface molecules related to neutrophil adhesion and extrinsic apoptosis pathway and its association with inflammatory markers. We evaluated 23 trained male runners at the São Paulo International Marathon 2013. The following components were measured: hematological and inflammatory mediators, muscle damage markers, and neutrophil function. The marathon race induced an increased leukocyte and neutrophil counts; creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CK-MB, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-8 levels. C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α plasma concentrations were significantly higher 24 h and 72 h after the marathon race. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels decreased 72 h after the marathon race. We also observed an increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and decreasedTNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) expression immediately after and 24 h after the marathon race. We observed an increased DNA fragmentation and L-selectin and Fas receptor expressions in the recovery period, indicating a possible slow rolling phase and delayed neutrophil activation and apoptosis. Marathon racing affects neutrophils adhesion and survival in the course of inflammation, supporting the ""open-window"" post-exercise hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2558721844,"Parents can effortlessly assist their child to walk, but the mechanism behind such physical coordination is still unknown. Studies have suggested that physical coordination is achieved by interacting humans who update their movement or motion plan in response to the partner’s behaviour. Here, we tested rigidly coupled pairs in a joint reaching task to observe such changes in the partners’ motion plans. However, the joint reaching movements were surprisingly consistent across different trials. A computational model that we developed demonstrated that the two partners had a distinct motion plan, which did not change with time. These results suggest that rigidly coupled pairs accomplish joint reaching movements by relying on a pre-programmed motion plan that is independent of the partner’s behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2559603757,"Targeting TLR3 through formulations of polyI:C is widely studied as an adjuvant in cancer immunotherapy. The efficacy of such targeting has been shown to increase in combination with anti-PD-L1 treatment. Nevertheless, the mechanistic details of the effect of polyI:C on DC maturation and the impact on T-DC interactions upon PD-L1 blockade is largely unknown. Here we found that although DC treatment with polyI:C induced a potent inflammatory response including the production of type I interferon, polyI:C treatment of DCs impaired activation of peptide specific CD8+ T cells mainly due to PD-L1. Interestingly, we found that PD-L1 trafficking to the cell surface is regulated in two waves in polyI:C-treated DCs. One induced upon overnight treatment and a second more rapid one, specific to polyI:C treatment, was induced upon CD40 signaling leading to a further increase in surface PD-L1 in DCs. The polyI:C-induced cell surface PD-L1 reduced the times of contact between DCs and T cells, potentially accounting for limited T cell activation. Our results reveal a novel CD40-dependent regulation of PD-L1 trafficking induced upon TLR3 signaling that dictates its inhibitory activity. These results provide a mechanistic framework to understand the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy combined with TLR agonists."

In the states, ART was fully subsidized but there were different payment modalities for other costs of treatment. Data was collected and analysed for direct and indirect costs of treatment of HIV/AIDS and co-morbidities' during out-and in-patient visits.

Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE) in this study measures the number of respondents whose monthly ART-related household expenditure (for in-patient and out-patient visits) as a proportion of monthly non-food expenditure was greater than 40% and 10% respectively.The average out-patient and in-patient direct costs were $5.49 and $122.10 respectively. Transportation cost was the highest non-medical cost and it was higher than most medical costs. The presence of co-morbidities contributed to household costs. All the costs were catastrophic to households at 10% and 40% thresholds in the three states, to varying degrees. The poorest SES quintile had the highest incidence of CHE for out-patient costs (p<0.0001). Rural dwellers incurred more CHE for all categories of costs compared to urban dwellers, but the costs were statistically significant for only outpatient costs.ART subsidization is not enough to eliminate economic burden of treatment on HIV patients. Service decentralization to reduce travel costs, and subsidy on other components of HIV treatment services should be introduced to eliminate the persisting inequitable and high cost burden of ART services. Full inclusion of ART services within the benefit package of the National Health Insurance Scheme should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2559409926,"A poor quality affects project makespan and its total costs negatively, but it can be recovered by repair works during construction. We construct a new non-linear programming model based on the classic multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem considering repair works. In order to obtain satisfactory quality without a high increase of project cost, the objective is to minimize total quality cost which consists of the prevention cost and failure cost according to Quality-Cost Analysis. A binary dependent normal distribution function is adopted to describe the activity quality; Cumulative quality is defined to determine whether to initiate repair works, according to the different relationships among activity qualities, namely, the coordinative and precedence relationship. Furthermore, a shuffled frog-leaping algorithm is developed to solve this discrete trade-off problem based on an adaptive serial schedule generation scheme and adjusted activity list. In the program of the algorithm, the frog-leaping progress combines the crossover operator of genetic algorithm and a permutation-based local search. Finally, an example of a construction project for a framed railway overpass is provided to examine the algorithm performance, and it assist in decision making to search for the appropriate makespan and quality threshold with minimal cost."

https://openalex.org/W2558325333,"Purpose While Cognitive impairment (CI) has been identified as an independent risk factors for mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), it is inadequately assessed. We evaluated the applicability of the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) in assessing specific cognitive function and compared it to a detailed neuropsychological test battery as the reference standard. Methods In this multicentric cross-sectional study, we enrolled 445 clinically stable patients from five PD units, who were undergoing PD for at least 3 months. The 3MS was evaluated for general cognitive function. A detailed neuropsychological battery including domains of immediate memory, delayed memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial ability were evaluated as reference standards. Sensitivity and specificity of the 3MS was determined by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results The CI prevalence evaluated by 3MS was 23.6%. PD patients with CI performed worse in all cognitive domains. The 3MS correlated well with specific cognitive domains. However, 18.5%, 57.4%, 12.6%, 8.8%, and 41.2% of patients whom were idendified as normal by 3MS still showed executive dysfunction, immediate memory impairment, delayed memory impairment, and language-ability and visuospatial-ability impairment, respectively. The 3MS identified patients having specific cognitive dysfunction with varied extent of diagnostic value, with 0.50, 0.42, 0.35, 0.34, and 0.26 of Youden index in executive function, delayed memory, language ability, immediate memory, and visuospatial ability, respectively. Conclusions The 3MS is not a comprehensive instrument for major cognitive domains in PD patients. It could, however, be used for executive dysfunction and delayed memory impairment screening."
https://openalex.org/W2558588533,"Adults of most marine benthic and demersal fish are site-attached, with the dispersal of their larval stages ensuring connectivity among populations. In this study we aimed to infer spatial and temporal variation in population connectivity and dispersal of a marine fish species, using genetic tools and comparing these with oceanographic transport. We focused on an intertidal rocky reef fish species, the shore clingfish Lepadogaster lepadogaster, along the southwest Iberian Peninsula, in 2011 and 2012. We predicted high levels of self-recruitment and distinct populations, due to short pelagic larval duration and because all its developmental stages have previously been found near adult habitats. Genetic analyses based on microsatellites countered our prediction and a biophysical dispersal model showed that oceanographic transport was a good explanation for the patterns observed. Adult sub-populations separated by up to 300 km of coastline displayed no genetic differentiation, revealing a single connected population with larvae potentially dispersing long distances over hundreds of km. Despite this, parentage analysis performed on recruits from one focal site within the Marine Park of Arrábida (Portugal), revealed self-recruitment levels of 2.5% and 7.7% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, suggesting that both long- and short-distance dispersal play an important role in the replenishment of these populations. Population differentiation and patterns of dispersal, which were highly variable between years, could be linked to the variability inherent in local oceanographic processes. Overall, our measures of connectivity based on genetic and oceanographic data highlight the relevance of long-distance dispersal in determining the degree of connectivity, even in species with short pelagic larval durations."
https://openalex.org/W2557828282,"Occupancy modelling has received increasing attention as a tool for differentiating between true absence and non-detection in biodiversity data. This is thought to be particularly useful when a species of interest is spread out over a large area and sampling is constrained. We used occupancy modelling to estimate the probability of three phylogenetically independent pairs of native-introduced species [Megachile campanulae (Robertson)-Megachile rotundata (Fab.), Megachile pugnata Say-Megachile centuncularis (L.), Osmia pumila Cresson-Osmia caerulescens (L.)] (Apoidea: Megachilidae) being present when repeated sampling did not always find them. Our study occurred along a gradient of urbanization and used nest boxes (bee hotels) set up over three consecutive years. Occupancy modelling discovered different patterns to those obtained by species detection and abundance-based data alone. For example, it predicted that the species that was ranked 4th in terms of detection actually had the greatest occupancy among all six species. The native M. pugnata had decreased occupancy with increasing building footprint and a similar but not significant pattern was found for the native O. pumila. Two introduced bees (M. rotundata and M. centuncularis), and one native (M. campanulae) had modelled occupancy values that increased with increasing urbanization. Occupancy probability differed among urban green space types for three of six bee species, with values for two native species (M. campanulae and O. pumila) being highest in home gardens and that for the exotic O. caerulescens being highest in community gardens. The combination of occupancy modelling with analysis of habitat variables as an augmentation to detection and abundance-based sampling is suggested to be the best way to ensure that urban habitat management results in the desired outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2557594707,"Purpose Statins are widely used by older persons in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although serious adverse events are rare, many statin users report mild muscle pain and/or muscle weakness. It’s unclear what impact statins exert on a patient’s daily life. Research on statin related side effects in older persons is relatively scarce. We therefore investigated the relation between statin use and self-reported hindering muscle complaints in older persons in the general population. Methods The present research was performed within the Integrated Systematic Care for Older Persons (ISCOPE) study in the Netherlands (Netherlands trial register, NTR1946). All registered adults aged ≥ 75 years from 59 participating practices (n = 12,066) were targeted. Information about the medical history and statin use at baseline and after 9 months was available for 4355 participants from the Electronic Patient Records of the general practitioners. In the screening questionnaire at baseline we asked participants: ‘At the moment, which health complaints limit you the most in your day-to-day life?’ Answers indicating muscle or musculoskeletal complaints were coded as such. No specific questions about muscle complaints were asked. Results The participants had a median age of 80.3 (IQR 77.6–84.4) years, 60.8% were female and 28.5% had a history of CVD. At baseline 29% used a statin. At follow-up, no difference was found in the prevalence of self-reported hindering muscle complaints in statin users compared to non-statin users (3.3% vs. 2.5%, OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.94–2.05; P = 0.98). Discontinuation of statin use during follow-up was independent of self-reported hindering muscle complaints. Conclusion Based on the present findings, prevalent statin use in this community-dwelling older population is not associated with self-reported hindering muscle complaints; however, the results might be different for incident users."
https://openalex.org/W2558770220,"In Bangladesh, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality accounting for 31% of all blood transfusions in the country. Although safe blood transfusion is one of the 8 signal functions of Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (CEmOC) strategy, most of the designated public sector CEmOC facilities do not have on-site blood storage system. Emergent blood is mainly available from external blood banks. As a result, emergent patients are to rely on an unregulated network of brokers for blood which may raise question about blood safety. This study explored lived experiences of patients' attendants, managers, providers, and blood brokers before and after the implementation of an on-line Blood Information and Management Application (BIMA) in regards to barriers and facilitators of blood transfusion for emergent patients.Data were collected at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), a tertiary-level teaching hospital before (January 2014) and after (March 2015) the introduction of an online BIMA system. Data collection methods included 24 key informant interviews (KIIs) and 40 in-depth interviews (IDIs). KIIs were conducted with formal health service providers, health managers and unlicensed blood brokers. IDIs were conducted with the relatives and husbands of women who suffered PPH, and needed emergency blood.Patients' attendants were unaware of patients' blood type and availability of blood in emergency situation. Newly introduced online BIMA system could facilitate blood transfusion process for poor patients at lower cost and during any time of day and night. However, service providers and service recipients were heavily dependent on a network of unlicensed blood brokers for required blood for emergent PPH patients. Blood collected through unlicensed blood brokers is un-screened, unregulated and probably unsafe. Blood brokers feel that they are providing a needed service, acknowledged a financial incentive and unaware about safety of blood that they supply.Ensuring safe and timely blood transfusion is necessary to end preventable maternal mortality. In a context where facilities have no on-site blood, and both providers and patient attendants are heavily dependent on an unregulated cadre of unlicensed blood brokers, access to timely safe blood transfusion is seriously threatened. BIMA is a promising intervention to reduce inefficiencies in obtaining blood, but steps must be taken to ensure buy-in from current purveyors of blood, and to increase the acceptance of the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2557757021,"Smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is common and difficult to diagnose. In this study, we investigated the diagnostic value of nucleic acid amplification testing and sequencing combined with acid-fast bacteria (AFB) staining of needle biopsy lung tissues for patients with suspected smear-negative PTB.Patients with suspected smear-negative PTB who underwent percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy between May 1, 2012, and June 30, 2015, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients with AFB in sputum smears were excluded. All lung biopsy specimens were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and subjected to acid-fast staining and tuberculous polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR). For patients with positive AFB and negative TB-PCR results in lung tissues, probe assays and 16S rRNA sequencing were used for identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of PCR and AFB staining were calculated separately and in combination.Among the 220 eligible patients, 133 were diagnosed with TB (men/women: 76/57; age range: 17-80 years, confirmed TB: 9, probable TB: 124). Forty-eight patients who were diagnosed with other specific diseases were assigned as negative controls, and 39 patients with indeterminate final diagnosis were excluded from statistical analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of histological AFB (HAFB) for the diagnosis of smear-negative were 61.7% (82/133), 100% (48/48), 100% (82/82), 48.5% (48/181), and 71.8% (130/181), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of histological PCR were 89.5% (119/133), 95.8% (46/48), 98.3% (119/121), and 76.7% (46/60), respectively, demonstrating that histological PCR had significantly higher accuracy (91.2% [165/181]) than histological acid-fast staining (71.8% [130/181]), P < 0.001. Parallel testing of histological AFB staining and PCR showed the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy to be 94.0% (125/133), 95.8% (46/48), 98.4% (125/127), 85.2% (46/54), and 94.5% (171/181), respectively. Among patients with positive AFB and negative PCR results in lung tissue specimens, two were diagnosed with NTM infections (Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex and Mycobacterium kansasii).Nucleic acid amplification testing combined with acid-fast staining in lung biopsy tissues can lead to early and accurate diagnosis in patients with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. For patients with positive histological AFB and negative tuberculous PCR results in lung tissue, NTM infection should be suspected and could be identified by specific probe assays or 16S rRNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2558103002,"Histiocytic sarcomas represent rare but fatal neoplasms in humans. Based on the absence of a commercially available human histiocytic sarcoma cell line the frequently affected dog displays a suitable translational model. Canine distemper virus, closely related to measles virus, is a highly promising candidate for oncolytic virotherapy. Therapeutic failures in patients are mostly associated with tumour invasion and metastasis often induced by misdirected cytoskeletal protein activities. Thus, the impact of persistent canine distemper virus infection on the cytoskeletal protein cortactin, which is frequently overexpressed in human cancers with poor prognosis, was investigated in vitro in a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82). Though phagocytic activity, proliferation and apoptotic rate were unaltered, a significantly reduced migration activity compared to controls (6 hours and 1 day after seeding) accompanied by a decreased number of cortactin mRNA transcripts (1 day) was detected. Furthermore, persistently canine distemper virus infected DH82 cells showed a predominant diffuse intracytoplasmic cortactin distribution at 6 hours and 1 day compared to controls with a prominent membranous expression pattern (p ≤ 0.05). Summarized, persistent canine distemper virus infection induces reduced tumour cell migration associated with an altered intracellular cortactin distribution, indicating cytoskeletal changes as one of the major pathways of virus-associated inhibition of tumour spread."
https://openalex.org/W2557594411,"Malaria is endemic in the American continent and the Amazonian rainforest is the region with the highest risk of transmission. However, the lack of suitable experimental models to infect malaria vectors from the Americas has limited the progress to understand the biology of transmission in this region. Anopheles aquasalis, a major vector in coastal areas of South America, was found to be highly refractory to infection with two strains of Plasmodium falciparum (NF54 and 7G8) and with Plasmodium berghei (mouse malaria), even when the microbiota was eliminated with antibiotics and oxidative stress was reduced with uric acid. In contrast, An. aquasalis females treated with antibiotics and uric acid are susceptible to infection with a second murine parasite, Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis N67 (PyN67). Anopheles albimanus, one of the main malaria vectors in Central America, Southern Mexico and the Caribbean, was more susceptible to infection with PyN67 than An. aquasalis, even in the absence of any pre-treatment, but was still less susceptible than Anopheles stephensi. Disruption of the complement-like system in An. albimanus significantly enhanced PyN67 infection, indicating that the mosquito immune system is mounting effective antiplasmodial responses. PyN67 has the ability to infect a broad range of anophelines and is an excellent model to study malaria transmission by South American vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2557645903,"Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is the most common complication that causes visual decrease after extracapsular cataract surgery. The primary cause of PCO formation is the proliferation of the residual lens epithelial cells (LECs). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in the growth and migration of LECs. In the current study, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to specifically attenuate mTOR in human lens epithelial B3 cells (HLE B3). We aimed to examine the effect of mTOR-siRNA on the proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HLE B3 cells and explore the underlying mechanisms. The mTOR-siRNA was transfected into HLE B3 cells using lipofectamine 2000. The mRNA and protein levels of mTOR were examined to confirm the efficiency of mTOR-siRNA. The levels of mRNA and protein as well as the activity of mTOR down-stream effectors p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and protein kinase B (PKB, AKT) were examined using real-time PCR or Western blot, respectively. The cell proliferation was determined using cell counting kit (CCK) 8 and cell growth curve assay. The cell migration was examined using Transwell system and Scratch assay. MTOR-siRNA effectively eliminated mTOR mRNA and protein. The proliferation and migration were significantly suppressed by mTOR-siRNA transfection. mTOR-siRNA reduced the mRNA of p70S6K and AKT in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of p70S6K and AKT was decreased by mTOR-siRNA. MTOR-siRNA also eliminated the formation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 protein complex and blocked the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced EMT. Our results suggested that mTOR-siRNA could effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration and EMT of HLE B3 cells through the inhibition of p70S6K and AKT. These results indicated that mTOR-siRNA might be an effective agent inhibiting HLE cells growth and EMT following cataract surgery and provide an alternative therapy for preventing PCO."
https://openalex.org/W2558201124,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator and its expression is up-regulated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Tristetraprolin (TTP) is implicated in regulation of TNF-α expression; however, whether TTP is involved in cigarette smoke-induced TNF-α expression has not been determined.TTP expression was examined by western blot analysis in murine alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells challenged without or with cigarette smoke extract (CSE). TNF-α mRNA stability, and the decay of TNF-α mRNA, were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. TNF-α protein levels were examined at the same time in these cells. To identify the molecular mechanism involved, a construct expressing the human beta-globin reporter mRNA containing the TNF-α 3'-untranslated region was generated to characterize the TTP targeted site within TNF-α mRNA.CSE induced TTP down-regulation in alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. Reduced TTP expression resulted in significantly increased TNF-α mRNA stability. Importantly, increased TNF-α mRNA stability due to impaired TTP function resulted in significantly increased TNF-α levels in these cells. Forced TTP expression abrogated the increased TNF-α mRNA stability and expression induced by CSE. By using the globin reporter construct containing TNF-α mRNA 3'-untranslated region, the data indicate that TTP directly targets the adenine- and uridine-rich region (ARE) of TNF-α mRNA and negatively regulates TNF-α expression at the post-transcriptional level.The data demonstrate that cigarette smoke exposure reduces TTP expression and impairs TTP function, resulting in significantly increased TNF-α mRNA stability and excessive TNF-α expression in alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. The data suggest that TTP is a novel post-transcriptional regulator and limits excessive TNF-α expression and inflammatory response induced by cigarette smoke."
https://openalex.org/W2558830318,"To exploit the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI when evaluating the therapeutic response of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) to Imatinib in a mouse model.Mice with xenografts bearing cells from the GIST-T1 cell line were randomly divided into a treated group receiving Imatinib and a control group. DWMRI scans with 14 b-values (0-1500 s/mm2) were performed before and after treatment (days 1, 3 and 7). IVIM related parameters perfusion fractions (fp) and perfusion-related diffusion coefficients (D*) and the conventional apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were calculated by fitting the DWMRI signal decay. The mean changes from baseline to each post-treatment time point for each measurement (ΔADC, Δfp and ΔD*) were calculated. The differences of mean changes between the two groups were tested for statistical significance. Histopathological analyses including Ki-67, CD31, TUNEL and H&E were conducted in conjunction with the MRI scans.Increases in ADC of the treated group were higher than those of the control group after treatment, whereas statistical significances were not observed. Compared to the control group, D* in the treated group decreased significantly (ΔD*treated = -41%, -49%, and -49% with P = 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.0001), and fp increased significantly (Δfptreated = 79%, 82% and 110%, with P = 0.001, 0.0001 and P = 0.0007) on days 1, 3 and 7 after treatment. Histopathological analyses demonstrated different tumor tissue characteristics between the treated and control groups.IVIM measurements may serve as more sensitive imaging biomarkers than ADC when assessing GIST response to Imatinib as early as one day after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2559064810,"With the globalization of the world economy, international innovation collaboration has taken place all over the world. This study selects three emerging technologies (3D printing, big data and carbon nanotubes and graphene technology) among 20 countries as the research objects, using three patent-based indicators and network relationship analysis to reflect international collaboration patterns. Then we integrate empirical analyses to show effecting factors of international collaboration degrees by using panel data. The results indicate that while 3D printing technology is associated with a “balanced collaboration” mode, big data technology is more accurately described by a radial pattern, centered on the United States, and carbon nanotubes and graphene technology exhibits “small-world” characteristics in this respect. It also shows that the factors GDP per capita (GPC), R&D expenditure (RDE) and the export of global trade value (ETV) negatively affect the level of international collaboration. It could be useful for China and other developing countries to make international scientific and technological collaboration strategies and policies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2557988911,"Objective To analyze the association between circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) and Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1) and radiological progression in patients with tightly controlled rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Serum levels of OPG and DKK-1 were measured in 97 RA patients who were treated according to a treat-to-target strategy (T2T) aimed at remission (DAS28<2.6). Radiologic joint damage progression was assessed by changes in the total Sharp-van der Heijde score (SHS) on serial radiographs of the hands and feet. The independent association between these biomarker levels and the structural damage endpoint was examined using regression analysis Results The mean age of the 97 RA patients (68 women) at the time of the study was 54 ± 14 years, and the median disease duration was 1.6 ± 1.5 years. Most patients were seropositive for either RF or ACPA, and the large majority (76%) were in remission or had low disease activity. After a median follow-up time of 3.3 ± 1.5 years (range, 1–7.5 yrs.), the mean total SHS annual progression was 0.88 ± 2.20 units. Fifty-two percent of the patients had no progression (defined as a total SHS of zero). The mean serum OPG level did not change significantly over the study period (from 3.9 ± 1.8 to 4.07 ± 2.23 pmol/L), whereas the mean serum DKK-1 level decreased, although not significantly (from 29.9 ± 10.9 to 23.6 ± 18.8 pmol/L). In the multivariate analysis, the predictive factors increasing the likelihood of total SHS progression were age (OR per year = 1.10; p = 0.003) and a high mean C-reactive protein level over the study period (OR = 1.29; p = 0.005). Circulating OPG showed a protective effect reducing the likelihood of joint space narrowing by 60% (95% CI: 0.38–0.94) and the total SHS progression by 48% (95% CI: 0.28–0.83). The DKK-1 levels were not associated with radiological progression. Conclusion In patients with tightly controlled RA, serum OPG was inversely associated with progression of joint destruction. This biomarker may be useful in combination with other risk factors to improve prediction in patients in clinical remission or low disease activity state."
https://openalex.org/W2557774468,"K-shuff is a new algorithm for comparing the similarity of gene sequence libraries, providing measures of the structural and compositional diversity as well as the significance of the differences between these measures. Inspired by Ripley's K-function for spatial point pattern analysis, the Intra K-function or IKF measures the structural diversity, including both the richness and overall similarity of the sequences, within a library. The Cross K-function or CKF measures the compositional diversity between gene libraries, reflecting both the number of OTUs shared as well as the overall similarity in OTUs. A Monte Carlo testing procedure then enables statistical evaluation of both the structural and compositional diversity between gene libraries. For 16S rRNA gene libraries from complex bacterial communities such as those found in seawater, salt marsh sediments, and soils, K-shuff yields reproducible estimates of structural and compositional diversity with libraries greater than 50 sequences. Similarly, for pyrosequencing libraries generated from a glacial retreat chronosequence and Illumina® libraries generated from US homes, K-shuff required >300 and 100 sequences per sample, respectively. Power analyses demonstrated that K-shuff is sensitive to small differences in Sanger or Illumina® libraries. This extra sensitivity of K-shuff enabled examination of compositional differences at much deeper taxonomic levels, such as within abundant OTUs. This is especially useful when comparing communities that are compositionally very similar but functionally different. K-shuff will therefore prove beneficial for conventional microbiome analysis as well as specific hypothesis testing."
https://openalex.org/W2558647481,"The stochastic nature of gene regulatory networks described by Chemical Master Equation (CME) leads to the distribution of proteins. A deterministic bistability is usually reflected as a bimodal distribution in stochastic simulations. Within a certain range of the parameter space, a bistable system exhibits two stable steady states, one at the low end and the other at the high end. Consequently, it appears to have a bimodal distribution with one sub-population (mode) around the low end and the other around the high end. In most cases, only one mode is favorable, and guiding cells to the desired state is valuable. Traditionally, the population was redistributed simply by adjusting the concentration of the inducer or the stimulator. However, this method has limitations; for example, the addition of stimulator cannot drive cells to the desired state in a common bistable system studied in this work. In fact, it pushes cells only to the undesired state. In addition, it causes a position shift of the modes, and this shift could be as large as the value of the mode itself. Such a side effect might damage coordination, and this problem can be avoided by applying a new method presented in this work. We illustrated how to manipulate the intensity of internal noise by using biologically practicable methods and utilized it to prompt the population to the desired mode. As we kept the deterministic behavior untouched, the aforementioned drawback was overcome. Remarkably, more than 96% of cells has been driven to the desired state. This method is genetically applicable to biological systems exhibiting a bimodal distribution resulting from bistability. Moreover, the reaction network studied in this work can easily be extended and applied to many other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2559327706,"Plants have evolved an array of specific photoreceptors to acclimate to the light environment. By sensing light signals, photoreceptors modulate plant morphology, carbon- and water-physiology, crop yield and quality of harvestable organs, among other responses. Many cultural practices and crop management decisions alter light quantity and quality perceived by plants cultivated in the field. Under full sunlight, phytochromes perceive high red to far red ratios (R:FR; 1.1), whereas overhead or lateral low R:FR (below 1.1) are sensed in the presence of plant shade or neighboring plants, respectively. Grapevine is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. To date, studies on grapevine response to light focused on different Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) levels; however, limited data exist about its response to light quality. In this study we aimed to investigate morphological, biochemical, and hydraulic responses of Vitis vinifera to variations in R:FR. Therefore, we irradiated Syrah and Torrontés Riojano plants, grown in a glasshouse, with lateral FR light (low lateral R:FR treatment), while others, that were kept as controls, were not irradiated (ambient lateral R:FR treatment). In response to the low lateral R:FR treatment, grapevine plants did not display any of the SAS morphological markers (i.e. stem length, petiole length and angle, number of lateral shoots) in any of the cultivars assessed, despite an increase in gibberelins and auxin concentrations in leaf tissues. Low lateral R:FR did not affect dry matter partitioning, water-related traits (stomata density and index, wood anatomy), or water-related physiology (plant conductance, transpiration rate, stem hydraulic conductivity, stomatal conductance). None of the Vitis vinifera varieties assessed displayed the classical morphological and hydraulic responses associated to SAS induced by phytochromes. We discuss these results in the context of natural grapevine environment and agronomical relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2558255316,"The gene KRAS is commonly mutated in lung cancer to encode a constitutively active and oncogenic protein that is well established to initiate and maintain lung tumorigenesis. However, the remaining wild-type KRAS protein, or the other family members HRAS and NRAS, can still be activated in the presence of oncogenic KRAS. Moreover, loss of any one of these three genes has been shown to increase the sensitivity of mice to the carcinogen urethane, which induces Kras mutation-positive early lung lesions. To determine the contribution of progressively disrupting Hras and Nras genes on urethane lung tumorigenesis, mice with different combinations of wild-type and null alleles of Hras and Nras were exposed with urethane and tumor burden was assessed. As previously reported, loss of one allele of Hras increased the sensitivity of mice to this carcinogen, and this effect was further exacerbated by the loss of the second Hras allele. However, loss of one or both alleles of Nras failed to alter tumor burden, either in the absence or presence of Hras, after exposure to urethane. Additionally, no obvious difference between lung lesions in mice with wild-type versus null alleles was detected, suggesting that wild-type Ras proteins may exert a tumor suppressive effects at the time of initiation, although other interpretations are certainly possible. In summary, these data suggest that in some genetic backgrounds inactivation of different wild-type Ras genes can have different effects on urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis."

The k-clique percolation method was used to extract local research communities within the network. Analysis of the shared vocabulary in research papers reflects the trends of collaboration and splintering among different disciplines in medicine. Our model identifies distinct communities within each discipline that preferentially collaborate with other communities within other domains of specialty, and overturns some common perceptions. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis provides a tool to assess growth, merging, splitting and contraction of research communities and can thereby serve as a guide to inform policymakers about funding and training in healthcare."

We investigated whether using formulae to estimate creatinine excretion rate (eCER), rather than assuming a standard creatinine excretion rate, would improve the estimation of proteinuria from spot urine samples in kidney transplant recipients.We measured 24 hour urine protein and albumin and spot albumin:creatinine (ACR) and spot protein:creatinine (PCR) in 181 Kidney transplant recipients."" We utilized 6 different published formulae (Fotheringham, CKD-EPI, Cockcroft-Gault, Walser, Goldwasser and Rule) to estimate eCER and from it calculated estimated albumin and protein excretion rate (eAER and ePER). Bias, precision and accuracy (within 15%, 30% and 50%) of ACR, PCR, eAER, ePER were compared to 24-hour urine protein and albumin.ACR and PCR significantly underestimated 24-hour albumin and protein excretion (ACR Bias (IQR), -5.9 mg/day; p< 0.01; PCR Bias, (IQR), -35.2 mg/day; p<0.01). None of the formulae used to calculate eAER or ePER had a bias that was significantly different from the 24-hour collection (eAER and ePER bias: Fotheringham -0.3 and 7.2, CKD-EPI 0.3 and 13.5, Cockcroft-Gault -3.2 and -13.9, Walser -1.7 and 3.1, Goldwasser -1.3 and -0.5, Rule -0.6 and 4.2 mg/day respectively. The accuracy for ACR and PCR were lower (within 30% being 38% and 43% respectively) than the corresponding values estimated by utilizing eCER (for eAER 46% to 49% and ePER 46-54%).Utilizing estimated creatinine excretion to calculate eAER and ePER improves the estimation of 24-hour albuminuria/proteinuria with spot urine samples in kidney transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2557574697,"The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is widely used in molecular evolutionary analyses, particularly to identify genes under adaptive or unique evolution in the human lineage. For such studies, it is necessary to align nucleotide sequences of homologous protein-coding genes among multiple species. The validity of these analyses is dependent on high quality genomic data. However, for most mammalian species (other than humans and mice), only draft genomes are available. There has been concern that some results obtained from evolutionary analyses using draft genomes may not be correct. The rhesus macaque provides a unique opportunity to determine whether an improved genome (MacaM) yields better results than a draft genome (rheMac2) for evolutionary studies. We compared protein-coding genes annotated in the rheMac2 and MacaM genomes with their human orthologs. We found many genes annotated in rheMac2 had apparently spurious sequences not present in genes derived from MacaM. The rheMac2 annotations also appeared to inflate a frequently used evolutionary index, ω (the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates). Genes with these spurious sequences must be filtered out from evolutionary analyses to obtain correct results. With the MacaM genome, improved sequence information means many more genes can be examined for indications of selection. These results indicate how upgrading genomes from draft status to a higher level of quality can improve interpretation of evolutionary patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2558446228,"How many times have you been to the doctor and was told that a balanced lifestyle is key for a healthy, disease-free, long life? How many times did genetics take the blame? But do we really know whether genetic risk associated with complex diseases can be offset by behavioral changes? A recent study at the New England Journal of Medicine now brings us some answers.Image from iStock.com/udraView Large Image | View Hi-Res Image | Download PowerPoint SlideThe idea that most human diseases are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environment is not new. Complex genetic disorders, those in which the effects of multiple genes are at play and clear-cut patterns of inheritance are difficult to pinpoint, are particularly influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors. Take heart disease as an example. While one’s own risk of cardiovascular disease increases by 3- to 5-fold if a person’s parent is diseased, factors such as diet, physical activity, tobacco use, environmental stress, and host factors such as age and sex also play a significant role in the risk of developing disease. The problem is that quantifying the contribution of each of these factors is tricky. Khera et al. (2016)xKhera, A.V., Emdin, C.A., Drake, I., Natarajan, P., Bick, A.G., Cook, N.R., Chasman, D.I., Baber, U., Mehran, R., Rader, D.J. et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; CrossrefSee all References)Khera et al. (2016) set up to try to answer the billion dollar question: can a healthy lifestyle compensate for a strong genetic risk of developing disease?Genetic risk in complex diseases results from the combination of incremental effects of a large number of DNA sequence polymorphisms. In the case of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarct—a common and severe complication of cardiac disease—over 50 independent loci have been associated with risk of disease in genome-wide analyses. The aggregate of these risk genes provides has proved useful in defining genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular events. Khera et al. make use of this strategy to stratify the ∼60,000 subjects in their prospective study into three genetic risk categories: low, intermediate, and high. Then they ask whether baseline heathy lifestyle choices impact the risk of developing coronary events and atherosclerosis. The definition of healthy lifestyle was drawn from the strategic goals of the American Heart Association (AHA) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular in the general population and include no current smoking, no obesity, physical activity at least once weekly, and a healthy diet pattern. Importantly, the subjects in the study were previously enrolled in independent studies and represent three completely independent cohorts, what helps to power their analyses.As one would expect, subjects with high polygenic risk score were at much higher risk of developing coronary events than those at low genetic risk. What may come as a surprise is that further dividing subjects of different genetic risk groups according to their lifestyle choices shows that those who make healthy lifestyle choices present ∼45%–47% lower relative risk of developing coronary events. Even subjects at high genetic risk have their risk reduced when they make healthy lifestyle choices. The association also seems to hold true in men and women, and it does not seem to be under strong influence of ancestry. Moreover, not only the risk of adverse coronary events is reduced by adherence to healthy lifestyle but also coronary artery calcification, which is a prelude to more severe disease.Does that mean that going to the gym and eating fresh fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts and fish (while avoiding saturated fat, red meat and sugar-sweetened beverages) can counteract completely the effect of genetic inheritance? Certainly not. The new study clearly shows that high genetic risk is a strong and independent risk factor that increases the risk of coronary events and atherosclerosis. What perhaps is unexpected is that genetics and healthy lifestyle choices seem to be independently contributing to the susceptibility of heart disease. While it is true that people with high genetic risk benefit the most from healthy choices, the positive effect is also seen in those with intermediate and low genetic risk. In other words, healthy lifestyle benefits everyone, and high genetic risk is not necessarily deterministic of disease outcome.What do these findings mean from a basic biology perspective? Will we be able to get passed associations and begin to understand relationships of causality between healthy habits, genetics and disease? Will we be able to move beyond generic prescriptions of diet and exercise and tailor one’s choices to his or her genetics? Recent data have already showed that the response to food, for instance, is highly individualized when it comes to metabolism and glucose response (Zeevi et al., 2015xPersonalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses. Zeevi, D., Korem, T., Zmora, N., Israeli, D., Rothschild, D., Weinberger, A., Ben-Yacov, O., Lador, D., Avnit-Sagi, T., Lotan-Pompan, M. et al. Cell. 2015; 163: 1079–1094Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (69)See all ReferencesZeevi et al., 2015), speaking to the need a personalized approaches for nutrition and medicine. Further, can the risk to other complex diseases be modified by behavioral changes? While we eagerly wait for answers to some of these questions, perhaps it would be wise to stick with carrots."
