https://openalex.org/W4311551799,"Cells respond to fluctuating nutrient supply by adaptive changes in organelle dynamics and in metabolism. How such changes are orchestrated on a cell-wide scale is unknown. We show that endosomal signaling lipid turnover by MTM1, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] 3-phosphatase mutated in X-linked centronuclear myopathy in humans, controls mitochondrial morphology and function by reshaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Starvation-induced endosomal recruitment of MTM1 impairs PI(3)P-dependent contact formation between tubular ER membranes and early endosomes, resulting in the conversion of ER tubules into sheets, the inhibition of mitochondrial fission, and sustained oxidative metabolism. Our results unravel an important role for early endosomal lipid signaling in controlling ER shape and, thereby, mitochondrial form and function to enable cells to adapt to fluctuating nutrient environments."
https://openalex.org/W4311552206,"People are living longer internationally, with a growing number experiencing very old age (≥95 years). Physical, psychological and social changes can challenge one’s sense of self and disrupt existing identities. However, experiences of the very old in society are seldom researched and how they construct identity and negotiate a sense of self is little understood. Our study focuses on participants aged &gt;95 years to understand how identity is conceptualised to negotiate a continued place in society. Qualitative interviews with 23 people were thematically analysed, underpinned by Positioning Theory. Five themes were generated: A contented life; reframing independence; familial positioning; appearance and physical wellbeing; reframing ill health. Participants saw themselves as largely content and, despite their world becoming smaller, found pleasure in small routines. Perceptions of self were reframed to maintain autonomy within narrow parameters. Past relationships and experiences/events were drawn on to make sense of ongoing ways of living. There were tensions around feelings of loss of autonomy and independence, with some valuing these over issues such as safety. This sometimes conflicted with views of others and small acts of resistance and subversion were acted out to maintain some sense of control. However, participants minimised progressive ill health. Findings provide insight into how the very old may utilise identity to negotiate, acquiesce, resist and challenge the world around them."
https://openalex.org/W4311551807,"Fractals-objects with noninteger dimensions-occur in manifold settings and length scales in nature. In this work, we identify an emergent dynamical fractal in a disorder-free, stoichiometric, and three-dimensional magnetic crystal in thermodynamic equilibrium. The phenomenon is born from constraints on the dynamics of the magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice, which restrict them to move on the fractal. This observation explains the anomalous exponent found in magnetic noise experiments in the spin ice compound Dy2Ti2O7, and it resolves a long-standing puzzle about its rapidly diverging relaxation time. The capacity of spin ice to exhibit such notable phenomena suggests that there will be further unexpected discoveries in the cooperative dynamics of even simple topological many-body systems."

The seasonality and spread of influenza are often associated with meteorological factors and have spatio-temporal differences. Based on the influenza cases and daily average meteorological factors in Lanzhou from 2014 to 2017, this study firstly aimed to analyze the characteristics of influenza incidence in Lanzhou and the impact of meteorological factors on influenza activities. Then, SARIMA(X) models for the prediction were established. The influenza cases in Lanzhou from 2014 to 2017 was more male than female, and the younger the age, the higher the susceptibility; the epidemic characteristics showed that there is a peak in winter, a secondary peak in spring, and a trough in summer and autumn. The influenza cases in Lanzhou increased with increasing daily pressure, decreasing precipitation, average relative humidity, hours of sunshine, average daily temperature and average daily wind speed. Low temperature was a significant driving factor for the increase of transmission intensity of seasonal influenza. The SARIMAX (1,0,0)(1,0,1)[12] multivariable model with average temperature has better prediction performance than the university model. This model is helpful to establish an early warning system, and provide important evidence for the development of influenza control policies and public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4311552634,"Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose (OD) impose huge social and economic burdens on society and health care systems. Research suggests that Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) is effective in the treatment of OUD. We use machine learning to investigate the association between patient's adherence to prescribed MOUD along with other risk factors in patients diagnosed with OUD and potential OD following the treatment.We used longitudinal Medicaid claims for two selected US states to subset a total of 26,685 patients with OUD diagnosis and appropriate Medicaid coverage between 2015 and 2018. We considered patient age, sex, region level socio-economic data, past comorbidities, MOUD prescription type and other selected prescribed medications along with the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) as a proxy for adherence to MOUD as predictive variables for our model, and overdose events as the dependent variable. We applied four different machine learning classifiers and compared their performance, focusing on the importance and effect of PDC as a variable. We also calculated results based on risk stratification, where our models separate high risk individuals from low risk, to assess usefulness in clinical decision-making.Among the selected classifiers, the XGBoost classifier has the highest AUC (0.77) closely followed by the Logistic Regression (LR). The LR has the best stratification result: patients in the top 10% of risk scores account for 35.37% of overdose events over the next 12 month observation period. PDC score calculated over the treatment window is one of the most important features, with better PDC lowering risk of OD, as expected. In terms of risk stratification results, of the 35.37% of overdose events that the predictive model could detect within the top 10% of risk scores, 72.3% of these cases were non-adherent in terms of their medication (PDC <0.8). Targeting the top 10% outcome of the predictive model could decrease the total number of OD events by 10.4%.The best performing models allow identification of, and focus on, those at high risk of opioid overdose. With MOUD being included for the first time as a factor of interest, and being identified as a significant factor, outreach activities related to MOUD can be targeted at those at highest risk."
https://openalex.org/W4311556598,"Policing, corrections, and other carceral institutions are under scrutiny for driving health harms, while receiving disproportionate resources at the expense of prevention and other services. Amidst renewed interest in structural determinants of health, roles of race and class in shaping government investment priorities are poorly understood.Based on the Social Conflict Model, we assessed relationships between city racial/ economic profiles measured by the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) and budgetary priorities measured by the novel Carceral Resource Index (CRI), contrasting investments in carceral systems with funding for health and social support across the 50 most populous cities in the United States (U.S.). Bivariate correlations, and unadjusted and adjusted polynomial regression models were used to assess the relationship between budgetary investments and population concentration at extremes in terms of income, racial/ethnic composition, and education, controlling for other demographic characteristics.In our sample, median CRI was -0.59 (IQR -0.64, -0.45), with only seven cities exhibiting positive CRI values. This indicates that most large U.S. cities spend more on carceral systems than on health and supportive services, combined. Adjusted polynomial models showed a convex relationship between the CRI and ICE-Education, and ICE-Race(White vs. Black)+Income, with quadratic terms that were positive and significant at p<0.05. After controlling for age, the strongest prioritization of carceral systems was observed in cities where the proportion of low-income Black residents approached or exceeded that of high-income white residents.Municipal prioritization of carceral investments over health and social support is pervasive in the U.S and exacerbated by racial and economic disparities. The CRI offers new opportunities to understand the role of government investments as a structural determinant of health and safety. Longitudinal research is warranted to examine the relationship between budget priorities, structural racism, and health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4311602217,"Multiple factors in addition to over consumption lead to obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the United States and worldwide. CYP2B6 is the only human detoxification CYP whose loss is associated with obesity, and Cyp2b-null mice show greater diet-induced obesity with increased steatosis than wildtype mice. However, a putative mechanism has not been determined. LC-MS/MS revealed that CYP2B6 metabolizes PUFAs, with a preference for metabolism of ALA to 9-HOTrE and to a lesser extent 13-HOTrE with a preference for metabolism of PUFAs at the 9- and 13-positions. To further study the role of CYP2B6 in vivo , humanized-CYP2B6-transgenic (hCYP2B6-Tg) and Cyp2b-null mice were fed a 60% high-fat diet for 16 weeks. Compared to Cyp2b-null mice, hCYP2B6-Tg mice showed reduced weight gain and metabolic disease as measured by glucose tolerance tests, however hCYP2B6-Tg male mice showed increased liver triglycerides. Serum and liver oxylipin metabolite concentrations increased in male hCYP2B6-Tg mice, while only serum oxylipins increased in female hCYP2B6-Tg mice with the greatest increases in LA oxylipins metabolized at the 9 and 13-positions. Several of these oxylipins, specifically 9-HODE, 9-HOTrE, and 13-oxoODE, are PPAR agonists. RNA-seq data also demonstrated sexually dimorphic changes in gene expression related to nuclear receptor signaling, especially CAR &gt; PPAR with qPCR suggesting PPARγ signaling is more likely than PPARα signaling in male mice. Overall, our data indicates that CYP2B6 is an anti-obesity enzyme, but probably to a lesser extent than murine Cyp2b’s. Therefore, the inhibition of CYP2B6 by xenobiotics or dietary fats can exacerbate obesity and metabolic disease potentially through disrupted PUFA metabolism and the production of key lipid metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W4311602240,"Numerous studies on unrealistic optimism (UO) have shown that people claim they are less exposed to COVID-19 infection than others. Yet, it has not been assessed if this bias evolves; does it escalate or diminish when the information about the threat changes? The present paper fills this gap. For 12 months 120 participants estimated their own and their peers' risk of COVID-19 infection. Results show that UO regarding COVID-19 infection is an enduring phenomenon-It was the dominant tendency throughout almost the entire study and was never substituted by Unrealistic Pessimism. While the presence of UO-bias was constant, its magnitude changed. We tested possible predictors of these changes: the daily new cases/deaths, the changes in governmental restrictions and the mobility of participants' community. Out of these predictors, only changes in governmental restrictions proved to be significant- when the restrictions tightened, UO increased."
https://openalex.org/W4311551852,"In the conservation and development of traditional villages, it is vital to delineate reasonable village boundaries. At present, China’s traditional village boundaries are mainly defined through the boundaries of village construction land in its land policy. This approach ignores the ""natural"" state of traditional village boundaries and does not truly reflect villagers’ use of their villages. Using the constituent line segments of traditional village boundaries as parameters, we delineate a series of traditional village boundaries and constructed an assessment system for traditional village boundaries in terms of the convenience of villagers’ activities and their habitual use of village space. We used the delineation of the boundary of Haishangqiao village in the Yiluo River Basin in China as an example to test the effectiveness of the traditional village boundary delineation method and assessment system. The results show the following: (1) The virtual line segments connecting the buildings on the traditional village boundary are the main factors affecting the delineation of the traditional village boundary. (2) The amplitude of vibration and the global deviation of traditional village boundaries are the main influencing factors of complexity. (3) The complexity of traditional village boundaries is negatively correlated with the convenience of villagers’ activities. (4) The complexity of traditional village boundaries is negatively correlated with the emptiness of the internal space of traditional villages. The results of this study can provide practical reference values for scholars of rural planning, rural construction, rural conservation, rural management, and rural research."
https://openalex.org/W4311552277,"Long-term opioid use is an increasingly important problem related to the ongoing opioid epidemic. The purpose of this study was to identify patient, hospitalization and system-level determinants of long term opioid therapy (LTOT) among patients recently discharged from hospital.To be eligible for this study, patient needed to have filled at least one opioid prescription three-months post-discharge. We retrieved data from the provincial health insurance agency to measure medical service and prescription drug use in the year prior to and after hospitalization. A multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards model was utilized to determine factors associated with time to the first LTOT occurrence, defined as time-varying cumulative opioid duration of ≥ 60 days.Overall, 22.4% of the 1,551 study patients were classified as LTOT, who had a mean age of 66.3 years (SD = 14.3). Having no drug copay status (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.91, 95% CI: 1.40-2.60), being a LTOT user before the index hospitalization (aHR 6.05, 95% CI: 4.22-8.68) or having history of benzodiazepine use (aHR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.12-1.83) were all associated with an increased likelihood of LTOT. Cardiothoracic surgical patients had a 40% lower LTOT risk (aHR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.31-0.96) as compared to medical patients. Initial opioid dispensation of > 90 milligram morphine equivalents (MME) was also associated with higher likelihood of LTOT (aHR 2.08, 95% CI: 1.17-3.69).Several patient-level characteristics associated with an increased risk of ≥ 60 days of cumulative opioid use. The results could be used to help identify patients who are at high-risk of continuing opioids beyond guideline recommendations and inform policies to curb excessive opioid prescribing."
https://openalex.org/W4311552622,"The present study examines the moderation effect of board independence change on the relationship between board characteristics, related party transactions and financial performance of Indian listed banks over 10 years from 2010 to 2019. While board size, independence, diligence, and remuneration were taken to represent board characteristics, all key personnel and subsidiaries’ transactions were considered measures for related party transactions. On the other hand, the financial performance of banks was measured by two accounting-based measures (return on assets and profit after tax) and two market-based measures (earning per share and Tobin Q). The results revealed that board independence change has a significant negative effect on financial performance. Further, the results indicated that board independence change moderates positively and significantly the relationship between related party transactions and financial performance. The findings also showed that board independence change had a moderating effect that significantly and negatively weakens board size and effectiveness, negatively influencing banks’ profitability. Unlike other studies, this study uniquely uses board independence change as a moderator between board characteristics, related party transactions, and several measures of banks’ financial performance. The limited research highlighting this issue, where Indian banks have encountered several challenges in the last few years, has motivated the present study to bridge the existing gaps in the strand literature. Therefore, this research opens useful insights and has beneficial implications for policymakers, bankers, financial analysts, and academicians."
https://openalex.org/W4311557018,"Although many studies have examined the effects of perceived stress on some specific stress responses during the COVID-19, a comprehensive study is still lacking. And the co-mediating role of coping style and resilience as important mediators of stress processes is also unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of perceived stress on emotional, physical, and behavioral stress responses and the mediating roles of coping style and resilience in Chinese population during the recurrent outbreak of COVID-19 from a comprehensive perspective. 1087 participants were recruited to complete the anonymous online survey including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Response Questionnaire, the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and the Emotional Resilience Questionnaire. Pearson's correlation and Hayes PROCESS macro 3.5 model 6 were used in the mediating effect analysis. Results showed that positive coping style and resilience both buffered the negative effects of perceived stress on emotional, physical, and behavioral responses through direct or indirect pathways, and resilience had the strongest mediating effects. The findings urged relevant authorities and individuals to take measures to promote positive coping style and resilience to combat the ongoing pandemic stress and protect public physical and mental health."

https://openalex.org/W4311602333,"Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of under-five mortality in India and Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main bacterial pathogen for it. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine 13 (PCV13) has been introduced in a phased manner, in the national immunization program of India since 2017/2018. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PCV13 on chest radiograph (CXR)-confirmed pneumonia, in children hospitalized with WHO-defined severe CAP.This prospective, multi-site test-negative study was conducted in a hospital-network situated in three districts of Northern India where PCV13 had been introduced. Children aged 2-23 months, hospitalized with severe CAP and with interpretable CXR were included after parental consent. Clinical data was extracted from hospital records. CXRs were interpreted by a panel of three independent blinded trained radiologists. Exposure to PCV13 was defined as ≥2 doses of PCV13 in children aged ≤ 12 months and ≥ 1 dose(s) in children > 12 months of age. Our outcome measures were CXR finding of primary endpoint pneumonia with or without other infiltrates (PEP±OI); vaccine effectiveness (VE) and hospital mortality.From 1st June 2017-30th April 2021, among 2711 children included, 678 (25.0%) were exposed to PCV1. CXR positive for PEP±OI on CXR was found in 579 (21.4%), of which 103 (17.8%) were exposed to PCV. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for PEP±OI among the exposed group was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54-0.89, p = 0.004). Adjusted VE was 31.0% (95% CI: 11.0-44.0) for PEP±OI. AOR for hospital mortality with PEP±OI was 2.65 (95% CI: 1.27-5.53, p = 0.01).In severe CAP, children exposed to PCV13 had significantly reduced odds of having PEP±OI. Since PEP±OI had increased odds of hospital mortality due to CAP, countrywide coverage with PCV13 is an essential priority."

This study aimed to investigate the role of AIF-1 in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). AIF-1, IL-6, and VEGF expressions in human NSCLC tissue were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify AIF-1-related molecules and pathways in NSCLC. Human lung cancer A549 cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay, and cell migration was evaluated with wound-healing assay. IL-6 and VEGF secretions in A549 cell culture supernatants were quantified using the Elecsys IL-6 immunoassay kit and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Assay Kit. RT-PCR and western blot were performed to quantify the expressions of AIF-1, IL-6, and VEGF mRNAs and proteins involved in p38-MAPK and JAK/STAT3 signaling such as p-p38 and p-STAT3. The effects of AIF-1 on A549 cell proliferation and the expressions of IL-6 and VEGF were assessed using SB203580 and ruxolitinib. The results showed that AIF-1 expression was higher in human NSCLC tissue than that in paracancer tissue. High AIF-1 expression was associated with metastasis, higher TNM stage, and poorer survival. Bioinformatics connected AIF-1 to JAK/STAT signaling in NSCLC. AIF-1 increased A549 cell proliferation, migration, IL-6 secretion and, VEGF secretion, and these effects were attenuated by inhibition of p38-MAPK or JAK/STAT3 signaling. In conclusion, AIF-1 may promote aggressive NSCLC behavior via activation of p38-MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4311552098,"Introduction The continuum of care (CoC) throughout pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery has recently been highlighted as an integrated intervention programme for maternal, new-born, and child health. Existing literature suggests the importance of continuum of care (CoC) for improved maternal and child health outcomes. However due to unavailability of data at the lowest administrative levels, literature on spatial pattern of uptake of full CoC is lacking. The present study attempts to focus on the spatial analysis of CoC in maternal health care in India. Data and methods The study is based on the fourth round of National Family Health Survey data conducted in 2015–16 in India. The outcome variable used is maternal health continuum of care which includes- at least 4 ANC visits, delivery through skilled birth attendant and postnatal check-up within 48 hours of delivery. Univariate and bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) maps have been generated to show the spatial pattern of CoC across 640 districts in India. We also employed spatial regression techniques to explore the determinants of CoC. Findings Percentage of women who followed full CoC was observed to be least for East Kameng (0.0%) district of Arunachal Pradesh and highest in North Goa district (90.4%). Majority of districts where uptake of full CoC was more than 80 percent were found concentrated in southern region on India. Equivalently, findings indicated a strong spatial clustering of full CoC with high-high clusters mostly concentrated in southern districts. Low-low district clusters are concentrated in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. For complete CoC the global Moran’s I is 0.73 indicating the spatial dependence. The spatial regression analysis suggested that modern contraceptive use, meeting with health worker, urbanization and secondary or above education for women have positive impact on the utilisation of CoC. Conclusion The spatial pattern indicates district level clustering in uptake of CoC among women. The study suggests policymakers and stakeholders to implement comprehensive interventions at sub-regional levels for ensuring the completion of CoC for women which acts as a preventive measure for adverse outcomes such as-maternal and child mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4311552113,"Background Limited data exist on the differential association between neighborhood characteristics such as crime and violence and diabetes outcomes by race. Objective To examine racial differences in the relationship between neighborhood characteristics (crime and violence) and glycemic control in a sample of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Design A cross-sectional study. Participants 601 adults with T2DM from the Southeastern United States. Measurements Outcome was glycemic control. Neighborhood violence and crime were the primary independent variable, and previously validated scales and indices were used to assess neighborhood crime and violence. Covariates included age, gender, education, marital status, income, hours of work per week, duration of diabetes, comorbidity, health status, and site of recruitment. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between neighborhood characteristics (violence and crime) and glycemic control adjusting for relevant covariates. Results Approximately 66% of the sample population was Black with ages ranging between 49–71 years. The unadjusted mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was significantly higher for Black adults compared to White adults (8.0 ± 2.0 vs. 7.8 ± 1.6; p = 0.002). In the fully adjusted stratified model, glycemic control was significantly associated with neighborhood crime (β-coefficient: 0.36; 95% CI 0.07, 0.65) and neighborhood violence (β-coefficient: 0.14; 95% CI 0.003, 0.28) for White adults in the fully adjusted model; these relationships were not significant for Black adults. Conclusion In this sample of adults with T2DM, neighborhood crime and violence were significantly associated with glycemic control for White adults, but not for Black adults. Additional research is needed to understand perceptions of neighborhood crime and violence between White adults and Black adults with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W4311552326,"During tissue regeneration, mesenchymal stem cells can support endothelial cells in the process of new vessel formation. For a functional interaction of endothelial cells with mesenchymal stem cells a vascular inductive microenvironment is required. Using a cellular model for neo-vessel formation, we could show that newly formed vascular structures emanated from the embedded aggregates, consisting of mesenchymal stem cells co-cultured with autologous human umbilical vein endothelial cells, into avascular human platelet lysate-based matrices, bridging distances up to 5 mm to join with adjacent aggregates with the same morphology forming an interconnected network. These newly formed vascular sprouts showed branch points and generated a lumen, as sign of mature vascular development. In two-dimensional culture, we detected binding of mesenchymal stem cells to laser-damaged endothelial cells under flow conditions, mimicking the dynamics in blood vessels. In conclusion, we observed that mesenchymal stem cells can support human umbilical vein endothelial cells in their vitality and functionality. In xeno-free human platelet lysate-based matrices, endothelial cells form complex vascular networks in a primarily avascular scaffold with the aid of mesenchymal stem cells, when co-cultured in three-dimensional spherical aggregates. Under dynamic conditions, representing the flow rate of venous vessel, mesenchymal stem cells preferably bind to damaged endothelial cells presumably assisting in the healing process."
https://openalex.org/W4311552567,"Deep learning is notably successful in data analysis, computer vision, and human control. Nevertheless, this approach has inevitably allowed the development of DeepFake video sequences and images that could be altered so that the changes are not easily or explicitly detectable. Such alterations have been recently used to spread false news or disinformation. This study aims to identify Deepfaked videos and images and alert viewers to the possible falsity of the information. The current work presented a novel means of revealing fake face videos by cascading the convolution network with recurrent neural networks and fully connected network (FCN) models. The system detection approach utilizes the eye-blinking state in temporal video frames. Notwithstanding, it is deemed challenging to precisely depict (i) artificiality in fake videos and (ii) spatial information within the individual frame through this physiological signal. Spatial features were extracted using the VGG16 network and trained with the ImageNet dataset. The temporal features were then extracted in every 20 sequences through the LSTM network. On another note, the pre-processed eye-blinking state served as a probability to generate a novel BPD dataset. This newly-acquired dataset was fed to three models for training purposes with each entailing four, three, and six hidden layers, respectively. Every model constitutes a unique architecture and specific dropout value. Resultantly, the model optimally and accurately identified tampered videos within the dataset. The study model was assessed using the current BPD dataset based on one of the most complex datasets (FaceForensic++) with 90.8% accuracy. Such precision was successfully maintained in datasets that were not used in the training process. The training process was also accelerated by lowering the computation prerequisites."

https://openalex.org/W4311552956,"Purpose To explore the association between the physical health (PH) and physical activity behavior (PAB) of children aged 3 to 6 years, and to provide a basis for the scientific planning of children’s physical activity behavior in kindergarten. Methods A total of 18041 children in China aged 3 to 6 years were selected as the research subject. The PH monitoring indicators were measured according to ""The National Physical Fitness Measurement Standards Manual"" (Preschool Children Version) (NPFMSM), and PAB was reported by teachers. The chi-square test was used to test for differences in PH and PAB across groups, the percentile method was used to rank PAB, correlation analysis was used to analyze the association between components of PH and PAB, and multiple linear regression was used to determine the independent association between PAB and PH. Results Participants in this study exhibited poor PH status, and the detection rates of failure were 16.4% for boys and 16.8% for girls, and showed a decreasing trend with increasing age. The grade difference and sex difference in PH components were statistically significant (P&lt;0.01). PAB changes to static activities with increasing age, mainly to static indoor physical activities (SIPAs). The regression effects of the total duration of physical activity (TDPA) and dynamic physical activity (DPA) on PH score and physical fitness (PF) score were significant (P &lt; 0.01) but not statistically significant with static physical activity (SPA) (P&gt;0.05). Dynamic outdoor physical activity (DOPA) is the core factor affecting children’s PH, and is significantly positively correlated with the components of PH. Conclusion PAB in kindergarten can improve children’s PH, and reasonable planning of PAB in kindergarten has a targeted effect on PH promotion."
https://openalex.org/W4311553047,"Over the past 10 years, studies using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing have shown that mosquitoes harbor diverse bacterial communities in their digestive system. However, no previous research has examined the total bacteria community inside versus outside of mosquitoes and whether bacteria found on the outside could represent a potential health threat through mechanical transfer. We examined the bacterial community of the external surface and internal body of female Anopheles coluzzii adults collected from homes in Côte d’Ivoire, Africa, by Illumina sequencing of the V3 to V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. Anopheles coluzzii is in the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) species complex and important in the transmission of malaria. The total 16S rRNA reads were assigned to 34 phyla, 73 orders, 325 families, and 700 genera. At the genus level, the most abundant genera inside and outside combined were Bacillus , Staphylococcus , Enterobacter , Corynebacterium , Kocuria , Providencia , and Sphingomonas . Mosquitoes had a greater diversity of bacterial taxa internally compared to the outside. The internal bacterial communities were similar between homes, while the external body samples were significantly different between homes. The bacteria on the external body were associated with plants, human and animal skin, and human and animal infections. Internally, Rickettsia bellii and Rickettsia typhi were found, potentially of importance, since this genus is associated with human diseases. Based on these findings, further research is warranted to assess the potential mechanical transmission of bacteria by mosquitoes moving into homes and the importance of the internal mosquito microbiota in human health."
https://openalex.org/W4311556803,"The Canadian province of Nova Scotia recently became the first jurisdiction in North America to pass deemed consent organ donation legislation. The announcement of this legislation generated substantial online discussion, which we analyzed to provide insights on public perception.We performed directed content analysis on 2663 user-generated comments appearing on two widely-shared Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) articles published online in April 2019. We determined levels of support and opposition in comments and described the specific rhetoric used for doing so. We also performed one-way ANOVA and Pearson chi-square tests to determine how the comments were being received and engaged by other users.A range of commentary was present in both support and opposition to the changes in legislation. There were more negative than positive comments, and negative commentary generated more replies. Positive comments were received more positively by other users while negative comments were received more negatively. The total sum of negative comments was greatly influenced by a small number of very active participants. Negative commentary focused more on broad concepts and principles related to government, power, and individual rights rather than specific issues in the Nova Scotian context. Substantial issues of trust in the government and healthcare system were evident.There were strong positive and negative sentiments expressed in the comments, but the total sum of negativity in the comments was significantly influenced by a small number of commentators. Analysis on the presumed consent concerns can be helpful to inform public outreach efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4311556880,"Introduction Chordoma is formed from embryonic residues or ectopic chordae and locally aggressive or malignant tumors. We visually analyzed the research tendency and hotspot of chordoma. Methods The bibliometric analysis was conducted from the Web of Science Core Collection database over the past two decades. The term and strategies were as follows: “TS = (chordoma) OR TS = (chordoblastoma) OR TS = (chordocarcinoma) OR TS = (chordoepithelioma) OR TS = (chordosarcoma) OR TS = (notochordoma). AND Language: English. AND Reference Type: Article OR Review”. A total of 2,118 references were retrieved and used to make a visual analysis by VOSviewer 1.6.15. Results The chordoma was on a steady rise and chordoma but remained the focus of scholars and organizations over the last two decades. The Chinese institutions and scholars lacked cooperation with their counterparts in other countries. The citations of documents and co-citation analysis of cited references suggested that M.L. McMaster, B.P. Walcott, P. Bergh, and S. Stacchiotti were leading researchers in this field of chordoma and their papers had been widely accepted and inspired recent researches. Keywords associated with recent chemotherapy, PD-1-related immunotherapy, and SMARCB1/integrase interactor 1 (INI1) in chordoma were a shortage of research and there may be more research ideas in the future by scholars. The research of chordoma will continue to be the hotspot. Conclusions Thus, explaining the molecular mechanism and potential role of transcriptional inhibition and immunologic responses to SMARCB1/INI1-negative poorly differentiated chordoma will be available for preclinical experiments and clinical trials and lead to new therapeutic opportunities for chordoma patients."

To test the proposition, this study utilizes a nationally representative longitudinal survey with Indonesia's health insurance for poor policy in 2014 as the quasi-experimental case study. The country represents developing nations that undergo a massive and rapid expansion of health insurance coverage. The empirical approach combines a matching and difference-in-differences method to obviate potential bias of the selectivity nature of health insurance provision and time-invariant unobserved factors. The findings suggest the presence of ex-ante moral hazard in the form of the less people using trash cans associated with the introduction of the subsidized health insurance premium. The results add empirical findings of a negative side effect of expanding health insurance coverage in developing nations."
https://openalex.org/W4311602335,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular (CVD) disease related deaths worldwide. It affects more than 20% of adults in Ethiopia, making it a major public health concern. Although it is important to uncover the hidden extent of hypertension, there is limited information on the proportion of undiagnosed hypertension in rural areas of the country.This study aimed to determine the magnitude of undiagnosed hypertension and associated factors among adults living in the rural Dano district, Central Ethiopia 2020.A quantitative, community-based cross-sectional study conducted from May to July 2020. A three-stage sampling technique was used to select a total of 605 study participants. A Validated tool was used to assess the participant's behavioral characteristics. Blood pressure was measured using digital blood pressure apparatus. The mean of three blood measurements was used to classify hypertension after intra-class correlation was tested. Standardized instruments were used to assess participants' health-seeking behavior and knowledge of the hypertensive disease. The proportion of undiagnosed hypertension was determined among patients with hypertension. The regression analyses were done to determine factors associated with undiagnosed hypertension. The adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was estimated to measure the strength of the association. The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value < 0.05.The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension was 21.32% (CI: 19.95%, 25.8%). Living in a household with the low wealth index [(AOR: 3.5,95%CI: (1.6,6.4)], far distance to health facility, [(AOR: 0.155,95%CI: (0.11.0.67)], underweight, [AOR = 2.2.1,95%CI:(2.00,4.22)], use of smokeless tobacco products, [AOR = 3.2,95%Cl:(1.88,4.75)], and participants' knowledge of hypertension were independently associated with undiagnosed hypertension.This study shows that undiagnosed hypertension is a major public health problem in the study area. Living in a household with a low wealth index, being far from a health facility, being underweight, using smokeless tobacco products, and having little knowledge about hypertension increase the likelihood of having undiagnosed Hypertension. Hypertension health information, particularly to smokes tobacco users, could improve the perceived susceptibility to hypertensive disease, and reduce the hidden extent of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W4311606167,"Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, chronic form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Clinical manifestations can include classical complement pathway-mediated chronic hemolysis, anemia, and profound fatigue. Research has shown that patients with other anemias may develop anxiety and depression, but this has not been studied previously in patients with CAD.CAD patients were identified in the Optum Claims-Clinical dataset (between January 1, 2006-June 30, 2016) and matched to comparison patients without CAD by patient factors. Adjusted Cox regression models estimated time to anxiety and depression, defined by three different outcomes: medication use, hospitalization, and therapy related to anxiety and depression. Subset analyses were performed for primary CAD. Patients were followed until they had anxiety and depression, they left the Optum system, death, or the study period ended (June 30, 2016).Patients with CAD (n = 384) were more likely to have medically attended anxiety and depression (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.1), to be prescribed antidepressants or psychotherapy after their CAD diagnosis (aHR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.9), or to be hospitalized for an anxiety and depression-related event along with medication or psychotherapy (aHR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.4-2.9) relative to matched comparisons (n = 2789), during the follow-up period. Patients with primary CAD were at increased risk for medically attended anxiety and depression (aHR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4-2.4), with the highest risk for prescription medication or therapy (aHR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.6-4.6).Our study indicates that medically attended anxiety and depression manifest at a higher rate in CAD patients than in a matched non-CAD cohort. Study findings suggest that CAD patients may experience a greater burden on mental health that may negatively contribute to their overall quality of life. Further investigation on this topic is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4311606206,"The building sector is under the significant influence of emerging technologies. Structures shape the environment and ""consume"" natural resources throughout their life cycle. They ""live"" many years after the construction which implies a dependence on some generations of supporting technologies. They can be useful in the subsequent phases: design, construction, maintenance and demolition. They may refer to main processes (construction production) as well as to concurrent processes (management, accountancy, logistics etc.). Computers, automated tools and machines or other intelligent devices seem to be inevitable in the 21st century. Therefore, contractors of construction projects should be sensitive to these issues. Based on literature studies, the article revealed that knowledge management in a construction company should primarily rely on the corporate culture that manifests a preference for computer-aided methods. This part was supplemented by a questionnaire technique and a statistical analysis of the results. It was concluded that the path to technological maturity of the construction company is a continual process. Consistency in this pursuit enables effective promotion of innovative technologies in the construction company. The research allowed us to draw three explicit phases: lack of experience, euphoria, and experience in becoming a technologically matured enterprise."
https://openalex.org/W4311606520,"Language lateralization is the most intriguing trait of functional asymmetry for cognitive functions. Nowadays, ontogenetic determinants of this trait are largely unknown, but there are efforts to find its anatomical correlates. In particular, a white matter interhemispheric connection–the corpus callosum–has been proposed as such. In the present study, we aimed to find the association between the degree of language lateralization and metrics of the callosal sub-regions. We applied a sentence completion fMRI task to measure the degree of language lateralization in a group of healthy participants balanced for handedness. We obtained the volumes and microstructural properties of callosal sub-regions with two tractography techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) . The analysis of DTI-based metrics did not reveal any significant associations with language lateralization. In contrast, CSD-based analysis revealed that the volumes of a callosal sub-region terminating in the core posterior language-related areas predict a stronger degree of language lateralization. This finding supports the specific inhibitory model implemented through the callosal fibers projecting into the core posterior language-related areas in the degree of language lateralization, with no relevant contribution of other callosal sub-regions."

https://openalex.org/W4311552068,"To better understand how health risk processes are linked to adrenarche, measures of adrenarcheal timing and tempo are needed. Our objective was to describe and classify adrenal trajectories, in terms of timing and tempo, in a population of children transitioning to adolescence with repeated measurements of salivary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA-sulphate, and testosterone. We analysed data from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (CATS), a longitudinal study of 1239 participants, recruited at 8–9 years old and followed up annually. Saliva samples were assayed for adrenal hormones. Linear mixed-effect models with subject-specific random intercepts and slopes were used to model longitudinal hormone trajectories by sex and derive measures of adrenarcheal timing and tempo. The median values for all hormones were higher at each consecutive study wave for both sexes, and higher for females than males. For all hormones, between-individual variation in hormone levels at age 9 (timing) was moderately large and similar for females and males. Between-individual variation in hormone progression over time (tempo) was of moderate magnitude compared with the population average age-slope, which itself was small compared with overall hormone level at each age. This suggests that between-individual variation in tempo was less important for modelling hormone trajectories. Between-individual variation in timing was more important for determining relative adrenal hormonal level in childhood than tempo. This finding suggests that adrenal hormonal levels at age 8–9 years can be used to predict relative levels in early adolescence (up to 13 years)."
https://openalex.org/W4311552094,"The Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI) was created to facilitate improved evaluation of the sources of post-secondary student stress. This study reports evidence in support of the validity of the tool using a large, nationwide cross-sectional sample of students attending universities across Canada during the 2020-2021 academic year. We provide additional evidence for the construct validation of the PSSI, including internal structure evidence and relations to other variables by estimating multiple-indicator, multiple-cause models and investigating Spearman's rho correlation coefficients between the PSSI and like constructs. Based on index validation guidelines, results provide further support for the internal structure of the PSSI, demonstrating hypothesized relationships with like constructs and manifest variables, as well as acceptable goodness-of-fit statistics. Similarly, correlation coefficients were statistically significant and in line with directionality hypotheses. The results of this research provide further evidence for the validity of the PSSI among varied university student populations in Canada and addresses several of the limitations identified in earlier preliminary psychometric work on the instrument."
https://openalex.org/W4311552177,"’ Candidatus Phytoplasma mali’, is a bacterial pathogen associated with the so-called apple proliferation disease in Malus × domestica . The pathogen manipulates its host with a set of effector proteins, among them SAP11 CaPm, which shares similarity to SAP11 AYWB from ’ Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’. SAP11 AYWB interacts and destabilizes the class II CIN transcription factors of Arabidopsis thaliana , namely AtTCP4 and AtTCP13 as well as the class II CYC/TB1 transcription factor AtTCP18, also known as BRANCHED1 being an important factor for shoot branching. It has been shown that SAP11 CaPm interacts with the Malus × domestica orthologues of AtTCP4 (MdTCP25) and AtTCP13 (MdTCP24), but an interaction with MdTCP16, the orthologue of AtTCP18, has never been proven. The aim of this study was to investigate this potential interaction and close a knowledge gap regarding the function of SAP11 CaPm . A Yeast two-hybrid test and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation in planta revealed that SAP11 CaPm interacts with MdTCP16. MdTCP16 is known to play a role in the control of the seasonal growth of perennial plants and an increase of MdTCP16 gene expression has been detected in apple leaves in autumn. In addition to this, MdTCP16 is highly expressed during phytoplasma infection. Binding of MdTCP16 by SAP11 CaPm might lead to the induction of shoot proliferation and early bud break, both of which are characteristic symptoms of apple proliferation disease."
https://openalex.org/W4311552253,"This study aimed to explore how religiosity affects the level of meaningful work among Malaysian Muslims, owing to Malaysia’s highly religious background. Although religiosity constitutes a major part of an individual’s value system, the influence of religiosity on the meaningfulness of work remains unclear. To address this gap, this study examined the indirect effects of the two types of religiosity—intrinsic religiosity (IR) and extrinsic religiosity (ER)—on meaningful work through existential labor, namely, surface acting and deep acting. Self-reported survey responses from 303 Malaysian Muslim employees were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping analysis. The results showed that both surface acting and deep acting had significant mediation effects on the relationship between IR and meaningful work. By contrast, in the relationship between ER and meaningful work, surface acting’s mediation effect was not significant, whereas deep acting showed a positive mediation effect. Our findings suggest that even if employees share the same religion, meaningful work is shaped differently by the specific type of religiosity and those existential labor strategies that individuals develop. This study advances the understanding of the underlying psychological mechanisms of the impact of individual religious values in the workplace. Implications and limitations were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4311552330,"Background Although studies in Nigeria showed the efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPT-SP) in preventing malaria in pregnancy among Nigerian women there is still poor implementation of the intervention in Nigeria. Methods A mixed method study was conducted in Bwari Area Council, Nigeria in 2018. The quantitative part of the study is presented and discussed in this paper. Pregnant women were interviewed using a validated interviewer-administered questionnaire and observations of current practice were performed. Results A total of 422 pregnant women were recruited into the study (mean age, 26 years) with the majority being married women (90.3%). Most respondents (68.5%) did not know who could take IPT-SP and 58.5% of respondents did not know when and how many times IPT-SP should be taken during pregnancy. Nearly all participants (99.5%) did not take SP at the facility under direct observation of the health worker. None of the facilities had free SP and all respondents paid for SP through the Drug Revolving Fund. The knowledge of the use of SP was significantly influenced by respondents’ parity, ward of residence, antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance history and education. Respondents who had tertiary and secondary education were 8.3 (95% CI: 1.01–68.27) times more likely to use IPT-SP than those without formal education. Conclusion Most women who attend ANC in Bwari Area council did not receive IPT-SP as per the national guidelines. The unavailability of logistics (SP, Water and Cup) on a regular basis, the cost of the SP, poor knowledge of the importance of IPT in malaria prevention, and the non-implementation of the administration of SP under direct observation were factors influencing the use of IPT-SP. Outcomes could be enhanced through the provision of measures to address identified gaps by this study."
https://openalex.org/W4311552360,"Maternity providers, including nurses, midwives, physicians, are at significant risk for stress and burnout due to the nature of care provision in maternal and child health settings. Yet, the empirical evidence on stress and burnout among maternity providers in sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to (1) assess levels of stress and burnout among maternity providers and support staff in Ghana, and (2) identify individual and situational factors associated with maternity provider stress, burnout, and physiology.Using a purposive sampling technique, we recruited 150 maternity providers from 19 high delivery health facilities within the 15 districts of the Upper East region (UER) of Ghana into a cross-sectional study. Participants completed Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, the Shirom-Melamed Burnout scale, and sociodemographic, health-, and work-related items. Participants' heart rate variability (HRV) and hair cortisol levels were assessed for stress-related physiologic responses. We computed bivariate and multivariate linear regression models to examine factors associated with stress and burnout.Most participants were experiencing moderate to high stress (58.0%) and burnout (65.8%). Each unit increase in overcommitment to work was associated with 0.62 higher perceived stress scores (β = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.22, 1.02) and 0.15 higher burnout scores. On average, those who had experienced disrespect from colleagues in the last year had higher perceived stress scores compared to those who had not experienced disrespect (β = 1.77, 95% CI: 0.50, 3.04); and those who had experienced disrespect from patients in the last year had higher cortisol levels than those who had not (β = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.93). Those who work for more than 5 days also had higher cortisol levels, on average, compared to those who worked fewer days a week.We found high levels of stress and burnout among maternity providers in Northern Ghana, underscoring the need for interventions to manage the effects of stress and burnout on maternity providers' wellbeing, quality of care, and patient outcomes. Healthcare management teams should assist providers in reducing their overcommitment by hiring more staff, given its strong link to stress and burnout. Additionally, facilitating a respectful workplace culture could also help reduce stress and burnout among maternity providers."
https://openalex.org/W4311552364,"Malnutrition and poor health are common among recently resettled refugees and may be differentially associated with pre-migration exposure to refugee camp versus non-camp dwelling. We aimed to investigate the associations of iron deficiency (ID), anemia, and ID anemia (IDA) with pre-migration refugee camp exposure among recently arrived refugees to Canada. To this end, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1032 adult refugees who received care between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015, within a specialized refugee health clinic in Calgary, Canada. We evaluated the prevalence, severity, and predictors of ID, anemia, and IDA, stratified by sex. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated the association of refugee camp exposure with these outcomes, adjusting for age, months in Canada prior to investigations, global region of origin, and parity. Among female refugees, the prevalence of ID, anemia, and IDA was 25% (134/534), 21% (110/534), and 14% (76/534), respectively; among males, 0.8% (4/494), 1.8% (9/494), and 0% (0/494), respectively. Anemia was mild, moderate, and severe in 55% (60/110), 44% (48/110) and 1.8% (2/110) of anemic females. Refugee camp exposure was not associated with ID, anemia, or IDA while age by year (ID OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.93–0.98; anemia OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–1.00; IDA OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.99) and months in Canada prior to investigations (ID OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.72–1.01; anemia OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.67–0.97; IDA OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.64–1.00) were inversely correlated with these outcomes. ID, anemia, and IDA are common among recently arrived refugee women irrespective of refugee camp exposure. Our findings suggest these outcomes likely improve after resettlement; however, given proportionally few refugees are resettled globally, likely millions of refugee women and girls are affected."

Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a process that increase cold tolerance in most insect species. The molecular mechanisms of RCH remain largely unknown, and whether it is associated with transcriptional changes is unclear. In this study, we compared the transcriptomes of Liriomyza trifolii and L. sativae exposed to RCH to investigate the transcript abundance due to RCH in both species. RNA-seq revealed 93,166 assembled unigenes, and 34,303 of these were annotated in the L. trifolii and L. sativae transcriptome libraries. After a 4-h treatment at 1°C (RCH) compared with control, 268 and 606 unigenes were differentially expressed in L. trifolii and L. sativae, respectively. When comparing pupae exposed to 2h cold shock directly with pupae went through 4h acclimation prior to 2h cold shock, 60 and 399 unigenes were differentially expressed in L trifolii and L sativae, respectively. Genes that were commonly expressed in both L. trifolii and L. sativae, included cytochrome P450, cuticular protein, glucose dehydrogenase, solute carrier family 22 and cationic amino acid transporter. Additionally, several pathways including galactose metabolism and peroxisome were significantly enriched during RCH. Our results show that the transcriptional response is correlated with RCH in the pupal stage of the two Liriomyza species, but more transcriptional changes were identified in L sativae than in L. trifolii."
https://openalex.org/W4311552691,"Objective To assess the practices and dose uniformity of tablet splitting at selected public hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A hybrid study method was employed to see the overall practices of tablet splitting. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the practices of tablet splitting by administering structured questionnaires to patients and pharmacy professionals. Experimental data on dose and content uniformity of split tablets were obtained from the results of drugs split by study subjects. The content uniformity assay was performed using UV/Vis spectrophotometry. Results A total of 241 patients and 82 pharmacy professionals participated in the cross-sectional study. The majority of patient participants (51.3%) faced problems while splitting their tablet medications and this had a significant association with the education level of the patients (χ2 = 60.5; p = 0.001). Enteric-coated formulations were dispensed to be split, despite the precaution given by the manufacturers against splitting or crushing these products. Splitting of enteric-coated products accounts for 11% of the total drugs that were dispensed to be taken after a split. The mean of weight variation test for the half tablets does not meet the specifications set in pharmacopoeias when splitting was done by patients. The unscored haloperidol tablets were hard to split and resulted in a significant weight variation of half-tablets than the scored furosemide tablets. Moreover, the weight of 4 out of 20 fragments that were split by patients deviated at least by 15%. Conclusions This finding showed that the tablet-splitting practices are poor and do not meet the specifications set by pharmacopoeias. Splitting by patients resulted in significantly higher dose variation and weight loss of fragments than splitting by pharmacists."

The mothers were selected using purposive sampling technique. Data were collected using face-to-face in-depth interview method. Data were analyzed using framework approach.Four themes emerged from the data: well-being of mothers and their children with four subthemes (physical, social, mental, and spiritual wellbeing), perception of street life, motivations to leave street life and efforts to end street life. Nearly all of the street mothers perceived that living on the street was terrible for them and their kids. They described it as an absolutely revolting, bitter, awful, horrible, and difficult life. Generally, street mothers had the motivation to leave street life, but only some had exerted tangible efforts to end the street life.Street mothers had a very poor status in almost all dimensions of well-being. The perception of mother about their street life was negative. The mothers had strong motivation to end street life but were unable to make strong tangible efforts showing that they need assistance mechanisms before they change to street extended families under misery."
https://openalex.org/W4311556788,"Objectives While studies have found lower cancer risks and better cancer survival in immigrant populations, it is debated whether cancer care is offered on equal terms to all residents regardless of background. Our aim was to study patterns of care and outcomes in immigrants in a country with a tax-financed universal health care system. Material and methods We used a population-based database to compare clinical presentation, management and mortality between Swedish-born and immigrant patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. Results We identified 40,075 patients diagnosed with NSCLC of which 84% were born in Sweden, 7% in Nordic and 9% in Non-Nordic countries. Non-Nordic immigrants were to a higher extent male, smokers, younger at diagnosis, had a better performance status and a higher educational level. No differences were seen regarding comorbidity burden or stage at diagnosis. Non-Nordic immigrants more often underwent positron emission tomography (PET) (aHR 1.32; 95% CI 1.19–1.45) and were more often discussed in a multidisciplinary team setting (aHR 1.30; 95% CI 1.17–1.44). There were no differences in treatment modalities following adjustment for age, with the exception of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage IIIA disease which was more common in Non-Nordic immigrants (aOR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03–1.74). Both overall and cause specific survival in non-metastatic disease were higher among Non-Nordic immigrants. Overall mortality in stage I-II: HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73–0.90 and stage IIIA: HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65–0.86. Following full adjustments, cause-specific mortality in stage I-II was aHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98. Conclusion Taken together, only minor differences in management and outcomes were observed between Swedish-born and immigrant patients. We conclude that lung cancer care is offered on equal terms. If anything, outcomes were better in Non-Nordic immigrants with early stage NSCLC."

Current objective balance tests are either cost- or space-prohibitive, or utilize a static balance protocol, which may mask neuromotor dysfunction due to the simplicity of the task. To address this gap, our team developed an Android-based smartphone app (portable and cost-effective) that uses the sensors in the device (objective) to record movement profiles during a stepping-in-place task (dynamic movement). The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which our custom smartphone app and protocol could discriminate neuromotor behavior between concussed and non-concussed participants. Data were collected at two university laboratories and two military sites. Participants included civilians and Service Members (N = 216) with and without a clinically diagnosed concussion. Kinematic and variability metrics were derived from a thigh angle time series while the participants completed a series of stepping-in-place tasks in three conditions: eyes open, eyes closed, and head shake. We observed that the standard deviation of the mean maximum angular velocity of the thigh was higher in the participants with a concussion history in the eyes closed and head shake conditions of the stepping-in-place task. Consistent with the optimal movement variability hypothesis, we showed that increased movement variability occurs in participants with a concussion history, for which our smartphone app and protocol were sensitive enough to capture."

A pilot program was designed to provide individualized structured treatment plans, including addressing prolonged withdrawal symptoms, family/systems assessment, and contingency management, to reduce readmission after the index inpatient detoxification.A non-randomized quasi-experimental design was used to compare the pilot facilities (treatment) and comparison facilities before and after the program started, i.e., a simple difference-in-differences (DID) strategy. Adults 18 years and older who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 criteria for OUD and had an inpatient detoxification admission at any OUD treatment facility in two study periods between 7/2016 and 3/2020 were included. Readmission for inpatient detoxification in 90-days after the index stay was the primary outcome, and partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient care, outpatient services, and medications for OUD were the secondary outcomes. Six statistical estimation methods were used to triangulate evidence and adjust for potential confounding factors between treatment and comparison groups.A total of 2,320 unique patients in the pilot and comparison facilities with 2,443 index inpatient detoxification admissions in the pre- and post-periods were included. Compared with patients in comparison facilities, patients in the C.L.I.M.B. facilities had higher readmission in the pre-period (unadjusted readmission 17.0% vs. 10.6%), but similar rates in the post-period (12.3% vs. 10.6%) after the implementation of the pilot program. For 90-day readmission, all DID estimates were not statistically significant (adjusted estimates ranged from 6 to 9 percentage points difference favoring the C.L.I.M.B. program). There was no significant improvement in the secondary outcomes of utilizations in lower level of care and medications for OUD in C.L.I.M.B. facilities.We found a reduction in readmission in the pilot facilities between the two periods, but the results were not statistically significant compared with the comparison facilities and the utilization of lower level of care services remained low. Even though providers in the pilot OUD treatment facilities actively worked with health plans to standardize care for patients with OUD, more strategies are needed to improve treatment engagement and retention after an inpatient detoxification."
https://openalex.org/W4311602131,"This study develops novel models of heterogeneous consumer preferences for different dining options and imperfect competition among food suppliers to analyze the market and welfare effects of portion size reduction (PSR) for food away from home. Different scenarios on the nature of differentiation of the dining options, the information available to consumers, and their response to links between portion size and obesity, food waste, and climate change are considered within this framework. The market and welfare effects of the policy are quantified using a simulation analysis. The analysis shows that the market and welfare effects of the policy are case-specific and dependent on the relative magnitude of the cost and utility effects of PSR, the strength of the consumer preference for dining out, and the food suppliers' initial costs and degree of market power in the relevant markets. The policy can create winners and losers among consumers and accounting for consumer heterogeneity, as done in this study, is essential for capturing the asymmetric welfare effects of PSR. Intriguingly, consumers and suppliers can benefit from PSR even without accounting for any health or/and environmental benefits of reduced portion sizes."
https://openalex.org/W4311602325,"The production of full length, biologically active proteins in mammalian cells is critical for a wide variety of purposes ranging from structural studies to preparation of subunit vaccines. Prior research has shown that Modified vaccinia virus Ankara encoding the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7) is particularly suitable for high level expression of proteins upon infection of mammalian cells. The expression system is safe for users and 10-50 mg of full length, biologically active proteins may be obtained in their native state, from a few litres of infected cell cultures. Here we report further improvements which allow an increase in the ease and speed of recombinant virus isolation, the scale-up of protein production and the simultaneous synthesis of several polypeptides belonging to a protein complex using a single virus vector. Isolation of MVA-T7 viruses encoding foreign proteins was simplified by combining positive selection for virus recombinants and negative selection against parental virus, a process which eliminated the need for tedious plaque purification. Scale-up of protein production was achieved by infecting a BHK 21 suspension cell line and inducing protein expression with previously infected cells instead of virus, thus saving time and effort in handling virus stocks. Protein complexes were produced from infected cells by concatenating the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) N1A protease sequence with each of the genes of the complex into a single ORF, each gene being separated from the other by twin TEV protease cleavage sites. We report the application of these methods to the production of a complex formed on the one hand between the HIV-1 integrase and its cell partner LEDGF and on the other between the HIV-1 VIF protein and its cell partners APOBEC3G, CBFβ, Elo B and Elo C. The strategies developed in this study should be valuable for the overexpression and subsequent purification of numerous protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W4311602392,"Work-related stress is a major cause of health problems worldwide. Faculty in educational institutions, including universities, also face high levels of stress, which undoubtedly affects their performance, level of personal satisfaction and wellbeing, and the relationship with students. Training interventions based on embodied learning can promote self-knowledge, emotional regulation and stress reduction, thereby increasing levels of psychological well-being. The present pilot study analyzed the impact of body awareness training in 31 university teachers using a controlled, randomized pre-post experimental design, with two experimental groups and a control group (n = 10). The two interventions were: Hatha Yoga (n = 11) and Dance Movement Therapy/Body Mind Centering (n = 10), which we have termed Body Movement Awareness. Variables related to body awareness, mindfulness, wellbeing, life satisfaction and stress were measured using self-perception tests. Cortisol levels, heart rate variability and sleep quality were also analyzed. Finally, participants' reflections were analyzed according to a qualitative approach. The results showed significant differences between the control group and the Hatha Yoga group in terms of stress reduction and wellbeing. The Body Movement Awareness group exhibited evidence of contributions on self-knowledge, communication and kinesthetic empathy, key elements in the educational field. Despite the inherent limitations of the study, the conclusions are encouraging and open new lines of research from embodied approaches that introduce creative movement and group experience as part of the process of emotional regulation and self-knowledge."

However, China’s “Strengthening the Provincial Capital” strategy attracts many college graduates, resulting in many limitations in attracting college students to employment in non-provincial capital cities. This paper systematically studies college students’ work and entrepreneurial intention factors. We conduct a social survey of employment and entrepreneurial intentions among university graduates in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, and obtain 12,897 questionnaires. Then, we construct an index analysis system (IAS) and analyze the 12897 questionnaires systematically based on IAS. The results show that urban characteristics and personal orientation most directly affect college graduates’ employment and entrepreneurial willingness. Based on the statistical conclusions, we put forward corresponding policy recommendations. Colleges should build a “government-enterprise-school” cooperation mechanism, implement strategically focused attraction policies following local conditions and local conditions, and promote the employment of college students to promote employment and entrepreneurship in non-provincial capitals."
https://openalex.org/W4311602505,"In this study, we report data on intraoperative complications occurring after cataract surgery in a high-volume single-center setting using a low-energy, mobile femtosecond laser. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) in our hospital between August 2015 and December 2019. Among the sample of 1,806 eyes of 1,131 patients (903 left and 903 right eyes), the mean age was 75.8 years (range, 21-99 years). The overall intraoperative complication rate was 0.28% (n = 5), with three cases of anterior capsule tear (0.17%) and two cases of posterior capsule tear (0.11%). No further complications occurred. This study underlines the safety of low-energy femtosecond-assisted cataract surgery in a real-world setting with a very low rate of intraoperative complications."

After the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, traffic volume decreased. In this study, to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic correlates with traffic collisions, we used the Spearman rank correlation of non-parametric statistical test to compare the number of COVID-19 infections with the number of traffic collisions. The number of COVID-19 infections showed a significant inverse correlation with the number of traffic collisions nationwide, in some regions, and in some prefectures. When the number of COVID-19 infections increased, a State of Emergency or Semi-Emergency Spread Prevention Measures were repeatedly declared. We submit that these measures along with the restrictions on the population's autonomy and movement to prevent the spread of infection, reduces the number of traffic incidents, injuries, and fatalities owing to a decrease in traffic volume. Therefore, these lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic advocate that regulation of vehicle traffic volume is an effective means of reducing the occurrence of traffic collisions. These results can be applied to future policy development to support road safety improvements during unique events."
https://openalex.org/W4311606702,"Studies investigating the association between functional capacity and quality of life (QoL) in individuals with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) usually do not include a gold-standard evaluation of functional capacity, limiting the validity and the interpretation of the results. The present study is a cross-section analysis aiming to evaluate the association between functional capacity (quantified by cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPET]) and QoL in individuals with CCC. QoL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical, cardiac function and maximal progressive CPET variables were obtained from PEACH study. Generalized linear models adjusted for age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction were performed to evaluate the association between CPET variables and QoL. After adjustments, VO2 peak and VO2 AT were both associated with physical functioning (β = +0.05 and β = +0.05, respectively) and physical component summary (β = +0.03 and β = +0.03, respectively). Double product was associated with physical functioning (β = +0.003), general health perceptions (β = +0.003), physical component summary (β = +0.002), and vitality (β = +0.004). HRR≤12bpm was associated with physical functioning (β = -0.32), role limitations due to physical problems (β = -0.87), bodily pain (β = -0.26), physical component summary (β = -0.21), vitality (β = -0.38), and mental health (β = -0.19). VE/VCO2 slope presented association with all mental scales of SF-36: vitality (β = -0.028), social functioning (β = -0.024), role limitations due to emotional problems (β = -0.06), mental health (β = -0.04), and mental component summary (β = -0.02). The associations between CPET variables and QoL demonstrate the importance of CPET inclusion for a more comprehensive evaluation of individuals with CCC. In this setting, intervention strategies aiming to improve functional capacity may also promote additional benefits on QoL and should be incorporated as a treatment strategy for patients with CCC."
