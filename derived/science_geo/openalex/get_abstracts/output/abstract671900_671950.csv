https://openalex.org/W3141751158,"A general approach for heritably altering gene expression has the potential to enable many discovery and therapeutic efforts. Here, we present CRISPRoff—a programmable epigenetic memory writer consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion protein that establishes DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. Transient CRISPRoff expression initiates highly specific DNA methylation and gene repression that is maintained through cell division and differentiation of stem cells to neurons. Pairing CRISPRoff with genome-wide screens and analysis of chromatin marks establishes rules for heritable gene silencing. We identify single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) capable of silencing the large majority of genes including those lacking canonical CpG islands (CGIs) and reveal a wide targeting window extending beyond annotated CGIs. The broad ability of CRISPRoff to initiate heritable gene silencing even outside of CGIs expands the canonical model of methylation-based silencing and enables diverse applications including genome-wide screens, multiplexed cell engineering, enhancer silencing, and mechanistic exploration of epigenetic inheritance."

To identify therapeutic targets relevant to COVID-19, we conducted Mendelian randomization analyses, deriving genetic instruments based on transcriptomic and proteomic data for 1,263 actionable proteins that are targeted by approved drugs or in clinical phase of drug development. Using summary statistics from the Host Genetics Initiative and the Million Veteran Program, we studied 7,554 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and >1 million controls. We found significant Mendelian randomization results for three proteins (ACE2, P = 1.6 × 10-6; IFNAR2, P = 9.8 × 10-11 and IL-10RB, P = 2.3 × 10-14) using cis-expression quantitative trait loci genetic instruments that also had strong evidence for colocalization with COVID-19 hospitalization. To disentangle the shared expression quantitative trait loci signal for IL10RB and IFNAR2, we conducted phenome-wide association scans and pathway enrichment analysis, which suggested that IFNAR2 is more likely to play a role in COVID-19 hospitalization. Our findings prioritize trials of drugs targeting IFNAR2 and ACE2 for early management of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3152249737,"The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting millions of lives worldwide. Large retrospective studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, in vitro, and in vivo analyses, we report that topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of topotecan (TPT), an FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as 4 days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of TOP1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing TOP1 inhibitors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3139736334,"Chromosomal instability leading to aneuploidy is pervasive in early human embryos1-3 and is considered as a major cause of infertility and pregnancy wastage4,5. Here we provide several lines of evidence that blastocysts containing aneuploid cells are worthy of in vitro fertilization transfer. First, we show clinically that aneuploid embryos can lead to healthy births, suggesting the presence of an in vivo mechanism to eliminate aneuploidy. Second, early development and cell specification modelled in micropatterned human 'gastruloids' grown in confined geometry show that aneuploid cells are depleted from embryonic germ layers, but not from extraembryonic tissue, by apoptosis in a bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-dependent manner. Third, a small percentage of euploid cells rescues embryonic tissue in mosaic gastruloids when mixed with aneuploid cells. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of early human embryos revealed a decline of aneuploidy beginning on day 3. Our findings challenge two current dogmas: that a single trophectoderm biopsy at blastocyst stage to perform prenatal genetic testing can accurately determine the chromosomal make-up of a human embryo, and that aneuploid embryos should be withheld from embryo transfer in association with in vitro fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W3146966644,"Viral infection in early pregnancy is a major cause of microcephaly. However, how distinct viruses impair human brain development remains poorly understood. Here we use human brain organoids to study the mechanisms underlying microcephaly caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). We find that both viruses efficiently replicate in brain organoids and attenuate their growth by causing cell death. However, transcriptional profiling reveals that ZIKV and HSV-1 elicit distinct cellular responses and that HSV-1 uniquely impairs neuroepithelial identity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, although both viruses fail to potently induce the type I interferon system, the organoid defects caused by their infection can be rescued by distinct type I interferons. These phenotypes are not seen in 2D cultures, highlighting the superiority of brain organoids in modeling viral infections. These results uncover virus-specific mechanisms and complex cellular immune defenses associated with virus-induced microcephaly."
https://openalex.org/W3142211719,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in early March 2020, UK supermarkets have implemented different policies to reduce the virus transmission in stores to protect both customers and staff, such as restricting the maximum number of customers in a store, changes to the store layout, or enforcing a mandatory face covering policy. To quantitatively assess these mitigation methods, we formulate an agent-based model of customer movement in a supermarket (which we represent by a network) with a simple virus transmission model based on the amount of time a customer spends in close proximity to infectious customers. We apply our model to synthetic store and shopping data to show how one can use our model to estimate the number of infections due to human-to-human contact in stores and how to model different store interventions. The source code is openly available at https://github.com/fabianying/covid19-supermarket-abm. We encourage retailers to use the model to find the most effective store policies that reduce virus transmission in stores and thereby protect both customers and staff."
https://openalex.org/W3152419253,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak spread to over 100 countries with a total of 100,000 cases during the first week of March 2020. Health care workers, as those on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, are more susceptible to infection. Inadequate related knowledge and preventive behaviors among health care workers might lead to delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. Therefore, this study evaluated the knowledge of health care workers with regard to COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 10–18, 2020. Participants were general practitioners, specialists, and nurses working at the forefront of the pandemic. Their knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions concerning COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire created by our medical specialists. The questionnaire consisted of 29, 5, and 4 items about COVID-19 knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions, respectively. A total of 251 health care workers completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 33.88±8.72 years old, and the sample consisted of 68 males (27.08%) and 183 females (72.91%). While there was no difference between the percentage of correct answers given by female and male participants to knowledge-based questions (p&gt;0.05), the percentage of correct answers to the questions on preventive behaviors was significantly higher in female participants than in males (p&lt;0.001). The overall average percentages of correct responses were 91.66% for knowledge-based questions and 85.96% for preventive behavior questions. The scores for knowledge-based questions were higher for medical specialists, whereas nurses scored higher on preventive behavior questions. Government hospital staff showed a significant difference in preventive behaviors compared to that of university hospitals (p&lt;0.05). In addition, there was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and preventive behaviors. Although all the participants (100%) knew that contracting COVID-19 can lead to death, only 66.93% of them were willing to get vaccinated themselves. The knowledge level of health care workers concerning COVID-19 was above 90%, but the level of competence in terms of preventive behaviors was found to be low, especially in males."
https://openalex.org/W3148031322,"This study aimed to analyze the discourses of patients who were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the perception of why they acquired this health condition and barriers to seeking care in a priority city in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants’ discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue. Through discursive formations, these revealed the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Considering the complexity involved in the dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, advancing in terms of equity in health, that is, in reducing unjust differences, is a challenge for public policies, especially at the current moment in Brazil, which is of accentuated economic, political and social crisis. The importance of psychosocial stressors and the lack of social support should also be highlighted as intermediary determinants of health. The study has also shown the situation of COVID-19, which consists of an important barrier for patients seeking care. Many patients reported fear, insecurity and worry with regard to returning to medical appointments, which might contribute to the worsening of tuberculosis in the scenario under study."
https://openalex.org/W3120076468,"GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor family shown to play important roles in cell adhesion, brain development, immune function, and tumorigenesis. GPR56 is highly upregulated in colorectal cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. Several studies have shown GPR56 couples to the Gα12/13 class of heterotrimeric G-proteins to promote RhoA activation. However, due to its structural complexity and lack of a high-affinity receptor-specific ligand, the complete GPR56 signaling mechanism remains largely unknown. To delineate the activation mechanism and intracellular signaling functions of GPR56, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain (ECD). Using deletion mutants, we mapped the mAb binding site to the GAIN domain, which mediates membrane-proximal autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD. We showed that GPR56 overexpression in 293T cells leads to increased phosphorylation of Src, Fak, and paxillin adhesion proteins and activation of the Gα12/13-RhoA-mediated serum response factor (SRF) pathway. Treatment with the mAb potentiated Src-Fak phosphorylation, RhoA–SRF signaling, and cell adhesion. Consistently, GPR56 knockdown in colorectal cancer cells decreased Src–Fak pathway phosphorylation and cell adhesion. Interestingly, GPR56-mediated activation of Src–Fak phosphorylation occurred independent of RhoA, yet mAb-induced potentiation of RhoA–SRF signaling was Src-dependent. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal portion of the Serine–Threonine–Proline-rich (STP) region, adjacent to the GAIN domain, was required for Src–Fak activation. However, autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD was dispensable. These data support a new ECD-dependent mechanism by which GPR56 functions to regulate adhesion through activation of Src–Fak signaling.

Similar to other aGPCRs, the ECD of GPR56 is structurally characterized by the presence of a highly conserved GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain featuring a juxtamembrane GPCR Proteolysis Site (GPS) (1Langenhan T.

Typically, aGPCR activation involves binding of the NTF with its ligand followed by activation of the CTF to transmit intracellular signaling (1Langenhan T. Aust G. Hamann J. Sticky signaling--adhesion class G protein-coupled receptors take the stage.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6re3Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Evidences supporting both stalk-dependent and stalk-independent models of ligand-induced GPR56 activation have been reported; however, the exact mechanism remains elusive. In the stalk-dependent model, the NTF serves as a shield for the stalk region and upon ligand binding the NTF dissociates or sheds from the CTF, allowing stalk to function as a “tethered agonist” that can engage with the 7TM (20Kishore A.

However, due to its structural complexity and lack of high-affinity receptor-specific ligands, the activation and intracellular signaling mechanism(s) of GPR56 have yet to be completely resolved. In this study, we generated a high-affinity anti-GPR56 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 10C7, which binds to the GAIN domain, to investigate the activation and signaling mechanisms of GPR56. We show that GPR56 can activate Src–Fak adhesion signaling in 293T and CRC cells. GPR56-mediated activation of this pathway was independent of autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD and required the STP region, indicating the importance of the NTF. Treatment with 10C7 potentiated both RhoA–SRF and Src–Fak signaling. GPR56-mediated activation of Src–Fak occurred independent of RhoA. However, activation of Src was required for 10C7-induced potentiation of RhoA–SRF signaling. Overall, we demonstrate a new ECD-dependent mechanism by which GPR56 functions to regulate cell adhesion through activation of the Src–Fak pathway. We generated and purified a unique mouse–human chimera anti-GPR56 mAb 10C7 directed against the ECD of GPR56 (amino acids 1–400). To characterize 10C7, we first established HEK293T (293T) cell lines with stable overexpression of myc-tagged full-length human GPR56 wild-type (293T-GPR56 WT). To determine relative binding affinities, we employed a cell-based fluorescence binding assay. We showed that 10C7 binds GPR56 with high affinity and approximate Kd of 1.2 μg/ml or 7.8 nM (Fig. 1A). No binding was detected for human IgG1 isotype control. To further demonstrate specificity, a competitive binding assay was performed with the purified GPR56 ECD used for immunization during mAb production. As shown in Figure 1B, preincubation of 5 μg/ml (or 33 nM) 10C7 with ECD inhibited 10C7 binding to GPR56 at the cell surface in a concentration-dependent manner. Confocal analysis further confirmed 10C7 binding was blocked by ECD in 293T-GPR56 WT cells (Fig. S1A). To map the domain of the ECD to which 10C7 binds, we generated a series of truncation and deletion mutants and established stable overexpression cell lines (Fig. 1C). These cell lines include mutants of full-length GPR56 lacking the STP region (a.a.108–177; ΔSTP), deletion of the PLL domain (a.a. 26–160; ΔPLL), deletion of the NTF (a.a. 26–383; ΔNT) or vector control. The STP region encompasses the C-terminal portion of the PLL domain, the PLL–GAIN linker (a.a.161–175) and first two amino acids of the GAIN domain (19Salzman G.S. Ackerman S.D. Ding C. Koide A.

Previously, it has been shown that the STP region is required for GPR56 interaction with TG2 (27Yang L. Chen G. Mohanty S. Scott G. Fazal F. Rahman A. Begum S. Hynes R.O. Xu L. GPR56 regulates VEGF production and angiogenesis during melanoma progression.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the PLL domain has been shown to bind collagen III (24Luo R. Jeong S.J. Jin Z. Strokes N. Li S. Piao X. G protein-coupled receptor 56 and collagen III, a receptor-ligand pair, regulates cortical development and lamination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 12925-12930Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting these regions may play an important role in ligand/protein interactions. Stable overexpression of GPR56 was verified by western blot using myc-tag antibody and 10C7 (Fig. 1D). Of note, the three major molecular weight bands for GPR56 represent expression of glycosylated full-length (top), partially, or unglycosylated full-length (middle) and cleaved ECD (bottom), as has been previously reported (21Stoveken H.M. Hajduczok A.G. Xu L. Tall G.G. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors are activated by exposure of a cryptic tethered agonist.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 6194-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 10C7 failed to detect expression of ΔNT, suggesting that under denaturing conditions 10C7 does not bind the stalk region of GPR56. Given that 10C7 binds to both native and denatured forms of GPR56 indicates that the mAb binds a surface exposed, linear epitope. To further verify the region where the 10C7 epitope resides, we performed cell-based fluorescence assays at 4ºC and quantified relative surface expression of GPR56 and its mutants in live cells using 5 μg/ml (or 33 nM) 10C7 or myc-tag mAbs (Fig. 1, E and F). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) and confocal analysis was performed to visualize binding and mAb-receptor cointernalization after mAb treatment of live cells for 1 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1G). Our findings showed that similar levels of GPR56 WT and ΔSTP were detected at the cell surface based on 10C7 and myc-tag mAb binding, whereas the ΔPLL mutant showed reduced surface expression (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, GPR56 WT, ΔSTP, and ΔPLL cointernalized with both mAbs (Fig. 1G). No surface binding nor internalization was detected for either 10C7 or myc-tag mAb in vector or ΔNT cells (Fig. 1, E–G). However, ICC of fixed, permeabilized ΔNT cells showed binding of myc-tag mAb and not 10C7, as was demonstrated by western blot (Fig. S1B and Fig. 1D). While these findings suggest an impairment in the ΔNT mutant for trafficking to the cell surface, more importantly, they confirm that 10C7 does not bind the stalk region of GPR56. We then determined relative binding affinities of 10C7 for each of the GPR56 deletion mutants. 10C7 showed similar, high-affinity binding for WT, ΔSTP, and ΔPLL with average Kd of ∼7.8 nM, 8.1 nM, and 8.8 nM, respectively (Fig. 1, A and H). No binding of 10C7 was detected in vector cells (Fig. 1H). These findings indicate that 10C7 binds GPR56 ECD within the GAIN domain of the NTF with high affinity and specificity and does not bind the CTF stalk region. GPR56 has been shown to induce activation of the small GTPase RhoA mediated through Gα12/13 to promote cell adhesion (13Zhang S. Chatterjee T. Godoy C. Wu L. Liu Q.J. Carmon K.S.

To examine if GPR56 deletion mutants were fully functional and dependent on RhoA activity, we employed the SRF-RE reporter assay, which drives transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in response to G12/13-RhoA-mediated activation of SRF signaling. SRF binding to its response element promotes transcription of target genes involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and actin dynamics (28Olson E.N. Nordheim A. Linking actin dynamics and gene transcription to drive cellular motile functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). A series of reports have shown that GPR56 can activate both SRF-RE (20Kishore A. Purcell R.H. Nassiri-Toosi Z. Hall R.A.

Garvin D. Paguio A. Stecha P. Wood K. Fan F. Luciferase reporter assay system for deciphering GPCR pathways.Curr. Chem. Genomics. 2010; 4: 84-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of GPR56 WT or ΔSTP significantly increased SRF-RE activity (approximately fivefold) compared with vector (Fig. 2A). Contrastingly, ΔPLL did not significantly activate SRF-RE. To test if NTF dissociation was required for signaling, we generated the GPS cleavage-deficient mutant, T383A, as previously reported (20Kishore A. Purcell R.H. Nassiri-Toosi Z. Hall R.A. Stalk-dependent and stalk-independent signaling by the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors GPR56 (ADGRG1) and BAI1 (ADGRB1).J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 3385-3394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We found that this mutant routinely exhibited a two- to threefold reduction in SRF-RE activation compared with WT. Of note, T383A exhibited similar surface expression as WT and also cointernalized with 10C7 (Fig. S1, C and D). Treatment with a Rho inhibitor suppressed SRF-RE response and active RhoA levels (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1E), confirming that GPR56-mediated SRF-RE activity is mediated through RhoA. These data suggest that the PLL domain (a.a. 26–108, exclusive of the STP) is important for basal constitutive GPR56-mediated RhoA–SRF signaling, yet the STP region is dispensable. Furthermore, these findings suggest that although GPS-mediated autoproteolytic cleavage of the ECD"

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and biological implications of this finding are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a synthetic RNA-based assay that can simultaneously assess multiple forms of antiviral responses. Dicer is an enzyme essential for RNA interference (RNAi), which is used as a major antiviral mechanism in invertebrates. RNAi activity is detected in wild-type ESCs but is abolished in Dicer knockout ESCs (D−/−ESCs) as expected. Surprisingly, D−/−ESCs have gained the ability to express IFN, which is otherwise deficient in wild-type ESCs. Furthermore, D−/−ESCs have constitutively active double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR), an enzyme that is also involved in antiviral response. D−/−ESCs show increased sensitivity to the cytotoxicity resulting from RNA transfection. The effects of dsRNA can be partly replicated with a synthetic B2RNA corresponding to the retrotransposon B2 short interspersed nuclear element. B2RNA has secondary structure features of dsRNA and accumulates in D−/−ESCs, suggesting that B2RNA could be a cellular RNA that activates PKR and contributes to the decreased cell proliferation and viability of D−/−ESCs. Treatment of D−/−ESCs with a PKR inhibitor and IFNβ-neutralizing antibodies increased cell proliferation rate and cell viability. Based on these findings, we propose that, in ESCs, Dicer acts as a repressor of antiviral responses and plays a key role in the maintenance of proliferation, viability, and pluripotency of ESCs.

Based on these findings, we propose that, in ESCs, Dicer acts as a repressor of antiviral responses and plays a key role in the maintenance of proliferation, viability, and pluripotency of ESCs. The innate immune system is the first line of an organism’s defense against a broad range of pathogen invasions. Although innate immunity consists of different mechanisms, the antiviral response is one of the most critical components and is presumably developed in most, if not all, mammalian cells (1Sen G.C. Virues and infections.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 2Kumar H. Kawai T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors and innate immunity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 388: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). However, a series of our recent studies have demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have an attenuated innate immune response. In particular, they do not express type I interferons (IFN) and lack response to inflammatory cytokines. Similar observations have been made in human ESCs and induced PSCs (iPSCs) (3Guo Y.L. Carmichael G.G. Wang R. Hong X. Acharya D. Huang F. Bai F. Concise reviews: Attenuated innate immunity in embryonic stem cells and its implications in developmental biology and regenerative medicine.Stem Cells. 2015; 33: 3165-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Guo Y.L. Utilization of different antiviral mechanisms by mammalian embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2017; 95: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, this is a common property shared by all types of PSCs. It appears that ESCs in the early embryo are immunologically divergent from the traditional view of “innate immunity” established in somatic cells of developed organisms. The biological implications of the attenuated innate immune responses in ESCs have been speculated from different perspectives. Immune response is a double-edged sword: it serves as a critical part of the defense mechanism, but it can also cause immunologic toxicity to tissues since IFN and inflammatory cytokines negatively impact cell proliferation and viability (5Hertzog P.J. Hwang S.Y. Kola I. Role of interferons in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and development.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Garcia M.A. Meurs E.F. Esteban M.

Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). While this could be tolerated by tissues of developed organisms, it could cause serious damage to ESCs in an early embryo. From this perspective, an attenuated immunological response could serve as a self-protective mechanism in ESCs by minimizing immunological cytotoxicity at early stages of embryogenesis (8Guo Y.L. The underdeveloped innate immunity in embryonic stem cells: The molecular basis and biological perspectives from early embryogenesis.Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2019; 81e13089Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). From the perspective of ESC biology, IFN response does not appear to be compatible with the pluripotency of ESCs, as demonstrated by a recent study showing that forced activation of the IFN pathway can cause dysregulation of many pluripotency- and lineage-specific genes in ESCs (9Eggenberger J. Blanco-Melo D. Panis M. Brennand K.J. tenOever B.R. Type I interferon response impairs differentiation potential of pluripotent stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Both scenarios are supported by strong experimental evidence and are not mutually exclusive. However, they only make biological sense if the deficiency in IFN production does not compromise the defense capacity of ESCs. Indeed, two alternative antiviral mechanisms have been proposed; ESCs may use a subset of preexisting IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are independent of IFN stimulation (10Wu X. Dao Thi V.L. Huang Y. Billerbeck E. Saha D. Hoffmann H.H. Wang Y. Silva L.A.V. Sarbanes S. Sun T. Andrus L. Yu Y. Quirk C. Li M. MacDonald M.R. et al.Intrinsic immunity shapes viral resistance of stem cells.Cell. 2018; 172: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), or they may use the RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral pathway that may not be operational in differentiated mammalian cells (11Pare J.M. Sullivan C.S. Distinct antiviral responses in pluripotent versus differentiated cells.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10e1003865Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although RNAi is widely recognized as a major antiviral mechanism in invertebrates, such a function has not been convincingly demonstrated in mammals. Interestingly, RNAi activity was detected in viral infected mouse ESCs, pointing to the possibility that RNAi could be an alternative antiviral mechanism in ESCs, in which the IFN system is deficient (12Maillard P.V. Ciaudo C. Marchais A. Li Y. Jay F. Ding S.W. Voinnet O. Antiviral RNA interference in mammalian cells.Science. 2013; 342: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of RNAi as an antiviral mechanism in ESCs remains uncertain (13Cullen B.R. Cherry S. tenOever B.R. Is RNA interference a physiologically relevant innate antiviral immune response in mammals?.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14: 374-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since Dicer is the key enzyme responsible for miRNA and siRNA biogenesis, D−/−ESCs could be used as a loss-of-function model to investigate the function of RNAi since they have retained the basic morphology of ESCs and the capacity to express pluripotency markers even though they display severe differentiation and growth defects (14Murchison E.P. Partridge J.F. Tam O.H. Cheloufi S. Hannon G.J. Characterization of Dicer-deficient murine embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12135-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 15Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K. Dicer-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells are defective in differentiation and centromeric silencing.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently reported that D−/−ESCs were able to express IFNβ and show increased antiviral activity (16Witteveldt J. Knol L.I. Macias S. MicroRNA-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells acquire a functional interferon response.eLife. 2019; 8e44171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Quite unexpectedly, our studies using ESCs as a model to express proteins from synthetic mRNA have led to new insights into the role of Dicer in the regulation of antiviral responses in these cells. Direct expression of a protein from its synthetic mRNA is an alternative to plasmid DNA- or viral vector-based gene expression systems (17Angel M. Yanik M.F. Innate immune suppression enables frequent transfection with rna encoding reprogramming proteins.PLoS One. 2010; 5e11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A major biological issue with this method is that synthetic mRNA transfected to the host cells is detected as foreign RNA and elicits antiviral responses, leading to reduced cell viability and apoptosis of the host cells (17Angel M. Yanik M.F. Innate immune suppression enables frequent transfection with rna encoding reprogramming proteins.PLoS One. 2010; 5e11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, this is not a serious problem in ESCs due to their attenuated antiviral responses as we demonstrated in a recent study (18Wang R. Teng C. Spangler J. Wang J. Huang F. Guo Y.-L. Mouse embryonic stem cells have underdeveloped antiviral mechanisms that can be exploited for the development of mRNA-mediated gene expression strategy.Stem Cells Dev. 2014; 23: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this feature in ESCs, we attempted to use green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed from its synthetic mRNA as a virus-free in vitro assay to determine RNAi activity in this study. RNAi activity was indeed detected in wild-type ESCs, but not in D−/−ESCs, as expected. However, D−/−ESCs showed increased antiviral responses to RNA transfection. Viral RNA induces IFN response by interacting with toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), leading to IFN transcription through activation of NFκB and IRFs (19Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzo¦zka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H. Akira S. Conzelmann K.K. Schlee M. Endres S. Hartmann G. 5'-Triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I.Science. 2006; 314: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 20Kawai T. Akira S.

Takahasi K. Fujita T. RIG-I-like receptors: Cytoplasmic sensors for non-self RNA.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 243: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, viral RNA can also activate other antiviral mechanisms, such as dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR). Activation of PKR causes inhibition of both cellular and viral protein synthesis. While this represses viral replication, it also inhibits cell proliferation (22Yan N. Chen Z.J. Intrinsic antiviral immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). PKR is constitutively expressed in cells and is readily activated by viral dsRNA or by dysregulated cellular RNA, but it can be further upregulated by IFN as a part of the IFN response. Thus, the IFN system can activate multiple pathways and mount a powerful antiviral response (7Samuel C.E. Antiviral actions of interferons.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). While it is apparent that the deficiency of ESCs in expressing IFN is closely related to pluripotency, the underlying molecular basis of this deficiency is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that D−/−ESCs have gained the ability to express not only the type I IFN system, but also constitutively active PKR, which together contribute to the reduced cell proliferation and cell viability of D−/−ESCs. Our data revealed a critical role of Dicer as a repressor of antiviral responses in ESCs, which represents a novel mechanism essential for ESCs to maintain rapid proliferation and to prevent potential cell damage resulting from dysregulated endogenous RNA transcripts. This assay was initially intended to determine the RNAi activity in ESCs. Functionalized GFP-mRNA was first transfected into cells where it was translated to GFP. The cells were then transfected with a synthetic dsRNA corresponding to the sequence of GFP (designated as dsGFP). Based on the principle of RNAi, dsGFP would be processed to yield siRNA that will specifically target GFP-mRNA, thereby reducing GFP expression. GFP was detected as early as 3 h after GFP-mRNA transfection. Subsequent transfection with either dsGFP or dsLuc (a control luciferase dsRNA of similar length with a sequence unrelated to GFP-mRNA) reduced GFP expression as indicated by diminished green fluorescence (Fig.S1A). Quantitative analysis by flow cytometry indicated that GFP fluorescence intensity in ESCs was reduced more by dsGFP than by dsLuc (Fig.S1B, 59% versus 76% at 24 h, in comparison with control, 100%). However, in D−/−ESCs, both dsGFP and dsLuc reduced the expression of GFP to a similar level (45% versus 47%, at 24 h). A logical explanation for these results would be that the different effect between dsGFP and dsLuc in ESCs is due to sequence-specific reduction of GFP-mRNA by dsGFP via Dicer-dependent RNAi activity, which is abolished in D−/−ESCs. The non-sequence-specific effects in the reduction of GFP fluorescence caused by dsGFP and dsLuc in both ESCs and D−/−ESCs are likely due to the activation of other pathways. These results demonstrated the existence of RNAi activity in ESCs, which is in agreement with the study using GFP expressed from plasmids as an siRNA target (23Maillard P.V. Van der Veen A.G. Deddouche-Grass S. Rogers N.C. Merits A. Reis E Sousa C. Inactivation of the type I interferon pathway reveals long double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 2505-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the most notable observation is that transfection of D−/−ESCs with dsRNA, and to a lesser extent with GFP-mRNA, caused cell death, as judged by the increased number of detached cells (Fig.S1A, D−/−ESC1), whereas the cytotoxicity caused by dsRNA transfection in ESCs is low and limited to reduced colony size (Fig.S1A, ESC1). These results suggested that D−/−ESCs have increased susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of transfected RNA. The GFP-mRNA contains some uncapped GFP-mRNA, which has a 5’ppp-group that can activate RIG-I (24Schlee M. Roth A. Hornung V. Hagmann C.A. Wimmenauer V. Barchet W. Coch C. Janke M. Mihailovic A.

Therefore, the RNA preparations used in the above experiments can potentially interact with most, if not all, known RNA receptors, including TLR3, RIG-I, MDA5, and PKR, that can potentially activate most of the common antiviral pathways. Therefore, cellular effects of RNA transfection on ESCs and D−/−ESCs represent the collective results of their antiviral responses. The increased antiviral response in D−/−ESCs is a novel finding that we investigated further with two independent pairs of ESC lines (ESC1;D−/−ESC1 and ESC2;D−/−ESC2) in this study. To determine the effect of Dicer deletion on the IFN pathway, we transfected the cells with dsGFP or dsLuc and analyzed the expression of IFNβ and ISG15 as indicators of the functionality of the type I IFN system. As shown in Figure 1A, the mRNA levels of the two genes were not or only slightly increased in ESCs, but they were strongly stimulated in D−/−ESCs. Similar results were observed when cells were transfected with polyIC (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid), a synthetic dsRNA used as a viral RNA analog in our previous studies (25Wang R. Wang J. Paul A.M. Acharya D. Bai F. Huang F. Guo Y.L. Mouse embryonic stem cells are deficient in type I interferon expression in response to viral infections and double-stranded RNA.J. Biol.

It is known that certain cellular RNA with dsRNA structures, including those from apoptotic cells, misprocessed RNA, and transcripts of transposable elements (TEs), can induce antiviral responses and cause cellular damage in the absence of infection (27White E. Schlackow M. Kamieniarz-Gdula K. Proudfoot N.J. Gullerova M. Human nuclear Dicer restricts the deleterious accumulation of endogenous double-stranded RNA.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Effects of length and location on the cellular response to double-stranded RNA.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 432-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The B2 short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) is a major type of retrotransposons in mouse genomes (30Walters R.D. Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Invaluable junk: The cellular impact and function of alu and B2 RNAs.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). B2RNA, which has several features of dsRNA (31Espinoza C.A. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. Characterization of the structure, function, and mechanism of B2 RNA, an ncRNA repressor of RNA polymerase II transcription.RNA. 2007; 16: 583-596Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), is abundantly expressed in mouse ESCs. As shown in Figure 1B, synthetic B2RNA (B2) showed patterns similar to dsGFP and dsLuc in inducing IFNβ and ISG15 expression in ESCs and D−/−ESCs. It is noted that the endogenous B2RNA level in D−/−ESCs was significantly higher than in ESCs, indicating its accumulation in D−/−ESCs (Fig. 1C). If Dicer is responsible for processing endogenous B2RNA, it could target the transfected B2 RNA as well. To test this possibility, we transfected ESCs and D−/−ESCs with Cy3-labeled fluorescent B2RNA (Cy3-B2) and analyzed the levels of Cy3-B2 by Cy3 fluorescence intensity. Our results indicated that Cy3-B2 was detected at higher levels in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs (Fig. S2), consistent with the accumulation of endogenous B2RNA in D−/−ESCs (Fig. 1C). We also compared the basal mRNA levels of the RNA receptors that mediate the effects of viral RNA. With the exception of MDA5, which is expressed at higher levels in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs, the other tested dsRNA receptors are expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1D). ESCs are able to respond to IFNα and IFNβ, but they are unable to express the two cytokines (25Wang R. Wang J. Paul A.M. Acharya D. Bai F. Huang F. Guo Y.L.

Chem. 2014; 289: 25186-25198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test if Dicer deletion affects the responsiveness of ESCs to IFN, we treated the cells with IFNα and compared IFNα-induced expression of three ISGs (PKR, ISG15, and STAT1) in ESCs and D−/−ESCs. IFNα induced expression of all three genes, with ISG15 mRNA induced significantly higher in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs (Fig. 2A). It is also noted that the basal mRNA levels of all three ISGs are about threefold higher in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs. At the protein level, STAT1 was detected in unstimulated cells, but it was induced by IFNα in both ESCs and D−/−ESCs. IFNα-induced PKR was also apparent in ESCs and D−/−ESCs (Fig. 2B, left panel). For a functional analysis of the IFN system, we prepared conditioned medium (CM) from dsGFP-transfected ESCs and D−/−ESCs (dsGFP[CM]). The rationale is that if the CM contains IFN, it will induce ISGs, such as STAT1, resembling the effects of IFNα (Fig. 2B). In this experiment, we used ESC-differentiated fibroblasts (ESC-FBs) since they are much more responsive to IFN than ESCs (32D'Angelo W. Acharya D. Wang R. Wang J. Gurung C. Chen B. Bai F. Guo Y.L. Development of antiviral innate immunity during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells Dev. 2016; 25: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2C, dsGFP[CM] prepared from D−/−ESCs, but not that from ESCs (blot inset), induced the expression of STAT1 in ESC-FBs. This result indicated that dsGFP[CM] only from D−/−ESCs contains secreted IFN, as confirmed by ELISA analysis of IFNβ in the CMs (Fig. 2C, bar graph). Together, these data demonstrate that D−/−ESCs have a fully functional type I IFN system. We further analyzed the expression levels of the major signaling molecules that mediate the effects of IFN. As shown in Figure 2D, RT-qPCR analysis indicated that most of these molecules were expressed at comparable mRNA levels in ESCs and D−/−ESCs although some variations were noted for JAK1, IFNAR2, and STAT1 between the two different D−/−ESC lines. The PKR pathway is functional in ESCs as we demonstrated with polyIC transfection and viral infection (25Wang R. Wang J. Paul A.M. Acharya D. Bai F. Huang F. Guo Y.L. Mouse embryonic stem cells are deficient in type I interferon expression in response to viral infections and double-stranded RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15926-15936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine if this pathway is also altered in D−/−ESCs, we treated the cells with dsGFP or B2RNA. Although dsRNA is the best characterized activator of PKR, single-stranded RNA having hairpin structures with a certain length can also activate PKR (27White E. Schlackow M. Kamieniarz-Gdula K. Proudfoot N.J. Gullerova M. Human nuclear Dicer restricts the deleterious accumulation of endogenous double-stranded RNA.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Williams B.R. PKR; a sentinel kinase for cellular stress.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 29Wang Q. Carmichael G.G. Effects of length and location on the cellular response to double-stranded RNA.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 432-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that B2RNA may be able to activate PKR since it has a secondary structure with five hairpins, two loops, and two single-stranded regions (31Espinoza C.A. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. Characterization of the structure, function, and mechanism of B2 RNA, an ncRNA repressor of RNA polymerase II transcription.RNA. 2007; 16: 583-596Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PKR activation is commonly assessed by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (peIF2α), which is a well-characterized PKR substrate (6Garcia M.A. Meurs E.F. Esteban M. The dsRNA protein kinase PKR: Virus and cell control.Biochimie. 2007; 89: 799-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and by the level of phosphorylated PKR (pPKR), which is the active form of PKR. As shown in Figure 3, peIF2α was detected in both ESCs and D−/−ESCs treated with dsGFP and B2RNA, but levels of pPKR were much higher in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs. However, the most notable observation is that both pPKR and peIF2α were detected in untreated D−/−ESCs but barely detected in untreated ESCs (Fig. 3 Con), indicating that PKR is constitutively active in D−/−ESCs. ESCs are characterized by their rapid cell proliferation rate due to constitutively activated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) driven by high expression levels of cyclins A, B, and E (33Stead E. White J. Faast R. Conn S. Goldstone S. Rathjen J. Dhingra U. Rathjen P. Walker D. Dalton S. Pluripotent cell division cycles are driven by ectopic Cdk2, cyclin A/E and E2F activities.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8320-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). D−/−ESCs have a substantially lower growth rate than ESCs (Fig. 4A). RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the mRNA level of cyclin E and cyclin B appeared to be lower in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs while cyclin A was not significantly altered. However, three major cell cycle inhibitors, p21, p19, and p16, which are expressed at very low levels in ESCs, are expressed at substantially higher levels in D−/−ESCs (Fig. 4B). These results explain, at least partially, the reduced cell proliferation in D−/−ESCs. PKR activation is known to inhibit cell proliferation, including in ESCs as we previously demonstrated with polyIC-activated PKR (25Wang R. Wang J. Paul A.M. Acharya D. Bai F. Huang F. Guo Y.L. Mouse embryonic stem cells are deficient in type I interferon expression in response to viral infections and double-stranded RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15926-15936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To test if constitutively activated PKR in D−/−ESCs contributed to their reduced cell proliferation, we treated ESCs and D−/−ESCs with an imidazolo-oxindole PKR inhibitor (C16), which shows a similar effect to siRNA that knocks down PKR (25Wang R. Wang J. Paul A.M. Acharya D. Bai F. Huang F. Guo Y.L. Mouse embryonic stem cells are deficient in type I interferon expression in response to viral infections and double-stranded RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 15926-15936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5A, C16 treatment significantly increased the cell number of D−/−ESCs in a dose-dependent manner with the maximal effect at the concentration of 0.75 μM, but this dose dependence was not seen in ESCs. We further analyzed the cells by flow cytometry. ESCs have large populations at the S phase and similar cell populations at the G1 and G2 phases when they are grown at low density. However, in comparison, D−/−ESCs have increased G1 cell populations and reduced S phase cell populations, which are indicators of slowed cell cycle progression. Treatment of D−/−ESCs with C16 reduced the G1 cell population. At 0.75 μM and 1 μM, C16-treated D−/−ESCs have a cell cycle profile with a ratio of G1 and G2 cells similar to ESCs. Although the S phase cell population in ESCs was slightly reduced by C16, the overall cell cycle profiles were not altered (Fig. 5B), consistent with the unchanged cell proliferation rate (Fig. 5A). The effect of C16 on the inhibition of PKR was confirmed by knocking down PKR expression with its specific siRNA, leading to increased cell proliferation similar to the effect of C16 (Fig. 5C). In line with the results from RT-qPCR analysis shown in Figure 4B, western blot analysis indicated that p21 and p19 proteins were expressed at substantially higher levels in D−/−ESCs than in ESCs, but their relative levels were not affected by C16 (Fig. 6A). The relative levels of CDK2 (Fig. 6B) and cyclin E and A were not significantly altered in either D−/−ESCs or ESCs by C16 treatment (data not shown). However, CDC25A, a protein phosphatase that activates CDKs and leads to G1/S cell cycle progression (34Shen T. Huang S. The role of Cdc25A in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2012; 12: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), is upregulated in D−/−ESCs (Fig. 6B). This result could contribute to the reduction of G1 phase cells by C16 in D−/−ESCs. In routine cell culture, it is notable that there are more cells undergoing"

Loss-of-function mutations of human ZIP4 (hZIP4) drastically reduce zinc absorption, causing a life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE). These mutations occur not only in the conserved transmembrane zinc transport machinery, but also in the extracellular domain (ECD) of hZIP4, which is only present in a fraction of mammalian ZIPs. How these AE-causing ECD mutations lead to ZIP4 malfunction has not be fully clarified. In this work, we characterized all seven confirmed AE-causing missense mutations in hZIP4-ECD and found that the variants exhibited completely abolished zinc transport activity in a cell-based transport assay. Although the variants were able to be expressed in HEK293T cells, they failed to traffic to the cell surface and were largely retained in the ER with immature glycosylation. When the corresponding mutations were introduced in the ECD of ZIP4 from Pteropus Alecto, a close homolog of hZIP4, the variants exhibited structural defects or reduced thermal stability, which likely accounts for intracellular mistrafficking of the AE-associated variants and as such a total loss of zinc uptake activity.

This work provides a molecular pathogenic mechanism for AE. Zinc is an essential micronutrient for any living organism. As the second most abundant transition metal element in humans after iron, zinc is required for function of over 2000 transcription factors and activity of approximately 300 enzymes (1McCall K.A. Huang C. Fierke C.A. Function and mechanism of zinc metalloenzymes.J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1437S-1446SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been estimated that zinc ions bind to nearly 3000 proteins, which account for ∼10% of the proteins encoded in human genome (2Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. Counting the zinc-proteins encoded in the human genome.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that zinc deficiency may affect many biological processes, causing growth retardation, immune dysfunction, diarrhea, delayed sexual maturation, and skin lesions (3Maret W. Sandstead H.H. Zinc requirements and the risks and benefits of zinc supplementation.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2006; 20: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Zinc deficiency is usually caused by inadequate zinc supply in foods or acquired diseases either reducing zinc uptake or increasing zinc loss (4Prasad A.S. Zinc deficiency.BMJ. 2003; 326: 409-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In a rare case, inherited zinc deficiency, which is called acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE), is caused by loss-of-function (LOF) mutations of ZIP4 (5Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M.

AE is fatal without treatment, but lifelong high-dose zinc supplementation on daily basis can effectively alleviate the symptoms (11Perafan-Riveros C. Franca L.F. Alves A.C. Sanches Jr., J.A.

ZIP4 is specifically expressed on the apical side of enterocytes in the small intestine and also in the kidney where it is believed to be involved in zinc reabsorption from urine (18Jeong J. Eide D.J. The SLC39 family of zinc transporters.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Topologically, ZIP4 has a transmembrane domain (TMD), which is generally conserved in the entire ZIP family, and a large extracellular domain (ECD), which is only present in a fraction of the family members (19Zhang T. Sui D. Hu J. Structural insights of ZIP4 extracellular domain critical for optimal zinc transport.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Hu J. Wille H. Schmitt-Ulms G. The evolutionary unZIPping of a dimerization motif—a Comparison of ZIP and PrP architectures.Pathogens. 2018; 7: 4Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The AE-causing mutations are evenly distributed along the 12 exons of zip4 gene without showing hotspot (21Schmitt S. Kury S. Giraud M. Dreno B. Kharfi M. Bezieau S. An update on mutations of the SLC39A4 gene in acrodermatitis enteropathica.Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Kury S. Kharfi M. Schmitt S. Bezieau S. Clinical utility gene card for: Acrodermatitis enteropathica.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 20Google Scholar). As a result, half of the missense AE-causing mutations are mapped in the ECD and the other half in the TMD where the zinc transport machinery is located. A previous work has investigated several corresponding mutations in the TMD of mouse ZIP4 (mZIP4) but only one mutation in the ECD (equivalent to the P200L mutation in human ZIP4, hZIP4) was studied in the same report (7Wang F. Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. Acrodermatitis enteropathica mutations affect transport activity, localization and zinc-responsive trafficking of the mouse ZIP4 zinc transporter.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The P200L variant of hZIP4 was also characterized in a recent report (23Hoch E. Levy M. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. Elucidating the H(+) coupled Zn(2+) transport mechanism of ZIP4; implications in acrodermatitis enteropathica.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). So far, it is still unclear about how the other AE-causing mutations in the ECD affect hZIP4 function and the corresponding molecular mechanisms are also unknown. The crystal structure of the ECD of ZIP4 from Pteropus Alecto (black fruit bat, pZIP4-ECD), which shares 68% sequence identity with hZIP4-ECD, provides a structural framework to deduce structural impacts of the AE-causing mutations on this accessory domain required for optimal zinc transport (19Zhang T. Sui D. Hu J. Structural insights of ZIP4 extracellular domain critical for optimal zinc transport.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this work, we functionally characterized all the seven confirmed AE-associated variants in a human cell line (HEK293T) and biophysically studied the purified variants of pZIP4-ECD harboring the corresponding mutations. We found that all the variants showed little zinc transport activity in the cell-based transport assay. Although the variants were expressed, the cell surface expression was barely detectable. The variants were found to be immaturely glycosylated and aberrantly retained in the ER. For the purified pZIP4-ECD variants, biophysical studies revealed that the mutations caused structural defects or reduced thermal stability, providing a possible causative explanation for ZIP4 mistrafficking and dysfunction. A total of 17 missense mutations in hZIP4-ECD have been documented, of which seven are confirmed AE-causing mutations and the others are benign single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), according to the MASTERMIND database (https://mastermind.genomenon.com/) and an early review (21Schmitt S. Kury S. Giraud M. Dreno B. Kharfi M. Bezieau S. An update on mutations of the SLC39A4 gene in acrodermatitis enteropathica.Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mapping these residues on the hZIP4-ECD structural model (generated using SWISS-MODEL (24Waterhouse A. Bertoni M. Bienert S. Studer G. Tauriello G. Gumienny R. Heer F.T. de Beer T.A.P. Rempfer C.

As shown in Figure 2A, in sharp contrast to the wild-type hZIP4, none of the cells expressing any variants uptook more zinc than the blank group in which the cells were transfected with an empty vector, which means that the variants have no detectable zinc transport activity with 10 μM of Zn2+ in culture media. For the wild-type hZIP4, the previous studies have shown that zinc transport activity reaches plateau at 10 μM of Zn2+ under the same condition (28Zhang T. Kuliyev E. Sui D. Hu J.

To examine whether any activity can be detected at higher zinc concentration, the P200L variant was tested at various zinc concentrations up to 50 μM, but the results only confirmed no detectable activity (Fig. S1).Figure 2Expression and functional characterization of hZIP4 and the variants.

Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. Acrodermatitis enteropathica mutations affect transport activity, localization and zinc-responsive trafficking of the mouse ZIP4 zinc transporter.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To examine whether the AE-causing mutations in the ECD have similar effects, expression of the variants was detected in the whole-cell samples using an anti-HA antibody in western blot. As shown in Figure 2B, all the variants were expressed, but the wild-type hZIP4 has two discrete bands at approximately 75 kDa, whereas the AE-associated variants have only one band corresponding to the lower band of the wild-type protein. When treated with PNGase F, an enzyme cleaving the glycosidic bond directly linked with the asparagine residue, the two bands of the wild-type protein merged into a single one with a smaller apparent molecular weight, indicating that the expressed hZIP4 harbors two distinct glycans (7Wang F. Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. Acrodermatitis enteropathica mutations affect transport activity, localization and zinc-responsive trafficking of the mouse ZIP4 zinc transporter.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When treated with Endo H, which is a glycosidase selectively hydrolyzing high-mannose or some hybrid glycans, the lower band was processed, whereas the upper band was resistant (Fig. 2C), indicating that the species in the upper band has a complex glycan, whereas the lower band represents a species with immature glycosylation. In contrast, the P200L variant was completely processed by Endo H, and the resulting species is of the same apparent molecular weight as the one corresponding to the lower band of the processed wild-type protein. Thus, although the total expression levels of the variants were not drastically affected by the mutations in the ECD, defects in glycosylation were observed for all the AE-associated variants. Proteins expressed at cell surface are often modified by N-glycosylation, which may play a key role in protein function (30Spiro R.G. Protein glycosylation: Nature, distribution, enzymatic formation, and disease implications of glycopeptide bonds.Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 43R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). As the AE-associated variants losing zinc transport activity are concomitant with defects in glycosylation, we asked whether the lack in glycosylation is responsible for activity loss. Using the NetNGlyc server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/), we identified a potential glycosylation site at N261 in an “NxS/T” motif. We then generated the N261Q variant and expressed it in HEK293T cells. In western blot, the N261Q variant showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight smaller than the lower band of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2B), confirming that N261 is indeed the only N-glycosylation site in hZIP4. Importantly, zinc transport assay of the N261Q variant only showed a modest reduction of transport activity (Fig. 2D), indicating that glycosylation at N261 is not pivotal for zinc transport and therefore lack of glycosylation of the AE-associated variants does not account for loss of zinc transport activity. As the glycans are added to the client membrane proteins in the ER, processed in the ER and then in the Golgi in a stepwise manner (31Marinko J.T. Huang H. Penn W.D. Capra J.A. Schlebach J.P. Sanders C.R. Folding and misfolding of human membrane proteins in health and disease: From single molecules to cellular proteostasis.Chem. Rev. 2019; 119: 5537-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), immature glycosylation is an indicator of defect in intracellular trafficking. To examine potential mislocalization, we tested cell surface expression levels of the AE-associated variants by applying the anti-HA antibody to the nonpermeabilized cells fixed with formaldehyde (7Wang F. Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J.

Molecular basis of zinc-dependent endocytosis of human ZIP4 transceptor.Cell Rep. 2020; 31: 107582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After extensive wash, nonspecific bound antibody was removed, leaving those specifically bound with the C-terminal HA tag at cell surface. As shown in Figure 3A, all the AE-associated variants had substantially reduced cell surface levels when compared with the wild-type hZIP4 in western blot. Consistent with the zinc transport data, the N261Q variant missing the N-linked glycan had significantly higher level of cell surface expression than the variants linked with disease, indicating that the N-glycosylation at N261 is not a key factor for hZIP4 surface expression. We then applied immunofluorescence imaging to locate the AE-associated variants expressed in cells. To do that, the cells transiently expressing the wild type or the variants were fixed and permeabilized with formaldehyde and TX-100, followed by staining with an FITC-labeled anti-HA antibody. The samples were then checked under confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Consistent with the western blot shown in Figure 2B, the wild type and the variants were expressed in HEK293T cells at comparable levels (Fig. 3B). To detect the transporters expressed at cell surface, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and treated with the same anti-HA antibody, followed by extensive washing and checking under CLSM. In Figure 3B, fluorescence signals at cell surface can be convincingly detected for the wild-type hZIP4 and the N261Q variant, whereas the signals of the AE-associated variants imaged under the same conditions were not detectable. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that the cell surface expression levels of the AE-associated variants were largely suppressed, which is likely responsible for loss of zinc transport activity. Since all the AE-associated variants were expressed but not presented at cell surface, we then asked where the variants are located in cells. Endo H treatment experiment suggests that the variants are likely trapped in the ER (Fig. 2C). To test this, we examined colocalization of hZIP4 and its variants with an ER-resident protein, calreticulin, and quantified the results using Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). As shown in Figure 4, the staining of the wild-type hZIP4-HA (red) was partially superimposed with those of calreticulin (green), resulting in a yellow/orange color. The calculated PCC (0.37 ± 0.06) indicates that a significant portion of hZIP4 expressed in HEK293T cells were retained in the ER, which is consistent with the results of the Endo H treatment, which showed that more than half of the expressed hZIP4 were not maturely glycosylated. For all the AE-associated variants, more overlapped signals were detected and the PCCs (0.52–0.66) are significantly higher than that of the wild-type protein (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4), indicating that these variants were retained in the ER to a greater extent than the wild-type protein. Next, we attempted to clarify the molecular basis of the variants’ mistrafficking. Given the difficulty of obtaining adequate amount of purified full-length hZIP4 or hZIP4-ECD for biophysical characterization, we turned to the isolated pZIP4-ECD, which we have previously crystallized and biochemically characterized (19Zhang T. Sui D. Hu J. Structural insights of ZIP4 extracellular domain critical for optimal zinc transport.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Zhang T. Kuliyev E. Sui D. Hu J. The histidine-rich loop in the extracellular domain of ZIP4 binds zinc and plays a role in zinc transport.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 1791-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Given the high sequence identity, we believe that the results obtained from the study of purified pZIP4-ECD would help to understand how the disease-causing mutations affect the biophysical properties of the human counterpart. We introduced mutations in pZIP4-ECD on the residues topologically equivalent to those in hZIP4 (C64R, R87C, A91T, D98K, P193L, Q299H, and C305Y). The variants were expressed and purified in the same way as the wild-type protein, but the final yields were lower. Particularly, the yields of two variants (D98K and C305Y) were too low to allow for further characterization. Therefore, we focused on the other five variants in later study. In size-exclusion chromatography, all the variants were eluted as a single peak with apparent molecular weights at or greater than that of a homodimer (66 kDa), except that the Q299H variant has a smaller apparent molecular weight at approximately 50 kDa (Fig. 5). Consistently, the hydrodynamic diameter of the Q299H variant (7.4 ± 1.2 nm), which was determined by dynamic light scattering, is significantly smaller than that of the wild-type protein (10.6 ± 0.3 nm, p < 0.05). As only one species was detected in both the size-exclusion chromatography and the dynamic light scatter experiment, the monomer–dimer equilibrium appears to strongly favor one side, but the current data cannot tell whether this variant preserves dimerization or becomes monomeric in solution. The purified proteins were applied to circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer, and the data were analyzed on the K2D3 server to estimate secondary structure contents (34Louis-Jeune C. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Perez-Iratxeta C. Prediction of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism using theoretically derived spectra.Proteins. 2012; 80: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 6, the CD spectrum of the wild-type pZIP4-ECD has a high α-helical content (66 ± 2%) with the characteristic minima at 208 nm and 222 nm and maximum at 195 nm, which is consistent with the reported crystal structure (19Zhang T. Sui D. Hu J. Structural insights of ZIP4 extracellular domain critical for optimal zinc transport.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When compared with the wild-type protein, three variants exhibited lower levels of α-helical content – R87C (56 ± 3%), A91T (59 ± 3%), and Q299H (56 ± 2%) (p < 0.05). In addition, the ratios of ellipticities (θ) at 222 nm and 208 nm were significantly reduced. The θ222/θ208 ratio is an indicator of whether α-helices are packed to form coiled-coil-like tertiary structures (35Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Synthetic model proteins.

A value smaller than 1 may indicate poorly packed helices and lack of coiled-coils. For the wild-type protein, the θ222/θ208 ratio (1.020) is slightly greater than 1, which is consistent with the crystal structure where two helix bundles form two separate subdomains: in the N-terminal helix-rich domain (HRD), α4 is surrounded and packed with the other eight helices, whereas four helices (α10-α12) in the C-terminal domain (PAL motif-containing domain, PCD) are packed against the count"

Severe and acute deterioration of COPD can easily lead to respiratory failure, resulting in personal, social, and medical burden. Recent studies have shown a high correlation between the gut microbiota and lung inflammation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and COPD severity. A total of 60 COPD patients with varying severity according to GOLD guidelines were enrolled in this study. DNA was extracted from patients’ stool and 16S rRNA data analysis conducted using high-throughput sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. The richness of the gut microbiota was not associated with COPD severity. The gut microbiome is more similar in stage 1 and 2 COPD than stage 3+4 COPD. Fusobacterium and Aerococcus were more abundant in stage 3+4 COPD. Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group and Lachnoclostridium were less abundant in stage 2–4, and Tyzzerella 4 and Dialister were less abundant in stage 1. However, the abundance of a Bacteroides was associated with blood eosinophils and lung function. This study suggests that no distinctive gut microbiota pattern is associated with the severity of COPD. The gut microbiome could affect COPD by gut inflammation shaping the host immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3148211770,"Rewiring of cellular programmes in malignant cells generates cancer-specific vulnerabilities. Here, using an unbiased screening strategy aimed at identifying non-essential genes required by tumour cells to sustain unlimited proliferative capacity, we identify the male-specific lethal (MSL) acetyltransferase complex as a vulnerability of genetically unstable cancers. We find that disruption of the MSL complex and consequent loss of the associated H4K16ac mark do not substantially alter transcriptional programmes but compromise chromosome integrity and promote chromosomal instability (CIN) that progressively exhausts the proliferative potential of cancer cells through a p53-independent mechanism. This effect is dependent on pre-existing genomic instability, and normal cells are insensitive to MSL disruption. Using cell- and patient-derived xenografts from multiple cancer types, we show that excessive CIN induced by MSL disruption inhibits tumour maintenance. Our findings suggest that targeting MSL may be a valuable means to increase CIN beyond the level tolerated by cancer cells without inducing severe adverse effects in normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3129830219,"The ongoing COVID pandemic has disrupted the ability to hold scientific conferences in person. Despite this, over 200 people from across the world attended The First International Symposium on the Chaperone Code, which was held virtually on October 28 to 29, 2020. The meeting highlighted the many ways that posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on molecular chaperones regulate their function to control proteostasis in diverse organisms. Cells are continuously exposed to a variety of internal and external stressors that induce protein misfolding. To respond and recover from these stresses, cells express a myriad of molecular chaperone and co-chaperone paralogs that aid in folding, refolding, stabilization, activation, and transport of a large proportion of the proteome (“clients”). While chaperones have been extensively studied for over 40 years, the majority of studies have focused on chaperone actions, ATPase cycle regulation, and in vitro folding mechanisms. With the exponential improvement in proteomic technologies over the past 10 years, a huge number of PTMs have been uncovered on chaperones including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination. Despite the identification of these sites, the respective roles and roles of the modifications (collectively known as the Chaperone Code, Fig. 1) are poorly understood. The inaugural meeting on the Chaperone Code brought together experts from diverse fields ranging from chaperone mechanisms to signal transduction to discuss their latest exciting insights on the Chaperone Code. In this report, we highlight several of these findings in this emerging field of chaperone biology. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone involved in folding, stability, and activity of more than 300 proteins also known as clients. Many of these clients are involved in various maladies including cancer, neurodegenerative and infectious diseases (1Schopf F.H. Biebl M.M. Buchner J. The HSP90 chaperone machinery.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Woodford M.R. Dunn D.M. Ciciarelli J.G. Beebe K. Neckers L. Mollapour M. Targeting Hsp90 in non-cancerous maladies.Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2016; 16: 2792-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting Hsp90 in preclinical studies and clinical trials in these diseases has been actively pursued (3Neckers L. Workman P. Hsp90 molecular chaperone inhibitors: Are we there yet?.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Hsp90 chaperone function is linked to its intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp90. This activity is enhanced by the co-chaperone Aha1 (1Schopf F.H. Biebl M.M. Buchner J. The HSP90 chaperone machinery.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Len Neckers (National Cancer Institute, USA) showed that phosphorylation of a highly conserved Tyr313 in the middle domain of human Hsp90α is important for initial binding of Aha1 (4Xu W. Beebe K. Chavez J.D. Boysen M. Lu Y. Zuehlke A.D. Keramisanou D. Trepel J.B. Prodromou C. Mayer M.P. Bruce J.E. Gelis I. Neckers L. Hsp90 middle domain phosphorylation initiates a complex conformational program to recruit the ATPase-stimulating cochaperone Aha1.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr313 appears to provide a phosphorylation-sensitive conformational switch that initiates Aha1 C-domain recruitment to the Hsp90 middle (M) domain and consequent stimulation of ATPase activity. This binding pose of the Aha1 C-domain to Hsp90 M-domain, which was unexpected based on previous models, is supported by recently reported orthogonal cryo-EM data (4Xu W. Beebe K. Chavez J.D. Boysen M. Lu Y. Zuehlke A.D. Keramisanou D. Trepel J.B. Prodromou C. Mayer M.P. Bruce J.E. Gelis I. Neckers L. Hsp90 middle domain phosphorylation initiates a complex conformational program to recruit the ATPase-stimulating cochaperone Aha1.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further, since tyrosine phosphorylation of Aha1 also facilitates its binding to human Hsp90 (5Dunn D.M. Woodford M.R. Truman A.W. Jensen S.M. Schulman J. Caza T. Remillard T.C. Loiselle D. Wolfgeher D. Blagg B.S. Franco L. Haystead T.A. Daturpalli S. Mayer M.P.

PTMs of Hsp90 can impact its ATPase activity, suggesting an allosteric regulation mechanism in Hsp90. Giorgio Colombo (University of Pavia, Italy) demonstrated the use of computational design in deciphering the chaperone code. Using this approach, it is possible to identify regulatory amino acids that are subject to PTMs and consequently impact the conformational dynamics and ATPase activity of Hsp90 both in vitro and in vivo (6Rehn A. Moroni E. Zierer B.K. Tippel F. Morra G. John C. Richter K. Colombo G. Buchner J. Allosteric regulation points control the conformational dynamics of the molecular chaperone Hsp90.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 4559-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This information can ultimately be used to generate small molecule modulators of function or protein–protein interaction inhibitors. The Hsp90 paralog mitochondrial chaperone tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP1) is instrumental in metabolic regulation and cell survival. Andrea Rasola, (University of Padova, Italy) showed context-dependent PTMs of TRAP1. More specifically, mutation and inactivation of neurofibromin, a Ras GTPase-activating protein, induce an oncogenic metabolic switch via mitochondrial ERK-mediated phosphorylation of the molecular chaperone TRAP1 (7Masgras I.

Dimitra Bourboulia (SUNY Upstate Medical University, USA) discussed how secreted kinase signaling could impact extracellular Hsp90 (eHsp90) chaperone function. She showed that the first secretory eHsp90 co-chaperone TIMP2 (8Baker-Williams A.J. Hashmi F. Budzynski M.A. Woodford M.R. Gleicher S. Himanen S.V. Makedon A.M. Friedman D. Cortes S. Namek S.

This modification could define TIMP2 function as an eHsp90 co-chaperone or an MMP inhibitor. Previous studies have also identified a role for the chaperone code in fungal virulence (10Weissman Z.

Acta. 2020; 1868: 140135Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Stephanie Diezmann (University of Bristol, UK) described a new phosphorylation site (S530) on Candida albicans Hsp90, targeted by casein kinase 2 (CK2), which results in the inhibition of Hsp90 function and blocking expression of key virulence traits. She showed that the phosphomimetic mutant S530E (but not S530A) abolished C. albicans survival at high temperatures, supported a switch to filamentous growth, a morphological change that is important for fungal virulence, and rendered C. albicans susceptible to both antifungal (fluconazole) and Hsp90 (radicicol) drugs (11Alaalm L.

These studies support the idea that specific Hsp90 PTMs may be exploited as potential antifungal drug targets. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is involved in folding, stability, and quality control of proteins (12Mayer M.P. Gierasch L.M.

Dalia Barsyte-Lovejoy (University of Toronto, Canada) described how characterization of a novel inhibitor of the arginine methylase PRMT7 led to the discovery that Hsp70 is methylated on R469, a highly conserved amino acid present on the client-binding domain. Intriguingly, this PRMT7-catalyzed methylation can only occur when Hsp70 is in its ATP-bound “open” conformation. R469 methylation appears to be important for a wide variety of chaperone processes that include stress granule response to proteasome inhibition and the general response to heat stress (15Szewczyk M.M.

Lysine methylation comes in several “flavors,” and Magnus Jakobsson (Lund University, Sweden) discussed the impacts of mono, di, and trimethylation of Hsp70 K561 promoted by METTL21A. The trimethylated K561 Hsp70 may have the greatest functional relevance, as it is the major form found in both the nucleus and the cytosol (16Jakobsson M.E. Moen A. Falnes P.O.

Functionally, Hsp70 methylation tunes the interaction of Hsp70 with the disease-associated protein alpha-synuclein (17Jakobsson M.E. Moen A. Bousset L. Egge-Jacobsen W. Kernstock S. Melki R. Falnes P.O. Identification and characterization of a novel human methyltransferase modulating Hsp70 protein function through lysine methylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27752-27763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, Jakobsson revealed that lysine methylation on Hsp70 in ovarian cancer tumor effusions may be correlated with disease prognosis (18Jakobsson M.E. Moen A. Davidson B. Falnes P.O. Hsp70 (HSPA1) lysine methylation status as a potential prognostic factor in metastatic high-grade serous carcinoma.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0140168Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These fascinating results bolster the growing evidence that multiple mutually exclusive modifications of a single Hsp70 residue can uniquely fine-tune chaperone function and represent biomarkers with clinical utility. Hsp70 is intimately tied to oxidative stress and metabolic processes in the cell. Adeleye Afolayan (Medical College of Wisconsin, USA) demonstrated a novel role of Hsp70 in the mitochondrial import of the superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2, MnSOD) appropriate to the levels of ROS inside the mitochondria. This process is driven by AKT1-catalyzed phosphorylation of Hsp70 on S631, which alters Hsp70 structure and ability to bind the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP. Several avenues of investigation remain to be explored, including the role of adjacent Hsp70 phosphorylation sites S633 and T636, which are also phosphorylated by AKT1 but do not impact the mitochondrial import of SOD2 (19Zemanovic S. Ivanov M.V. Ivanova L.V. Bhatnagar A. Michalkiewicz T. Teng R.J. Kumar S. Rathore R. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Konduri G.G. Afolayan A.J.

Several talks in the symposium described large-scale structural rearrangements on chaperones in response to PTM addition. Richard Bayliss (University of Leeds, UK) described the innovative use of expanded genetic codes in bacteria to produce recombinant Hsp70 phosphorylated on S66. This phosphorylated form was crystallized and revealed that S66 plays a role in Hsp70 interdomain communication. At the cellular level, this Nek6-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp70 is required to maintain a functional mitotic spindle, although the key clients involved are yet to be determined (20Mukherjee M. Sabir S. O'Regan L. Sampson J. Richards M.W. Huguenin-Dezot N. Ault J.R. Chin J.W. Zhuravleva A. Fry A.M. Bayliss R. Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release.Sci. Signal. 2018; 11eaao2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Lila Gierasch (University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA) tested the hypothesis that functionally relevant sites of modifications on Hsp70 chaperone impact its allosteric mechanism. One important site identified was T495 on mammalian Hsp70, a site previously identified in yeast as a functional hotspot as well as being activated in mammalian cells by the legionella pneumophila kinase LegK4 as part of its program of infection (21Moss S.M. Taylor I.R. Ruggero D. Gestwicki J.E. Shokat K.M. Mukherjee S.

She is currently exploring the native regulation of this site in yeast and mammalian cells in collaboration with Andrew Truman (University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA). Cells have evolved to express a multitude of Hsp70 chaperone paralogs (13Rosenzweig R. Nillegoda N.B. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. The Hsp70 chaperone network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 665-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Lotz S.K. Knighton L.E. Nitika Jones G.W. Truman A.W. Not quite the SSAme: Unique roles for the yeast cytosolic Hsp70s.Curr. Genet. 2019; 65: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several of these are located at spatially distinct sites. An important example is the ER-resident Hsp70 BiP (also known as Grp78), which is essential for the folding of membrane proteins and those with redox-related modifications such as disulfide bonds. Seema Mattoo (Purdue University, USA) described how Huntingtin yeast interacting protein (HYPE; also called FicD) is able to AMPylate the ER-resident Hsp70 BiP at T366 and T518 impacting the BiP ATP cycle. In contrast to many of the other talks demonstrating activation of chaperones through addition of PTMs, her message was that site-specific AMPylation has differential effects on BiP’s ATPase activity and provides a way for cells to stall BiP function in preparation for future stresses (23Sanyal A. Chen A.J. Nakayasu E.S. Lazar C.S. Zbornik E.A. Worby C.A. Koller A. Mattoo S.

Following on from this, Matthias Truttmann (University of Michigan, USA) provided evidence that although AMPylation of BiP in C. elegans does not alter animal survival, it does reduce Aβ toxicity, an effect that can be mimicked by directly silencing Hsp70 chaperones Hsp1, 3, and 4 simultaneously (25Truttmann M.C. Pincus D. Ploegh H.L. Chaperone AMPylation modulates aggregation and toxicity of neurodegenerative disease-associated polypeptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E5008-E5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the lion’s share of chaperone code research has focused on the Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperones, it is now clear that there are many other important regulators of this code. One such example is the heat shock factor (HSF) family of proteins, which regulate the expression of chaperones and co-chaperones under a variety of cellular stresses (26Himanen S.V. Sistonen L. New insights into transcriptional reprogramming during cellular stress.J. Cell Sci. 2019; 132jcs238402Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Lea Sistonen (Åbo Akademi University, Turku Bioscience Center, Finland) discussed the extensive stress-induced PTMs of HSFs, exploring their ability to both activate and repress transcription. Using Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq), a technology that maps nascent transcription at a nucleotide’s resolution (27Mahat D.B. Kwak H. Booth G.T. Jonkers I.H. Danko C.G. Patel R.K. Waters C.T. Munson K. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Base-pair-resolution genome-wide mapping of active RNA polymerases using precision nuclear run-on (PRO-seq).Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11: 1455-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), she showed that HSF1 also binds to highly upregulated enhancers, reprogramming transcription and mRNA expression following heat shock (28Vihervaara A. Mahat D.B. Guertin M.J. Chu T. Danko C.G. Lis J.T. Sistonen L. Transcriptional response to stress is pre-wired by promoter and enhancer architecture.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 255Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although most chaperone PTM studies have focused on phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation, there are many more that may be important to allow cells to rapidly respond to cellular status. One such PTM is glycosylation, directly regulated through metabolism. Although the interplay between molecular chaperones and metabolism remains poorly defined, it is clear that glycosylation of chaperones and co-chaperones may be key. The dynamic cycling of protein O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by the concerted actions of the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) that add and remove O-GlcNAc to serine or threonine amino acids, respectively. Natasha Zachara (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, USA) presented work on decoding the role of glycosylation in stress response. She showed that AMPKα and sequestosome modification by O-GlcNac and O-GlcNAcylation responds to oxidative stress. Additionally, O-GlcNac levels potentiate autophagy in an AMPKα-dependent manner. This is a perfect example of how one PTM such as O-GlcNAcylation can be used by cells to sense and respond to stress (29Zachara N. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. The O-GlcNAc modification.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Darvill A.G. Kinoshita T. Packer N.H. Prestegard J.H. Schnaar R.L. Seeberger P.H. Essentials of Glycobiology. 2015: 239-251Google Scholar). Johannes Buchner (Technische Universität München, Germany) discussed the consequences of chaperone code failure in the eye lens, loosely interpreting the “code” as the job definition of a chaperone to protect other proteins. Buchner explained that the current model for cataract formation assumes that damaged crystallin proteins assemble into light-scattering aggregates. Chaperones are thought to counteract this by sequestering misfolded crystallin proteins. He showed that in the lens, point mutations in α- (with a chaperone activity), β-, or γ-crystallin proteins are substantially reduced and that the mutant proteins do not accumulate in the water-insoluble fraction. As the mutant lenses show changes in protein composition and the spatial organization of crystallin, this suggests that the imbalance in the lenticular proteome results in changed crystallin interactions as the basis for cataract formation, rather than the aggregation of the crystallin mutants. This work ultimately helps in designing pharmacological treatments to prevent cataract or delay its onset (30Schmid P.W.N. Lim N.C.H. Peters C. Back K.C. Bourgeois B. Pirolt F. Richter B. Peschek J. Puk O. Amarie O.V. Dalke C. Haslbeck M. Weinkauf S. Madl T. Graw J. Buchner J.

Andrew Truman (University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA) closed the meeting by describing the history of research uncovering the roles of PTMs in chaperone–client interactions (31Truman A.W. Kristjansdottir K. Wolfgeher D. Hasin N. Polier S. Zhang H. Perrett S. Prodromou C. Jones G.W. Kron S.J. CDK-dependent Hsp70 phosphorylation controls G1 cyclin abundance and cell-cycle progression.Cell. 2012; 151: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). He followed up by summarizing the present state of knowledge on the Chaperone Code, reiterating that despite major advances in the identification of the myriad of PTMs on chaperones, fewer than 5% have been fully characterized. He defined multiple levels of future Chaperone Code research, the first of which is the identification of the stresses and enzymes that regulate specific sites on chaperones, as well as the functional consequences (in vitro and in vivo) of these modifications. The second level is more complex, determining the interplay between different sites and functional hierarchy involved. In the third level of the Code, evolutionary considerations are taken into account—how do sites of PTM appear on chaperones over time and understanding why different chaperone paralogs have evolved to have different PTMs. At the final level, there was discussion of how all of this information can be integrated into the global concept of the Chaperone Code (14Nitika Porter C.M.

https://openalex.org/W3140098005,"Hawkes processes are a form of self-exciting process that has been used in numerous applications, including neuroscience, seismology, and terrorism. While these self-exciting processes have a simple formulation, they can model incredibly complex phenomena. Traditionally Hawkes processes are a continuous-time process, however we enable these models to be applied to a wider range of problems by considering a discrete-time variant of Hawkes processes. We illustrate this through the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a substantive case study. While alternative models, such as compartmental and growth curve models, have been widely applied to the COVID-19 epidemic, the use of discrete-time Hawkes processes allows us to gain alternative insights. This paper evaluates the capability of discrete-time Hawkes processes by modelling daily mortality counts as distinct phases in the COVID-19 outbreak. We first consider the initial stage of exponential growth and the subsequent decline as preventative measures become effective. We then explore subsequent phases with more recent data. Various countries that have been adversely affected by the epidemic are considered, namely, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are all unique concerning the spread of the virus and their corresponding response measures. However, we find that this simple model is useful in accurately capturing the dynamics of the process, despite hidden interactions that are not directly modelled due to their complexity, and differences both within and between countries. The utility of this model is not confined to the current COVID-19 epidemic, rather this model could explain many other complex phenomena. It is of interest to have simple models that adequately describe these complex processes with unknown dynamics. As models become more complex, a simpler representation of the process can be desirable for the sake of parsimony."
https://openalex.org/W3140344371,"Fruit abscission is a complex physiological process that is regulated by internal and environmental factors. During early development, apple fruit are exposed to extreme temperature fluctuations that are associated with premature fruit drop; however, their effect on fruit abscission is largely unknown. We hypothesized that fruit abscission is triggered by cold stress and investigated the molecular basis of premature fruit drop using RNA-Seq and metabolomics data from apple fruit undergoing abscission following cold stress in the field. Genes responsive to abscisic acid signaling and cell wall degradation were upregulated during abscission, consistent with the increased abscisic acid concentrations detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We performed ex vivo cold shock experiments with excised tree subunits consisting of a branch, pedicel, and fruit. Abscission induction occurred in the cold-stressed subunits with concurrent upregulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis ( MdNCED1 ) and metabolism ( MdCYP707A ) genes, and ethylene biosynthesis ( MdACS1 ) and receptor ( MdETR2 ) genes in the pedicel. Another key finding was the activation of cytoplasmic streaming in abscission-zone cells detected by electron microscopy. Our results provide a novel insight into the molecular basis of fruit abscission physiology in response to cold stress in apple."
https://openalex.org/W3149886425,"The microbiome is a matter of interest for science, consumers and business. Our objective is to quantify that interest in academic journals and newspapers, both quantitatively and by study design. We calculated the number of articles on the microbiome from the total number of biomedicine articles featured in both PubMed and Spanish science news agency SINC, from 2008 to 2018. We used the Factiva database to identify news stories on microbiome papers in three general newspapers ( The New York Times , The Times and El País ) and three business newspapers ( The Wall Street Journal , the Financial Times and Expansión ), from 2007 to 2019. Then, we compared news stories with microbiome papers in PubMed, while also analyzing the frequencies of five study design types, both in the newspapers and in the papers themselves. Microbiome papers represented 0.8% of biomedicine papers in PubMed from 2008 to 2018 (increasing from 0.4% to 1.4%), while microbiome news published by SINC represented 1.6% of total biomedical news stories during the same period (increasing from 0.2% to 2.2%). The number of news stories on microbiome papers correlated with the number of microbiome papers (0.91, p &lt; 0.001) featured in general newspapers, but not in business ones. News stories on microbiome papers represented 78.9% and 42.7% of all microbiome articles in general and business newspapers, respectively. Both media outlet types tended to over-report observational studies in humans while under-reporting environmental studies, while the representation of systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, randomized controlled trials and animal/laboratory studies was similar when comparing newspapers and PubMed. The microbiome is receiving increasing attention in academic journals and newspapers. News stories on the microbiome in general and business newspapers are mostly based on research findings and are more interested in observational studies in humans and less in environmental studies compared to PubMed."
https://openalex.org/W3120485420,"The ability of iron to transfer electrons enables the contribution of this metal to a variety of cellular activities even as the redox properties of iron are also responsible for the generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), the most destructive of the reactive oxygen species. We previously showed that iron can promote the oxidation of bisretinoid by generating highly reactive hydroxyl radical (•OH). Now we report that preservation of iron regulation in the retina is not sufficient to prevent iron-induced bisretinoid oxidative degradation when blood iron levels are elevated in liver-specific hepcidin knockout mice. We obtained evidence for the perpetuation of Fenton reactions in the presence of the bisretinoid A2E and visible light. On the other hand, iron chelation by deferiprone was not associated with changes in postbleaching recovery of 11-cis-retinal or dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes indicating that the activity of Rpe65, a rate-determining visual cycle protein that carries an iron-binding domain, is not affected. Notably, iron levels were elevated in the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of Abca4−/− mice. Consistent with higher iron content, ferritin-L immunostaining was elevated in RPE of a patient diagnosed with ABCA4-associated disease and in RPE and photoreceptor cells of Abca4−/− mice. In neural retina of the mutant mice, reduced Tfrc mRNA was also an indicator of retinal iron overload. Thus iron chelation may defend retina when bisretinoid toxicity is implicated in disease processes.

In neural retina of the mutant mice, reduced Tfrc mRNA was also an indicator of retinal iron overload. Thus iron chelation may defend retina when bisretinoid toxicity is implicated in disease processes. In addition to iron being essential for oxygen transport by hemoglobin, iron is vital to the functioning of numerous other heme- and nonheme proteins (1Winter W.E. Bazydlo L.A. Harris N.S. The molecular biology of human iron metabolism.Lab. Med. 2014; 45: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2He X. Hahn P. Iacovelli J. Wong R. King C. Bhisitkul R. Massaro-Giordano M. Dunaief J.L. Iron homeostasis and toxicity in retinal degeneration.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2007; 26: 649-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In mitochondria iron-containing cytochrome proteins function in the synthesis of ATP by facilitating the transfer of electrons, the iron atom in the heme group being alternately oxidized and reduced (3Musallam K.M. Taher A.T. Iron deficiency beyond erythropoiesis: Should we be concerned?.Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2018; 34: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other cytochromes primarily involved in the metabolism and detoxification of substrates belong to the large family of cytochrome P450 enzymes that utilize iron as a cofactor (3Musallam K.M. Taher A.T. Iron deficiency beyond erythropoiesis: Should we be concerned?.Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2018; 34: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Iron is also required for the activity of ribonucleoside reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of DNA (4Puig S. Ramos-Alonso L. Romero A.M. Martinez-Pastor M.T. The elemental role of iron in DNA synthesis and repair.Metallomics. 2017; 9: 1483-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aconitase, a nonheme iron–sulfur protein is involved in the first step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (5Crooks D.R. Maio N. Lane A.N. Jarnik M. Higashi R.M. Haller R.G. Yang Y. Fan T.W. Linehan W.M. Rouault T.A.

Chem. 2018; 293: 8297-8311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In retina, the visual cycle protein RPE65 is dependent on its iron-binding domain for activity (6Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Mutation of key residues of RPE65 abolishes its enzymatic role as isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Iron is also a redox-active metal that exerts toxicity by generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that attack proteins, lipids, and DNA. For this reason, several mechanisms operate to prevent iron overload or deficiency by regulating Fe import, storage, and export (7Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). For instance, the liver secretes hepcidin into the systemic circulation to reduce blood iron levels. Circulating hepcidin does this by causing the degradation of the cellular iron exporter ferroportin that is located on cell surfaces of intestinal epithelium and macrophages; loss of ferroportin attenuates iron export (8Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Hepcidin regulates cellular iron efflux by binding to ferroportin and inducing its internalization.Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3276) Google Scholar). Null mutations of hepcidin in mice are associated with progressive accumulation of iron in the retina; elevation of ferritin, the iron storage protein; increased ferroportin and subsequent photoreceptor cell degeneration (9Hadziahmetovic M. Song Y. Ponnuru P. Iacovelli J. Hunter A. Haddad N. Beard J. Connor J.R. Vaulont S. Dunaief J.L. Age-dependent retinal iron accumulation and degeneration in hepcidin knockout mice.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2011; 52: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that excessive iron in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of mice deficient in ceruloplasmin (Cp) and hephaestin (Heph) (Cp−/−; Heph−/− mice) (10Wolkow N. Song D. Song Y. Chu S. Hadziahmetovic M. Lee J.C. Iacovelli J. Grieco S. Dunaief J.L. Ferroxidase hephaestin's cell-autonomous role in the retinal pigment epithelium.Am. J. Pathol. 2012; 180: 1614-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is associated with toxic bisretinoid photooxidation and degradation (11Ueda K. Kim H.J. Zhao J. Song Y. Dunaief J.L. Sparrow J.R. Iron promotes oxidative cell death caused by bisretinoids of retina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 4963-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Like hephaestin, ceruloplasmin is a ferroxidase that oxidizes iron from the ferrous (Fe2+, 4 unpaired electrons) to ferric (Fe3+, 5 unpaired electrons) state so that it can be accepted by transferrin in the circulation. RPE cells are subjected to photooxidative stress because of their content of bisretinoids. Bisretinoids are a family of photoreactive vitamin A aldehyde-derived adducts that form nonenzymatically as a by-product of the visual cycle; bisretinoids accumulate in RPE cells with age. These bisretinoid fluorophores present with two-side arms, a long and a short, consisting of conjugated systems of double bonds that are oxidized by both photo-mediated processes (12Wu Y. Yanase E. Feng X. Siegel M.M. Sparrow J.R. Structural characterization of bisretinoid A2E photocleavage products and implications for age-related macular degeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kim H.J. Zhao J. Song Y. Dunaief J.L. Sparrow J.R. Iron promotes oxidative cell death caused by bisretinoids of retina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here in mechanistic studies, we embarked on an examination of RPE iron overload in liver-specific (LS) hepcidin knockout mice and tested for evidence of a photo-assisted Fenton reaction using visible light (14Xian T. Di L. Sun X. Li H. Zhou Y. Yang H.

Lett. 2019; 14: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As noted above, in RPE cells the enzyme Rpe65 is the iron-dependent isomerohydrolase essential for the conversion of all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis retinaldehyde (15Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the retinoid visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); as such RPE65 catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the visual cycle. Thus we also tested for an effect of deferiprone (DFP) treatment on the activity of the visual cycle protein Rpe65. Importantly we discovered that iron levels are elevated in the retina of Abca4−/− mice and in a patient diagnosed with ABCA4-associated disease. Hepcidin that is secreted into the bloodstream by the liver serves to reduce blood iron levels by binding to and bringing about the degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin that is expressed on the surface of cells (8Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Hepcidin regulates cellular iron efflux by binding to ferroportin and inducing its internalization.Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3276) Google Scholar). It has been shown that liver-specific Hepc knockout (LS-Hepc−/−) mice exhibit elevated iron in blood and increased free (labile) iron levels in the retina and RPE cells (16Baumann B.H. Shu W. Song Y. Sterling J. Kozmik Z. Lakhal-Littleton S. Dunaief J.L. Liver-specific, but not retina-specific, hepcidin knockout causes retinal iron accumulation and degeneration.Am. J. Pathol. 2019; 189: 1814-1830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In histological sections through the ONH, LS-Hepc−/− mice presented with thickenings of displaced, stacked, and/or enlarged RPE cells that projected into the subretinal space at multiple locations in posterior retina; all LS-Hepc−/− mice presented with these changes (Fig. 1, B and C). Within these RPE cells, melanin density was markedly reduced. At the positions of these aberrations, the RPE monolayer was discontinued, outer segments were shortened, and photoreceptor cell nuclei spanning the ONL appeared to be reduced. Nevertheless, overall ONL area (calculated as sum of thickness measurements 0.2–1.0 mm from ONH × 0.2 mm) was not different in LS-Hepc−/− mice (7.59 × 104 ± 0.13 μm2) than in wild-type mice (7.26 × 104 ± 0.13 μm2 p > 0.05, t-test). An extension of the RPE monolayer at the edge of the ONH was often visible as a tuft of lightly pigmented cells (Fig. 1A). Atrophy of the optic nerve was not obvious, and the retinal ganglion cell layer was not changed relative to wild-type. In addition to the histological changes, we noted a pronounced peripapillary ring of hyperautofluorescence in 4 of 8 LS-Hepc−/− eyes that were imaged by SW-AF (Fig. 1D). This ring of AF was detectable at age 6 months and was more pronounced in images acquired at age 12 months. This peripapillary hyperautofluorescence could be indicative of increases in known fluorophores, modifications of known fluorophores, or autofluorescence from unknown fluorophores (12Wu Y. Yanase E.

We also sought to determine whether the iron overload in RPE due to loss of liver-produced Hepc is associated with reduced bisretinoid levels. We measured bisretinoids in LS-Hepc−/− mice at 6 months of age using the noninvasive qAF approach. qAF intensity in LS-Hepc−/− mice (0.88 qAF units) versus wild-type mice (0.56 qAF units) did not reach a statistically significant difference at the age of 6 months (Fig. 1E). NIR-AF that originates primarily from RPE melanin was measured in a circular area centered on the ONH and having a diameter of 3 mm. There was no difference between wild-type and LS-Hepc−/− mice. At 12 months of age, however, while peaks attributable to the bisretinoids A2E, iso-A2E, A2-glycerophosphoethanolamine (A2-GPE), A2-dihydropyridine-phosphatidylethanolamine (A2-DHP-PE), and all-trans-retinal dimer phosphatidylethanolamine (atRAL-di-PE) were observed in HPLC chromatograms generated with extracts of wild-type mice, these peaks were greatly diminished or undetectable in the chromatograms acquired from LS-Hepc−/− mice (Fig. 1F). HPLC quantitation of A2E in the LS-Hepc−/− mice revealed a 63% reduction in A2E relative to the wild-type mice (p < 0.01, unpaired two-tailed t-test). The fluorescence emission generated from bisretinoid lipofuscin in the RPE of LS-Hepc knockout mice (age 11, 13, 14.5 months) and in wild-type controls (age 13 months) was recorded at 488, 561, and 640 nm (Fig. 2). The emission maximum recorded from both the mutant and wild-type eyes with 488 nm excitation was 590 nm. The spectra were also similar in shape as was the spectral width at half-maximal intensity (50 nm and 60 nm, LS-Hepc−/− and WT, respectively). At 561 nm excitation the peak emissions recorded from the LS-Hepc−/− and WT mice were red-shifted to 625 nm and the spectral width was narrower (40 nm in both mutant and WT mice) (Fig. 2B). The spectra recorded with 640 nm excitation had little structure within the emission range studied (Fig. 2D). The intensity difference between the mutant and wild-type mice was pronounced. The peak intensity was sevenfold and tenfold greater in the LS-Hepc−/− mice at 488 nm and 561 nm excitation, respectively (Fig. 2B). In mutant mice, auto-fluorescence emission was more intense when recorded at the RPE thickenings versus areas between the thickenings (Fig. 2, C and D). The Fenton reaction can efficiently generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) through the decomposition of H2O2 by Fe2+ (H2O2/Fe2+). We have shown that bisretinoids are oxidized both by photooxidative processes (12Wu Y. Yanase E. Feng X. Siegel M.M. Sparrow J.R.

We note, however, that the production of the hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction depends on continued availability of Fe2+ (ferrous iron). Thus we evaluated the ability of visible light to potentiate the oxidation of bisretinoid, presumably by the photoreduction of Fe3+ (ferric iron) to Fe2+ (ferrous iron) (photo-Fenton process) (14Xian T. Di L. Sun X. Li H. Zhou Y. Yang H.

Int. 2017; 24: 1152-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When A2E was incubated with FeSO4 and H2O2 at 37 °C for 30 min and then irradiated with 430 nm light (15 s) at an intensity of 290.6 lux (H2O2/Fe2+/light), UPLC quantitation of A2E revealed a 86% reduction in A2E as the substrate (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's multiple comparisons test) (Fig. 3A). Incubation of A2E with FeSO4 and H2O2 in the absence of light was associated with a less pronounced decline (36%) in A2E (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's multiple comparisons test), and A2E was decreased by 59% with irradiation at 430 nm alone (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test). Oxidation of A2E was also demonstrated by the detection of oxidized A2E (m/z 592 + 16). After irradiation at 430 nm the proportion of oxidized A2E in the sample increased 2.4 times compared with unirradiated A2E (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's multiple comparisons test) while irradiation in the presence of FeSO4 and H2O2 was associated with a 1.9 times increase in oxidized A2E (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's multiple comparisons test) (Fig. 3B). Within cells, the majority of iron is stored in ferritin, a cytosolic protein (24Picard E. Daruich A. Youale J. Courtois Y. Behar-Cohen F. From rust to quantum biology: The role of iron in retina physiopathology.Cells. 2020; 9: 705Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We measured iron levels in the RPE and neural retina of Abca4−/− and wild-type mice both pigmented and albino using a colorimetric assay based on ferrozine, a water-soluble chelator of Fe2+ (25Zhao X. Ting S.M. Liu C.H. Sun G. Kruzel M. Roy-O'Reilly M. Aronowski J. Neutrophil polarization by IL-27 as a therapeutic target for intracerebral hemorrhage.Nat.

Nutr. 2017; 60: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Iron levels were higher in RPE than in neural retina, and this difference was significant in agouti Abca4−/− and albino Abca4−/− mice (p < 0.0001; for agouti Abca4−/−, p < 0.05 for albino Abca4−/− two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 4A). It is especially noteworthy that iron levels in RPE were higher in agouti and albino Abca4−/− mice than in RPE cells harvested from wild-type C57BL/6J and C57BL/6c2j mice (p < 0.0001, for agouti Abca4−/−, p < 0.001 for albino Abca4−/−two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 4A). While iron is considered to also be stored in association with melanin (24Picard E. Daruich A. Youale J. Courtois Y. Behar-Cohen F. From rust to quantum biology: The role of iron in retina physiopathology.Cells. 2020; 9: 705Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), our measurements of iron levels were not significantly different in the RPE of albino C57BL/6c2j mice as compared with black-coated C57BL/6J mice (p > 0.05 two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 4A). Further indication of retinal iron overload was provided by measuring Tfrc mRNA levels in isolated neural retina and RPE by real-time qPCR. Relative Tfrc mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the neural retina of Abca4−/− mice (p < 0.001) and decreased but not significantly in the RPE of the Abca4−/− mice (Fig. 4B). This is additional evidence of increased intracellular iron levels in the RPE and NSR of the Abca4−/− mice. To further examine iron accumulation in the retina of Abca4−/− mice, we assessed retinal levels of the iron storage protein ferritin light chain (ferritin-L) using immunohistochemistry. The RPE and photoreceptor layers stained positively for ferritin-L in both the wildtype and Abca4−/− 8-month-old mice (Fig. 4C) but quantitation shows significantly increased ferritin-L positivity in the RPE and photoreceptor layers of the Abca4−/− mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4D). By immunocytochemical staining using mouse antihuman ferritin-light chain, we also observed increased ferritin, (indicative of increased iron) that was localized to RPE in cryostat sections of the eyes from patients diagnosed with STGD1 (Fig. 5). The FDA-approved iron chelator DFP is orally absorbed and cell-permeable and known to reduce serum iron and intracellular iron levels in the retina (11Ueda K. Kim H.J. Zhao J. Song Y. Dunaief J.L.

Sci. 2014; 55: 4525-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DFP not only binds iron, it also oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+, thus impeding the effects of Fe2+ the major catalyst of free radical damage to cells (29Timoshnikov V.A. Kobzeva T.V. Polyakov N.E. Kontoghiorghes G.J. Inhibition of Fe(2+)- and Fe(3+)- induced hydroxyl radical production by the iron-chelating drug deferiprone.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 78: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We treated BALB/cJ mice with oral DFP from age 2 months to 4 months and observed a 25% increase in the bisretinoid A2E and a 28% increase in A2-GPE (Fig. 6A). We also measured bisretinoid noninvasively (30Sparrow J.R. Blonska A. Flynn E. Duncker T. Greenberg J.P. Secondi R. Ueda K. Delori F.C. Quantitative fundus autofluorescence in mice: Correlation with HPLC quantitation of RPE lipofuscin and measurement of retina outer nuclear layer thickness.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2013; 54: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) by employing in vivo fundus autofluorescence after only 1 month of DFP treatment. With this shorter duration of treatment, the difference in fluorophore accumulation between DFP-treated and untreated mice was less pronounced (p > 0.05, two-tailed t-test). We surmised that the changes in levels of bisretinoid were indicative of DFP-mediated reduction in endogenous iron-associated degradation of A2E and A2-GPE. The rate limiting enzyme of the visual cycle is Rpe65, the isomerohydrolase essential for the conversion of all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis retinaldehyde (15Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the retinoid visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12413-12418Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Rpe65 has an iron binding domain and the catalytic activity of Rpe65 is dependent on the availability of iron (6Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Mutation of key residues of RPE65 abolishes its enzymatic role as isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus we examined for an effect of iron chelation on steady-state levels of retinoids in dark-adapted BALB/cJ mice (age 2 months) that were treated with DFP in drinking water for 1 month. BALB/cJ mice were used for these experiments because the latter mice carry wild-type Rpe65 (Rpe65-Leucine 450) while C57BL/6J mice carry the methionine variant. No differences in DFP-treated versus untreated mice were observed for 11-cis-retinal, all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinyl ester, 11-cis-retinol, and 11-cis-retinyl ester. However, inexplicably all-trans-retinal was more abundant in the DFP-treated mice (Fig. 6B). We also measured the recovery of 11-cis-retinal levels 1 h after exposure to bleaching light in dark-adapted mice (BALB/cJ, age 3 months). UPLC measurement of retinoids in mice maintained in darkness for 1 h after the bleach revealed that in mice treated with DFP for 1 month, 11-cis-retinal, 11-cis-retinol, and all-trans-retinol were not different than in the untreated BALB/cJ mice (p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA, and Sidak’s multiple comparison test). In the DFP-treated mice, there was, however, a small increase in all-trans-retinyl ester (8% increase) and a 27% decrease in 11-cis-retinyl ester, both of which reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6D). For an additional test of iron chelation on the visual cycle, we also compared DFP-treated and untreated mice in terms of the time to recovery of dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes after photobleaching (90% bleach). The DFP-treated and nontreated dark adapted mice exhibited similar postbleach recovery of the b-wave amplitude (Fig. 6C). STGD1 is an early onset monogenic disease caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. The ABCA4 protein is located in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells and assists in the removal of retinaldehyde by flipping N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (NRPE), the Schiff base that forms by reaction of retinaldehyde with phosphatidylethanolamine in the disc membrane (31Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. Retinal stimulates ATP hydrolysis by purified and reconstituted ABCR, the photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter responsible for Stargardt disease.J. Biol.

ABCA4 insufficiency in STGD1 allows for reaction of NRPE with a second molecule of retinaldehyde thereby leading to the formation of bisretinoid. The latter fluorophores are subsequently transferred to RPE within phagocytosed outer segment discs. Evidence available from mouse models and clinical studies of ABCA4-related disease indicates that accelerated bisretinoid formation is the cause of retinal degeneration in STGD1 (22Ueda K. Zhao J.

Despite men are the chief decision-makers and economically dominant in Ethiopia, the impact of their involvement on maternal health services utilization is not clear. This study aimed to assess the association between male involvement and women’s use of institutional delivery, and factors influencing male partners’ involvement in institutional delivery. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted between March and May, 2019. A total of 477 married men who have children less than one year of age were interviewed. Face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire were used for data collection. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were carried out. SPSS version 23 was used for data analysis. Results Overall 181 (37.9%) husbands/partners were involved in institutional delivery for the most recent child birth. Male partners involvement in institutional delivery was strongly associated with an increased odds of attending institutional delivery by spouse [AOR: 66.2, 95% CI: 24.8, 177.0]. Education [AOR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18–0.59], knowledge on maternal health [AOR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.11–2.50], favourable attitude towards institutional delivery [AOR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23–2.71], and no fear while supporting spouse [AOR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.28–5.50] were positively associated with male partners involvement in institutional delivery. Conclusion Male partner’s involvement in institutional delivery was inadequate. This study reported a significant beneficial impact of male involvement on maternal health through improved utilisation of institutional delivery. Therefore, maternal health interventions should target husbands as consumers of maternal health services, and healthcare/government policies that isolate or discourage men from having active engagement in maternal health should be improved."

Protein synthesis is the cellular process targeted by many commercial antibiotics. It has always been a focal point of modern antibacterial drug discovery (1Fischbach M.A. Walsh C.T. Antibiotics for emerging pathogens.Science. 2009; 325: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), a family of ∼20 essential enzymes, ligate amino acids to the corresponding tRNAs that decode messenger RNA to produce protein at the translating macromolecular ribosome (2Schimmel P.R.

Tuberculosis (TB) caused by the single agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has surpassed AIDS/HIV, becoming a leading infectious disease worldwide (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis). Most TB drugs were discovered in the past century and are losing efficacy because of the resistance inevitably arisen in bacteria. New chemical scaffold with novel inhibition mechanism against Mtb is being actively sought. An oxaborole compound GSK3036656 that inhibits Mtb leucyl-tRNA synthetase is currently undergoing clinical trial (5Tenero D. Derimanov G. Carlton A. Tonkyn J. Davies M. Cozens S. Gresham S.

A functional PheRS is typically made of two heterodimers (αβ)2, with a whole molecular weight around 250 kD. In Mtb H37Rv genome, two consecutive essential genes, Rv1649 and Rv1650 (pheST), encode the protein subunits (7Dejesus M.A. Gerrick E.R. Xu W. Park S.W. Long J.E. Boutte C.C. Rubin E.J.

Like other aaRSs, PheRS catalyzes the formation of phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe in two steps: (1) activation of phenylalanine (Phe) by hydrolyzing ATP to form Phe-AMP and pyrophosphate (PPi) and (2) subsequent transfer of Phe to the 2′-OH group of adenosine ribose at the 3′-terminal of tRNAPhe and simultaneous release of AMP. In addition to the synthetic site on the α subunit, PheRS has a dedicated domain on the β subunit that can hydrolyze improperly charged tRNA, for example, tyrosinyl-tRNAPhe, to maintain the fidelity of aminoacylation and translation (8Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. Post-transfer editing in vitro and in vivo by the β subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). From a drug discovery standing point, PheRS synthetic activity that involves binding of the three substrates and the editing activity could all be targetable. PheRS should also allow specific binding of compounds that allosterically regulate the enzymatic activities because of its size, molecular mechanism, and other miscellaneous functions (9Lechler A. Kreutzer R. The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase specifically binds DNA.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PheRS was a major antibacterial target in a number of screening programs (10Gallant P. Finn J. Keith D. Wendler P.

To the best of our knowledge, most of them were not for TB drug except one that identified a fungal natural product isopatulin able to inhibit the growth of Mtb strain H37Rv (18Wang L.-N. Di W.-J.

Recently, PheRS from Plasmodium falciparum, which is another pathogen of global health concern, has become genetically and chemically validated target for antiparasitics (19Cowell A.N. Winzeler E.A. Advances in omics-based methods to identify novel targets for malaria and other parasitic protozoan infections.Genome Med. 2019; 11: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Potent PheRS inhibitors with novel mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels were discovered (20Kato N. Comer E. Sakata-Kato T. Sharma A. Sharma M. Maetani M. Bastien J. Brancucci N.M. Bittker J.A. Corey V. Clarke D. Derbyshire E.R. Dornan G.L. Duffy S. Eckley S. et al.Diversity-oriented synthesis yields novel multistage antimalarial inhibitors.Nature. 2016; 538: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), prompting us to initiate a hit discovery campaign targeting Mtb PheRS with new assays and diversity compound libraries, such as recent collection of pharmacologically relevant small molecules (21Janes J. Young M.E. Chen E. Rogers N.H. Burgstaller-Muehlbacher S. Hughes L.D. Love M.S. Hull M.V. Kuhen K.L. Woods A.K. Joseph S.B. Petrassi H.M. McNamara C.W. Tremblay M.S.

A. 2018; 115: 10750-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this work, Mtb PheRS enzyme was enzymatically characterized and analyzed with a synthesized reference compound GDI05-001. High-throughput screening (HTS) assay was adopted to screen a Selleck-2148 library against the PheRS. One screening hit, PF-3845, was confirmed to inhibit Mtb PheRS with Ki ∼ 0.73 μM. It is a well-developed inhibitor of human fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Its minimum concentration required to inhibit >90% growth of WT H37Rv (MIC) is ∼24 μM, and the antibiotic activity increased against an engineered strain Mtb pheS–FDAS, which expresses PheS contained a C-terminal degradation tag Flag-DAS. The mechanism of inhibition was studied with enzyme kinetics and crystal structures. PF-3845 was shown to be a non-nucleoside bisubstrate competitive inhibitor of the PheRS. The results will aid future medicinal chemistry effort to improve the potency, reduce the toxicity, and develop combination therapy with TB drugs. In Mtb H37Rv genome, pheST genes encode the α and β subunits of PheRS, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of PheS is ∼16 to 30% identical to human cytoplasmic hFARS1α or mitochondrial hFARS2. The mitochondrial PheRS does not have a β subunit. The identity of PheT versus hFARS1β is below 12%. Three conserved signature motifs of class II aaRS are identified in Mtb PheS sequence (Fig. S1). The ∼3.5 kb pheST was synthesized based on the DNA sequences in GenBank. After sequencing confirmation, the DNA was cloned for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Several constructs were made for copurification of the heterodimeric protein. The best one, pET30a-Mtb PheRS-CHis, under optimized fermentation conditions, gave a yield of ∼1 to 2 mg/l, with the highest purity possible after optimized purification steps (Fig. S2). We also constructed, overexpressed, and partially purified an Mtb tRNAGAAPhe from E. coli (see Experimental procedures section). It was reported that more than ∼90% of the enriched and partially purified tRNA fraction could be the overexpressed tRNA species (22Martin F. Eriani G. Eiler S. Moras D. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J.

We used standard aminoacylation assay that detects the charging of 14C-labeled Phe onto tRNAPhe to confirm the purified protein and tRNA were indeed functional together. Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters of Mtb PheRS were measured with the tRNA aminoacylation assay and shown in Figure S3. The Km's and kcat's generally agree with previous reports on Mtbs and other bacterial PheRSs although some discrepancies are noted. For example, we and others found the Km with regard to Phe at ∼68.0 ± 6.6 μM, but this is much higher than the ∼1 to 7 μM of other bacterial PheRSs (14Zhang Z.-M. Sun Y. Zhao L.-L. Wang L.-N.

The parameters are subject to revision in further research of PheRS biology and aromatic amino acid metabolism. Nonradioactive biochemical assays were adopted for screening for PheRS inhibitor and the subsequent analysis of mode of inhibition. In a continuous spectrophotometric assay (26Lloyd A.J. Thomann H.U. Ibba M. Söll D. A broadly applicable continuous spectrophotometric assay for measuring aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2886-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the PPi production is coupled to generation of phosphate by inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase); the phosphate then serves as a substrate in a purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase)–catalyzed reaction to cleave nucleoside compound 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) into ribose-1-phosphate and base 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine that has absorbance at 360 nm. When optimizing the so-called PPi production assay, we noticed that the A360 readout is tRNA dependent as expected, meaning no PPi was released in the absence of tRNA (Fig. 1A). PheRS concentration at 100 nM per reaction gave a linear response in the first 6 min of the progression. By measuring the initial velocity of PPi production, the apparent Km, ATP with regard to ATP was found to be 162.50 ± 11.62 μM, Km, Phe 18.10 ± 2.44 μM, and Km, tRNA 0.13 ± 0.05 μg/ml (Fig. 1, B–D). These Km's were used as references in the following screening and hit confirmation. To screen compound library, we used a commercial kit Kinase-Glo, which measures the remaining amount of ATP in a PheRS reaction. Readout is luminescent signal generated by luciferase-catalyzed oxidation of luciferin in the presence of the ATP. The readout is thus inversely correlated with the amount of PheRS activity. Because ATP at 1 μM to initiate the PheRS reaction is far below its Km, the assay is presumably biased toward ATP-competitive inhibitors (27Baragaña B. Forte B. Choi R. Hewitt S.N. Bueren-Calabuig J.A. Pisco J.P. Peet C. Dranow D.M. Robinson D.A. Jansen C. Norcross N.R. Vinayak S. Anderson M. Brooks C.F.

We optimized the assay in 384-well HTS format and determined the amount of PheRS per reaction (Fig. S4). Reaction endpoint was chosen to be at the first 2 h. A known bacterial PheRS inhibitor (11Beyer D. Kroll H.P. Endermann R. Schiffer G. Siegel S. Bauser M. Pohlmann J. Brands M. Ziegelbauer K. Haebich D. Eymann C. Brötz-Oesterhelt H. New class of bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors with high potency and broad-spectrum activity.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was synthesized as reference compound, named GDI05-001 (NMR and MS data in Supporting Information). Its IC50 against Mtb PheRS was determined to be 1.72 ± 0.13 μM. A Selleck Bioactive Collection purchased before 2018 contains 2148 small molecules with validated biological and pharmacological activities. The library was screened in seven plates, which showed mean robust Z′ at 0.756 to 0.862. When the cutoff was set to 70% inhibition compared with no-enzyme control reaction, four initial hits were identified (Fig. S5), giving a hit rate ∼0.19% (Fig. 2A). A top hit PF-3845 is reportedly a potent covalent inhibitor of human enzyme FAAH with Ki calculated to be 0.23 ± 0.03 μM (28Ahn K. Johnson D.S. Mileni M. Beidler D. Long J.Z. McKinney M.K. Weerapana E. Sadagopan N. Liimatta M. Smith S.E. Lazerwith S. Stiff C. Kamtekar S. Bhattacharya K. Zhang Y. et al.Discovery and characterization of a highly selective FAAH inhibitor that reduces inflammatory pain.Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and many analogous compounds are in public database. PF-3845 and an analog PF-04457845 were repurchased (Fig. 2B). The IC50s of the two compounds were determined with the two assays and other similar assays (29Cestari I. Stuart K. A spectrophotometric assay for quantitative measurement of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity.J. Biomol. Screen. 2013; 18: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. S6). By the Kinase-Glo assay, the IC50 of PF-3845 was 2.65 ± 0.19 μM (hillslope −0.86 ± 0.05) and the IC50 of PF-04457845 was 9.76 ± 0.73 μM (hillslope −0.81 ± 0.05) (Fig. 2C). PF-3845, at concentrations up to 20 μM, did not inhibit the activities of PPase, PNPase, and luciferase that were used in the coupled reactions (Fig. S7). The inhibition was observed only when Mtb PheRS was present in the coupled reactions. Thus, we identified investigational drug PF-3845 as a new PheRS inhibitor. PF-3845 apparently has a scaffold different from previously known PheRS inhibitors. The mode of inhibition of PF-3845 was analyzed with enzyme kinetics in comparison with GDI05-001. PPi production assay was used to record the progress of PheRS reaction setups, which had excessive amounts of two substrates but varying concentration of a third substrate at various inhibitor concentrations. Each dataset was fit into Michaelis–Menten equation; the resulting Lineweaver–Burk plot of a set of experiments with regard to the third substrate was examined for a pattern of competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or mixed inhibition mode. Both GDI05-001 and PF-3845 are clearly Phe competitive inhibitors of PheRS as the presence of inhibitor only affected Km but not Vmax (Fig. 3A). In the Phe-competitive mode, Ki of GDI05-001 is 0.20 ± 0.01 μM and Ki of PF-3845 is 1.70 ± 0.11 μM, determined with the PPi production assay. It was reported that GDI05-001 was noncompetitive regarding ATP (11Beyer D. Kroll H.P. Endermann R. Schiffer G. Siegel S. Bauser M. Pohlmann J. Brands M. Ziegelbauer K. Haebich D. Eymann C. Brötz-Oesterhelt H. New class of bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors with high potency and broad-spectrum activity.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and we had similar observation. In contrast, PF-3845 is more likely in a mixed inhibition mode with regard to ATP over a range of PF-3845 concentrations (Fig. 3B). PF-3845 is an uncompetitive inhibitor with regard to tRNAPhe (Fig. 3C). Crystallographic effort was made to first solve the structures of Mtb PheRS apo protein and its complex with GDI05-001 at 2.83 and 2.71 Å, respectively. Like other bacterial PheRS structures, Mtb PheRS is an (αβ)2 heterotetramer. The α subunit contains catalytic site, and β subunit contains editing site (Fig. 4A). Except for the N-terminal 74 residues of α subunit, all other residues were constructed. The N-terminal region of Thermophilus thermus PheRS was reported to form a coiled-coil domain, playing a critical role in interaction with tRNA (30Moor N. Kotik-Kogan O. Tworowski D. Sukhanova M. Safro M. The crystal structure of the ternary complex of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase with tRNAPhe and a phenylalanyl-adenylate analogue reveals a conformational switch of the CCA end.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10572-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was flexible and invisible in the solved Mtb PheRS when no tRNA was included. The binding mode of GDI05-001 was illustrated by cocrystallization (Fig. 4B). When looking into the catalytic site of the α subunit, we found that besides the amino acid (Phe) pocket and ATP pocket, there is an additional pocket between the two pockets (Fig. 4C). The key residues forming the additional pocket are mainly hydrophobic, including F143, F148, A154, H175, F254, F255, P256, and F257. GDI05-001 occupies the Phe pocket and the additional pocket, whereas the ATP pocket is empty (Fig. 4, C and D). The phenylsulfonamide group of GDI05-001 extends much deeper into the amino acid pocket than a Phe could. In this pocket, strong π–π stackings can be seen between the phenyl rings of GDI05-001 and F255/F257. Three hydrogen bonds are formed between the urea group of GDI05-001 and the side chains of E217 and S177. In addition, the sulfonamide oxygen forms interactions with the side chain of Q215 and the main chain of G282 and G307. The indole moiety of GDI05-001 is bended almost vertically to the phenylsulfonamide and extends into the additional pocket, which has strong hydrophobic interaction with the protein. Compared with the apo form, two major differences were observed. First, in the apo form structure, the side chain of F257 has two alternative conformations with one conformation that occupies the deeper amino acid pocket, and the side chain of Q180 also stretches toward the pocket. While in the liganded structure, F257 adapts only one rigid conformation, which occupies out of the pocket. Together with the rotation of Q180, they constitute a much deeper amino acid pocket of the complex than the apo form (Fig. S8). Second, the loop 148 to 160 undergoes a conformational change upon GDI05-001 binding and has much higher B factors than the apo structure, indicating it is more flexible when GDI05-001 binds (Fig. S9). On the other hand, preliminary analysis using a deep learning–based docking platform Orbital showed that PF-3845 might have two major putative binding conformations among the top-ranking poses (Fig. S10). In one conformation, PF-3845 is bended to interact with the additional pocket outside Phe pocket by π–π interactions. Another possibility is that PF-3845 could extend deep into the ATP pocket. Further work is needed to validate which binding mode is dominated. To illustrate the binding mode of PF-3845, we obtained the cocrystal structure of Mtb PheRS in complex with PF-3845 at a resolution of 2.3 Å. Initial Fo–Fc map of PF-3845 (along with GDI05-001) is presented in Figure S11. PF-3845 binds clearly in the amino acid pocket as well as the ATP pocket, whereas the additional pocket is empty (Fig. 4C). An extensive hydrophilic and hydrophobic interaction network in two pockets can be found between PF-3845 and Mtb PheRS. Like the phenylsulfonamide group of GDI05-001, the 4-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyl group and phenyl ring of PF-3845 inserts deeply into the amino acid pocket. Two strong π–π stackings also can be seen between the phenyl rings of PF-3845 and F255/F257 residues of the PheRS (Fig. 4E). A hydrogen bond is formed between the amide of the trifluoromethylpyridinyl group and the main chain oxygen of G218. Two more hydrogen bonds are formed between the oxygen linker and the side chain of E217 and the main chain of F306. Unlike GDI05-001, the other end of PF-3845, including the 3-aminopyridine and piperidine groups, completely inserts into the ATP pocket (Fig. 4, C and E). The carbonyl group of PF-3845 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of G309. The amide of 3-aminopyridine forms a water-mediated interaction with the side chain of E311 and the main chain of E311/R312. The 3-aminopyridine of PF-3845 also forms a strong π–π stacking with F213 and a π–cation interaction with R312. Surprisingly, a sulfate ion (SO42−) is found near PF-3845 to bridge the interaction between the amide linker of PF-3845 and R201/R312 of the PheRS. Compared with the apo form, the side chain of R312 in the complex rotates nearly 90° to get closer to the compound. The SO42− most likely stabilizes R312, which in turn forms the π–cation interaction with the 3-aminopyridine. When this is compared with two other structures, hFARS2 complexed with Phe–AMP and E. coli PheRS (EcPheRS) complexed with Phe and AMP, the SO42− occupies an approximate space of AMP phosphate group in either case (Fig. 5). In the hFARS2–PheAMP cocrystal structure (31Klipcan L. Levin I. Kessler N. Moor N. Finarov I. Safro M. The tRNA-induced conformational activation of human mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.Structure. 2008; 16: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the PheAMP forms hydrogen bond with R143 that is corresponding to R201 in Mtb PheRS. In the EcPheRS–AMP cocrystal structure, the AMP forms hydrogen bond with R301 corresponding to R312 in Mtb PheRS. Overall, the SO42− here engages R201 and R312 in the ATP pocket and enables multiple interactions to facilitate PF-3845 binding into the ATP pocket of Mtb PheRS. Although SO42− has been found at the active site of several other aaRS structures, none of them contributes to the binding of a ligand as in the case of PF-3845 (32Itoh Y. Sekine S. Kuroishi C. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S.

To confirm the role of the SO42−, we reperformed and analyzed the PF-3845 inhibition kinetics with 5 mM (NH4)2SO4 in the PheRS enzyme reaction. This time, PF-3845 clearly acted as an ATP competitive inhibitor (Fig. 3D), with the Ki calculated to be 0.73 ± 0.055 μM, which is lower than Ki 1.08 ± 0.245 μM with regard to ATP when SO42− was absent (Fig. 3B). The experiment demonstrated that sulfate ion increased the binding of PF-3845, making it a true bisubstrate compet"
https://openalex.org/W3120383433,"The development of a targeted therapy would significantly improve the treatment of periodontitis and its associated diseases including Alzheimer Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases. Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) from the oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Prevotella intermedia represent attractive target enzymes for small-molecule inhibitor development, as their action is likely to stabilize essential periplasmic and outer membrane proteins by N-terminal pyroglutamination. In contrast to other microbial QCs that utilize so-called type I enzymes, these oral pathogens possess sequences corresponding to type II QCs, observed hitherto only in animals. However, whether differences between these bacteroidal QCs and animal QCs are sufficient to enable development of selective inhibitors is not clear. To learn more, we recombinantly expressed all three QCs. They exhibit comparable catalytic efficiencies and are inhibited by metal chelators. Crystal structures of the enzymes from P. gingivalis (PgQC) and T. forsythia (TfQC) reveal a tertiary structure composed of an eight-stranded β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices, typical of animal type II QCs. In each case, an active site Zn ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by conserved residues. Nevertheless, significant differences to mammalian enzymes are found around the active site of the bacteroidal enzymes. Application of a PgQC-selective inhibitor described here for the first time results in growth inhibition of two P. gingivalis clinical isolates in a dose dependent manner. The insights gained by these studies will assist in the development of highly specific small-molecule bacteroidal QC inhibitors, paving the way for alternative therapies against periodontitis and associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3142952004,"Background Dietary diversity has continued to receive a global attention among pregnant women as they have been considered susceptible to malnutrition because of their increased nutrient demands. Thus, a variety of foodstuffs in their diet are necessary for ensuring the appropriateness of their nutrient consumptions. This study, therefore assessed the dietary diversity practice and its determinants among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at Wachemo University Nigist Eleni Mohammed memorial referral hospital, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out on 303 participants from May 1 to June 15, 2019 using a systematic random sampling technique. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS (version24.0). Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to decide the association of each explanatory variable with the outcome variable. Odds ratio with their 95% confidence intervals was calculated to identify the presence and strength of association, and statistical significance was declared at p &lt; 0.05. Results The overall prevalence of adequate dietary diversity practices was observed to be 42.6%. The determinants of dietary diversity practice included earning of a monthly income ≥2000 Ethiopian birr (AOR = 1.62; 95%CI:1.19–2.85), maternal educational level (AOR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.05–6.12), educational status of partner (AOR = 2.45; 95% CI:1.20, 9.57), having a partner who was a government employee (AOR = 4; 95% CI:2.18–7.21), and the receiving of nutritional information (AOR = 1.35; 95% CI: 3.39–6.94). Conclusions The study indicated that the overall consumption of adequate dietary diversity practice was found to be low. Therefore, increasing household income, enhancing nutritional related information, advancing the academic level of both wife and her partner is essential to improve women’s dietary diversity practice."
https://openalex.org/W3148506744,"Objective Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). However, the fecal transplant’s causal components translating into clearance of the CDI are yet to be identified. The commensal bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii may be of great interest in this context, since it is one of the most common species of the healthy gut microbiota and produces metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties. Although there is mounting evidence that F . prausnitzii is an important regulator of intestinal homeostasis, data about its role in CDI and FMT are relatively scarce. Methods Stool samples from patients with recurrent CDI were collected to investigate the relative abundance of F . prausnitzii before and after FMT. Twenty-one patients provided fecal samples before the FMT procedure, at 2 weeks post-FMT, and at 2–4 months post-FMT. The relative abundance of F . prausnitzii was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results The abundance of F . prausnitzii was elevated in samples (N = 9) from donors compared to pre-FMT samples (N = 15) from patients (adjusted P&lt;0.001). No significant difference in the abundance of F . prausnitzii between responders (N = 11) and non-responders (N = 4) was found before FMT (P = 0.85). In patients with CDI, the abundance of F . prausnitzii significantly increased in the 2 weeks post-FMT samples (N = 14) compared to the pre-FMT samples (N = 15, adjusted P&lt;0.001). The increase persisted 2–4 months post-FMT (N = 15) compared to pre-FMT samples (N = 15) (adjusted P&lt;0.001). Conclusions FMT increases the relative abundance of F . prausnitzii in patients with recurrent CDI, and this microbial shift remains several months later. The baseline abundance of F . prausnitzii in donors or recipients was not associated with future treatment response, although a true predictive capacity cannot be excluded because of the limited sample size. Further studies are needed to discern whether F . prausnitzii plays an active role in the resolution of CDI."
https://openalex.org/W3147690005,"Objective To examine the health care costs associated with mental disorders and subthreshold mental disorders within a nationally representative sample of children and adolescents in Australia. Method Data were derived from the Young Minds Matter Survey (N = 6,310). Mental disorders were classified using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV. Participant data were linked to administrative data on health care costs. Adjusted generalized linear regression models and two-part models were used to estimate mean differences in costs between those with a mental disorder or subthreshold disorder and those without. Results Costs associated with health care attendances and medications were higher for children and adolescents with mental disorders and subthreshold mental disorders compared to those without a mental disorder. The additional population health care costs due to mental disorders amounted to AUD$234 million annually in children and adolescents, of which approximately 16% was attributed to out-of-pocket costs. Findings showed that those with subthreshold mental disorders or comorbid mental disorders have substantial additional costs of Medicare-funded medical and pharmaceutical services. Conclusion and implication Mental disorders in children and adolescents are associated with significant health care costs. Further research is needed to ensure that this population is receiving effective and efficient care."
https://openalex.org/W3150513537,"Much evidence suggests that Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest were connected through at least three dispersion routes in the past: the Eastern route, the central route, and the Western route. However, few studies have assessed the use of these routes based on multiple species. Here we present a compilation of mammal species that potentially have dispersed between the two forest regions and which may serve to investigate these connections. We evaluate the present-day geographic distributions of mammals occurring in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest and the likely connective routes between these forests. We classified the species per habitat occupancy (strict forest specialists, species that prefer forest habitat, or generalists) and compiled the genetic data available for each species. We found 127 mammalian species presently occurring in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest for which, substantial genetic data was available. Hence, highlighting their potential for phylogeographic studies investigating the past connections between the two forests. Differently from what was previously proposed, the present-day geographic distribution of mammal species found in both Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest points to more species in the eastern portion of the dry diagonal (and adjoining forested habitats). The Central route was associated with the second most species. Although it remains to be seen how this present-day geography reflects the paleo dispersal routes, our results show the potential of using mammal species to investigate and bring new insights about the past connections between Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest."
https://openalex.org/W3120199542,"In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, multidrug and toxic-compound extrusion (MATE) transporters catalyze the efflux of a broad range of cytotoxic compounds, including human-made antibiotics and anticancer drugs. MATEs are secondary-active antiporters, i.e., their drug-efflux activity is coupled to, and powered by, the uptake of ions down a preexisting transmembrane electrochemical gradient. Key aspects of this mechanism, however, remain to be delineated, such as its ion specificity and stoichiometry. We previously revealed the existence of a Na+-binding site in a MATE transporter from Pyroccocus furiosus (PfMATE) and hypothesized that this site might be broadly conserved among prokaryotic MATEs. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis by analyzing VcmN and ClbM, which along with PfMATE are the only three prokaryotic MATEs whose molecular structures have been determined at atomic resolution, i.e. better than 3 Å. Reinterpretation of existing crystallographic data and molecular dynamics simulations indeed reveal an occupied Na+-binding site in the N-terminal lobe of both structures, analogous to that identified in PfMATE. We likewise find this site to be strongly selective against K+, suggesting it is mechanistically significant. Consistent with these computational results, DEER spectroscopy measurements for multiple doubly-spin-labeled VcmN constructs demonstrate Na+-dependent changes in protein conformation. The existence of this binding site in three MATE orthologs implicates Na+ in the ion-coupled drug-efflux mechanisms of this class of transporters. These results also imply that observations of H+-dependent activity likely stem either from a site elsewhere in the structure, or from H+ displacing Na+ under certain laboratory conditions, as has been noted for other Na+-driven transport systems.

The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in major human microbial pathogens is an increasingly alarming public-health threat. Examples include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and HIV (1Clavel F. Hance A.J. HIV drug resistance.N. Engl. J.

Among other cellular mechanisms, MDR is greatly fostered by innate mechanisms that enable bacteria to expel a broad range of cytotoxic compounds out of the cell (4Higgins C.F. Multiple molecular mechanisms for multidrug resistance transporters.Nature. 2007; 446: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 5Poole K. Efflux pumps as antimicrobial resistance mechanisms.Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 162-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). So-called MDR efflux pumps are the class of membrane transporters that specifically provide this kind of defense. These transporters deplete the cytosolic concentration of human-made antimicrobial drugs as well as natural immunologic compounds, thus protecting their intracellular targets. Accordingly, these membrane transporters are considered a potential target for pharmacological interventions against MDR (6Duraes F. Pinto M. Sousa E. Medicinal chemistry updates on bacterial efflux pump modulators.Curr. Med. Chem. 2018; 25: 6030-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

Structures of multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters and their mechanistic implications.Channels. 2016; 10: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This very limited understanding no doubt hampers the development of novel potential inhibitors against an important class of MDR proteins. From bacteria to plants to mammals, MATE transporters catalyze the efflux of a variety of xenobiotics, most of which are hydrophobic and weakly cationic. These compounds are able to enter the cell by diffusing across the cytoplasmic membrane, following their concentration gradient and often driven by the transmembrane electric field. MATEs counter this deleterious unregulated uptake by catalyzing the translocation of these substances back to the cell exterior (or the periplasm in gram-negative bacteria). To activate this uphill process, MATEs are believed to couple their molecular mechanism to the uptake of Na+ or H+, thus harnessing the electrochemical potential of these ions to power drug efflux. Structurally, MATE transporters consist of two distinct domains of six transmembrane helices each (TM1–TM6 and TM7–TM12); these two domains, referred hereafter as N- and C-lobes, have the same topology with respect to the membrane plane but are symmetrically arranged with respect to its perpendicular (11Lu M.

Like other secondary-active transporters, MATEs appear to operate according to the alternating-access model (13Jardetzky O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps.Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In this model, a transporter cycles between two major conformational states, each of which exposes ion and substrate binding sites to one or other side of the membrane, but not both concurrently.

In these structures the N- and C-lobes adopt a V-like conformation, i.e., they are in contact only on the intracellular side and project away from each other on the extracellular side, exposing a large cavity to the exterior. A recent structure of PfMATE (23Zakrzewska S. Mehdipour A.R. Malviya V.N. Nonaka T. Koepke J. Muenke C. Hausner W. Hummer G. Safarian S. Michel H. Inward-facing conformation of a multidrug resistance MATE family transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As mentioned, MATEs are driven either by Na+ or H+ gradients, like most secondary-active transport systems. However, in many instances their ion specificity and stoichiometry remain to be conclusively established, and little is known about the mechanisms that couple ion binding to the interconversion between outward- and inward-open states or to substrate binding and release. NorM-VP and NorM-NG were the first MATEs reported to be driven by Na+ (24Morita Y. Kataoka A. Shiota S. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T.

It is important to note, however, that many of the functional studies of MATE transporters are based on live cells, rather than controlled reconstituted systems, implying that ion-dependent effects resulting from other membrane systems or from adaptive cellular mechanisms cannot be ruled out. Based on structures alone, it has also been difficult to clarify the matter of ion specificity, as the resolution of much of the data available does not permit an unambiguous interpretation. Likewise, crystallographic assays whereby electron-rich cations such as Cs+ and Rb+ are used as reporters can be misleading, as these ions do not in fact mimic Na+ but might displace H+ from electronegative sites. In two recent studies of PfMATE and NorM-VC, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (33Ficici E. Zhou W. Castellano S. Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Broadly conserved Na+-binding site in the N-lobe of prokaryotic multidrug MATE transporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2018; 115: E6182-E6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to identify a Na+ binding site in the N-lobe of these transporters; we also showed that it reflects a highly conserved sequence motif among prokaryotic MATEs (33Ficici E. Zhou W. Castellano S. Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Broadly conserved Na+-binding site in the N-lobe of prokaryotic multidrug MATE transporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Malviya V.N. Nonaka T. Koepke J. Muenke C. Hausner W. Hummer G. Safarian S. Michel H. Inward-facing conformation of a multidrug resistance MATE family transporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 12275-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), very likely explains the observation of Na+-dependent drug efflux among some transporters of this family, as well as others in the larger superfamily of MOP (multidrug/oligosaccharidyl-lipid/polysaccharide) exporters, such as the lipid-flippase MurJ (35Kuk A.C.Y. Hao A. Guan Z. Lee S.Y. Visualizing conformation transitions of the Lipid II flippase MurJ.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this Na+ site is also highly similar to those observed in other ion-driven transport systems with dual specificity for Na+ and H+ (36Krah A. Pogoryelov D. Langer J.D. Bond P.J.

However, this “circumstantial” specificity implies that subtle variations in sequence or certain laboratory conditions might favor H+ binding instead. This promiscuity of the N-lobe binding site might thus explain some of the reports of H+-dependent activity among MATEs. Nonetheless, additional binding sites for H+ in the C-lobe or elsewhere in the structure have also been proposed as potential explanations for H+-coupling in this family (27Jin Y.

The proposed binding site is formed by four side chains, namely Asp35 on TM1, Asn174 and Asp178 on TM5, and Thr196 on TM6; the backbone carbonyl of Ala192, also in TM6, is the fifth component (Fig. 1B). A strong spherical electron-density signal not attributable to the protein was also detected at the center of this site (Fig. 1B). Kusakizako et al. interpreted this signal as a bound water molecule, which they suggested mediates a network of hydrogen-bonding interactions whereby both Asp35 and Asp178 are protonated (Fig. 2A).

However, the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play fundamental biological roles in various cellular functions. Some studies suggested that the sEVs were involved in the metabolism of ECM and the function of fibroblasts. The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of sEVs secreted by vaginal fibroblasts on the pathogenesis of SUI. We showed that the fibroblasts of female anterior vaginal wall secreted sEVs. Moreover, fibroblasts of females with SUI had significantly elevated secretion of sEVs. The collagen contents, proliferation and migration capacity of fibroblasts were decreased when fibroblasts were co-cultured with fibroblasts-derived sEVs (fibroblast-sEVs) from SUI patients. Proteomic analysis revealed that fibroblast-sEVs contained various differentially expressed proteins including TIMP2, TGF-β and ABCC4, which were involved in signaling pathways of fibroblasts regulation. Therefore, we suggested that fibroblast-sEVs contributed to the pathogenesis of SUI through various proteins including TIMP2, TGF-β and ABCC4."
https://openalex.org/W3149531137,"De novo blood vessel formation occurs through coalescence of endothelial cells (ECs) into a cord-like structure, followed by lumenization either through cell-1-3 or cord-hollowing4-7. Vessels generated in this manner are restricted in diameter to one or two ECs, and these models fail to explain how vasculogenesis can form large-diameter vessels. Here, we describe a model for large vessel formation that does not require a cord-like structure or a hollowing step. In this model, ECs coalesce into a network of struts in the future lumen of the vessel, a process dependent upon bone morphogenetic protein signalling. The vessel wall forms around this network and consists initially of only a few patches of ECs. To withstand external forces and to maintain the shape of the vessel, strut formation traps erythrocytes into compartments to form a rigid structure. Struts gradually prune and ECs from struts migrate into and become part of the vessel wall. Experimental severing of struts resulted in vessel collapse, disturbed blood flow and remodelling defects, demonstrating that struts enable the patency of large vessels during their formation."

Evidence indicates a rising prevalence of the use of these products worldwide especially among the age group 18–23 years. Aim The study investigates the tendencies and attitudes of Bangladeshi undergraduate female students towards dietary supplements (DS). Methods A three-month (March 2018-May 2018) cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted in undergraduate female students in Chittagong, Bangladesh using a pre-validated dietary supplement questionnaire. The study was carried among the four private and three public university students of different disciplines in Chittagong to record their prevalent opinions and attitudes toward using DS. The results were documented and analyzed by SPSS version 22.0. Results Ninety two percent (N = 925, 92.0%) of the respondents answered the survey questions. The prevalence of DS use was high in undergraduate female students. The respondents cited general health and well-being (n = 102, 11.0%) and physician recommendation (n = 101, 10.9%) as a reason for DS use. Majority of the students (n = 817, 88.3%) used DS cost monthly between USD 0.12 and USD 5.90. Most of the students (n = 749, 81.0%) agreed on the beneficial effect of DS and a significant portion (n = 493, 53.3%) recommended for a regular use of DS. Highly prevalent use of dietary supplements appeared in Chittagonian undergraduate female students. They were tremendously positive in using DS. The results demonstrate an increasing trend of using DS by the undergraduate females for both nutritional improvement and amelioration from diseases. Conclusion Dietary supplements prevalence was so much higher in students of private universities as compared to students of public universities. Likewise, maximal prevalence is indicated in pharmacy department compared to other departments. Students preferred brand products, had positive opinions and attitudes towards dietary supplements."
https://openalex.org/W3118857201,"T lymphocytes discriminate between healthy and infected or cancerous cells via T-cell receptor-mediated recognition of peptides bound and presented by cell-surface-expressed major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHCs). Pre-T-cell receptors (preTCRs) on thymocytes foster development of αβT lymphocytes through their β chain interaction with MHC displaying self-peptides on thymic epithelia. The specific binding of a preTCR with a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) has been identified previously as forming a weak affinity complex with a distinct interface from that of mature αβTCR. However, a lack of appropriate tools has limited prior efforts to investigate this unique interface. Here we designed a small-scale linkage screening protocol using bismaleimide linkers for determining residue-specific distance constraints between transiently interacting protein pairs in solution. Employing linkage distance restraint-guided molecular modeling, we report the oriented solution docking geometry of a preTCRβ-pMHC interaction. The linkage model of preTCRβ-pMHC complex was independently verified with paramagnetic pseudocontact chemical shift (PCS) NMR of the unlinked protein mixtures. Using linkage screens, we show that the preTCR binds with differing affinities to peptides presented by MHC in solution. Moreover, the C-terminal peptide segment is a key determinant in preTCR-pMHC recognition. We also describe the process for future large-scale production and purification of the linked constructs for NMR, X-ray crystallography, and single-molecule electron microscopy studies."
https://openalex.org/W3120405869,"Degranulation, a fundamental effector response from mast cells (MCs) and platelets, is an example of regulated exocytosis. This process is mediated by SNARE proteins and their regulators. We have previously shown that several of these proteins are essential for exocytosis in MCs and platelets. Here, we assessed the role of the SNARE protein SNAP23 using conditional knockout mice, in which SNAP23 was selectively deleted from either the megakaryocyte/platelet or connective tissue MC lineages. We found that removal of SNAP23 in platelets results in severe defects in degranulation of all three platelet secretory granule types, i.e., alpha, dense, and lysosomal granules. The mutation also induces thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet morphology and activation, and reduction in the number of alpha granules. Therefore, the degranulation defect might not be secondary to an intrinsic failure of the machinery mediating regulated exocytosis in platelets. When we removed SNAP23 expression in MCs, there was a complete developmental failure in vitro and in vivo. The developmental defects in platelets and MCs and the abnormal translocation of membrane proteins to the surface of platelets indicate that SNAP23 is also involved in constitutive exocytosis in these cells. The MC conditional deletant animals lacked connective tissue MCs, but their mucosal MCs were normal and expanded in response to an antigenic stimulus. We used this mouse to show that connective tissue MCs are required and mucosal MCs are not sufficient for an anaphylactic response."
https://openalex.org/W3120440224,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, replicative life span (RLS) is primarily affected by the stability of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The stability of the highly repetitive rDNA array is maintained through transcriptional silencing by the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase Sir2. Recently, the loss of Smi1, a protein of unknown molecular function that has been proposed to be involved in cell wall synthesis, has been demonstrated to extend RLS in S. cerevisiae, but the mechanism by which Smi1 regulates RLS has not been elucidated. In this study, we determined that the loss of Smi1 extends RLS in a Sir2-dependent manner. We observed that the smi1Δ mutation enhances transcriptional silencing at the rDNA locus and promotes rDNA stability. In the absence of Smi1, the stress-responsive transcription factor Msn2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and nuclear-accumulated Msn2 stimulates the expression of nicotinamidase Pnc1, which serves as an activator of Sir2. In addition, we observed that the MAP kinase Hog1 is activated in smi1Δ cells and that the activation of Hog1 induces the translocation of Msn2 into the nucleus. Taken together, our findings suggest that the loss of Smi1 leads to the nuclear accumulation of Msn2 and stimulates the expression of Pnc1, thereby enhancing Sir2-mediated rDNA stability and extending RLS in S. cerevisiae."

Materials and methods Performance, Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) survey data from 2014–2018 was used. PMA2020 surveys are cross-sectional including women 15–49 years. PMA2020 used a 2-stage cluster design with urban/rural regions as strata with random selection of households. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done using stata V15. Results Of the 34,832 respondents interviewed from 2014 to 2018, 60.2% were MWRA. There was a significant decrease in demand for FP from 2014 to 2018, p = 0.012. Lowest demand was among 15–19 and 45–49 years old women. Overall, modern contraceptive prevalence rate increased significantly from 54.6% to 60.8%, p = 0.004, being higher for women from urban areas, home visits by health care worker (HCW), educated, wealthy, visited health facilities and exposed to mass media. Unmet need for FP decreased from 23.0–13.8% over the 5-years, p&lt;0.001. Married adolescent 15–19 had the highest unmet need and those from rural areas, poor, uneducated and not exposed to mass media. mDFPS increased significantly from 69.7–79.4% over the 5-years, p&lt;0.001, with increase in long acting reversible contraception/permanent methods from 19.9–37.2% and decrease in short acting methods from 49.9–42.2%. Significant determinants of mDFPS were age, rural/urban residence, education, wealth, health facility visitation, exposure to FP messages via mass media in the last 12 months, year of study and county of residence. Conclusions Results show a good progress in key FP indicators. However, not all MWRA are being reached and should be reached if Kenya is to achieve the desired universal health coverage as well as Sustainable Development Goals. Targeted home visits by HCW as well increase in mass media coverage could be viable interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3141724508,"Background The search for immune correlates of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in humans is limited by the focus on peripheral blood measures. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can safely be done and provides insight into cellular function in the lung where infection is first established. In this study, blood and lung samples were assayed to determine if heavily MTB exposed persons who resist development of latent MTB infection (RSTR) vs those who develop latent MTB infection (LTBI), differ in the make-up of resident BAL innate and adaptive immune cells. Methods Bronchoscopy was performed on 21 healthy long-term Ugandan RSTR and 25 LTBI participants. Immune cell distributions in BAL and peripheral blood were compared by differential cell counting and flow cytometry. Results The bronchoscopy procedure was well tolerated with few adverse reactions. Differential macrophage and lymphocyte frequencies in BAL differed between RSTR and LTBI. When corrected for age, this difference lost statistical significance. BAL CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were almost entirely composed of effector memory T cells in contrast to PBMC, and did not differ between RSTR and LTBI. BAL NKT, γδ T cells and NK cells also did not differ between RTSR and LTBI participants. There was a marginally significant increase (p = 0.034) in CD8 T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (T EMRA ) in PBMC of LTBI vs RSTR participants. Conclusion This observational case-control study comparing unstimulated BAL from RSTR vs LTBI, did not find evidence of large differences in the distribution of baseline BAL immune cells. PBMC T EMRA cell percentage was higher in LTBI relative to RSTR suggesting a role in the maintenance of latent MTB infection.

In vitro cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and dendritic cells (BMDCs) are well-established and valuable methods for immunological studies. Typically, commercially available recombinant GM-CSF is utilized to generate BMDCs and is also used to culture alveolar macrophages. We have generated a new HEK-293T cell line expressing murine GM-CSF that secretes high levels of GM-CSF (~180 ng/ml) into complete media as an alternative to commercial GM-CSF. Differentiation of dendritic cells and expression of various markers were kinetically assessed using the GM-CSF HEK293T cell line, termed supGM-CSF and compared directly to purified commercial GMCSF. After 7–9 days of cell culture the supGM-CSF yielded twice as many viable cells compared to the commercial purified GM-CSF. In addition to differentiating BMDCs, the supGM-CSF can be utilized to culture functionally active alveolar macrophages.

Three experiments with an identical design (one original study and two replications) with 3- to 4-year-old-children (N = 100) assessed whether children’s source memory performance would improve in the face of disagreement and whether such an effect interacts with different types of sources (first- vs. second-hand). In a 2 x 2 repeated-measures design, children found out about the contents of a container either by looking inside or being told (IV1). Then they were questioned about the contents of the container by an interlocutor puppet who either agreed or disagreed with their answer (IV2). We measured children’s source memory performance in response to a free recall question (DV1) followed by a forced-choice question (DV2). Four-year-olds (but not three-year-olds) performed better in response to the free recall source memory question (but not the forced-choice question) when their interlocutor had disagreed with them compared to when it had agreed with them. Children were also better at recalling ‘having been told’ than ‘having seen’. These results demonstrate that by four years of age, source memory capacities are sensitive to the communicative context of assertions and serve social functions."

The ankylosing spondylitis T9-L5 FE model was built and the range of motion (ROM) was compared to previous studies. The L1 transverse fracture was simulated and was separately fixed by five different patterns. The pull force and yielding force of the screws, the von Mises stress of the internal fixation, and the displacement of fracture site were analyzed to evaluate the proper fixation pattern for thoracolumbar fracture of AS. ROM of AS model was obviously restricted comparing to the normal vertebral experimental data. All the fixation patterns can stabilize the fracture. At least four levels of fixation can reduce the von Mises stress of the internal fixation. Four levels fixation has a higher pull force than the six levels fixation. Skipped level fixation did not reduce the stress, pull force and yielding force. The kyphosis correction did not change the biomechanical load. At least 4 levels fixation was needed for AS thoracolumbar fracture. The cemented screws should be chosen in 4 levels fixation to increase the holding of the screws. The skipped fixation has no advantage. The kyphosis correction can be chosen after weighing the pros and cons."
https://openalex.org/W3148516707,"Background The burden of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections remains disproportionately high in sub-Saharan Africa, with high rates of co-infections. Multiplex rapid diagnostic tests for HIV, HBV and HCV serological testing with high analytical performances may improve the “cascade of screening” and quite possibly the linkage-to-care with reduced cost. Based on our previous field experience of HIV self-testing, we herein aimed at evaluating the practicability and acceptability of a prototype finger-stick whole-blood Triplex HIV/HCV/HBsAg self-test as a simultaneous serological screening tool for HIV, HBV, and HCV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Methods A cross-sectional multicentric study consisting of face-to-face, paper-based, and semi-structured questionnaires with a home-based and facility-based recruitment of untrained adult volunteers at risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections recruited from the general public was conducted in 2020 in urban and rural areas in the DRC. The practicability of the Triplex self-test was assessed by 3 substudies on the observation of self-test manipulation including the understanding of the instructions for use (IFU), on the interpretation of Triplex self-test results and on its acceptability. Results A total of 251 volunteers (mean age, 28 years; range, 18–49; 154 males) were included, from urban [160 (63.7%)] and rural [91 (36.3%)] areas. Overall, 242 (96.4%) participants performed the Triplex self-test and succeeded in obtaining a valid test result with an overall usability index of 89.2%. The correct use of the Triplex self-test was higher in urban areas than rural areas (51.2% versus 16.5%; aOR: 6.9). The use of video IFU in addition to paper-based IFU increased the correct manipulation and interpretation of the Triplex self-test. A total of 197 (78.5%) participants correctly interpreted the Triplex self-test results, whereas 54 (21.5%) misinterpreted their results, mainly the positive test results harboring low-intensity band (30/251; 12.0%), and preferentially the HBsAg band (12/44; 27.3%). The rates of acceptability of reuse, distribution of the Triplex self-test to third parties (partner, friend, or family member), linkage to the health care facility for confirmation of results and treatment, and confidence in the self-test results were very high, especially among participants from urban areas. Conclusions This pilot study shows evidence for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa on good practicability and high acceptability of a prototype Triplex HIV/HCV/HBsAg self-test for simultaneous diagnosis of three highly prevalent chronic viral infections, providing the rational basis of using self-test harboring four bands of interest, i . e . the control, HIV, HCV, and HBsAg bands. The relatively frequent misinterpretation of the Triplex self-test points however the necessity to improve the delivery of this prototype Triplex self-test probably in a supervised setting. Finally, these observations lay the foundations for the potential large-scale use of the Triplex self-test in populations living in sub-Saharan Africa at high risk for HIV, HBV, and HCV infections."
https://openalex.org/W3151949912,"Background Initially, the relative sizes of the asymptomatic and the symptomatic infected populations were not known for the COVID-19 pandemic and neither was the actual fatality rate. Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. Aim To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic’s course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. Methods The SEIRS (Susceptible—Exposed—Infected—Recovered—Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. Results The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate ℜ 0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8–1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1–20, 2020. Conclusions The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA."

We develop algorithms that can visualize spiral waves and their tip locations on curved atrial geometries. We use these algorithms to quantify differences in AF maps and spiral tip locations between 3D basket reconstructions, projection onto 3D anatomical shells and unfolded 2D surfaces.We tested our algorithms in N = 20 patients in whom AF was recorded from 64-pole baskets (Abbott, CA). Phase maps were generated by non-proprietary software to identify the tips of spiral waves, indicated by phase singularities. The number and density of spiral tips were compared in patient-specific 3D shells constructed from the basket, as well as 3D maps from clinical electroanatomic mapping systems and 2D maps.Patients (59.4±12.7 yrs, 60% M) showed 1.7±0.8 phase singularities/patient, in whom ablation terminated AF in 11/20 patients (55%). There was no difference in the location of phase singularities, between 3D curved surfaces and 2D unfolded surfaces, with a median correlation coefficient between phase singularity density maps of 0.985 (0.978-0.990). No significant impact was noted by phase singularities location in more curved regions or relative to the basket location (p>0.1).AF maps and phase singularities mapped by endocardial baskets are qualitatively and quantitatively similar whether calculated by 3D phase maps on patient-specific curved atrial geometries or in 2D. Phase maps on patient-specific geometries may be easier to interpret relative to critical structures for ablation planning."

Cardiovascular risk factors and diseases were examined in asymptomatic Hungarian elite handball referees undergoing extended screening: personal/family history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory tests, body-composition analysis, echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Holter-ECG (n = 8), blood pressure monitorization (n = 10), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR; n = 27) and computer tomography (CCT; n = 4) were also carried out if needed. We examined 100 referees (age: 29.6±7.9years, male: 64, training: 4.3±2.0 hours/week), cardiovascular risk factors were: positive medical history: 24%, overweight: 10%, obesity: 3%, dyslipidaemia: 41%. Elevated resting blood pressure was measured in 38%. Stress-ECG was positive due to ECG-changes in 16%, due to elevated exercise blood pressure in 8%. Echocardiography and/or CMR identified abnormalities in 19%. A significant number of premature ventricular contractions was found on the Holter-ECG in two cases. The CCT showed myocardial bridge or coronary plaques in one-one case. We recommended lifestyle changes in 58%, new/modified antihypertensive or lipid-lowering therapy in 5%, iron-supplementation in 22%. By our results, a high percentage of elite Hungarian handball referees had cardiovascular risk factors or diseases, which, combined with physical and psychological stress, could increase the possibility of cardiovascular events. Our study draws attention to the importance of cardiac screening in elite handball referees."
https://openalex.org/W3151977514,"Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV, genus Nepovirus , family Secoviridae , order Picornavirales ) is a bipartite positive-strand RNA virus, with each RNA encoding one large polyprotein. ToRSV RNAs are linked to a 5’-viral genome-linked protein (VPg) and have a 3’ polyA tail, suggesting a non-canonical cap-independent translation initiation mechanism. The 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of RNA1 and RNA2 are unusually long (~1.5 kb) and share several large stretches of sequence identities. Several putative in-frame start codons are present in the 5’ regions of the viral RNAs, which are also highly conserved between the two RNAs. Using reporter transcripts containing the 5’ region and 3’ UTR of the RNA2 of ToRSV Rasp1 isolate (ToRSV-Rasp1) and in vitro wheat germ extract translation assays, we provide evidence that translation initiates exclusively at the first AUG, in spite of a poor codon context. We also show that both the 5’ region and 3’ UTR of RNA2 are required for efficient cap-independent translation of these transcripts. We identify translation-enhancing elements in the 5’ proximal coding region of the RNA2 polyprotein and in the RNA2 3’ UTR. Cap-dependent translation of control reporter transcripts was inhibited when RNAs consisting of the RNA2 3’ UTR were supplied in trans . Taken together, our results suggest the presence of a CITE in the ToRSV-Rasp1 RNA2 3’ UTR that recruits one or several translation factors and facilitates efficient cap-independent translation together with the 5’ region of the RNA. Non-overlapping deletion mutagenesis delineated the putative CITE to a 200 nts segment (nts 773–972) of the 1547 nt long 3’ UTR. We conclude that the general mechanism of ToRSV RNA2 translation initiation is similar to that previously reported for the RNAs of blackcurrant reversion virus, another nepovirus. However, the position, sequence and predicted structures of the translation-enhancing elements differed between the two viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3126836126,"The importance of molecular chaperones in cancer is well established, yet several chaperone inhibitors have failed in clinical trials due to toxicity. Recent efforts have focused on targeting chaperone function in cancer by either manipulating the “chaperone code” or inhibiting helper cochaperones, such as DNAJA1. Tong et al. identify a novel inhibitor that specifically disrupts DNAJA1's interaction with p53, promoting p53 degradation. This finding highlights specific DNAJA1 interactions with the potential for less toxicity compared to traditional chaperone inhibitors. The importance of molecular chaperones in cancer is well established, yet several chaperone inhibitors have failed in clinical trials due to toxicity.

Tong et al. identify a novel inhibitor that specifically disrupts DNAJA1's interaction with p53, promoting p53 degradation. This finding highlights specific DNAJA1 interactions with the potential for less toxicity compared to traditional chaperone inhibitors. Molecular chaperones are highly expressed proteins that act as custodians of the cell, helping to fold a large fraction of the proteome. The most well studied of these are Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are critical for cell viability (1Rosenzweig R. Nillegoda N.B. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. The Hsp70 chaperone network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 665-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Hsp70 works at the initial stages of folding, binding newly synthesized and denatured proteins. In contrast, Hsp90 binds clients after they have been processed by Hsp70, promoting protein maturation and activation. Due to their ability to stabilize selected oncoproteins, significant research into development of chaperone-targeting anticancer therapeutics has been pursued. Unfortunately, many of the molecules identified to date have failed in patient trials due to toxicity, presumably due to consequences of chaperone inhibition in healthy cells (1Rosenzweig R. Nillegoda N.B. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. The Hsp70 chaperone network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 665-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The lack of clinical success of chaperone inhibitors has led researchers to begin to focus on novel ways to modulate chaperone function rather than completely abolish it. One direction has been to explore manipulation of the chaperone code, the posttranslational modifications that regulate chaperone function (2Nitika Porter C.M. Truman A.W. Truttmann M.C. Post-translational modifications of Hsp70 family proteins: expanding the chaperone code.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 10689-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another approach has been to explore the role of helper “co-chaperones” and the impact of inhibiting specific cochaperone interactions (Fig. 1). For example, Hsp70 requires a large suite of cochaperones for function. These cochaperones bind unfolded clients and direct them to Hsp70 for folding (1Rosenzweig R. Nillegoda N.B. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. The Hsp70 chaperone network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 665-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 3Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Additionally, cochaperones such as DNAJA1 are able to activate Hsp70 activity directly by binding Hsp70 and stimulating the Hsp70 ATPase cycle required for chaperone function. An early indication that Hsp70 cochaperones may play a role in cancer came in 2016 when Parrales and colleagues uncovered a connection between the mevalonate metabolic pathway and the activity and stability of mutant p53, a well-established tumor suppressor (4Parrales A. Ranjan A. Iyer S.V. Padhye S. Weir S.J. Roy A. Iwakuma T. DNAJA1 controls the fate of misfolded mutant p53 through the mevalonate pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Through a series of elegant studies, the team determined that p53 activity was mediated through two cochaperones of Hsp70, DNAJA1 and CHIP (carboxy-terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein). Parralles and coworkers determined mutant p53 is a client of DNAJA1, and their interaction is directly controlled through mevalonate pathway activity, possibly through posttranslational modification of DNAJA1 (4Parrales A. Ranjan A. Iyer S.V. Padhye S. Weir S.J. Roy A. Iwakuma T. DNAJA1 controls the fate of misfolded mutant p53 through the mevalonate pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed and extended 3 years later, when farnesylation of DNAJA1 at C394 was demonstrated to be critical for DNAJA1–p53 interaction (5Xu D. Tong X. Sun L. Li H. Jones R.D. Liao J. Yang G.Y. Inhibition of mutant Kras and p53-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis by atorvastatin: mainly via targeting of the farnesylated DNAJA1 in chaperoning mutant p53.Mol. Carcinog. 2019; 58: 2052-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mutation of DNAJA1 C394 to C394S (a farnesylation-deficient mutant) or treatment of cells with atorvastatin (an inhibitor of farneslyation) promoted p53 degradation (5Xu D. Tong X. Sun L. Li H. Jones R.D. Liao J. Yang G.Y. Inhibition of mutant Kras and p53-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis by atorvastatin: mainly via targeting of the farnesylated DNAJA1 in chaperoning mutant p53.Mol. Carcinog. 2019; 58: 2052-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results raised the question of whether it is possible to directly disrupt the DNAJA1–p53 complex. Tong et al. (6Tong X. Xu D. Mishra R.K. Jones R.D. Sun L. Schiltz G.E. Liao J. Yang G.-Y. Identification of a druggable protein-protein interaction site between mutant p53 and its stabilizing chaperone DNAJA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) now advance insights into this issue, combining computational modeling, mutation-based in vitro work, and mouse models to search for and assess inhibitors of the DNAJA1–p53 interaction. The authors first modeled the interaction between mutant p53 (mutp53R175H) and DNAJA1 (6Tong X. Xu D. Mishra R.K. Jones R.D. Sun L. Schiltz G.E. Liao J. Yang G.-Y. Identification of a druggable protein-protein interaction site between mutant p53 and its stabilizing chaperone DNAJA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the numerous structural studies on DNAJA1, no full-length structures have been experimentally determined. In an effort to bypass this issue, the authors utilized multitemplate homology modeling to generate a high-quality DNAJA1 structure. After generating 2000 docking poses of DNAJA1 bound to mutp53R175H, 250 low-energy poses were obtained, 10 of which had similar binding modes (6Tong X. Xu D. Mishra R.K. Jones R.D. Sun L. Schiltz G.E. Liao J. Yang G.-Y. Identification of a druggable protein-protein interaction site between mutant p53 and its stabilizing chaperone DNAJA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using these structures, the authors next looked for druggable interaction pockets at the DNAJA1–p53 interface, identifying four in the glycine/phenylalanine-rich (G/F) region of DNAJA1. Mutation of key residues in the G/F region of DNAJA1 (P84S and K125Q) resulted in destabilization of mutant p53, validating this region of DNAJA1 as an area for targeting as an anticancer therapeutic. The authors then computationally screened a proprietary library of one million molecules. Functional characterization of the top 27 hits identified a small molecular inhibitor, GY1-22, that was able to bind at the mutp53R175H-DNAJA1 interface, disrupting the interaction and leading to p53 degradation. This novel small-molecule inhibitor performed well in in vitro and in vivo mouse studies to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth (6Tong X. Xu D. Mishra R.K. Jones R.D. Sun L. Schiltz G.E. Liao J. Yang G.-Y. Identification of a druggable protein-protein interaction site between mutant p53 and its stabilizing chaperone DNAJA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of Tong et al. (6Tong X. Xu D. Mishra R.K. Jones R.D. Sun L. Schiltz G.E. Liao J. Yang G.-Y. Identification of a druggable protein-protein interaction site between mutant p53 and its stabilizing chaperone DNAJA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reinforce the growing body of evidence that cochaperone proteins such as DNAJA1 have excellent potential as anticancer targets. Recent studies have shown DNAJA1 to be important in the activity of other important oncoproteins. For example, DNAJA1 and its yeast counterpart Ydj1 bind, stabilize, and regulate the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex in both yeast and mammalian cells (7Sluder I.T. Nitika Knighton L.E. Truman A.W. The Hsp70 co-chaperone Ydj1/HDJ2 regulates ribonucleotide reductase activity.PLoS Genet. 2018; 14e1007462Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DNAJA1 function through either knockout via CRISPR-CAS9 or via the novel small molecule 116-9e developed by the Gestwicki group (8Wisen S. Bertelsen E.B. Thompson A.D. Patury S. Ung P. Chang L. Evans C.G. Walter G.M. Wipf P. Carlson H.A. Brodsky J.L. Zuiderweg E.R. Gestwicki J.E. Binding of a small molecule at a protein-protein interface regulates the chaperone activity of hsp70-hsp40.ACS Chem. Biol. 2010; 5: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) caused a marked increase in sensitivity to well-characterized RNR inhibitors such as hydroxyurea, triapine, and gemcitabine (7Sluder I.T.

DNAJA1 also promotes androgen receptor (AR) activity; disruption of the Hsp70–DNAJA1 interaction in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (CRPC) via the small-molecule inhibitor C86 promoted rapid AR degradation (9Moses M.A. Kim Y.S.

Consistent with this observation, C86 significantly decreased average CRPC-derived tumor volume in mouse in vitro studies (9Moses M.A. Kim Y.S. Rivera-Marquez G.M. Oshima N. Watson M.J. Beebe K.E.

Of further interest, DNAJA1 may also a play a role in many other signal transduction pathways. Although the complete DNAJA1 interactome has yet to be determined, a recent chemogenomic study revealed that over 30% of a panel of NCI-approved oncology drugs tested showed substantially increased potency in cells lacking DNAJA1 (10Nitika Blackman J.S. Knighton L.E. Takakuwa J.E. Calderwood S.K. Truman A.W. Chemogenomic screening identifies the hsp70 co-chaperone DNAJA1 as a hub for anticancer drug resistance.Sci Rep. 2020; 10 (13831)Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These drugs acted on a variety of pathways including cell cycle progression, DNA damage response and repair, and the cytoskeleton, suggesting a wide range of novel DNAJA1 functions Additionally, these data suggest an untapped space for drug synergy utilizing combinations of DNAJA1 inhibitors with existing approved small-molecule therapeutics. It should be noted, however, that a small but significant number of drugs utilized in the screen were rendered less potent by loss of DNAJA1, possibly explained by DNAJA1 stabilizing proteins whose roles act to inhibit rather than activate specific signal transduction pathways (10Nitika Blackman J.S. Knighton L.E. Takakuwa J.E. Calderwood S.K. Truman A.W. Chemogenomic screening identifies the hsp70 co-chaperone DNAJA1 as a hub for anticancer drug resistance.Sci Rep. 2020; 10 (13831)Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a rationale for inhibiting specific DNAJA1–client interactions as in the work from Tong and colleagues (6Tong X. Xu D. Mishra R.K. Jones R.D. Sun L. Schiltz G.E. Liao J. Yang G.-Y. Identification of a druggable protein-protein interaction site between mutant p53 and its stabilizing chaperone DNAJA1.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than inhibiting DNAJA1 completely. Future directions may include understanding the range of DNAJA1–client interactions impacted by GY1-22, particularly if several clients share the same DNAJA1 binding site. Additionally, it may be worthwhile understanding if GY1-22 can bind any of the large number of highly similar J-proteins present in cells. Whatever the answer, going forward it may be possible to apply the same strategies by Tong and team to develop many more potent anticancer therapeutics based on destabilizing other selected J-protein–client interactions.

Here, we examined the level of perivascular fibulin-2 expression in relation to elastosis content, vascular invasion, molecular subtypes, tumour detection mode, and patient prognosis in breast cancer. We performed a population based retrospective study of invasive breast cancers from the Norwegian Breast Screening Program (Vestfold County, 2004–2009) including 200 screen-detected and 82 interval cancers. Perivascular fibulin-2 staining was semi-quantitatively graded based on immunohistochemistry (1–3) and dichotomized as high expression (grade 2–3) and low expression (grade 1). Elastosis content was graded on a 4-tiered scale and dichotomized as high (score 3) and low (score 0–2) expression, whereas lymphatic (LVI) and blood vessel invasion (BVI) were recorded as absent or present by immunohistochemistry. High perivascular fibulin-2 expression was strongly related to stromal elastosis (p&lt;0.001), and inversely associated with BVI and LVI (p&lt;0.001 for both). High fibulin-2 was associated with luminal breast cancer subgroups (p&lt;0.001) and inversely with interval cancers compared with screen-detected tumours (p&lt;0.001). By univariate analysis, low perivascular fibulin-2 was associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (p = 0.002) and disease specific survival (p = 0.019). Low perivascular fibulin-2 expression was strongly related to vascular invasion, low stromal elastosis, non-luminal breast cancer subtypes, interval presentation, and adverse prognosis."

Strikingly, 100 ATP hydrolysis events are needed per successfully refolded ribozyme, suggesting that each round of unfolding requires ten ATP molecules, since 90% of substrate unfolding cycles only lead back to the kinetically favored misfolded state.

Discovery of this new form of dietary iron and elucidation of its pathway of intestinal absorption may lead to the development of improved iron supplementation approaches. The nicotianamine-iron chelate [NA-Fe2+], which is found in many plant-based foods, has been recently described as a new form of bioavailable iron in mice and chickens. How NA-Fe2+ is assimilated from the diet, however, remains unclear. The current investigation by Murata et al. has identified the proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) as the main mechanism by which NA-Fe2+ is absorbed in the mammalian intestine. Discovery of this new form of dietary iron and elucidation of its pathway of intestinal absorption may lead to the development of improved iron supplementation approaches. Iron is an essential nutrient for humans and other mammals with numerous critical biochemical functions; yet iron in excess is toxic. Importantly, there is no physiological means to excrete excess iron, so homeostasis must be maintained by modulating the magnitude of intestinal absorption. Dietary iron exists mainly as heme iron and nonheme (or inorganic) iron. Molecular mechanisms of nonheme iron absorption have been elucidated (1Gulec S. Anderson G.J. Collins J.F. Mechanistic and regulatory aspects of intestinal iron absorption.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2014; 307: G397-G409Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but details of heme iron absorption remain unclear. Dietary nonheme iron exists as ferric (Fe3+) iron, which is insoluble in aqueous solutions. Endogenous (e.g., gastric acid) and exogenous (e.g., ascorbic acid) factors and enzyme action (e.g., duodenal cytochrome B [DCYTB]) promote reduction of ferric iron to ferrous (Fe2+) iron. Fe2+ is then imported into duodenal enterocytes by divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1), which is required for nonheme iron absorption in mice (2Shawki A. Anthony S.R. Nose Y. Engevik M.A. Niespodzany E.J. Barrientos T. Ohrvik H. Worrell R.T. Thiele D.J. Mackenzie B. Intestinal DMT1 is critical for iron absorption in the mouse but is not required for the absorption of copper or manganese.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2015; 309: G635-G647Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and probably in humans (3Mims M.P. Guan Y. Pospisilova D. Priwitzerova M. Indrak K. Ponka P. Divoky V. Prchal J.T. Identification of a human mutation of DMT1 in a patient with microcytic anemia and iron overload.Blood. 2005; 105: 1337-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Nonheme iron imported by DMT1 into enterocytes and iron contributed from other dietary iron sources constitute the intracellular “labile” iron pool. This iron can be utilized by the cell for metabolic purposes or exported by ferroportin 1 (FPN1). After export, Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ by hephaestin (HEPH), which allows ferric iron binding to transferrin for delivery to the liver via the portal vein. Importantly, recent work has also identified another potential source of dietary iron, the nicotianamine (NA)-iron chelate [NA-Fe2+], derived from plant-based foods (4Murata Y. Yoshida M. Sakamoto N. Morimoto S. Watanabe T. Namba K. Iron uptake mediated by the plant-derived chelator nicotianamine in the small intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism driving the absorption of this form of bioavailable iron, however, is unknown. In their recent JBC paper, Murata et al. have elegantly demonstrated that the NA-Fe2+ chelate is absorbed differently from nonheme dietary iron, advancing what is known about a fundamental biological process and perhaps providing opportunities to develop new and improved iron supplementation strategies. NA, an iron-binding phytosiderophore found in higher plants, likely plays an innate role in defense against iron-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (5von Wiren N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Nicotianamine chelates both FeIII and FeII. Implications for metal transport in plants.Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Earlier observations demonstrated that NA-Fe2+ could be transported into Caco-2 cells (6Eagling T. Wawer A.A. Shewry P.R. Zhao F.J. Fairweather-Tait S.J. Iron bioavailability in two commercial cultivars of wheat: Comparison between wholegrain and white flour and the effects of nicotianamine and 2'-deoxymugineic acid on iron uptake into Caco-2 cells.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2014; 62: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that NA-chelated iron is bioavailable in mice (7Lee S. Kim Y.S. Jeon U.S. Kim Y.K. Schjoerring J.K. An G. Activation of rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) enhances iron availability for biofortification.Mol. Cells. 2012; 33: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and chickens (8Beasley J.T. Johnson A.A.T. Kolba N. Bonneau J.P. Glahn R.P. Ozeri L. Koren O. Tako E. Nicotianamine-chelated iron positively affects iron status, intestinal morphology and microbial populations in vivo (Gallus gallus).Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed, and expanded upon, by the recent work of Murata et al. (4Murata Y. Yoshida M. Sakamoto N. Morimoto S. Watanabe T. Namba K. Iron uptake mediated by the plant-derived chelator nicotianamine in the small intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors thoughtfully noted that the NA-Fe2+ complex was trafficked across plant cell membranes by proteins with homology to amino acid/oligopeptide transporters in mammals. This seems logical since NA is formed from three S-adenosyl methionine molecules, and its structure somewhat resembles a small peptide. Thus, they tested the hypothesis that an amino acid transporter could also facilitate absorption of the NA-Fe2+ complex in the mammalian small intestine. Their investigation focused on proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1), which they viewed as a potential intestinal NA-Fe2+ transporter. Using radiotracer studies in Caco-2 cells (along with siRNA silencing of PAT1), functional (electrophysiological) analyses of PAT1 overexpression in Xenopus oocytes, and in vivo studies in mice, these authors demonstrated uptake of NA-59Fe2+ into the epithelium of the proximal jejunum and noted 59Fe appearance in the spleen, liver, and kidney. Taken together, these findings confirmed that NA-Fe2+ is a bioavailable source of iron in vivo, but most importantly, they uncovered the possible mechanism by which NA-Fe2+ is absorbed in the mammalian intestine (Fig. 1). The recent investigation by Murata et al. expands our understanding of dietary sources of bioavailable iron and mechanisms of intestinal iron absorption. This work also raises important questions to be considered in the future. For example, is NA-Fe2+ targeted to lysosomes in enterocytes? If so, NA could be degraded, thus liberating the ferrous iron atom, which could be subsequently transported into the cytosol. Also, do cells that express PAT1 express the iron exporter FPN1? If so, then iron liberated from NA within cells could be exported via this common pathway. Or, alternatively, is the NA-Fe2+ complex exported from enterocytes intact, and if so, where is the iron liberated from NA? Perhaps in the liver (assuming the NA-Fe2+ complex is water-soluble)? The answers to these questions will shed new light on fundamental iron absorption processes crucial to whole-body iron homeostasis. Murata et al.’s findings also introduce new queries concerning iron metabolism. Complex regulatory mechanisms have evolved to modulate absorption of enteral iron to match the physiological demand for iron. Historically, intestinal iron transport has been known to be influenced by the level of storage iron, erythroid demand for iron, oxygen levels, and inflammation (1Gulec S. Anderson G.J. Collins J.F. Mechanistic and regulatory aspects of intestinal iron absorption.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2014; 307: G397-G409Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the liver-derived peptide hormone hepcidin is the main regulator of intestinal iron absorption, and Hamp (encoding hepcidin) expression in hepatocytes is modulated according to demand for dietary iron. Hepcidin modulates iron absorption by binding to FPN1 on the basolateral surface of enterocytes, causing its internalization and degradation (and thus decreasing iron efflux) (9Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Hepcidin regulates cellular iron efflux by binding to ferroportin and inducing its internalization.Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). What remains to be elucidated is whether NA-Fe2+ uptake by enterocytes of the proximal jejunum is regulated according to levels of storage iron or in response to other signals that regulate absorption of nonheme iron (e.g., tissue oxygen levels, erythroid demand for iron, and infection and inflammation). If PAT1 and FPN1 are coexpressed, this may indicate that NA-Fe2+ absorption could be regulated like absorption of nonheme iron (i.e., via hepcidin–FPN1 interactions). Finally, this seminal work may advance our understanding of how other essential minerals are absorbed in the intestine and could open up new avenues for treating iron deficiency in humans. As a case in point, since NA can also chelate zinc and copper, does it also facilitate uptake of these metal ions in the mammalian intestine? Also, could PAT1 facilitate the transport of iron–amino acid chelates, which are being increasingly considered as dietary iron sources with improved bioavailability (10Allen L.H. Advantages and limitations of iron amino acid chelates as iron fortificants.Nutr. Rev. 2002; 60 (discussion S45): S18-S21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, perhaps NA-Fe2+ could be leveraged to develop a new method for iron supplementation, thus improving the options available to patients and creating new strategies that may have advantages over existing supplementation treatment regimens (i.e., allowing lower dosing so as to avoid inhibition of absorption by hepcidin). Experimental consideration of these remaining issues could provide further impetus to develop NA-Fe2+ as a novel (and possibly improved) iron supplement.

Iron uptake mediated by the plant-derived chelator nicotianamine in the small intestineJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 296PreviewIron is an essential metal for all living organisms that is absorbed in the intestinal cells as a heme-chelated or free form. It is unclear how important plant-derived chelators, such as nicotianamine (NA), an organic small molecule that is ubiquitous in crops, vegetables, and various other foods, contribute to iron bioavailability in mammals. We performed electrophysiological assays with Xenopus laevis oocytes and radioactive tracer experiments with Caco-2 cells. The findings revealed that the proton-coupled amino acid transporter SLC36A1 (PAT1) transports iron in the form of NA-Fe (II) complex in vitro. Full-Text PDF Open Access"

We have previously used this approach to target p53, which represents a valuable target for cancer immunotherapy because of the high frequency of its deregulation by mutation or other mechanisms. The T1-116C TCRm antibody targets the wild type p53 65-73 peptide (RMPEAAPPV) presented by HLA-A*0201 (HLA-A2) and exhibited in vivo efficacy against triple receptor negative breast cancer xenografts. Here we report a comprehensive mutational analysis of the p53 RMPEAAPPV peptide to assess the T1-116C epitope and its peptide specificity. Antibody binding absolutely required the N-terminal arginine residue, while amino acids in the center of the peptide contributed little to specificity. Data mining the immune epitope database with the T1-116C binding consensus and validation of peptide recognition using the T2 stabilization assay identified additional tumor antigens targeted by T1-116C, including WT1, gp100, Tyrosinase and NY-ESO-1. Most peptides recognized by T1-116C were conserved in mice and human HLA-A2 transgenic mice showed no toxicity when treated with T1-116C in vivo . We conclude that comprehensive validation of TCRm antibody target specificity is critical for assessing their safety profile."

We have used bioinformatics and a de novo transcriptome assembly approach to identify potential targets for developing specific antibodies to serve as nervous system function markers for freshwater prawns of the Macrobrachium spp. Total RNA was extracted from brain ganglia of Macrobrachium carcinus freshwater prawns and Illumina Next Generation Sequencing was performed using an Eel Pond mRNA Seq Protocol to construct a de novo transcriptome. Sequencing yielded 97,202,662 sequences: 47,630,546 paired and 1,941,570 singletons. Assembly with Trinity resulted in 197,898 assembled contigs from which 30,576 were annotated: 9,600 by orthology, 17,197 by homology, and 3,779 by transcript families. We looked for glutamate receptors contigs, due to their main role in crustacean excitatory neurotransmission, and found 138 contigs related to ionotropic receptors, 32 related to metabotropic receptors, and 18 to unidentified receptors. After performing multiple sequence alignments within different biological organisms and antigenicity analysis, we were able to develop antibodies for prawn AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptor 1, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and 4, and ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptor subunit 2B, with the expectation that the availability of these antibodies will help broaden knowledge regarding the underlying structural and functional mechanisms involved in prawn behavioral responses to environmental impacts. The Macrobrachium carcinus brain transcriptome can be an important tool for examining changes in many other nervous system molecules as a function of developmental stages, or in response to particular conditions or treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3148791315,"The purpose of this study was to identify typologies of diurnal sedentary behavior patterns and sociodemographic characteristics of desk-based workers. The sedentary time of 229 desk-based workers was measured using accelerometer devices. The within individual diurnal variations in sedentary time was calculated for both workdays and non-workdays. Diurnal variations in sedentary time during each time period (morning, afternoon, and evening) was calculated as the percentage of sedentary time during each time period divided by the percentage of the total sedentary time. A hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward’s method) was used to identify the optimal number of clusters. To refine the initial clusters, a non-hierarchical cluster analysis (k-means method) was performed. Four clusters were identified: stable sedentary cluster (46.7%), off-morning break cluster (26.6%), off-afternoon break cluster (8.3%), and evening sedentary cluster (18.3%). The stable sedentary cluster had the lowest variations in sedentary time throughout the day and the highest amount of total sedentary time. Participants in the off-morning and off-afternoon break clusters had nearly the same sedentary patterns but took short-term breaks during non-workday mornings or afternoons. The evening sedentary cluster had a completely different pattern, with a longer sedentary time during the evening both on workdays and non-workdays. Sociodemographic attributes such as sex, household income, educational attainment, employment status, sleep duration, and residential area, differed significantly between groups. Initiatives to address desk-based workers’ sedentary behavior need to focus not only on the workplace but also on the appropriate timing for reducing excessive sedentary time in non-work contexts depending on the characteristics and diurnal patterns of target subgroups."
