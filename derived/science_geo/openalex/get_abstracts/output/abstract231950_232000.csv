https://openalex.org/W2092645526,"Monthly gravity field estimates made by the twin Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have a geoid height accuracy of 2 to 3 millimeters at a spatial resolution as small as 400 kilometers. The annual cycle in the geoid variations, up to 10 millimeters in some regions, peaked predominantly in the spring and fall seasons. Geoid variations observed over South America that can be largely attributed to surface water and groundwater changes show a clear separation between the large Amazon watershed and the smaller watersheds to the north. Such observations will help hydrologists to connect processes at traditional length scales (tens of kilometers or less) to those at regional and global scales."
https://openalex.org/W2146070554,"Formation of long term memory begins with the activation of many disparate signaling pathways that ultimately impinge on the cellular mechanisms regulating gene expression. We investigated whether mechanisms regulating chromatin structure were activated during the early stages of long term memory formation in the hippocampus. Specifically, we investigated hippocampal histone acetylation during the initial stages of consolidation of long term association memories in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Acetylation of histone H3 in area CA1 of the hippocampus was regulated in contextual fear conditioning, an effect dependent on activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and ERK, and blocked using a behavioral latent inhibition paradigm. Activation of NMDA receptors in area CA1 in vitro increased acetylation of histone H3, and this effect was blocked by inhibition of ERK signaling. Moreover, activation of ERK in area CA1 in vitro through either the protein kinase C or protein kinase A pathways, biochemical events known to be involved in long term memory formation, also increased histone H3 acetylation. Furthermore, we observed that elevating levels of histone acetylation through the use of the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A or sodium butyrate enhanced induction of long term potentiation at Schaffer-collateral synapses in area CA1 of the hippocampus, a candidate mechanism contributing to long term memory formation in vivo. In concert with our findings in vitro, injection of animals with sodium butyrate prior to contextual fear conditioning enhanced formation of long term memory. These results indicate that histone-associated heterochromatin undergoes changes in structure during the formation of long term memory. Mimicking memory-associated changes in heterochromatin enhances a cellular process thought to underlie long term memory formation, hippocampal long term potentiation, and memory formation itself."

With control of the two-body interactions through a Feshbach resonance, we demonstrated the dependence of the pairing gap on coupling strength, temperature, and Fermi energy. The appearance of an energy gap with moderate evaporative cooling suggests that our full evaporation brought the strongly interacting system deep into a superfluid state."
https://openalex.org/W2130869324,"High-resolution carbon isotope measurements of multiple stratigraphic sections in south China demonstrate that the pronounced carbon isotopic excursion at the Permian-Triassic boundary was not an isolated event but the first in a series of large fluctuations that continued throughout the Early Triassic before ending abruptly early in the Middle Triassic. The unusual behavior of the carbon cycle coincides with the delayed recovery from end-Permian extinction recorded by fossils, suggesting a direct relationship between Earth system function and biological rediversification in the aftermath of Earth's most devastating mass extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2086967399,"The hippocampus has differentiated into an extensively connected recurrent stage (CA3) followed by a feed-forward stage (CA1). We examined the function of this structural differentiation by determining how cell ensembles in rat CA3 and CA1 generate representations of rooms with common spatial elements. In CA3, distinct subsets of pyramidal cells were activated in each room, regardless of the similarity of the testing enclosure. In CA1, the activated populations overlapped, and the overlap increased in similar enclosures. After exposure to a novel room, ensemble activity developed slower in CA3 than CA1, suggesting that the representations emerged independently."
https://openalex.org/W2164713351,"FOXO1, a member of the FOXO forkhead type transcription factors, is markedly up-regulated in skeletal muscle in energy-deprived states such as fasting and severe diabetes, but its functions in skeletal muscle have remained poorly understood. In this study, we created transgenic mice specifically overexpressing FOXO1 in skeletal muscle. These mice weighed less than the wild-type control mice, had a reduced skeletal muscle mass, and the muscle was paler in color. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of many genes related to the structural proteins of type I muscles (slow twitch, red muscle) was decreased. Histological analyses showed a marked decrease in size of both type I and type II fibers and a significant decrease in the number of type I fibers in the skeletal muscle of FOXO1 mice. Enhanced gene expression of a lysosomal proteinase, cathepsin L, which is known to be up-regulated during skeletal muscle atrophy, suggested increased protein degradation in the skeletal muscle of FOXO1 mice. Running wheel activity (spontaneous locomotive activity) was significantly reduced in FOXO1 mice compared with control mice. Moreover, the FOXO1 mice showed impaired glycemic control after oral glucose and intraperitoneal insulin administration. These results suggest that FOXO1 negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass and type I fiber gene expression and leads to impaired skeletal muscle function. Activation of FOXO1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass in humans, which leads to obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1519071177,"The nature and control of individual metal atoms on insulators are of great importance in emerging atomic-scale technologies. Individual gold atoms on an ultrathin insulating sodium chloride film supported by a copper surface exhibit two different charge states, which are stabilized by the large ionic polarizability of the film. The charge state and associated physical and chemical properties such as diffusion can be controlled by adding or removing a single electron to or from the adatom with a scanning tunneling microscope tip. The simple physical mechanism behind the charge bistability in this case suggests that this is a common phenomenon for adsorbates on polar insulating films."
https://openalex.org/W2098788436,"Adherence by Helicobacter pylori increases the risk of gastric disease. Here, we report that more than 95% of strains that bind fucosylated blood group antigen bind A, B, and O antigens (generalists), whereas 60% of adherent South American Amerindian strains bind blood group O antigens best (specialists). This specialization coincides with the unique predominance of blood group O in these Amerindians. Strains differed about 1500-fold in binding affinities, and diversifying selection was evident in babA sequences. We propose that cycles of selection for increased and decreased bacterial adherence contribute to babA diversity and that these cycles have led to gradual replacement of generalist binding by specialist binding in blood group O–dominant human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2061505951,"A major change in the community structure of the dominant epibenthic megafauna was observed at 4100 meters depth in the northeast Pacific and was synchronous to a major El Niño/La Niña event that occurred between 1997 and 1999. Photographic abundance estimates of epibenthic megafauna from 1989 to 2002 show that two taxa decreased in abundance after 1998 by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, whereas several other species increased in abundance by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. These faunal changes are correlated to climate fluctuations dominated by El Niño/La Niña. Megafauna even in remote marine areas appear to be affected by contemporary climatic fluctuations. Such faunal changes highlight the importance of an adequate temporal perspective in describing biodiversity, ecology, and anthropogenic impacts in deep-sea communities."
https://openalex.org/W2056362544,"Budding yeast protein phosphatase Cdc14 is sequestered in the nucleolus in an inactive state during interphase by the anchor protein Net1. Upon entry into anaphase, the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) network initiates dispersal of active Cdc14 throughout the cell. We report that the FEARnetwork promotes phosphorylation of Net1 by cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexed with cyclin B1 or cyclin B2. These phosphorylations appear to be required for FEAR and sustain the proper timing of late mitotic events. Thus, a regulatory circuit exists to ensure that the arbiter of the mitotic state, Cdk, sets in motion events that culminate in exit from mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2031489220,"We consider trapped atomic Fermi gases with Feshbach-resonance enhanced interactions in pseudogap and superfluid temperatures. We calculate the spectrum of radio-frequency (or laser) excitations for transitions that transfer atoms out of the superfluid state. The spectrum displays the pairing gap and also the contribution of unpaired atoms, that is, in-gap excitations. The results support the conclusion that a superfluid, in which pairing is a manybody effect, was observed in recent experiments on radio-frequency spectroscopy of the pairing gap."

MAO A and MAO B oxidize neurotransmitters and dietary amines, the regulation of which is important in maintaining normal mental states. MAO A and B have different substrate specificities. MAO A prefers serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) as substrates. MAO B prefers phenylethylamine (PEA) as a substrate (for review, see Ref. 4Shih J.C. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1991; 4: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). They are coded by different genes, with 70% amino acid identity (5Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembene M.E. Kwan S.W.

Albers R.W. Fisher S.K. Uhler M.D. Basic Neurochemistry. Raven, New York1994: 304-308Google Scholar), and MAO B inhibitors are used to treat Parkinson's disease (15Knoll J. Knoll J. Inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidase B, Pharmacology and Clinical Use in Neurodegenerative Disorders. Birkhauser Verlag, Boston1993Google Scholar). Low levels of MAO activity or genetic mutations that abrogate MAO A expression are associated with violent, criminal, or impulsive behavior in humans (16Brunner H.G. Nelen M.R. Van Zandvoort P. Abeling N.G. Van Gennip A.H. Wolters E.C. Kuiper M.A. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 1032-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 17Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefiel X.O. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). A recent report on maltreated male children indicates that a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism of the MAO A promoter (four repeats) is associated with less antisocial behavior compared with maltreated children with three repeats in MAO A polymorphism (18Caspi A.

Loss of function of one or both isoenzymes takes place in some forms of Norrie disease marked by mental retardation (19Collins F.A. Murphy D.L. Reiss A.L. Sims K.B. Lewis J.G. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, Norrie disease involves multiple gene deletions of the X chromosome, and it is not clear what role MAO deletion may play in this disorder or if Norrie disease provides human model for studying the role of MAO in neurotransmitter metabolism in vivo. Experiments on MAO A or B KO mice (MAO A KO or MAO B KO) mice indicate that absence of each isoenzyme results in a specific biochemical and behavioral phenotype. MAO A KO mice have increased 5-HT, NE, and DA levels and decreased levels of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) (20Cases O. Sief I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), reflecting the preference of MAO A for oxidation of 5-HT. MAO B KO mice have elevated PEA levels, reflecting the preferred substrate of MAO B specificity for PEA (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). MAO A KO mice show increased aggressive behavior (20Cases O. Sief I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). MAO B KO mice do not exhibit increased aggressive behavior (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), indicating that the increase in 5-HT, a preferred substrate for MAO A, and concomitant decrease in 5-HIAA may form the basis for increased aggression, consistent with the association of low 5-HIAA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of men who exhibit aggressive behavior (22Shih J.C.

Lenane M. Brown G.L. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1990; 47: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although increased aggressive behavior has not been observed in MAO B KO mice (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), low platelet MAO B activity in humans is associated with, and considered a marker for, criminal or impulsive behavior (24Garpenstrand H.

Neuropsychopharmacol. 2002; 12: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although whether this is accompanied in human subjects by a concomitant decrease in MAO A activity or other related genetic or biochemical aberration is not known. MAO A/B KO mice cannot be generated through the breeding of MAO A KO and MAO B KO mice, due to the close proximity of the isoenzyme genes on the X chromosomes, where the two genes are next to each other at their 3′ tails, organized in opposite orientations with their last exons being less than 24 kb apart (determined by blat analysis of human and mouse MAO A and B at University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Server, genome.ucsc.edu). We have identified, bred, and characterized a line of MAO A/B KO mice, which arose by spontaneous point mutation in MAO A exon 8, in a litter of MAO B KO mice. The mutation is very similar to the MAO A point mutation observed in a Dutch family (17Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefiel X.O. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), which also occurred in exon 8. The mice exhibit unique biochemical, molecular, and behavioral characteristics. Breeding of MAO A/B Double KO Mice—The MAO A/B KO male, progenitor mouse was initially identified by a phenotype characterized by a marked decrease in body weight, behavioral hyper-reactivity on handling, and panic jumping after disturbance (door opening), a phenotype not seen in the MAO B KO mice colony (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Breeding of the progenitor male with 129/SvEv female mice resulted in a F1 generation that showed no apparent behavioral abnormalities. Female F1 mice were backcrossed with 129/SvEv males. Two types of F2 males were observed: smaller hyper-reactive and larger non-hyper-reactive mice consistent with X-chromosome transmission. Mice with low body weights and hyper-reactive phenotypes were expanded and subsequently were shown to have the MAO A/B double KO phenotype. Our experiments employed 2–5-month-old, male mice deficient in MAO A/B (MAO A/B KO) and their wild type littermates (WT). The background strain of the animals was that of the MAO B KO mice (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which had been originally generated in a C57-BL/6J/129Sv strain, whose males were subsequently backcrossed over 25 generations with 129/SvEv females. Animals were singly housed with contact bedding and ad libitum food and water. A 24-h diurnal cycle was maintained with lights on from 07:00 to 19:00 h each day. The animal breeding and all experiments performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Identification of the Site of the Mutation—Liver genomic DNA from MAO A/B KO and wild type mice was isolated using a DNA extraction Kit (Stratagene). PCR amplification of the 15 coding exons of the MAO A gene was performed using the primers designed from the intron sequence flanking the coding region of each exon (Table I).

Human MAO A-deficient (male, –) and wild type (female, +/+) fibroblast cells were treated for 2 h with the protein inhibitors puromycin (30 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) and then analyzed by Northern blot. Western blot analysis using a MAO A-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody against human MAO A confirmed the absence of MAO A protein using a previously published method (26Chen K. Wu H.F. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MAO assays were performed in duplicate on mouse brain homogenates as described previously (27Wu H.F. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 888-893PubMed Google Scholar) using [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine (1 mm) and [14C]phenylethylamine (10 μm) as substrates for estimating MAO A and MAO B activity, respectively. Determination of NE, DA, and 5-HT levels in brain tissue has been described (28Kim J.J. Shih J.S. Chen K. Chen L. Bao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Whole brains were homogenized in a solution containing 0.1 m trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 3.75); 1 μm isoproterenol was used as an internal standard. The homogenates were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. 5-HT, NE, DA, 5-HIAA, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (Sigma) were used as standards. The protein concentrations were determined using the pellet with the method of Lowry (29Oliver H. Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The mobile phase was the same as the homogenization buffer (excluding the isoproterenol) with 15% methanol for detection of 5-HT. NE was quantified separately using 5% methanol in the trichloroacetic acid mobile phase solution. The mobile phases were filtered and deaerated, and the pump speed (Shimadzu LC-6A liquid chromatograph) was 1.5 ml/min. The reverse-phase column used was a Rexchrom S50100-ODS C18 column with a length of 25 cm and an internal diameter of 4.6 mm (Regis, Morton Grove, IL). The compounds were measured at +0.7 V using a Shimadzu L-ECD-6A electrochemical detector. PEA was determined as reported previously (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains excised from mutant and WT mice were homogenized in nine volumes of 0.5 n perchloric acid solution by sonication. Before homogenization, 10 ng of deuterated PEA was added to the samples as an internal standard. PEA was extracted from the homogenate with ether and derivatized with pentafluoroproprionic anhydride. A Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph, directly interfaced with a HP5971A mass-selective detector, was used to separate and analyze PEA and the internal standard. Base peaks at 104 and 107 m/z were used for detection of PEA and the internal standard, respectively. Open Field Test—Locomotor activity was measured in a circular arena (43-cm diameter) under indirect lighting over 20 min. Data were collected by video camera and computer interface (Ethovision, Noldus, Inc., Sterling, VA). For each animal, the number of transitions between a peripheral zone (annulus of 8.9-cm width) and a central zone (25.4-cm diameter) were measured, as well as the time (in seconds) spent in the central zone. Group averages were compared using t tests (two-tailed, p < 0.05). Path length (cm) traveled in the arena was summed for each animal during each minute. A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed using “genotype” as a between subject factor and “time” as a within subjects factor. Path length for each animal was fitted with a random effects exponential model y = c + m·e–k·x, where y = path length, m = ordinate intercept, k = rate of decline of locomotor activity, x = time, and c = asymptotic final path length traveled in each minute interval (30Mar A. Spreekmeester E. Rochford J. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2000; 150: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Group differences in the parameters of the equation were tested by t test (two-tailed, p < 0.05). Elevated Plus-maze—Standard procedure was used (31Lister R.G. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1987; 92: 180-185PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) with 5-min test duration, during which time the animal was filmed by a ceiling-mounted camera. Recordings were scored by a blinded observer for time spent on the open and closed arms, using the Tufts Event Scoring System software (Princeton Economics). Entry into an arm of the maze was defined by placement of at least three paws into that compartment. Group averages were calculated for the number of entries and the time spent in open and closed arms of the maze, as well as the total number of rearing events. Genotypic differences were compared using t tests (two-tailed, p < 0.05). Social Interaction—Methods were adapted from our previous work (22Shih J.C. Ridd M.J. Chen K. Meehan W.P. Kung M.P. Sief I. De Maeyer E. Brain Res. 1999; 835: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After being weaned from their mothers on postnatal day 21, mice were housed singly for 4 weeks in transparent Makrolon cages. A novel intruder mouse was introduced into the cage for 10 min, and the interactions of the mice were videotaped. Intruders were weight-matched male mice of the same genotype as the resident animal. Social behavior was coded from video recording using Tufts Event Scoring software by a blinded observer according to standard definitions (32Blanchard R.J. Blanchard D.C. Behav. Biol. 1977; 21: 197-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 33Brain P.F. Nowell N.W. Commun. Behav. Biol. 1970; 5: 7-10Google Scholar), which are: 1) non-social (absence of exploration of other mouse), 2) investigative (subject actively investigating the cage, mostly by sniffing), 3) aggressive (biting, lateral attack, tail rattling, or climbing on top of the intruder), 4) chase/escape. Chasing was scored separately to emphasize the fact that aggressive encounters in the MAO A/B KO mice were characterized predominantly by chasing and less so by other aggressive behaviors. Latency to attack was recorded and included any aggressive encounter of the resident with the intruder, including chasing, biting, lunging, on the top behavior, but not simple tail rattle. Genotypic differences were analyzed by t test (two-tailed, p < 0.05). Home Cage Locomotor Activity—MAO A/B KO mice (n = 8, age = 16.8 ± 0.4 weeks) and WT mice (n = 11, age = 16.5 ± 0.3 weeks) received an intraperitoneal radiotransmitter implant (model TA10ETAF20, Datasciences International) using methods reported previously (34Holschneider D.P. Scremin O.U. Chialvo D.R. Chen K. Shih J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1751-H1759PubMed Google Scholar). Beginning 2 weeks postsurgery, locomotor activity was recorded in the home cage of the animal in 10 s segments every 3 min over 7 days. Activity counts were separately summed for each animal during the light phase (07:00 to 19:00) and the dark phase (19:00 to 7:00) across the 7-day period. Statistical comparison of genotypic differences was performed with a repeated measures analysis of variance, and post hoc t tests (two-tailed, p < 0.05) were used to examine genotypic differences during each 12-h light/dark cycle. Greatly Elevated Monoamine Levels in MAO A/B KO Mice— The MAO A/B KO mouse was initially identified by observing a mouse in a litter of MAO B KO mice, previously generated by homologous recombination (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), of markedly lower body weight (Fig. 1A), which exhibited extreme behavioral hyper-reactivity triggered by the approach of the experimenter to the cage of the animal, which resulted in an exaggerated escape response. The body weight and behavior were inconsistent with the phenotype of previously characterized MAO B KO mice (21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Breeding of the hyper-reactive, low body weight mouse revealed an X-linked transmission, consistent with the X linkage of MAO A and B genes (2Derry J.M. Lan N.C. Shih J.C. Barnard E.A. Barnard P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8403Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of urine demonstrated non-detectable levels of the MAO A metabolite 5-HIAA in the hyper-reactive, low body weight mice. In the MAO A/B KO hyper-reactive, low body weight mice, 5-HIAA levels were decreased to even lower levels than seen in MAO A KO mice (Fig. 1B). Enzymatic activity in brain was then assessed and the results indicated a complete loss of both MAO A and MAO B activity (Fig. 1C), as measured by oxidation of 5-HT and PEA, respectively. Next, we examined the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters oxidized by the MAO isoenzymes, as well as PEA levels and neurotransmitter metabolites in brain homogenates of MAO A/B KO mice. PEA and neurotransmitter levels were increased over wild type. However, more importantly, MAO substrate levels were increased, and metabolite levels were decreased, compared with those measured in each of the single MAO A or B KO mice (Fig. 1D), as assessed by HPLC or by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in the case of PEA. In MAO A/B KO mice 5-HT, NE, DA, and PEA levels were elevated 8.5-, 2.2-, 1.7-, and 15.7-fold, respectively, above those in WT animals. Although elevated 5-HT and PEA levels are, respectively, consistent with an absence of the MAO A or MAO B isoenzyme, the magnitudes of either 5-HT or PEA increases are much greater than in single MAO isoenzyme KO mice. Since NE and DA can also be metabolized by catechol-o-methyl transferase, a less extreme increase of their levels in brain compared with 5-HT or PEA was seen in the hyper-reactive, low body weight mice or in previously reported single KO MAO mice (20Cases O. Sief I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 21Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). 5-HIAA levels in brain homogenates were decreased compared with the already greatly reduced levels in the MAO A KO mice, and decreases of 5-HIAA levels were about 200-fold less than those of WT mice or MAO B KO mice (Fig. 1D). MAO B expression increases with age, and consequently, in MAO A KO mice, increases of 5-HT and decreases of 5-HIAA become less pronounced in adult and aged mice (20Cases O. Sief I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). MAO B is generally considered to be absent in newborn mice, as assessed by current MAO assays, ostensibly making a newborn MAO A KO mouse very similar if not equivalent to the double MAO A/B KO mouse in terms of MAO expression. Yet, MAO A/B KO mice have increased 5-HT and decreased 5-HIAA levels compared with newborn MAO A KO mice (20Cases O. Sief I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). These data suggest that even newborn mice may have a basal level of MAO B activity and that the MAO A/B double KO has all MAO activity abrogated. A863 → T Mutation in MAO A Gene Results in Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay and MAO A/B Double KO Mice from MAO B KO Mice—Given the implications of the above-described altered biochemical phenotype of the low body weight, hyper-reactive mice observed and bred from the MAO B KO litter, the presence or absence of MAO A transcript and protein were assessed by Northern and Western blot, respectively. No observation of transcript by Northern analysis (Fig. 2A), nor protein by Western blot, demonstrated the absence of MAO A protein (Fig. 2B), confirming that the mice were deficient in both MAO A and MAO B expression. The observed loss of MAO A activity was due to a spontaneous mutation in MAO A, creating a double KO for both MAO A and B as was shown in the following experiments. To determine the molecular basis for the mutation, PCR primers were designed that flanked each of the 15 exons of MAO A (Table I). Exon sequences were amplified from genomic DNA, subcloned, and sequenced. Sequence analysis identified a point mutation in exon 8 where adenine at position 863 of MAO A (numbering relative to the mouse MAO A GenBank™ entry NM_173740) is mutated to thymine (Figs. 2C and 3). This substitution results in the introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 284 rather than a lysine in wild type (AAA to TAA). The A863T mutation abrogates a DraI restriction site (TTTAAA → TTTTAA). DraI cleavage patterns of amplified exon 8 were analyzed in wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant mice and resulted in cleavage patterns consistent with the A863T mutation (Fig. 2D). Wild type showed normal DraI cleavage, homozygous mutant mice were unaffected by DraI, and heterozygous mice showed both cleavage product and non-cleaved DNA, confirming the sequence results for the PCR amplified exon 8. The molecular basis for the MAO A deficiency determined in the mice identified as being MAO A/B KO genotype differs from the initially reported MAO A KO mouse, Tg8 (19Collins F.A. Murphy D.L. Reiss A.L. Sims K.B. Lewis J.G. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Tg8 MAO A KO mice was based upon an insertion of the interferon-B gene into the MAO A gene with a concomitant deletion of exons two and three of the MAO A gene. Four mRNA species were observed in Tg8 mice (20Cases O. Sief I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. De Maeyer E. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), none of which resulted in viable MAO A protein, whereas in the A863T point mutation MAO A/B KO mice, which harbors an early termination codon, no mRNA was observed by Northern blot (Fig. 2A). The A863T point mutant is near the MAO A point mutation seen in a Dutch family (17Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefiel X.O. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), where cytidine at position 936 (950 using GenBank™ accession number M68840) in exon 8 is mutated to thymine (C936T, numbering as cited in Ref.17Brunner H.G.

https://openalex.org/W1984033710,"Exposure of Neuro-2a and PC12 cells to micromolar concentrations of sulfite caused an increase in reactive oxygen species and a decrease in ATP. Likewise, the biosynthesis of ATP in intact rat brain mitochondria from the oxidation of glutamate was inhibited by micromolar sulfite. Glutamate-driven respiration increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and this was abolished by sulfite but the MMP generated by oxidation of malate and succinate was not affected. The increased rate of production of NADH from exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> and glutamate added to rat brain mitochondrial extracts was inhibited by sulfite, and mitochondria preincubated with sulfite failed to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup>. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in rat brain mitochondrial extract was inhibited dose-dependently by sulfite as was the activity of a purified enzyme. An increase in the <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> (glutamate) and a decrease in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> resulting in an attenuation in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> (glutamate) at 100 μm sulfite suggest a mixed type of inhibition. However, uncompetitive inhibition was noted with decreases in both <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> (NAD<sup>+</sup>) and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>, whereas <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> (NAD<sup>+</sup>) remained relatively constant. We propose that GDH is one target of action of sulfite, leading to a decrease in α-ketoglutarate and a diminished flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle accompanied by a decrease in NADH through the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a decreased MMP, and a decrease in ATP synthesis. Because glutamate is a major metabolite in the brain, inhibition of GDH by sulfite could contribute to the severe phenotype of sulfite oxidase deficiency in human infants."
https://openalex.org/W1979264410,"The aim of this research was to test the role of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme malate synthase (MLS) in lipid utilization, gluconeogenesis, and seedling growth in Arabidopsis. We hypothesized that in the absence of MLS, succinate produced by isocitrate lyase (ICL) could still feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas glyoxylate could be converted to sugars using enzymes of the photorespiratory pathway. To test this hypothesis we isolated knock-out mls mutants and studied their growth and metabolism in comparison to wild type and icl mutant seedlings. In contrast to icl seedlings, which grow slowly and are unable to convert lipid into sugars (Eastmond, P. J., Germain, V., Lange, P. R., Bryce, J. H., Smith, S. M. & Graham, I. A. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 5669-5674), mls seedlings grow faster, use their lipid more rapidly, and are better able to establish as plantlets. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses show that icl seedlings exhibit many features characteristic of carbohydrate starvation, whereas mls seedlings differ relatively little from wild type. In the light mls seedlings generate more sugars than icl seedlings, and when fed with [14C]acetate, 14C-labeling of sugars is three times greater than in icl seedlings and more than half that in wild type seedlings. The mls seedlings also accumulate more glycine and serine than icl or wild type seedlings, consistent with a diversion of glyoxylate into these intermediates of the photorespiratory pathway. We conclude that, in contrast to bacteria and fungi in which MLS is essential for gluconeogenesis from acetate or fatty acids, MLS is partially dispensable for lipid utilization and gluconeogenesis in Arabidopsis seedlings."

In their Perspective, [Ottino and Wiggins][1] discuss recent results in an important aspect of this field: micromixing. In contrast to everyday fluids, fluids flowing in small structures are dominated by viscous effects. This in turn makes mixing difficult. One approach for designing optimal mixing devices comes from the world of pure mathematics. In particular, a tool called a linked twist map offers the possibility of predicting which structures and designs make the best mixers.

Reversible receptor-mediated changes in β1 tyrosine phosphorylation may modulate its ability to recruit and associate with ankyrin (22Malhotra J.D. Koopmann M.C. Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Fettman N.

The association of ankyrin with β1 is mediated through a 16-amino acid segment of the β1 intracellular domain containing a tyrosine residue (Tyr181). This event occurs independently of β1 association with the ion-conducting pore. Phosphorylation of residue Tyr181 (or expression of a β1 mutant mimicking phosphorylation of Tyr181, β1Y181E) had no effect on β1-mediated cell adhesion but resulted in the inhibition of β1-mediated ankyrin recruitment in transfected Drosophila S2 cells as well as the inhibition of β1-ankyrin association as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained in cells expressing wild type β1 following treatment with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and orthovanadate to phosphorylate β1 on tyrosine residues. FIGQY phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of L1 family CAMs, such as neurofascin, abolishes their ability to interact with ankyrin, establishing specialized ankyrin-dependent and ankyrin-independent microdomains in neurons and epithelial cells (23Jenkins S.M.

These results suggest the presence of a novel signaling pathway that is important for the regulation of L1 family CAMs during developmental processes. We propose that tyrosine-phosphorylated β1 (pYβ1, containing phospho-Tyr181) and nonphosphorylated β1 may be differentially localized in excitable cells and thus interact with different cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. To test our hypothesis, we developed an antibody that specifically recognizes pYβ1. We then investigated the differential subcellular localization of β1 and pYβ1 in mouse ventricular myocytes. We found that although an antibody that recognized the extracellular region of β1, anti-β1ex (which detects both β1 and pYβ1), showed staining at the t-tubules as well as the intercalated disks, anti-pYβ1 stained intercalated disks and not t-tubules. Anti-β1ex staining colocalized with that of phalloidin and ankyrinB at z-lines/t-tubules as well as with connexin-43 at intercalated disks. Anti-pYβ1 colocalized with connexin-43, N-cadherin, and Nav1.5 at intercalated disks but not with z-line/t-tubule markers. β1Y181E, a β1 mutant that mimics tyrosine phosphorylation of residue Tyr181, does not associate with ankyrin in transfected cells and does not modulate sodium currents (21McEwen D.P.

In the present study we show that anti-pYβ1 immunoprecipitates N-cadherin from heart membranes and from cells transfected with β1 and N-cadherin in the absence of sodium channel α subunits, indicating that these two proteins associate. Nav1.5 channels and connexin-43 also associate with N-cadherin in heart as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. In contrast, pYβ1 does not associate with ankyrinB in heart membranes. Thus, we propose that sodium channel complexes at intercalated disks of ventricular myocytes are composed of tetrodotoxin-resistant Nav1.5 and pYβ1 and that these complexes are in close association with both N-cadherin and connexin-43. Sodium channels at t-tubules of cardiac myocytes are composed of TTX-S channels, such as Nav1.1 and Nav1.6, and nonphosphorylated β1 subunits. These complexes are proposed to be in close association with ankyrinB.

Briefly, intact hearts were dissected into warmed Basic Tyrode's solution (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.16 mm NaH2PO4, 3 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mg/ml heparin.

The perfusion solution was then switched to MT containing 0.6 mg/ml collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ), 0.28 mg/ml hyaluronidase, and 0.12 mg/ml protease IX (Sigma), 10 μm CaCl2 for a further 10–15 min. Following collagenase treatment, the hearts were removed from the perfusion apparatus, placed in MT with 25 mg/ml albumin and 0.15 μm CaCl2, and cut lengthwise into ∼2 × 4-mm strips using a razor blade. Individual myocytes were released by dissociation using a series of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes of diminishing bore diameter. All solutions used for myocyte extraction were maintained at 35 °C.

The heart was removed and incubated in perfusion solution at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. The next day the solution was changed to 30% sucrose, and the incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. Cryostat sections (0.4 μm thick) were cut, postfixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, treated for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and then blocked at room temperature in the same solution containing 5% newborn calf serum. Primary antibodies (as indicated in the figure legends) were then added in the above solution that also contained 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The sections were washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Secondary antibodies (also as indicated in the figure legends) were then added, and the incubation continued for 1.5 h at room temperature.

Specificity of the Antiphosphotyrosine β1 Subunit Antibody, Anti-pYβ1—The goal of this study was to determine the subcellular localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated sodium channel β1 subunits (pYβ1) in cardiac myocytes. To accomplish our goal we generated a polyclonal antibody against the peptide Ac-QENASE(pY)LAITC-amide. To demonstrate the specificity of anti-pYβ1 for pYβ1 subunits over nonphosphorylated β1, we used a previously described β1 mutant construct, β1Y181A (22Malhotra J.D. Koopmann M.C.

CHL cells were transfected with wild type β1 or β1Y181A cDNAs and then treated with FGF and orthovanadate as described previously to obtain tyrosine phosphorylation of β1 subunits (22Malhotra J.D.

The blot was first probed with anti-pYβ1 to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated β1 subunits (left) and then stripped and reprobed with anti-β1ex to detect both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms (right). Fig. 1 shows that only wild type β1 subunits and not β1Y181A subunits are recognized by anti-pYβ1 under phosphorylating conditions, whereas both wild type β1 and β1Y181A subunits are recognized by anti-β1ex. The presence of an immunoreactive signal in the β1Y181A lane with anti-β1ex shows that β1 protein was indeed expressed but not recognized by anti-pYβ1. Thus, anti-pYβ1 appears to be specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated β1 subunits. Immunocytochemical Analysis of Ventricular Sections—To investigate the subcellular localization of pYβ1 relative to Nav1.5 and connexin-43 in ventricular myocytes, we performed immunohistochemistry and analyzed our results using confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). We reported previously that β1, β2, and Nav1.1 colocalize with the z-line marker α-sarcomeric actin in ventricular myocytes (2Malhotra J.D. Chen C. Rivolta I. Abriel H. Malhotra R. Mattei L.N.

However, we did not analyze intercalated disks in that study. Using the same Nav1.5 antibody as Maier et al. (3Maier S.K. Westenbroek R.E. Schenkman K.A. Feigl E.O. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc.

Evol. 1993; 10: 497-511PubMed Google Scholar), deriving their name from the high histidine content (2Mac Kay B.J. Pollock J.J. Iacono V.J. Baum B.J. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 688-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oppenheim F.G. Xu T. Mc Millian F.M. Levitz S.M. Diamond R.D. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7472-7477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The powerful antifungal action of this class of peptides stimulated intense investigations concerning their properties, activity, structure, and secretion (4Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 480-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Until now, only two human genes, HTN1 (HIS1) and HTN2 (HIS2), localized on chromosome 4q13, have been recognized as responsible for their synthesis (1Sabatini L.M. Ota T. Azen E.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 497-511PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vanderspek J.C. Wyandt H.E. Skare J.C. Milunsky A. Oppenheim F.G. Troxler R.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1989; 45: 381-387PubMed Google Scholar). The products of these two genes are histatin 1 and histatin 3, respectively. The former is a peptide of 38 amino acids, phosphorylated at Ser-2, whereas the latter, 32 amino acid long with a sequence very similar to histatin 1, is not phosphorylated. Many other peptides of this family have been identified in human saliva, all sharing a sequence common to the two parent peptides. Although different classifications have been proposed, the current preferred nomenclature derives from the study of Troxler et al. (6Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Xu T. Vanderspeck J.C. Oppenheim F.G. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 69: 2-6Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), who identified in human saliva a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 26 residues of histatin 1, named histatin 2, and nine peptides, all related to the sequence of histatin 3 and named histatins 4–12. Except for histatin 2, the other minor histatins likely originated by proteolytic cleavages from histatin 3. Among them, histatin 5, showing a sequence identical to the first 24 amino acids of histatin 3, represents the major fragment because it is present in human saliva at a higher concentration than the other fragments. Moreover, it appears to display the highest specific activity against Candida albicans species with respect to all the other histatins (7Xu T. Levitz S.M. Diamond R.D. Oppenheim F.G. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By utilizing different separation protocols, other researchers identified several small peptides originating from histatin 3 (8Perinpanayagam H.E.R. Van Wuyckhuyse B.C. Ji Z.S. Tabak L.A. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sequences of histatins 1–12 and other fragments previously detected by other researchers are reported in Tables I and II. Studies by Xu et al. (9Xu L. Lal K. Pollock J.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 7: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) demonstrated that histatins 2 and 4, not present in freshly collected parotid saliva, appeared only after autoproteolytic histatin degradation. Therefore, the main questions arising from these data concern the site and timing of the cleavage processes. Although some experimental evidence has suggested that cleavage events should be confined either before or during glandular secretions, the post-secretion involvement of endogenous and exogenous proteases present in the oral cavity cannot be completely excluded, due to the time-consuming experimental scheme utilized for purification. In this respect, relevant results were obtained by Xu et al. (10Xu L. Lal K. Santarpia III, R.P. Pollock J.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), who submitted several synthetic histatins to the action of salivary proteases in vitro and identified the different products of proteolysis. Fragments were detected only after a relatively long incubation time, and they were different from known histatins. Because the biosynthetic origin of histatin-derived peptides may be important to their function, interest in the synthesis of these peptides continues. In order to obtain further insight into the genesis of the fragments, we applied the high-throughput analytical potential inherent to electrospray multidimensional mass spectrometry-high performance liquid chromatography, which allows a fast and reliable analysis of complex protein mixtures without time-consuming pre-separation steps. Whole human salivary samples, a few seconds after collection, were treated with an acidic solution and, after centrifugation, immediately analyzed by RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; SIM, selected ion monitoring; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; TIC, total ion current. ESI-MSn. This procedure reduced the time during which artifacts can originate by salivary proteolysis, and thus it supported the assumption that the results obtained may represent a reliable picture of peptides present in the oral cavity immediately after secretion. This approach permitted detection and identification of several unknown peptides derived from histatin 3, and it provided the suggestion that a sequential cleavage pathway operates during the biosynthesis of these peptides.Table IList of histatin 3 fragments searched in human saliva Open table in a new tab Table IIList of histatin 1 fragments searched in human saliva Open table in a new tab Reagents—All common chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Farmitalia-Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy), Merck, and Sigma. Apparatus—The HPLC-ESI-MS apparatus was a ThermoFinnigan (San Jose, CA) Surveyor HPLC connected by a T splitter to a PDA diode-array detector and to Xcalibur LCQ Deca XP Plus mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ion source (ESI). The chromatographic column was a Vydac (Hesperia, CA) C8 column, with a 5-μm particle diameter (column dimensions 150 × 2.1 mm). Sample Collection and Treatment—Whole human saliva was collected between 2 and 4 p.m. from four normal adult informed volunteers according to a standard protocol (11Castagnola M. Congiu D. Denotti G. Di Nunzio A. Fadda M.B. Melis S. Messana I. Misiti F. Murtas R. Olianas A. Piras V. Pittau A. Puddu G. J. Chromatogr. B. 2001; 751: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Collection time was standardized in order to reduce concentration variability connected to circadian rhythms of secretion. An acidic solution (0.2% trifluoroacetic acid) was immediately added to salivary samples in 1:1 v/v ratio, and the solution was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was separated from the precipitate and immediately analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. The following solutions were utilized for reversed-phase chromatography: eluent A, 0.056% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and eluent B, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water 80:20 (v/v). The gradient applied was linear from 0 to 55% in 40 min, at a flow rate of 0.30 ml/min. The T splitter addressed a flow rate of about 0.20 ml/min toward the diode array detector and a flow rate of 0.10 ml/min toward the ESI source. The diode array detector was usually set at a wavelength of 214–276 nm. Mass spectra were collected every 3 ms in the positive ion mode. MS spray voltage was 4.50 kV, and the capillary temperature was 220 °C. Tandem MS experiments were performed by detection of parent ions with a peak width of 2–4 m/z values with 40–60% of the maximum activation amplitude. Data Analysis—Deconvolution of averaged ESI mass spectra was automatically performed either by the software provided with the Deca-XP instrument (Bioworks Browser) or by MagTran 1.0 (13Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) software. Mass values obtained were compared with average theoretical values using PeptideMass and FindPept programs available at the Swiss-Prot Data Bank (us.expasy.org/tools), where human histatin 1 and histatin 3 are coded as P15515 and P15516, respectively. Theoretical tandem MS spectra were generated by utilizing the MS-Product program, available at the Protein Prospector site (prospector.ucsf.edu/). Whole human saliva was collected between 2 and 4 p.m. in order to reduce variations connected to circadian rhythms (11Castagnola M. Congiu D. Denotti G. Di Nunzio A. Fadda M.B. Melis S. Messana I. Misiti F. Murtas R. Olianas A. Piras V. Pittau A. Puddu G. J. Chromatogr. B. 2001; 751: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Guzman H. Leone C. Helmerorst E.J. Nunn M. Flora B. Troxler R.F. Oppenheim F.G. Arch. Oral Biol. 2004; 49: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immediately after collection, samples were mixed with an equal volume of aqueous 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was injected into the RP-HPLC ESI-ion trap-mass spectrometer apparatus. Fig. 1 shows the typical RP-HPLC profile of human saliva, with the elution ranges of the principal classes of peptides and proteins detected by this method. They are histatins, basic and acidic proline-rich proteins, defensins, statherin, and cystatins. In Fig. 1, upperpanel, the total ion current (TIC) profile recorded by the mass spectrometer is reported. The HPLC separation was also revealed by UV detection at 214 and 276 nm (not reported). The eluent was not directed toward the electrospray source for the first 3–5 min of separation in order to avoid damage to the ion trap-mass spectrometer, due to the elevated concentration of electrolytes. Although TIC (and UV) profiles did not reveal significant signals between 3 and 12 min, the mass spectrometer detected numerous ions, with m/z values attributable to small peptides. As an example, the 3rd and 4th panels of Fig. 1 show the m/z values revealed between 7.98 and 8.43 min, which correspond to different mono-, di-, and multicharged ions. With the aim of identifying, among the different ions, those pertaining to histatin fragments, we adopted two strategies. The first strategy was based on the following: (i) an extensive search for peptides with mass values lower than 4000 atomic mass units, performed along the entire chromatogram of the four salivary samples; (ii) a selection, among the masses detected, of the peptides with the masses expected for fragments originating either from histatin 1 or from its nonphosphorylated form or from histatin 3 by using FindPept program; (iii) an MS/MS experiment carried out on potential fragments, usually inducing the fragmentation of the double charged ion; and (iv) a comparison of the observed fragmentation patterns with those predictable for histatin fragments by the MS-Product program available on the ProteinProspector site. Figs. 2 and 3 exemplify the final steps of this strategy. Fig. 2 reports the selected ion monitoring (SIM) results obtained by searching the masses expected for the double charged fragments 1–11, 1–12, and 1–13 of histatin 3. Fig. 3 reports the MS/MS fragmentation spectra, which confirmed the sequence of these fragments.Fig. 3Fragmentation pattern resulting from the tandem MS experiment reported inFig. 2. The analysis allowed us to recognize the y and b fragmentation series, as well as many neutral losses and internal fragments, pertaining to peptides 1–11, 1–12, and 1–13 deriving from histatin 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The MS/MS experiments performed on the double charged ions allowed easy detection of the peaks corresponding to the y fragmentation pattern, but some fragments of the b pattern were undetectable. The first fragmentation of the double charged ions often corresponded to the neutral loss of one or two molecules of water or ammonia. In the presence of multiple arginine residues, a neutral loss of 44 atomic mass units, corresponding to the HN=CH–NH2 group, was often observed. Peptides having the same amino acid composition but different sequences usually show similar chromatographic behavior and therefore cannot be separated by HPLC. However, these peptides may generate different fragments by MS/MS experiments. Thus, an accurate analysis of fragmentation patterns may show the presence of two peptides in the same chromatographic peak. This is the case, for example, of the fragments 5–12 and 6–13 of histatin 3, which correspond to KRHHGYKR and RHHGYKRK sequences, respectively (Fig. 4). On the basis of the results obtained with this strategy, we were able to identify many known and unknown fragments of histatin 3 in the different samples tested. It is worth mentioning that the fragmentation patterns observed for the majority of peptides submitted to the MS/MS experiment could not be ascribed to any possible histatin fragment. Some of the fragments observed may also synthesized from histatin 1, which shares part of its sequence with histatin 3. However, no peptide fragments specific to histatin 1 were detected, suggesting that the fragments potentially resulting from both histatins originated solely from cleavage of histatin 3. As the second strategy, we searched all the masses of peptides complementary to those found, as well as the masses of all possible fragments originating from histatin 1 and its nonphosphorylated form by cleavage pathways similar to those observed for histatin 3. To this end a SIM analysis was carried out, followed by the MS/MS analysis performed usually on the double charged ion. This second strategy allowed us to detect other fragments potentially originating from histatin 3, but none were specific to histatin 1. A search in the HPLC profile of histatins 1, 3, 5, and 6 was performed by SIM strategy. The simultaneous detection in the same HPLC position of four multicharged ions for each histatin was considered experimental evidence sufficient for its identification. On the whole, among the 136 searched peptides potentially originating from histatin 3 by different cleavages (based on a total of 495 fragments resulting from any possible cleavage of histatin 3), we were able to identify the 24 fragments reported in Table I. As far as histatin 1 is concerned, the search of 119 peptides (based on a total of 775 possible fragments, comprising also the possible nonphosphorylated fragments) did not allow us to detect any fragment specifically originating from the parent peptide, comprising histatin 2 (see Table II). In Tables I and II, the double continuous line segments represent the fragments detected both in this work and in previous studies. Single continuous line segments represent the peptides detected in this study and, to our knowledge, not described until now. The boldface dashed line segments represent the peptides identified in other studies that we were not able to detect in our samples by using the strategies adopted. Finally, the dotted line segments represent peptides searched for and not found either in this study or in other studies reported in the literature. In Table II, the peptides originating from putative cleavage of histatin 1 sharing a common sequence with fragments derived from histatin 3 are labeled by an asterisk. Table II clearly shows that no fragment specific to histatin 1 was found. Table III reports the detection (asterisks) of the fragments in Table I in the four subjects under study. Sixteen fragments were found in the saliva of all the subjects; four fragments were found in three subjects, and four fragments were found in the saliva of two subjects. As far as all the other peptides searched for are concerned, in one of the four volunteers we observed a mass corresponding to fragment 18–24 from histatin 3 but which showed an ambiguous tandem MS (not reported).Table IIIDetection (asterisks) of the histatin 3 fragments in the four samples analyzedFragmentSynonimSubject1234Histatin3 1/11****Histatin3 1/12****Histatin3 1/13****Histatin3 1/24Histatin 5****Histatin3 1/25Histatin 6****Histatin3 5/11Histatin 12****Histatin3 5/12Histatin 11***Histatin3 5/13****Histatin3 6/11****Histatin3 6/13**Histatin3 7/11****Histatin3 7/12****Histatin3 7/13****Histatin3 12/24Histatin 7****Histatin3 12/25Histatin 9**Histatin3 13/24Histatin 8****Histatin3 13/25Histatin 10****Histatin3 14/24****Histatin3 14/25***Histatin3 15/24****Histatin3 15/25***Histatin3 26/32**Histatin3 28/32**Histatin3 29/32**** Open table in a new tab Finally, Fig. 5 reports the elution times of all the histatins and histatin fragments observed under the experimental conditions reported under “Material and Methods.” The different fragments of histatin 3, already detected in human saliva (4Tsai H.

Res. 1995; 74: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are reported in Table I either as double continuous line segments (peptides found also in the present study) or as boldface dashed line segments (not found in the present study). These results were not obtained by a systematic search of histatin-derived peptides. The more systematic approach carried out in the present study by HPLC-tandem MS on whole human saliva allowed quite a comprehensive view of histatin 3 fragmentation patterns, because it was based on the search for the most probable fragments, and the information obtained was also derived from nondetected peptides (Tables I, II, III). For instance, lack of detection of histatin 2 and 4, the main and first products of salivary protease action, strongly supports the assumption that no artifacts are generated by salivary proteolysis under our experimental conditions (9Xu L. Lal K. Pollock J.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 7: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This assumption also agrees with lack of detection of almost all the fragments obtained by Xu et al.(10Xu L. Lal K. Santarpia III, R.P. Pollock J.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) through salivary proteolysis of synthetic histatins. The analysis was performed on whole saliva instead of selected glandular secretions with the aim of investigating any possible histatin source. In fact, preliminary data suggested that histatins are secreted not only by parotid glands but also by other minor glands of the oral cavity. Most of the observed peptide cleavages are trypsin-like. The 26–32, 28–32, and 29–32 peptides were the only C-terminal fragments detected. This finding suggests that Arg-25 should be the first site of cleavage of histatin 3, and hence histatin 6 and the 26–32 peptide should be the first fragments generated. Then, an exo-protease should synthesize histatin 5 and the fragments 28–32 and 29–32. Similarly, the lack of fragments starting from Lys-5/Arg-6 and ending with Tyr-24/Arg-25 suggested that the KRKF residues (11–14 positions) represent the second cleavage site and the AKR residues (4–6 positions) the final third cleavage site. Arg-22 and Lys-17 do not represent cleavage sites at all. The observed cleavages suggest the involvement of a proprotein convertase belonging to the kexin/subtilisin family, enzymes expressed in many tissues, where their active forms are localized in the trans-Golgi network and small secretory vesicles (14Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Indeed, the human proprotein convertase 1 (hPC1), an endocrine and neural convertase, was able to cleave in vitro synthetic histatin 3 primarily at the Arg-25 residue with minor cleavage at Arg-6 (15Basak A. Ernst B. Brewer D. Seidah N.G. Munzer J.S. Lazure C. Lajoie G.A. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Chan and Bennick (16Chan M. Bennick A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3423-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that intrinsic furin, the first proprotein convertase to be identified, may be responsible for in vivo cleavage of a basic proline-rich protein precursors in human submandibular cell lines. Moreover, the expression of the trypsin-like serine protease gene, PRSS20, a putative new member of the human kallikrein family, has recently been recognized in human salivary glands (17Yousef G.M. Scorilas A. Diamandis E.P. Genomics. 2000; 63: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of any information regarding its specificity, the action of this enzyme on histatin 3 processing cannot be confirmed. Lack of detection of specific fragments related to histatin 1 agrees well with other studies (9Xu L. Lal K. Pollock J.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 7: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One significant structural difference between histatin 1 and histatin 3 is represented by the phosphorylation at Ser-2 of the former peptide. Even though the phosphate group does not represent a hindrance to exploiting protease action (indeed histatin 1 can be cleaved by salivary proteases (10Xu L. Lal K. Santarpia III, R.P. Pollock J.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), phosphorylation can potentially represent a signal for differential processing. The results of the present study suggest another possible rationalization of the different sensitivity of the two major histatins to proteolysis. In fact, histatin 1 lacks an amino acid equivalent to the Arg-25 residue of histatin 3, which seems to represent the first crucial cleavage site for this peptide. In conclusion, two main questions arise from the results of the study. (a) Can the present fragmentation pattern of histatins be considered definitive? The answer should be negative for the following reasons. (i) Different fragmentation pathways linked to individual variations could be observed, and it must be outlined that our analysis was performed on a limited number of subjects. (ii) Some fragments could be present at a concentration lower than the detection limit of our analytical method. (iii) Some fragments could not be detected by the mass spectrometer. For example, fragment 6–12 of histatin 3 was not found, even though it should be present in salivary secretion, because of similarity with other identified fragments (see Table I). Moreover, fragments 1–4, 1–5, and 1–6, potentially present in human saliva on the basis of the presence of other complementary peptides (i.e. 7–11), two of them effectively observed by other researchers, (Table II) (8Perinpanayagam H.E.R. Van Wuyckhuyse B.C. Ji Z.S. Tabak L.A. J. Dent. Res. 1995; 74: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were not detected by us. These very polar peptides are expected to elute in the first minutes of the chromatographic separation, together with high salt amounts, when the eluent cannot be directed toward the MS apparatus. In order to overcome this problem we reduced salt concentration by applying a desalting C18 ZipTip procedure to the sample before the HPLC-MS analysis (data not reported). Unfortunately, after this desalting step not only were we unable to detect the 1–4, 1–5, and 1–6 fragments but we also verified the loss of almost all the small fragments detected in the undesalted sample. On the other hand, the direct injection in the MS apparatus of whole saliva and the attempt to begin the MS detection at 1.50 min caused a strong increase in noise and a significant sensitivity reduction because of ion suppression. (b) What does this histatin proteolytic cascade mean from a physiological point of view? Antifungal properties of histatin 5 against C. albicans species were largely demonstrated (4Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 480-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Xu T. Vanderspeck J.C. Oppenheim F.G. J. Dent.

Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), implying an action on energized mitochondria (18Helmerhorst E.J. Breeuwer P. van't Hof W. Walgreen-Weterings E. Oomen L.C.J.M.

Moreover, various studies performed with peptide-histatin analogues (19Helmerhorst E.J. van't Hof W. Veerman E.C.I. Simoons-Smit I. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Rothstein D.M. Spacciapoli P. Tran L.T. Xu T. Roberts F.D. Dalla Serra M. Buxton D.K. Oppheneim F.G. Friden P. Antimicrob.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5526-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) pointed out that the central sequence starting from Lys-11 and ending with Tyr-24 seems to be crucial for the antifungal activity. For instance, Arg-22 seems essential for the biological activity (22Tsai H. Bobek L.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragmentation pathway shown in this study, directed toward the genesis of different central fragments, agrees well with the results of structure-activity investigations. However, little is known about the role of the small terminal fragments, which may also play a significant role in the oral cavity and should be further investigated. Finally, we wish to observe that even though the name “histatins” is a suitable choice, the large number of new histatin fragments detected in this study suggests adoption of a more rational nomenclature, capable of including present and future identifications. To this purpose we suggest the nomenclature “histatinx y/z”, where x refers to the parent histatin (1 or 3) and y/z represents the position in the parent sequence of the first and last amino acid residues. Histatin 3 fragments reported in Table III have been named following the proposed nomenclature."

Retinoic acid (RA) consistently induces TGase expression and activation, and it was shown recently that RA-induced TGase expression was inhibited in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts co-stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF).

Exposure of cells to a TGase inhibitor or expression of a dominant-negative form of TGase potently inhibited EGF-mediated protection from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, expression of exogenous TGase in SKBR3 cells mimicked the survival advantage of EGF, suggesting that TGase activation is necessary and sufficient for the antiapoptotic properties of EGF.

Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The transamidation activity of TGase is highly regulated as underscored by the following two points. First, only a few proteins have been shown to serve as substrates for TGase transamidation in vivo (3Oliverio S. Amendola A. Di Sano F. Farrace M.G. Fesus L. Nemes Z. Piredda L. Spinedi A.

Second, the cross-linking of substrates by TGase occurs only after TGase has proceeded through multiple regulatory events resulting in a TGase species capable of enzymatic activity. One such event involves the ability of TGase to bind and hydrolyze GTP. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the binding of GTP, but not GDP, to TGase inhibits its enzymatic activity (6Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol.

However, the exact mechanism of how GTP binding and hydrolysis regulate the transamidation activity of TGase has yet to be elucidated fully (1Folk J.E. Annu. Rev.

For example, retinoic acid (RA), which has received attention as a cancer therapy because of its growth-inhibitory activity, is a consistent inducer of TGase expression and activation (8Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A.

RA-mediated TGase enzymatic activity was shown to be essential for neurite extension in SH-SY5Y cells (11Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V.

Conversely, RA-mediated TGase expression was suppressed in fibroblasts expressing an oncogenic form of Ras (16Antonyak M.A. McNeill C.J. Wakshlag J.J. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15859-15866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Kosa K. Meyers K. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), implying that retinoid-stimulated TGase expression was inconsistent with the Ras-transformed phenotype. As a result of these and similar findings, such as the proposed use of TGase hypoexpression as a biomarker for prostate cancer (18Birckbichler P.J. Bonner R.B. Hurst R.E. Bane B.L. Pitha J.V. Hemstreet III, G.P. Cancer. 2000; 89: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it has become generally accepted that TGase promotes cellular processes that limit cell number. However, recent evidence suggests that TGase may not be detrimental to the growth of all cell types. For instance, exogenous expression of TGase in mouse fibroblasts not only provided a protective effect from serum deprivation-mediated apoptosis but also did not compromise the proliferative capacity of these cells (16Antonyak M.A. McNeill C.J. Wakshlag J.J. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15859-15866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aberrant TGase expression has been noted in some human brain and breast tumors (19Hettasch J.M. Bandarenko N. Burchette J.L. Lai T.S. Marks J.R. Haroon Z.A. Peters K. Dewhirst M.W.

Neurobiol. 1997; 23: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but the relevance of TGase overexpression to the progression of these cancers is unknown. New insights regarding the regulation and function of TGase have come from studies investigating the effect of signaling events on TGase expression and activation (16Antonyak M.A. McNeill C.J. Wakshlag J.J. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15859-15866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Kosa K. Meyers K. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The Ras extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase-AKT pathway are signal transduction cascades that have received attention for their ability to mediate growth factor-stimulated processes such as inducing cell cycle progression and promoting cell survival (24Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In addition to growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF), retinoids can stimulate the activation of these same pathways in certain cell types (22Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Lopez-Carballo G. Moreno L. Masia S. Perez P. Barettino D. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 361: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); therefore, it was asked whether the ability of RA and EGF to activate the Ras-ERK and PI 3-kinase-AKT pathways influenced TGase expression and activation in the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (16Antonyak M.A. McNeill C.J. Wakshlag J.J. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15859-15866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Stimulation by RA resulted in the activation of PI 3-kinase, which is required for the induction of TGase expression and GTP binding ability. In contrast, stimulation by EGF antagonized the ability of RA to induce TGase expression by activating the Ras-ERK pathway. The use of mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) for these studies proved valuable in revealing complex signaling profiles that govern the activation of TGase, yet whether the same signaling events regulate TGase expression and activation in other cell types remains to be established. We decided to examine the effects of EGF on RA-stimulated TGase expression and activation in the human breast cancer cells. In contrast to NIH3T3 cells, EGF did not inhibit RA-induced TGase expression and activation in SKBR3 cells, nor in MDAMB468 or BT-20 cells. Even more intriguing was that EGF stimulation alone promoted TGase expression and activation more efficiently than RA. Both RA- and EGF-induced TGase expression required PI 3-kinase activity in SKBR3 cells, implicating PI 3-kinase as a common regulator of growth factor- and retinoid-mediated TGase expression in these cells. Inhibiting EGF-stimulated TGase activity resulted in a nearly complete loss of EGF-mediated protection from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in both SKBR3 and BT-20 cells, whereas the ectopic expression of TGase in SKBR3 cells was sufficient to confer resistance from the chemotherapeutic agent. These findings suggest for the first time that EGF-stimulated TGase activity contributes to the oncogenic potential of breast cancer cells by promoting chemoresistance. Materials—LY294002 and doxorubicin were obtained from Calbiochem, and EGF was from Invitrogen. RA and monodansyl cadaverine (MDC) were purchased from Sigma, and the 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine was from Pierce. The TGase antibody was obtained from Neomarkers; the actin antibody was from Sigma, and the phospho-ERK and -AKT antibodies and cleaved caspase 3 antibody were from Cell Signaling. The EGF receptor and the phospho-EGF receptor antibodies were purchased from Transduction Labs, and the HA and Myc antibodies were from Covance. [α-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all additional material was obtained from Fisher unless stated otherwise. Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, and SKBR3, MDAMB231, MDAMB468, and BT-20 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin. The cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the various treatments described, the cells were grown to near confluence in medium containing 10% serum, and then medium containing 1% serum or no serum (as indicated under “Results”) with 5 μm RA and/or 100 ng/ml EGF, ±7 μm LY294002 and ±0.2 μm doxorubicin, was added for the times indicated under “Results.” Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphoric acid, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.35). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates from each sample were combined with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.02% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The filters were incubated with the various primary antibodies diluted in TBST overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with TBST. To detect the primary antibodies, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and diluted 1:5000 in TBST was incubated with the filters for 1 h, followed by three washes with TBST. The protein bands were visualized on x-ray film after exposing the filters to chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Photoaffinity Labeling of TGase—Photoaffinity labeling of TGase was performed by incubating whole cell lysates with 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 μm AMP-PNP for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were placed in an ice bath, irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 15 min, mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled. SDS-PAGE was performed, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters and exposure on x-ray film. Transamidation Assay—TGase transamidation assays were performed as described previously (27Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 15 μg of whole cell extracts were incubated in a buffer containing 2 mm 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine, 40 mm CaCl2, and 40 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling. The reactions were then resolved on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and then blocked overnight with BBST (100 mm boric acid, 20 mm sodium borate, 0.01% SDS, 0.01% Tween 20, and 80 mm NaCl) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, diluted 1:3000 in BBST for 2 h at room temperature, and then washed five times with BBST. The proteins that incorporated 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine were visualized on x-ray film after exposing the filters to chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear Condensation or Blebbing Assay—Cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and grown in complete medium for 2 days. The cells were then incubated in medium containing 1% serum ±100 ng/ml EGF and ±10 μm MDC for 2 days. The cultures were then incubated with fresh medium containing EGF and MDC and ±0.2 μm doxorubicin for an additional 1.5 days and were fixed and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed nuclei and/or blebbing. Cell Growth Assays—Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown in medium containing 0.5% serum ± 5 μm RA and ±100 ng/ml EGF. Every 2 days the medium was changed. At 0, 2, 4, and 6 days of treatment, the cells were collected and counted. EGF Stimulates TGase Expression and Activation in SKBR3 Cells—Previous work on the regulation of TGase activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed that RA-induced TGase expression and activation could be blocked by EGF stimulation (16Antonyak M.A. McNeill C.J. Wakshlag J.J. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15859-15866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To expand upon this finding, we investigated whether the same interplay that exists between EGF and RA on TGase expression and activation in NIH3T3 cells also occurs in other cell lineages. Because it has been well established that activation of the EGF receptor promotes cell growth and survival and because overexpression of the EGF receptor has been implicated in the progression of several types of human cancers (28Wong A.J. Zoltick P.W. Moscatello D.K. Semin. Oncol. 1994; 21: 39-48Google Scholar), we felt that conducting these experiments in tumor cells that overexpress the EGF receptor had the potential to be interesting. To this end, we chose to study the effects of EGF on RA-induced TGase expression in SKBR3 cells, as well as other human breast cancer cell lines. We felt that SKBR3 cells were particularly well suited for this study because they not only were shown previously to express the EGF receptor at relatively high levels (29Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Zhang L. Bewick M. Lafrenie R.M. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but also were found to be responsive to RA stimulation as indicated by changes in gene transcription following exposure to the retinoid (31Sapi E. Flick M.B. Tartaro K. Kim S. Rakhlin Y. Rodov S. Kacinski B.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5578-5585PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (panel labeled αEGFR) shows that both NIH3T3 and SKBR3 cells express detectable amounts of the EGF receptor as determined by Western blot analysis. Consistent with reports showing that SKBR3 cells overexpress the EGF receptor (29Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Zhang L. Bewick M. Lafrenie R.M. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the level of EGF receptor expression in SKBR3 cells was considerably higher than in NIH3T3 cells. We then assayed the ability of EGF to activate its receptor and stimulate intercellular signaling events in the cancer cell line. This was accomplished through the use of antibodies that specifically recognize the activated form of the EGF receptor or AKT and ERK, two signaling molecules consistently activated in an EGF receptor-dependent manner. Treatment of SKBR3 cells with EGF for 5 min resulted in EGF receptor activation (Fig. 1, panel labeled αactive EGFR). Coinciding with this activation were increases in the activities of both AKT (Fig. 1, αactive AKT) and ERK (Fig. 1, αactive ERK), indicating the EGF receptor was capable of signaling in these cells. We then examined whether RA could up-regulate TGase expression and activation in SKBR3 cells. As shown in our previous work (8Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and again here, NIH3T3 cells stimulated with RA for 2 days induced TGase expression (Fig. 2A, αTGase) and GTP binding activity (Fig. 2A, [α-32P]GTP) as measured by the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into TGase. Parallel experiments conducted on SKBR3 cells showed that RA treatment increased TGase expression over the nearly undetectable amounts of TGase protein in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2A, αTGase). Accompanying this increase in TGase expression was a modest increase in the incorporation of radiolabeled GTP (Fig. 2A, [α-32P]GTP). The above data establish that SKBR3 cells express relatively high levels of functional EGF receptor and that TGase expression and activation can be augmented by RA stimulation of these cells. Thus, we were in the position to examine the effects of EGF on RA-mediated TGase expression in a cancer cell line that overexpresses the EGF receptor. As shown in Fig. 2A (panel labeled αTGase), exposure of SKBR3 cells to EGF did not inhibit RA-induced TGase expression, unlike the case of NIH3T3 cells. Perhaps even more interesting, EGF treatment alone was sufficient to up-regulate TGase expression. The EGF-induced TGase was active as indicated by increased GTP binding (Fig. 2A, [α-32P]GTP) and transamidation activity (Fig. 2B) as readout by the incorporation of 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine into proteins from cell extracts. It is worth noting that although both RA and EGF induced TGase expression in SKBR3 cells, the growth factor was more effective than RA at stimulating the GTP binding and enzymatic activity of TGase. We had earlier obtained evidence in HeLa cells suggesting that the regulated expression of TGase can be uncoupled from the regulation of its GTP binding and transamidation activities (32Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, EGF is apparently able to mediate effectively the regulation of both TGase expression and functional activity in SKBR3 cells. Because EGF, a known mitogen and survival factor (24Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 28Wong A.J. Zoltick P.W. Moscatello D.K. Semin. Oncol. 1994; 21: 39-48Google Scholar), strongly induced the expression and activation of TGase, a protein that has most often been linked to apoptosis or cell differentiation (3Oliverio S. Amendola A. Di Sano F. Farrace M.G. Fesus L. Nemes Z. Piredda L. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6040-6048Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we next asked how EGF stimulation would affect the growth rate of SKBR3 cells. Fig. 2C shows that SKBR3 cells were able to proliferate in low serum medium, a characteristic often associated with cancer cells. While RA treatment severely diminished the growth of the cancer cell line, EGF treatment did not. The fact that EGF stimulation did not impede the growth of SKBR3 cells, despite strongly activating TGase, indicates that the induction of TGase expression and activation is not necessarily detrimental to the growth rate of SKBR3 cells. The unique regulation of TGase expression and activation observed in SKBR3 cells was not limited to this cell line, as EGF treatment also enhanced TGase expression in the human breast cancer cell lines MDAMB468 and BT-20 (Fig. 2D). Moreover, MDAMB231 cells were also found to exhibit a profile of TGase expression and activation that was different from NIH3T3 cells. TGase protein was detected in MDAMB231 cells even in the absence of treatment with RA or EGF (Fig. 2A, αTGase). This TGase species displayed GTP binding (Fig. 2A, [α-32P]GTP) and enzymatic transamidation activity (Fig. 2B) that was comparable with the TGase activity seen in SKBR3 cells treated with EGF. Growth factor stimulation did not alter the constitutive level of TGase expression or activation in MDAMB231 cells, indicating that EGF-mediated signaling was not a negative regulator of TGase expression in these breast cancer cells as well as in the other cancer cell lines analyzed. The findings associating constitutive or EGF-induced TGase expression and activation in these different breast cancer cells suggest that in addition to being stimulated by factors that induce cell differentiation or apoptosis, TGase activity can also be positively regulated by stimuli associated with cell growth and survival.

IP3 in turn releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores via IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) resulting in the activation of a variety of Ca2+-dependent processes.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6134) Google Scholar, 2Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R.

Because of its central role in these responses, the ability to quantitatively monitor temporal changes in [IP3]i in single living cells is of vital importance to understanding these phenomena. Since IP3Rs are the natural physiological target for IP3, we reasoned that their IP3-binding domain (4Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) might be used to construct an effective and specific intracellular IP3 detector. Here we describe such a ratiometric fluorescent biosensor that in addition allows for in situ calibration. We demonstrate the utility of this biosensor by examining the relationship between the responses of [IP3]i and [Ca2+]i in single living cells. Media—Hanks' balanced salt solution with Hepes (HBSS-H) contained 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Intracellular-like medium (ICM) contained 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, and appropriate concentrations of CaCl2 (330 μm CaCl2 for 50 nm free Ca2+) (6Tanimura A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30904-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—A CFP/YFP fusion construct was made by cutting EYFP out of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) using BamHI and XbaI and ligating into pECFP-C1 (Clontech) cut with the same enzymes. The multiple cloning site of this vector was then removed by cutting with BspEI and BamHI and replaced with a linker generated from two synthetic oligonucleotides. The forward sequence of this linker was TCC GGA AAG CTC GAG GCA GTA AGA TCT GGC TCC GCC GAC GAT GAC GAT AAG GCC GGA TCT GTC GAC GCA GTC GGA TCC, where the reconstituted BspEI and BamHI sites have been included for clarity and the sequence has been parsed into codons. This fusion construct was referred to as pCY-N. The linker plus EYFP sequence of pCY-N was then cut out with BsrGI and ligated into pECFP-mem (Clontech) cut with the same enzyme. Finally the multiple cloning site originating from pECFP-mem was removed by cutting with Eco47III and SmaI and religating. The resultant construct, mCY, codes for ECFP preceded by the N-terminal 20 amino acids of neuromodulin (a membrane-targeting signal) and followed by the above linker and EYFP. To construct LIBRA (luminous inositol trisphosphate-binding domain for ratiometric analysis) the IP3-binding domain of the rat type 3 IP3R (amino acids 1–604) was amplified by PCR using pCB-EGFP: IP3R3 (7Morita T. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Tojyo T. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as the template and incorporating XhoI sites at either end. This sequence was then ligated into the XhoI site in the linker region of mCY using standard methods. LIBRAΔN was constructed in the same way using amino acids 227–604 of the rat type 3 IP3R (8Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward PCR primers used were ACG CAT ACT CGA GAT GAA TGA AAT GTC CAG C for LIBRA and AAG CAT ACT CGA GTT CCG GGA CCA TCT GGA G for LIBRAΔN. The same reverse primer, AGC GTA TCT CGA GCT TCC GGT TGT TGT GCA G, was used for both PCR reactions. The correctness of all constructs was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—SH-SY5Y cells purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with low glucose (100 mg/ml), supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 584 mg/ml l-glutamine, 110 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Fluorescence—SH-SY5Y cells were grown on fibronectin-coated glass cover slips incorporated into an experimental chamber (6Tanimura A. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30904-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with HBSS-H and rested for at least 15 min prior to experiments. In some experiments, cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation for 5 min at room temperature in HBSS-H containing 0.25–0.5 μm fura-2/AM (Dojin Chemicals, Kumamoto, Japan). Cells in HBSS-H or Ca2+-free HBSS-H (in which 1.3 mm CaCl2 was replaced with 0.1 mm EGTA) were stimulated by exposure to various concentration of acetylcholine (Ach) or 1 μm ionomycin as indicated. Permeabilization was performed by exposing cells to ICM containing 100 μg/ml (w/v) saponin (ICN, Cleveland, OH) for ∼1 min. Permeabilized cells were washed with ICM and then exposed to ICM containing various concentrations of IP3 and other reagents. Fluorescence images were captured using a dual-wavelength ratio imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) consisting of a cooled CCD camera (HiSCA) and W-View optics coupled to a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon Fluor 40 oil immersion objective (NA 1.3). Fluorescence of LIBRA, LIBRAΔN, and mCY were monitored with excitation at 425 nm and dual-emission at 480 and 535 nm. Simultaneous monitoring of LIBRA and fura-2 was performed with sequential excitation at 380 nm (for fura-2) and 425 nm (for LIBRA) and dual-emission at 480 nm (for LIBRA) and 535 nm (for LIBRA and fura-2). Data were analyzed with AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Photonics). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the fura-2 fluorescence intensity, F, using the formula [Ca2+] = Kd(F — Fmin)/(Fmax — F), where Kd = 135 nm, and Fmin and Fmax are the values of F at zero and limitingly high [Ca2+], respectively (9Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fmin was determined by assuming that the resting [Ca2+]i was 50 nm; Fmax was measured following the application of 1 μm ionomycin. We designed two potential IP3 biosensors (Fig. 1a and see “Experimental Procedures”) consisting of the IP3-binding domain of the rat type 3 IP3R (8Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) fused between the well established FRET pair CFP and YFP (10Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar, 11Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and preceded by the N-terminal 20 amino acids of neuromodulin (12Skene J.H.P. Virág I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), a plasma membrane-targeting signal. The first of these constructs, which we refer to as LIBRA contains residues 1–604 of the rat type 3 IP3R, while LIBRAΔN contains residues 227–604. The control molecule mCY lacks the IP3-binding domain. Using confocal microscopy we found that these recombinant proteins localized to the plasma membrane and Golgi area when expressed in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (data not shown); also ∼90% of their fluorescence was retained by the cells after permeabilization with saponin (Fig. 1b). We looked for FRET between CFP and YFP by exciting CFP at 425 nm and recording emitted fluorescence at 480 and 535 nm. When permeabilized SH-SY5Y cells transfected with LIBRA were exposed to 10 μm IP3 an increase in the 480 nm signal (∼4.5%) and a parallel decrease in the 535 nm signal (∼3.6%) were observed within ∼1 s (Fig. 1c). By contrast neither LIBRAΔN nor mCY showed any detectable fluorescence changes in response to 10 μm IP3 (Fig. 1d). The CFP donor quenching of LIBRA that was relieved by YFP acceptor photobleaching (13Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) was ∼3.9% in the presence of 10 μm IP3 and ∼8.6% in its absence, confirming that the FRET efficiency of LIBRA is decreased in its IP3-bound form. It has been demonstrated that residues 226–576 of the mouse type 1 IP3R constitute the essential “core” region required for high affinity IP3 binding and that the N-terminal 225 residues act to suppress the IP3 binding affinity of the core (14Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori S.C. Tanaka T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LIBRAΔN, which lacks this N-terminal suppressor region, shows no IP3-dependent changes in fluorescence. Accordingly we speculate that the conformational change underlying the IP3-dependent LIBRA FRET signal could be related to an effect of IP3 on the interaction between the core and suppressor regions. Changes in the LIBRA 480/535 nm emission ratio (ΔRatio) were highly sensitive to [IP3] and selective for 1,4,5-IP3versus other inositol phosphates (Fig. 2). ΔRatio had a monophasic dependence on [IP3] with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 404 nm and Hill coefficient (n) of 1.118 (Fig. 2b). The Kd for adenophostin A, a more potent agonist for the IP3R than IP3 (15Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was 65 nm and we estimate that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (IP2), and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (1,3,4-IP3) bind to LIBRA with Kd values of ∼15, ∼40, and »10 μm, respectively (Fig. 2b). It is known that the activity of the IP3R is modulated by Ca2+ (16Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 17Iino M. Endo M. Nature. 1992; 360: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and ATP (18Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2147-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), although their effects are not mediated by the IP3-binding domain (5Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Miyakawa T. Mizushima A. Hirose K. Yamazawa A. Bezprozvanny I. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In control experiments we have confirmed that both Ca2+ (0–1 μm) and ATP (0–3 mm) have no effect on LIBRA fluorescence or on the ΔRatio seen in response to IP3 (Fig. 2c). We also found that, while changes in pH affected the basal emission ratio as a result of the well known effects of pH on YFP fluorescence (13Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), the ΔRatio elicited by IP3 was unaffected over the pH range 7.0–7.6 (Fig. 2d). Taken together the above results show that ΔRatio (at constant pH) is a sensitive and specific measure of [IP3]. We next used the ΔRatio of LIBRA to follow the dynamics of [IP3]i after muscarinic stimulation of intact SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3a). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, application of 10 or 100 μm Ach increased ΔRatio in >80% of LIBRA-expressing cells, and 1 μm Ach elicited a response in ∼60% of the cells tested. Increasing [Ca2+]i with ionomycin had no effect on ΔRatio (Fig. 3, a and e) and the application of 100 μm Ach caused no changes in fluorescence in either mCY-expressing cells or in cells loaded with the intracellular pH indicator BCECF (data not shown), confirming the specificity of the LIBRA response. The PLC inhibitor U73122 (20Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar) completely blocked the Ach-induced increase in ΔRatio but had no effect on the resting emission ratio (Fig. 3b) suggesting that the resting [IP3]i in these cells is below the detectable range of LIBRA. The magnitude of the LIBRA ΔRatio response increased with [Ach] reaching a maximum 2–5 min after stimulation (Fig. 3, a and c). As discussed in more detail below the time scale of these responses is much longer than the onset of Ach-induced Ca2+ spikes in this cell type (5–20 s). Peak ΔRatio values were similar in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3c); however, significant differences were seen in the time courses of these responses (Fig. 3a). In the presence of Ca2+,in 20 out of 32 responding cells, ΔRatio rose monotonically to a sustained maximum level, while in the remaining 12 cells ΔRatio rose to a peak then fell to a plateau level that was >50% of the maximal response. In contrast, in the absence of Ca2+, only 9 out of 43 responding cells showed a sustained rise in ΔRatio in response to Ach; in the remaining 34 cells ΔRatio rose to a peak then fell to a value close to resting levels. In both experimental conditions the application of Ach typically elicited a rapid spike in [Ca2+]i (monitored using fura-2), which then fell to a lower sustained level above base line in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and to base-line levels in its absence (data not shown). The sustained rise in ΔRatio in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and the transient rise in its absence (Fig. 3a) suggest a role for a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i in maintaining increased [IP3] i. To look for effects of LIBRA expression on Ach-induced Ca2+ release, we examined the latency for the onset of Ca2+ spikes after Ach stimulation. Following the application of 1 μm Ach in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ this latency was 16.7 ± 4.2 s (n = 11) in LIBRA-expressing cells and 18.9 ± 2.0 s (n = 24) in non-expressing cells. Since any buffering of intracellular [IP3]by LIBRA would have been expected to increase this latency (i.e. to delay the Ca2+ spike), these results are consistent with the hypothesis that LIBRA expression has little if any buffering effect on intracellular IP3 levels under our experimental conditions. To directly explore the relationship between the Ach-induced [IP3]i response and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, we monitored the fluorescence of both LIBRA and the [Ca2+]i indicator fura-2 simultaneously in the same cells in Ca2+-free medium. In experiments where cells were exposed to two successive applications of a low [Ach], the second application of Ach consistently elicited a significant but smaller increase in [IP3]i than the first and was accompanied by little or no increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3d), consistent with previous observations that submaximal [IP3] leads to a partial depletion of stored Ca2+ (21Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in similar experiments in Ca2+ containing medium both applications of Ach resulted in comparable increases in both [IP3]i and [Ca2+]i (data not shown). Interestingly, at Ach concentrations ≥3 μm (and in some instances at 1 μm) the peak of the [IP3]i response consistently occurred after the peak in [Ca2+]i so that [IP3]i was still rising as [Ca2+]i fell (Fig. 3, d and e). Similar results were observed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (data not shown). At low [Ach] a subsequent application of a higher [Ach] resulted in additional Ca2+ release (Fig. 3d) indicating that this temporal dissociation of the [IP3]i and [Ca2+]i responses is not due to the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Additional experimentation will be required to clarify this interesting relationship between [IP3]i and [Ca2+]i. By assuming that the response of the LIBRA ΔRatio to IP3 is the same in intact and permeabilized cells, one can convert the above LIBRA signals to [IP3]i using the concentration-response curve shown in Fig. 2b. Consistent with this assumption we have confirmed that the increase in ΔRatio due to microinjection of a supramaximal concentration of IP3 into intact LIBRA-expressing cells is not significantly different from the maximal increase in ΔRatio due to IP3 in permeabilized cells (data not shown). Thus we estimate that the threshold [IP3]i required to elicit a Ca2+ spike in SH-SY5Y cells (ΔRatio ∼ 0.008) is ∼50 nm. This value is very close to the threshold concentration of photoreleased IP3 (∼60 nm) previously found to be required for triggering [Ca2+]i spikes in Xenopus oocytes (22Parker I. Ivorra I. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C154-C165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also estimate that the peak [IP3]i achieved by 1, 10, and 100 μm Ach in SH-SY5Y cells are ∼100, 210, and 360 nm, respectively. Our results demonstrate the utility of LIBRA to directly follow physiologically relevant changes in [IP3]i in intact mammalian cells in real time. LIBRA has several important advantages over a previous method for monitoring [IP3]i that employs the intracellular redistribution of a chimeric protein consisting of the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of PLCδ1 fused to GFP (GFP-PHD) (23Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This probe was originally designed to detect changes in membrane PIP2 levels (24Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Várinai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) but subsequently was also shown to be sensitive to [IP3]i (2Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R.

Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). More recent experiments have confirmed that GFP-PHD redistribution can reflect physiologically relevant changes in both IP3 and PIP2 and that its selectivity varies with GFP-PHD expression level (26van der Wal J.

The temporal dynamics of G protein coupled receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses have been shown to depend on the effects of cytosolic and luminal [Ca2+]onIP3Rs (1Berridge M.J.

Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies suggest the involvement of PKC and scaffolding proteins on IP3 synthesis (30Shin D.M. Dehoff M. Luo X. Kang S.H. Tu J. Nayak S.K. Ross E.M. Worley P.F. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We anticipate that the ability to quantitatively monitor [IP3]i with LIBRA and related ratiometric biosensors will aid in the clarification of the roles of these and other effects on the generation of spatiotemporally complex Ca2+ signals."

An intractable problem that hampers mechanistic insights is the low occurrence of myocardial cell death in failing hearts, although it differs strikingly according to the models examined and technical specificity (2Kang P.M.

To circumvent these obstacles, we established an inducible heart failure mouse model utilizing diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated cell ablation, in which a given number of cardiomyocytes are arbitrarily and synchronously ablated, and prospective and serial analysis is available. DT is a two-peptide protein consisting of fragments A (DT-A) and B (DT-B) produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae (11Pappenheimer A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 69-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). DT binds to the DT receptor on the cell surface through DT-B and is internalized into acidic endocytic vesicles, which allows release of catalytic DT-A into the cytoplasm (12Falnes P.O. Sandvig K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). DT-A exerts its cytotoxicity by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2 and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in infected cells (13Van Ness B.G. Howard J.B. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10710-10716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DT receptor has been identified as a precursor of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (pro-HB-EGF) (14Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 15Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, DT cannot bind to rodent pro-HB-EGF because of substitution of amino acids required for DT binding, whereas primate pro-HB-EGF acts as a functional DT receptor (16Mitamura T. Umata T. Nakano F. Shishido Y. Toyoda T. Itai A. Kimura H. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, specific cells in mice are ideally sensitized to DT by forced expression of human pro-HB-EGF (17Saito M. Iwawaki T. Taya C. Yonekawa H. Noda M. Inui Y. Mekada E. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To enable cardiac-specific cell ablation, we generated transgenic mice (TG) expressing human pro-HB-EGF in the hearts under the control of α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Administration of DT induced ablation of transgene-expressing cardiomyocytes, and subsequently symptomatic heart failure. In this mouse model of heart failure, autophagy but not apoptosis was the mechanism of cardiomyocyte death. Autophagy is a dynamic process and intracellular constituents are sequestered by membranes and subsequently degradated or recycled in lysosome or vacuole (18Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2985) Google Scholar, 20Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In this sense, autophagy is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and turnover in physiological conditions. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that autophagy is implicated in execution of programmed cell death and is closely linked to several pathological conditions (21Bursch W. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 22Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Our model of experimentally induced heart failure provided direct evidence that myocardial cell loss through ACD causes heart failure, and will be useful to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying structural and functional changes in heart failure. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Human pro-HB-EGF cDNA (gift from A. Ullrich, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) was subcloned into the α-myosin heavy chain promoter-containing expression vector (gift from J. Robbins, Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). The 6.9-kb DNA fragment was microinjected as a transgene into pronuclei of eggs from BDF1 mice, and the eggs were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant ICR mice. The transgene was identified by Southern blot and PCR analysis. All protocols using mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chiba University. Administration of Diphtheria Toxin—Diphtheria toxin (Sigma) was reconstituted in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% lactose, and was administered by intramuscular injection. Northern Blot and in Situ Hybridization Analysis—For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg) prepared from tissues were hybridized with cDNA probes. Probes for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), skeletal α-actin, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA2), and TNF-α were previously described (24Takano H. Nagai T. Asakawa M. Toyozaki T. Oka T.

Probes for macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and collagens (Col1a2 and Col3a1) were gifts from K. Matsushima (Universitty of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) and S.

Digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes were synthesized by using the 0.7-kb human pro-HB-EGF cDNA, and RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (27Akazawa H. Komuro I. Sugitani Y.

Transthoracic Echocardiography—Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Cardiac function was evaluated with echocardiography (SONOS 4500, Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) using a 12-MHz transducer as described previously (26Toko H. Zhu W. Takimoto E. Shiojima I.

Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—Hearts were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections at 5 μm were routinely stained with hematoxylin-eosin for morphological analysis, and with Masson's trichrome for detection of fibrosis. For measurement of the myocyte cross-sectional area, semi-thin sections with silver staining were analyzed. Suitable cross-sections were defined as having round-to-oval cardiomyocyte sections and nearly round-shaped capillaries that perfused in the region. For immunohistochemistry, Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used to detect the primary antibodies. The sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin.

Evaluation of DNA Fragmentation—TUNEL assay using paraffin sections was performed with an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Biomedicals, Otsu, Japan). For agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA fragmentation, genome DNA (10 μg) was electrophoretically fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide as described previously (29Saito S.

To induce apoptosis in spleens as positive controls, we injected lipopolysaccharide (40 mg/kg) (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline intraperitoneally into age-matched mice. Mice were sacrificed 12 h after lipopolysaccharide injection and spleens were excised (30Chau B.N. Borges H.L. Chen T.T. Masselli A. Hunton I.C. Wang J.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Electronmicroscopy—Hearts were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). After washing with the buffer solution and post-fixation in 1% OsO4 and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), they were washed with the buffer solution, dehydrated using alcohol and acetone, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were examined under the electron microscope (31Komazaki S. Ito K. Takeshima H. Nakamura H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance as appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Inducible Myocardial Cell Ablation in TG Expressing Human DT Receptor in the Hearts—To confer DT sensitivity to cardiomyocytes in mice, we generated TG expressing human DT receptor, pro-HB-EGF, under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (Fig. 1A). Of two independent founder lines with successful germline transmission, one line was chosen for further analysis on the basis of transgene expression levels. By immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for human pro-HB-EGF, we confirmed cardiac-specific expression of the transgene (Fig. 1B). In situ hybridization analysis using a specific riboprobe for human pro-HB-EGF further revealed a mosaic expression pattern of the transgene in the hearts (Fig. 1C). Expression of the transgene was scattered throughout the TG hearts, and the number of transgene-expressing cardiomyocytes was 17.3 ± 6.0% out of total cardiomyocytes. To induce DT-mediated myocardial cell ablation, we administered DT by intramuscular injection to TG and wild-type mice (WT) at 10 weeks of age. When 5 mg/kg DT was administered, TG became lethargic and ∼80% of TG died within 10 days after injection of DT, although WT appeared normal (Fig. 1D). Immunoblot analysis in combination with in situ hybridization analysis revealed that expression of human pro-HB-EGF in the TG hearts was significantly decreased on the next day of DT injection, and almost disappeared on the following day (Fig. 1E). After 7 days, transgene-expressing cardiomyocytes were undetected in the TG hearts, suggesting that they were completely ablated through DT-mediated cytotoxicity. DT-mediated Myocardial Cell Loss Caused Heart Failure in Mice—We next examined the geometric, functional, and histological changes in the hearts caused by DT-mediated myocardial cell damages. Gross inspections of the TG hearts 7 days after DT injection showed global chamber dilatation with marked wall thinning and atrial thrombus (Fig. 2A), and the heart to body weight ratios were ∼1.3-fold increased (Fig. 2B), whereas the mock-treated TG hearts and DT- or mock-treated WT hearts showed no geometric change (Fig. 2). To evaluate cardiac function, we performed transthoracic echocardiographic examination. Seven days after injection, a ∼1.3-fold increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and a 1.5-1.7-fold decrease in left ventricular wall thickness were observed in DT-treated TG, whereas these parameters were unchanged in mock-treated TG (Fig. 2, C and D) and DT- or mock-treated WT. Echocardiographic examination also demonstrated a 2.4-fold reduction in % FS in DT-treated TG. These results suggest that injection of DT induced deterioration of LV systolic function with chamber dilatation and ventricular wall thinning in TG. In contrast, no discernible phenotype was observed in TG in the absence of DT, and DT had no harmful effect on WT. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the histological sections of TG hearts 7 days after DT injection revealed degenerated cardiomyocytes surrounded by inflammatory cells (Fig. 3A). These pathological findings were not observed in WT with or without DT injection (data not shown). The infiltrating inflammatory cells were identified as macrophages by immunohistochemical analysis using anti-Mac-3 antibody (Fig. 3B). Histological sections with Masson's trichrome staining showed interstitial fibrosis in DT-treated TG hearts (Fig. 3A). Silver staining of the sections of TG hearts on 14 days after DT injection revealed a 1.9-fold increase in cross-sectional areas of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3C), indicating that the cardiomyocytes, which did not express the transgene and survived DT administration, underwent hypertrophic cell growth. Alterations of Gene Expression in TG Presenting DT-induced Heart Failure—To characterize the molecular basis of heart failure caused by DT-induced myocardial cell ablation, we examined expression levels of several molecular markers. Expression of BNP was up-regulated 1 day after DT injection, and persistently elevated thereafter (Fig. 4). Increased expression of skeletal α-actin and decreased expression of SERCA2 were evident 4 days after DT injection (Fig. 4). Up-regulation of natriuretic peptide genes and fetal cardiac genes including skeletal α-actin is one of the characteristic cellular responses observed during cardiac hypertrophy (32Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 33Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Especially, ventricular expression of BNP is induced promptly in response to volume expansion and pressure overload, and plasma BNP concentrations have proven to be valuable for diagnostic and prognostic assessment in patients with heart failure (34de Lemos J.A. McGuire D.K. Drazner M.H. Lancet. 2003; 362: 316-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In addition, down-regulation of SERCA2 has been reported to be a sensitive marker for heart failure (35Mercadier J.J. Lompre A.M. Duc P. Boheler K.R. Fraysse J.B. Wisnewsky C. Allen P.D. Komajda M. Schwartz K. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Therefore, these patterns of cardiac gene expression indicated that DT-induced myocardial cell ablation burdened hemodynamic overload and progressed overt heart failure concomitantly with cardiac hypertrophy. Consistent with the histological finding of infiltration by macrophages, an increase in expression of MCP-1 was observed 1 day after DT injection, and expression levels of MCP-1 were further increased until 4 days and declined on 7 days (Fig. 4). The expression levels of TNF-α, encoding an inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages, changed in parallel with that of MCP-1 (Fig. 4). Insomuch as symptomatic heart failure was evident 7 days after DT injection, stressed myocardium could be another source of TNF-α production at this period. Following up-regulation of inflammatory markers, expression levels of the collagen genes (Col1a2 and Col3a1) were increased at 4 days after DT injection (Fig. 4). These temporal profiles of gene expressions suggest that mobilization of macrophages are induced by up-regulated MCP-1 after the myocardial cell ablation, leading to cardiac fibrosis by enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines, and that inflammatory cytokines and cardiac remodeling might promote left ventricular dysfunction evoked by myocardial cell loss. Myocardial Cell Death Induced by DT Is Not Primarily because of Apoptosis—To investigate the mechanisms of myocardial cell death in DT-treated TG hearts, we first performed a TUNEL assay. In the hearts of DT-treated TG, we could not detect any TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes or inflammatory cells, whereas a marked increase in TUNEL-positive cells was detected in the spleen of mice treated with intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide as positive controls (Fig. 5A). Likewise, analysis of genomic DNA by agarose gel provided no evidence of DNA laddering in DT-treated TG hearts (Fig. 5B). We further examined activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 5C), changes in expression of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl2 family proteins (Fig. 5D), and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 5E), but biochemical changes leading to typical apoptosis were not observed in DT-treated TG hearts. Autophagy Is the Mechanism of Myocardial Cell Death in DT-induced Failing Hearts—ACD is a regulated process of caspase-independent programmed cell death, in which intracellular components are degradated by lysosomal or proteasomal proteases (21Bursch W. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 22Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 23Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for lysosomal protease cathepsin D, LAMP-1, and ubiquitin in cardiomyocytes of DT-treated TG hearts (Fig. 6A). It is notable that cathepsin D showed a diffuse cytosolic distribution, whereas LAMP-1 showed a granular localization. These results suggest an increase in formation of lysosomes and leakage of activated lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol. Recently, it has been reported that, in human failing hearts, ubiquitin accumulation in cardiomyocytes may be associated with up-regulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC2) and down-regulation of deubiquitinating enzymes such as UFD1 and isopeptidase T (6Kostin S. Pool L. Elsasser A. Hein S. Drexler H.C. Arnon E. Hayakawa Y. Zimmermann R. Bauer E. Klovekorn W.P. Schaper J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, Western blot analysis revealed that the amounts of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, UBC2, ubiquitin-ligating enzyme E3 (E6-AP), and UFD1 were not unchanged in DT-treated TG hearts when compared with control hearts (Fig. 6B). Electron microscopic analysis revealed abundant cytosolic vacuoles and segmented configuration of nuclei with lumpy condensation of chromatin in degenerated cardiomyocytes in TG hearts 3 days after DT injection (Fig. 7, A and B). However, nuclear fragmentation and crescent-shaped chromatin condensation at the nuclear periphery typical of apoptosis were not observed. In higher magnifications, cytosolic vacuoles containing lipid droplets with myelin figures and degenerated mitochondria (Fig. 7, C and D), suggested that these vacuoles are typical autophagosomes. In terminally degenerated cardiomyocytes, lysis of myofibrills and other intracellular organelles were prominent (Fig. 7E). These findings suggest that myocardial cell loss in DT-treated TG hearts is primarily because of ACD. Autophagic degeneration has been implicated in human failing heart failure (3Yamamoto S.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). We also found cardiomyocytes undergoing autophagic cell death in a biopsied specimen from a 43-year-old patient suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy. Similar to the electron micrographic findings in degenerated cardiomyocytes in our mouse model of heart failure, myofibrillar degeneration in association with cytosolic vacuoles and lipid droplets were observed in this biopsied specimen (Fig. 7F). The vacuoles were autophagosomes containing digested organelles. These findings are illustrative of the previously reported features characteristic of ACD in human heart failure. Therefore, degenerated cardiomyocytes in human dilated cardiomyopathy patients showed ultrastructural alterations similar to those in our mouse model of heart failure. In this study, we generated a novel mouse model of heart failure, where cardiomyocyte loss through ACD is arbitrarily and specifically induced by intramuscular injection of DT. Recent technical progress in genetic manipulation and physiological measurements enabled us to produce several mouse models of heart failure (36Elsner D. Riegger G.A. Curr. Opi"
https://openalex.org/W2001530819,"The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis (deletion of Phe-508 in the first nucleotide binding domain (ΔF508)) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) causes retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. We previously showed that the ΔF508 mutation causes the CFTR protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in an inactive and structurally altered state. Proper packing of the transmembrane (TM) segments is critical for function because the TM segments form the chloride channel. Here we tested whether the ΔF508 mutation altered packing of the TM segments by disulfide cross-linking analysis between TM6 and TM12 in wild-type and ΔF508 CFTRs. These TM segments were selected because TM6 appears to line the chloride channel, and cross-linking between these TM segments has been observed in the CFTR sister protein, the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein. We first mapped potential contact points in wild-type CFTR by cysteine mutagenesis and thiol cross-linking analysis. Disulfide cross-linking was detected in CFTR mutants M348C(TM6)/T1142C(TM12), T351C(TM6)/T1142C(TM12), and W356C(TM6)/W1145C(TM12) in a wild-type background. The disulfide cross-linking occurs intramolecularly and was reducible by dithiothreitol. Introduction of the ΔF508 mutation into these cysteine mutants, however, abolished cross-linking. The results suggest that the ΔF508 mutation alters interactions between the TM domains. Therefore, a potential target to correct folding defects in the ΔF508 mutant of CFTR is to identify compounds that promote correct folding of the TM domains.

It affects 1 in every 2500 live births, and 1 in every 25 people is a carrier (1Boat T.F. Cheng P.W. Acta Paediatr. Scand. Suppl. 1989; 363 (discussion 29–30): 25-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (cftr). The gene product, CFTR, is a member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter family. It is composed of 1480 amino acids and has the putative structure of an N-terminal cytosolic domain, two transmembrane domains (TMDs), two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), one regulatory domain, a C-terminal cytosolic tail, and two active N-glycosylation sites on the fourth extracellular loop (2Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5946) Google Scholar). To date there are more than 1300 mutations identified in the gene (CF mutation data base: www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr). The mutations occur throughout the gene and are classified according to their molecular consequences (for review, see Refs. 3Powell K. Zeitlin P.L. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 1395-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and 4Rowntree R.K. Harris A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2003; 67: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) such as null-production, processing defect, regulation defect, conductance defect, and promoter defect. Deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508) is the most common CF mutation as it accounts for more than 90% of the clinical cases. ΔF508 is a processing-defective mutation. CFTR is first synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is core-glycosylated at its N-glycosylation sites and folds with the aid of molecular chaperones. Upon proper folding and passing the ER quality control system, the CFTR protein is then exported into the Golgi apparatus where CFTR and its sugar moieties undergo further modification before being targeted onto the cell surface. Processing defective CFTRs such as ΔF508-CFTR do not make it past the ER quality control system. Instead, they are retained in the ER in an inactive form (5Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3797-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) before rapid degradation by cytosolic proteasomes (6Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

The lack of processing and maturation onto the cell surface by processing mutants such as ΔF508 is the most common cause of severe CF. Other mutations located through out the molecule also cause defective maturation (8Chen E.Y. Clarke D.M. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 9Seibert F.S. Jia Y.

Correction of defective processing of CFTR mutants would benefit patients with CF. An important observation is that the ΔF508 mutant has been shown to be functional if it can be induced to mature and be delivered to the cell surface. Maturation of ΔF508 CFTR can be promoted by incubation at low temperature, expression in the presence of high concentrations of glycerol, or by the co-expression in the presence of high levels of the N-terminal of CFTR (12Clarke L.L.

To devise an improved strategy to induce efficient maturation of CFTR-processing mutants, we must first understand the molecular basis of their defects. There is evidence that there are structural differences between wild-type and mutant ΔF508 CFTRs. Mutant ΔF508 as well as immature wild-type CFTR are more susceptible to protease digestion compared with mature protein (5Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3797-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Results from these protease digestion studies suggest that CFTR-processing mutants are not grossly misfolded but are trapped as partially folded intermediates that are structurally similar to immature wild-type protein. Studies on the CFTR sister protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), suggest that one structural alteration caused by the presence of the ΔF508 mutation is incomplete packing of the transmembrane (TM) segments located at the interface between TMD1 and TMD2 (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). P-gp is another ABC transporter that functions as an ATP-dependent pump. It has been used as a model system to learn about how processing mutations affect CFTR because introduction of CF-type mutations into P-gp also cause the mutant proteins to be retained in the ER in a protease-sensitive state (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The folding defects in P-gp, however, can be corrected by expressing the mutants in the presence of drug substrates (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Characterization of the ΔF508-type P-gp mutant suggested that deletion of this residue in NBD1 disrupted packing of the TM segments by affecting the interaction between NBD1 and the first cytoplasmic loop that connects TM segments 2 and 3. This in turn disrupted interactions between TMD1 and TMD2 of P-gp. Interactions between the two TMDs also appear to be critical for proper folding of CFTR since they appear to be the main contact points between the two halves of the molecule (20Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. DeBerg L.G. Welsh M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study we used disulfide cross-linking analysis to map contact points between TMD1 and TMD2 of CFTR and then tested whether packing of the TM segments was altered by the ΔF508 mutation. Construction of Mutants—The CFTR point mutations were constructed in fragments using PCR mutagenesis. The fragments were then fully sequenced before insertion to create full-length cDNA either in pMT21 (for transient expression) or pcDNA5-FRT (for stable expression). TM6 point mutations (M348C, T351C, and W356C) were generated in the XbaI (bp 573) → KpnI (bp 1370) fragment; TM12 point mutations (T1142C and W1145C) were generated in the EcoRV (bp 2996) → EcoRI (bp 3643) fragment; the ΔF508 mutation was generated in the KpnI (bp 1370) → ApaI (bp 2333) fragment. The construction of Cys-less CFTR (C76S/C126S/C225S/C276S/C343S/C491S/C524S/C590-S/C592S/C657S/C832S/C866S/C1344S/C1355S/C1395S/C1400S/C1410-S/C1458S) was performed using the following cDNA fragments. Point mutations C76/126S were generated in sequence in the PstI (bp 1) → XbaI (bp 573) fragment; point mutations C225S/C276S/C343S were generated in sequence in the XbaI (bp 573) → KpnI (bp 1370) fragment; point mutations C491S/C524S/C590S/C592S/C657S were generated in sequence in the KpnI (bp 1370) → ApaI (bp 2333) fragment; point mutations C832S/C866S were generated in sequence in the ApaI (bp 2333) → EcoRI (bp 3643) fragment; point mutations C1344S/C1355S/C1395S/C1400S/C1410S/C1458S were generated in sequence in the EcoRI (bp 3643) → XhoI (bp 4560) fragment, the five insert fragments were then ligated and inserted into the PstI and XhoI sites of plasmid vector pMT21. Preparation of Anti-NBD2 Antibody—Antibodies were prepared against human CFTR NBD2 (residues Asn-1195—Leu-1471). Briefly, an EcoRI (bp 3643) → XhoI (bp 4560) fragment containing NBD2 was ligated into the EcoRI and SalI sites of plasmid vector pMAL-c (New England Biolabs). The vector was then digested with EcoRI and StuI, filled in with Klenow enzyme, and religated. This resulted in a fusion of NBD2 with maltose-binding protein. The maltose-binding protein-NBD2 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, affinity-purified on an amylose column, and then injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits. Immune serum obtained was stored at –70 °C and used at a 1:5000 dilution. Expression of Mutants—Subconfluent HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg/ml cDNA constructs in pMT21 using a calcium phosphate precipitation method adapted from Chen and Okayama (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). At 18–24 h post-transfection, the media (sterile-filtered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum plus 5% penicillin-streptomycin plus 5% non-essential amino acids, pH 7.2) was replaced with plain media or media containing 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Alexis). The cells were harvested after another 24–48 h. Stable CHO cell lines were generated using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). Briefly, using a calcium phosphate precipitation method adapted from Chen and Okayama (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar), ∼60% confluent Flp-In CHO cells were co-transfected in a 100-mm cell culture plate with a total of 5 μg/ml cDNA constructs in pcDNA5-FRT and pOGO DNA in a 1:9 ratio. At 18 h post-transfection, the media was replaced with plain F-12 media (Invitrogen). After allowing the cells to recover for another 48 h, the cells were transferred to 5 100-mm plates containing selection media (F-12 plus 600 μg/ml hygromycin (BioShop Canada)). The selection media was then changed 48–72 h later to remove the dead cells. Colonies were picked ∼2 weeks post-transfection and transferred to 24-well plates. The selected colonies were then split into duplicates, with one set analyzed for expression using immunoblot analysis. The positive recombinant clones were subsequently maintained in the presence of 600 μg/ml hygromycin. Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—CFTR-expressing HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture plates were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were subsequently suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Samples of 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (control) or phosphate-buffered saline containing 300 μm cross-linker (1,5-pentanediyl-bismethanethiosulfonate (M5M), 3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl-bismethanethiosulfonate (M8M), 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecane-1,17-diyl-bismethanethiosulfonate (M17M); Toronto Research Chemicals) were added to 10 μl of cells. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 130 μlof2× Laemmli sample buffer (3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml E64, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). To test for the effect of reducing conditions, 1 μlof1 m dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the reactions immediately after the 15-min incubation with the thiol-reactive cross-linkers to give a final concentration of 33 mm DTT. After 15 min in the presence of DTT the cells were lysed by the addition of 130 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples (30 μl) of the reactions were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels unless otherwise indicated. The gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal anti-CFTR antibody as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody as the secondary antibody. The signals were detected by chemiluminescence (enhanced chemiluminescence, Pierce). Measurement of cAMP-stimulated Iodide Efflux—Stable CHO cell lines were grown to 90% confluency in triplicates in 6-well cluster tissue culture plates (Costar). Cells were incubated in the presence of 2 mm sodium butyrate 24 h before assay to enhance the levels of cell surface expression. After aspiration of the growth media, the cells were washed 3 times with 2 ml of loading buffer (136 mm NaI, 4 mm KNO3, 2 mm Ca(NO3)2,2mm Mg (NO3)2,11mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then loaded with NaI by incubation at room temperature with 2 ml of loading buffer for 1 h in the dark. The cells were then washed 13 times at 1-min intervals with 0.5 ml of efflux buffer (136 mm NaNO3, 4 mm KNO3, 2 mm Ca(NO3)2, 2 mm Mg (NO3)2, 11 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Solutions from the first 10 washes were discarded. The last three samples were collected and used to create a prestimulation base line. Stimulation buffer (0.5 ml of efflux buffer plus 10 μm forskolin (Sigma)) was added to the cells and removed at 1-min intervals for 12 min. The aspirated solutions were collected and stored in the dark until all samples had been collected. The relative voltages of the samples were subsequently measured using an iodide-specific electrode (Analytical Sensors Inc.). Standard iodide curves were generated using NaI dissolved in efflux buffer to determine the iodide concentrations in the samples for data analysis. CFTR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 1A) as a core-glycosylated immature protein (Fig. 1C, band B) that then matures as it passes through the Golgi where complex carbohydrate is added (Fig. 1C, band C). The protein is then delivered to the cell surface. The processing defective mutant ΔF508, however, is retained in the ER (Fig. 1B) as a core-glycosylated immature protein (Fig. 1C). Our goal was to determine whether the ΔF508 mutation in CFTR altered packing of the TM segments at the interface between domains TMD1 and TMD2 since this is the major contact point between the two halves of the molecule (20Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. DeBerg L.G. Welsh M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Each domain is predicted to contain six TM segments, and the chloride channel through the membrane is predicted to lie at the interface of TMD1 and TMD2 (22Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3729-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The first step was to map a contact point between the two domains. Our approach to map a contact point between TMD1 and TMD2 was to employ cysteine mutagenesis and reaction with thiol cross-linkers. We selected a disulfide cross-linking approach because it has successfully been employed to map contact points between the TM domains of P-gp, the CFTR sister protein (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Disulfide cross-linking analysis is very useful to examine contact points between the various domains of ABC transporters because the presence of an interdomain disulfide bond causes the protein to migrate slower on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is relatively easy to assay for the presence of a disulfide bond. A potential problem with performing disulfide cross-linking analysis with CFTR, however, is that it contains 18 endogenous cysteines. Mutation of such a large number of cysteines to serines or alanines could alter the structure and properties of the protein. In preliminary studies we found that mutation of all 18 cysteines to serines caused defective maturation (Fig. 1C). It appeared, however, that it would be possible to conduct cross-linking studies in a wild-type CFTR background because no evidence of cross-linking was observed when it was treated with various methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers (see below). Promiscuous cross-linking agents such as copper phenanthroline, however, could not be used because they induced cross-linking in wild-type CFTR (data not shown). To examine inter-TMD interactions in CFTR using disulfide cross-linking, we first had to mutate individual residues in the TMDs to cysteines. We chose TM6 because there is strong evidence that TM6 plays a crucial role in the formation of the pore for chloride conductance (31Gupta J. Lindsell P. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Guinamard R. Akabas M.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There is, however, little work done on the other TMs of CFTR. Studies on the TM packing of P-gp, the sister protein of CFTR, however, show interactions between TM6 and TM12 (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, residues in the cytosolic halves of TM6 and TM12 of CFTR were individually mutated to cysteine using site-directed mutagenesis (see Fig. 2A). The cytosolic halves of the TMs were chosen for this study based on the conical-shaped model proposed by Akabas (22Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3729-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on the extensive cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies on the TMs done by Akabas and co-workers (32Guinamard R. Akabas M.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) they proposed that the pore of the CFTR chloride channel is conical-shaped, with the cytosolic side of the TMs close together. Single substitution of the TM residues with cysteine had little deleterious effect on the maturation of CFTR as most single cysteine mutants of TMs 6 and 12 had similar levels of maturation as that of WT CFTR (data not shown). Subsequently, paired-cysteine CFTR mutants containing a cysteine in TM6 and another in TM12 were constructed and tested for cross-linking with methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers (Fig. 3A). These methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers have thiol-reactive groups at both ends that are linked by spacer arms of various lengths (27Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Alkylthiosulfonates react selectively with cysteines in protein, resulting in a disulfide attachment of the spacer arm and release of a sulfinic acid byproduct (37Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 38Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J. Protein Chem. 1982; 1: 47-58Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The methanethiosulfonate compounds are generally more reactive than other thiol-specific compounds such as maleimides or iodoacetates (38Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J. Protein Chem. 1982; 1: 47-58Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For our cross-linking assays, HEK293 cells transiently transfected with individual constructs of CFTR cDNA were harvested and treated with or without the thiol-reactive cross-linkers, M5M, M8M, or M17M. The cells were incubated with the cross-linkers for 15 min at room temperature, then lysed with the 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cross-linking of CFTR would cause the protein to migrate slower on SDS-PAGE gels. As shown in Fig. 3B, the addition of the thiol-reactive cross-linkers to cells expressing WT CFTR does not lead to cross-linking. Three positive cross-linking mutants, M348C/T1142C, T351C/T1142C, and W356C/W1145C were identified (see Fig. 3B, band X) and selected for further study. These were useful mutants because none of the mutations appeared to affect maturation of the protein. Fig. 2B shows the expression of WT CFTR, the single cysteine mutants M348C, T351C, W356C, T1142C, and W1145C, and the double cysteine mutants M348C/T1142C, T351C/T1142C, and W356C/W1145C. All of the mutants yielded relatively high levels of mature CFTR proteins (band C) relative to the core-glycosylated form of the protein (band B). The cross-linking patterns of mutants M348C/T1142C, T351C/T1142C, and W356C/W1145C showed differences when treated with different cross-linkers. Mutant M348C/T1142C, for example, showed cross-linking with M5M and M8M but not with M17M. Mutant T351C/T1142C, on the other hand, shows extensive cross-linking with M8M but not with M5M or M17M. It is interesting to note that both M348C and T351C in TM6 showed cross-linking to T1142C in TM12. Residue Met-348 is three residues away from Thr-351, which would put them on the same face of an α-helix. Therefore, it is not surprising that the substituted cysteines at both of these positions would cross-link to the same residue, T1142C. The positive mutant, W356C/W1145C, showed cross-linking with all three cross-linkers (Fig. 3B). Most of the other mutants tested did not show cross-linking with M5M, M8M, and M17M. An example of a mutant that did not show cross-linking, T351C/L1143C, is shown in Fig. 3B. Because the cross-linkable mutants M348C/T1142C, T351C/T1142C, and W356C/W1145C also contained the 18 endogenous cysteines, it was important to test whether any of the single M348C, T351C, W356C, T1142C, or W1145C mutants showed evidence of cross-linking with endogenous cysteines. Accordingly, cells expressing each of the single cysteine mutants were treated with M5M, M8M, or M17M, and samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 3B, right panel, shows that none of the single cysteine mutants showed cross-linking. Reduced levels of the T352C and W356C mutants, however, were observed with M8M, and this may be due to aggregation. Aggregation of CFTR protein is normally observed in cells (39Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) and caused some problems in these studies. In the immunoblot analysis of cross-linking only 10 μl of the assay samples were loaded in the negative control lanes (i.e. no cross-linker added) compared with the 30 μl that was loaded in the cross-linker lanes. This is because the cross-linkers, particularly M5M and M8M, also caused nonspecific cross-linking that leads to aggregation of the CFTR protein as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows an overexposed immunoblot of the effect of cross-linkers on WT and ΔF508 CFTR. The presence of the M5M and M8M cross-linkers led to accumulation of aggregates in the stacking gel. This is similar to the nonspecific aggregates we observed when we treated the cells with oxidants such as copper phenanthroline. The aggregates are likely due to reaction of the thiol-reactive cross-linkers with endogenous cysteines between CFTR molecules or between CFTR and other proteins. In addition, the studies were complicated by the presence of aggregates even in the absence of cross-linker (Fig. 4, lanes 0). It is also worth noting that it is possible that the efficiency of intramolecular cross-linking would be reduced if a separate cross-linker labels each of the introduced cysteines. Attachment of separate cross-linker labels to each cysteine or incomplete cross-linking (cross-linker only attached to one of the cysteines) may also promote aggregation when the reaction is stopped. It is also possible that formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between TM6 and TM12 blocks aggregation. Despite the problems with aggregation, cross-l"

Moreover, infection challenges cell volume constancy of the host erythrocyte requiring enhanced activity of cell volume regulatory mechanisms. Patch clamp recording demonstrated inwardly and outwardly rectifying anion channels in infected but not in control erythrocytes. The molecular identity of those channels remained elusive. We show here for one channel type that voltage dependence, cell volume sensitivity, and activation by oxidation are identical to ClC-2. Moreover, Western blots and FACS analysis showed protein and functional ClC-2 expression in human erythrocytes and erythrocytes from wild type (Clcn2+/+) but not from Clcn2–/– mice. Finally, patch clamp recording revealed activation of volume-sensitive inwardly rectifying channels in Plasmodium berghei-infected Clcn2+/+ but not Clcn2–/– erythrocytes. Erythrocytes from infected mice of both genotypes differed in cell volume and inhibition of ClC-2 by ZnCl2 (1 mm) induced an increase of cell volume only in parasitized Clcn2+/+ erythrocytes. Lack of ClC-2 did not inhibit P. berghei development in vivo nor substantially affect the mortality of infected mice. In conclusion, activation of host ClC-2 channels participates in the altered permeability of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes but is not required for intraerythrocytic parasite survival.

In conclusion, activation of host ClC-2 channels participates in the altered permeability of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes but is not required for intraerythrocytic parasite survival. Plasmodium falciparum is metabolically highly active and thus depends on ample supply of nutrients (1Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, the intraerythrocytic proliferation of the pathogen and the generation of waste products impose a severe challenge to volume constancy of the host red blood cell (RBC) 1The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorter.1The abbreviations used are: RBC, red blood cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorter. (1Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, the parasite impairs the pump leak balance of the host (2Overman R.R. Physiol.

Hoffman J.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1960; 44: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). From 15 and 36 h postinvasion, the K+ and Na+ leakage through the RBC membrane increases and the Na+/K+ pump activity decreases, respectively. Both processes result in a replacement of cytosolic K+ ions by Na+ in the late trophozoite/shizont-infected RBC (6Staines H.M. Ellory J.C. Kirk K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1576-C1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parasite requires high Na+ and low K+ concentrations in the host cytosol (9Brand V.B. Sandu C.D. Duranton C. Tanneur V. Lang K.S. Huber S.M. Lang F. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) most probably to build up inwardly directed Na+ and outwardly directed K+ gradients across its plasma membrane. However, high cytosolic Na+ concentrations lead to cell swelling and eventually to colloidosmotic hemolysis of the host RBC. Premature hemolysis is prevented by the concerted action of the parasite and the host RBC. The former lowers the colloid concentration by excess hemoglobin digestion and the latter exports the hemoglobin-derived amino acids out of the cell (7Lew V.L. Tiffert T. Ginsburg H. Blood. 2003; 101: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To meet the requirements of the intraerythrocytic parasite development new transport systems are up-regulated in the host membrane which accomplish parasite nutrition, cation leakage, and maintenance of host volume constancy (1Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 10Ginsburg H. Kirk K. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. A.S.F.

Physiol. 1998; 60: 719-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Comparison of the available data on the parasite-induced transport suggests that infection of erythrocytes activates two classes of channels, anion-selective channels and organic osmolytes (and cation) channels (12Ginsburg H.

The outward rectifier is additionally permeable for organic osmolytes whereas a cell swelling-activated fraction of the inward rectifying anion channels is not (20Duranton C. Huber S.M. Tanneur V.

Uhlemann A.C. Gamper N.L. Duranton C. Kremsner P.G. Lang F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The nature and physiological significance of channel types identified by patch clamp recording, however, have remained a matter of discussion (26Ginsburg H. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Huber S. Uhlemann A. Gamper N. Duranton C. Lang F. Kremsner P.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular identity of one of the infection-induced anion channels and to test for its functional significance for the cell volume maintenance of the infected host RBC. Parasites—P. berghei ANKA-parasitized mouse RBCs (2 × 106) were injected intraperitoneally into sex- and age-matched wild type (C57BL/6) and ClC-2 knockout mice (Clcn2–/–) (28Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and parasitemia was determined daily by Syto-16 staining in FACS analysis (see below). For patch clamp experiments, P. berghei-infected mouse RBCs were stored in RPMI 1640 medium. The human pathogen P. falciparum strains BINH (29Binh V.Q. Luty A.J. Kremsner P.G. Am. J. Trop. Med.

Hyg. 1978; 27: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were grown in vitro in banked human RBCs (blood group O+). Parasites were cultured as described earlier (14Huber S.M. Uhlemann A.C. Gamper N.L. Duranton C. Kremsner P.G. Lang F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) at a hematocrit of 5% and a parasitemia of 2–10% in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with Albumax II (0.5%; Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% CO2, 5% O2. Patch Clamp—Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature in late trophozoite stage-infected and non-infected human and mouse RBCs according to Huber et al. (14Huber S.M. Uhlemann A.C. Gamper N.L. Duranton C. Kremsner P.G. Lang F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with solutions buffered to pH 7.4. RBCs were bathed in (in mm:) 115 NaCl, 10 MgCl2, 5 CaCl2 20 Hepes/NaOH, a solution which was originally designed by Desai et al. (13Desai S.A. Bezrukov S.M. Zimmerberg J. Nature. 2000; 406: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and which improves the sealing of the cells. Upon achievement of whole cell recording mode, cells were superfused with the recording solutions. After each measurement, cells and Petri dishes were replaced. In whole cell experiments, cytosolic and extracellular ion concentrations are defined by the bath and pipette solution. Electrochemical driving forces result exclusively from the concentration difference of a permeable ion between both bath and pipette solutions and the applied voltage. An osmotic gradient across the recorded membrane to induce cell swelling was generated by either decreasing bath osmolarity (Fig. 1, A–E) or increasing pipette osmolarity (Figs. 1, F–I; 4, 5). Human RBCs were recorded with pipette solutions containing (in mm) 140 Na-X, 10 HEPES/NaOH, 5 MgCl2, 1 Mg-ATP, 0.5 EGTA (with X as chloride or d-gluconate) combined with a bath solution of 100 sorbitol, 90 NaCl, 10 HEPES/NaOH, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. Cell swelling and shrinkage in Fig. 1, A–E was induced iso-ionically by decreasing and increasing the bath sorbitol to 0 and 250 mm, respectively. Further human RBCs (Fig. 1, F–I) as well as non-infected and parasitized mouse RBCs (Figs. 4 and 5) were recorded in a bath solution containing (in mm) 140 NMDG-Cl, 10 HEPES/NMDG, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2 in combination with an isotonic (140 mm NMDG-Cl; Fig. 4, D–F, closed symbols/bars and Fig. 5E, closed triangles) or a hypertonic (170 mm NMDG-Cl; Fig. 4, A–C and D–F, open symbols/bars, G and Fig. 5, A–D and E, open symbols) pipette solution (additionally containing in mm: 10 HEPES/NMDG, 0.5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 Mg-ATP). The hypertonic pipette solution induced cell swelling during recording. Cell shrinkage (Fig. 4B, 3rd trace) and further cell swelling (Fig. 4B, 4th trace) was applied by adding 500 mm sorbitol to the NMDG-Cl bath solution and by diluting the bath solution 1:1.5 with water (95 mm NMDG-Cl), respectively. The ClC-2 inhibitor ZnCl2 was added to the bath solution at concentrations of 0.01–10 mm, the anion channel blocker NPPB (5-nitro-2-3-phenyl-propylamino)-benzoic acid at a concentration of 100 μm. Currents were evoked by 10 voltage pulses (400 ms each) from holding potential (–10 or –30 mV) to voltages between –100 mV and +80 mV using 20 mV increments. Currents were analyzed by averaging the whole-cell currents between 350 and 375 ms of each voltage square pulse. Inward conductances were calculated by linear regression of inward current between –60 and 0 mV voltage.Fig. 4ClC-2-dependent inwardly rectifying anion currents in mouse RBC.A–C, whole cell current traces recorded at different time points (as indicated) in a non-infected wild-type (A), a P. berghei(late trophozoite)-infected wild-type (B), and an infected Clcn2–/– mouse RBC (C). Continuous cell swelling was induced by combining a hypertonic pipette solution (170 mm NMDG-Cl) with an isotonic bath solution (140 mm NMDG-Cl). In addition, in B cell shrinkage and further strong cell swelling was evoked by increasing and decreasing the bath osmolarity by 450 and 150 mosm, respectively. D and E, I/V relations recorded as in B and C with hypertonic pipette solution (170 mm NMDG-Cl; open circles) and isotonic bath solution (swollen) were compared with those obtained in unpaired experiments with isotonic pipette (140 mm NMDG-Cl; closed triangles) and bath solution (non-swollen).

Friedrich B. Setiawan I. Lang F. Broer S. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To study dependence of rClC-2 on cell volume, oocytes were either recorded in isotonic solution containing (in mm) 100 sucrose, 48 NaCl, 5 HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, or during cell swelling upon removal of sucrose from the superfusate. For investigating the dependence of rClC-2 on the redox state oocytes were recorded in a solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4). For oxidation and reduction tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP; 1 mm) and dithiothreitol (5 mm) were added to the superfusate, respectively. Zn2+ sensitivity was assessed by adding 0.01–1 mm ZnCl2 to the bath solution. Density Distribution Assay—Venous blood was drawn retro-orbitally from wild-type and Clcn2–/– mice with heparinized hematocrit capillaries and collected in EDTA-coated tubes to prevent coagulation. Density distribution was obtained according to Danon and Marikovky (33Danon D. Marikovsky V. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1964; 64: 668-674PubMed Google Scholar) by using phthalate esters (mixtures of methyl phthalate and di-η-butyl phthalate) in microhematocrit capillaries. Osmotic Resistance—Venous mouse blood was drawn retro-orbitally and collected in one-fourth volume of 4.3% (w/v) sodium citrate. Citrate-blood (20 μl) was incubated for 2 h in H2O or in NaCl solutions with different NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.3–0.7% (w/v) NaCl. Hemolysis was quantified photometrically using total hemolysis in H2Oas a reference. Hematological Parameters—Venous mouse blood was drawn retroorbitally with heparinized hematocrit capillaries and collected in EDTA-coated tubes. Hematological parameters were determined automatically using Advia 120 Hematology System (Bayer, Germany). FACS Analysis—To test for oxidation-induced ClC-2 activation (Fig. 3D) venous mouse blood was drawn retro-orbitally with heparinized hematocrit capillaries diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at 4 °C. Mouse RBCs were equilibrated for 15 min at room temperature in 80 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 4 μm gramicidin D, 2 μm valinomycin, and 50 μm NPPB in the presence or absence of t-BHP (1 mm). Cell shrinkage was induced by adding 9 volumes of hypotonic sorbitol solution (200 mm sorbitol, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 4 μm gramicidin D, 2 μm valinomycin, 50 μm NPPB), and the decrease in cell volume was estimated every 60 s by forward scatter in FACS analysis. To test for activation of ClC-2 by P. berghei Anka infection (Fig. 3E), heparinized blood was taken from malaria-infected Clcn2–/– and wild-type mice with high parasitemia (70 ± 6% and 79 ± 7% in wild type and Clcn2–/–, respectively). RBCs were equilibrated for 15 min at room temperature in 125 mm NaCl, 32 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm KCl, 5 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm gramicidin. Cell shrinkage was induced by adding 9 volumes of 290 mm sorbitol, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm d-glucose, 4 μm gramicidin D, 100 μm NPPB, and cell volume was determined as described. To determine infection-induced changes in RBC forward scatter (Fig. 6A), heparinized blood was taken from P. berghei-infected wild-type and Clcn2–/– mice and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were further diluted 1:20 in PBS containing the DNA fluorescent dye Syto-16 (3 μm; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and stained for 40 min. In further experiments studying the effect of ZnCl2 on cell volume (Fig. 6B), heparinized, and washed blood from P. berghei-infected wild type and Clcn2–/– mice was incubated for 4 h at 37 °Cin125 mm NaCl, 32 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm KCl, 5 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and diluted in the same buffer containing Syto-16 (3 μm). Incubation and Syto-16 staining (40 min) was performed in the presence of ZnCl2 (1 mm) or (for control) of additional MgCl2 (1 mm). Cell volume of Syto-16-positive and -negative cells was analyzed by FACS forward scatter.Fig. 6Functional significance of the Zn2+-sensitive ClC-2-dependent anion channels in P. berghei-infected mRBCs.A, dot blot recorded by FACS showing fluorescence intensity of the DNA-specific dye syto16 against forward scatter of RBCs from infected mice (individual sample).

Thereafter, RBCs were washed in PBS, centrifuged, and the pellet (20 μl) was osmotically hemolyzed in 8 ml of 20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science).

Lysates were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (50 μg of protein per lane), and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-ClC-2 (28Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J.

To test for P. falciparum-induced activation of cell volume-sensitive ion channels in the host membrane whole cell currents of non-infected and P. falciparum-infected human RBCs were recorded in isosmotic, hyposmotic, and hyperosmotic bathing medium. The comparison of Fig. 1, A and B (left traces) clearly demonstrates activation of whole cell currents in the human RBC membrane following infection with P. falciparum. As illustrated in Fig. 1B (middle and right) osmotic cell shrinkage inhibited and osmotic cell swelling activated a fraction of the whole cell inward current. The volume-sensitive current fraction amounts to almost 50% of the total inward current in swollen infected cells (Fig. 1D). In sharp contrast to the infected RBC, swelling of non-infected human RBCs did not activate any appreciable current (Fig. 1, A and D, left two columns). This indicates that infection is a prerequisite for the activation of the current fraction by cell swelling. The cell volume sensitive current fraction of infected RBCs activated time-dependently upon hyperpolarization (Fig. 1C) and exhibited an inwardly rectifying current voltage (I/V) relationship (Fig. 1E, open circles). Replacement of Cl– in the pipette solution by gluconate in unpaired experiments (Fig. 1E, closed triangles) demonstrated the anion selectivity of this volume-sensitive current fraction. Addition of ZnCl2 (1 mm) to the bath solution partially inhibited the current of swollen infected human RBCs (Fig. 1, F and G). The ZnCl2-sensitive current fraction of swollen infected cells activated time-dependently at hyperpolarizing voltages (Fig. 1F, inset) and amounted to about 50% of the inward current (Fig. 1G). This current fraction (Fig. 1H) displayed an inward rectification and absolute current values similar to the swelling-activated fraction (Fig. 1E, open circles). ZnCl2 inhibited the total inward current of swollen infected cells with an IC50 in the range of 100 μm (Fig. 1I). The voltage dependence and the inhibition by Zn2+ (34Clark S. Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) of the swelling-induced inwardly rectifying anion current fraction in P. falciparum-infected human RBCs resembled that of the ubiquitously expressed, swelling activated Cl– channel ClC-2 (28Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Thiemann A. Grunder S.

If the inwardly rectifying infection-induced anion conductance was indeed generated by ClC-2 then heterologously expressed ClC-2 channels should be activated by oxidative stress. In order to test for sensitivity of ClC-2 to oxidation, we injected mRNA encoding ClC-2 into Xenopus laevis oocytes as described previously (35Grunder S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Two electrode voltage clamp demonstrated volume sensitive and inwardly rectifying anion currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing ClC-2 but not in water-injected oocytes (Fig. 2A). Exposure of the ClC-2 expressing oocytes to the oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP, 1 mm) resulted in a strong activation of inwardly rectifying anion currents (Fig. 2, B and C), which was reversed upon reduction by dithiothreitol (5 mm; Fig. 2, B and C). No similar current was induced by oxidation in water-injected oocytes (Fig. 2C) indicating that the current was indeed due to activation of ClC-2. The heterologously expressed ClC-2 current was reversibly inhibited by ZnCl2 added to the bath solution with an apparent IC50 in the range of about 30 μm (Fig. 2D). Those experiments allow us to suggest that, if ClC-2 is expressed in RBCs, it will be activated by oxidative stress imposed by either infection with P. falciparum or exposure to oxidants. Western blot analysis of RBC membrane preparations shows that ClC-2 protein is indeed expressed in erythrocytes. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, staining with a ClC-2-specific antibody yielded a single band in human RBCs and two bands in mouse RBCs at the expected molecular size in the range of 100 kDa. The bands were absent in RBCs from Clcn2–/– mice (Fig. 3A) confirming the specificity of the antibody. To test for functional significance of ClC-2 in non-treated mouse RBCs, erythrocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin amount, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; and percentage of reticulocytes were measured in non-treated blood from non-infected wild-type and Clcn2–/– mice. In addition, density of non-treated and non-infected mouse RBCs was assesse"

In this study, we examined the target genes of IL-13 by the cDNA microarray analysis in human dermal fibroblasts. We focused on the human α2(I) collagen gene, which was one of the IL-13-induced genes by the microarray analysis. IL-13 induced type I collagen protein as well as mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Actinomycin D, an RNA synthesis inhibitor, significantly blocked the IL-13-mediated up-regulation of α2(I) collagen mRNA expression, whereas cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not block this up-regulation. In addition, IL-13 treatment induced the promoter activity of α2(I) collagen by nuclear run-on transcription assay and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. IL-13-mediated transcriptional activation of α2(I) collagen gene or type I collagen protein up-regulation was inhibited by the treatment of fibroblasts with a selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, or STAT6 antisense oligonucleotide, but not by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK/ERK, or SB202190 or SB203580, specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK; IL-13 induced the phosphorylation of PI3K p85 regulatory subunit and STAT6. These results suggest that IL-13 may play a role in the regulation of extracellular matrix and indicate the possible therapeutic value of the blockade of IL-13 signaling pathways via PI3K and STAT6 in fibrosis.

Asselin S. Bensussan A. Shire D. Vita N. Vyakarnam A. Wijdenes J. Ferrara P. Caput D. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 203-213PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for IL-13 is closely linked to the IL-4 gene (2Morgan J.G. Dolganov G.M. Robbins S.E. Hinton L.M. Lovett M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the IL-13 protein has been shown to have a 30% identity in the amino acid sequence to IL-4 protein (3Zurawski S.M. Vega F.J. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that IL-4 receptor and IL-13 receptor may share a common component that appears to function in signal transduction (3Zurawski S.M. Vega F.J. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Sharing many biological properties with IL-4, IL-13 induces cell surface phenotype changes and displays immunomodulatory effects on B cells and human monocytes (4McKenzie A.N.J. Culpepper J.A. de Malefyt R. Briere F. Punnonen J. Aversa G. Sato A. Dang W. Cocks B.G. Menon S. de Vries J.E. Banchereau J. Zurawski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to IL-4, IL-13 has been shown not to affect T cells (5Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 6Punnonen J.

IL-13 induces proliferation and differentiation of B cells, enhances proliferative responses to anti-IgM and anti-CD40 antibodies, up-regulates major histocompatibility complex class II and CD23 expression, and induces anti-CD40-dependent IgE class switch and certain immunoglobulin isotypes such as IgG4 on B cells (1Minty A.

In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes, IL-13 inhibits the production of chemokines (IL-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1), hematopoietic growth factors (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, and IL-6) (1Minty A.

Mohan-Peterson S. Bennett B. Culpepper J. Dang W. Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IL-13 is considered to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine. On the other hand, there have been quite a few reports that discussed its effects on fibroblasts. High affinity IL-13 receptor is reported to be expressed in normal skin fibroblasts (10Murata T. Husain S.R. Mohri H. Puri R.K. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, total collagen protein and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 protein are up-regulated in normal skin fibroblast after stimulation by IL-13 (11Oriente A. Fedarko N.S. Pacocha S.E. Huang S.K. Lichtenstein L.M. Essayan D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-13 inhibits IL-1β-induced matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 protein production (11Oriente A. Fedarko N.S. Pacocha S.E. Huang S.K. Lichtenstein L.M. Essayan D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, IL-13 is thought to be associated with the regulation of extracellular matrix synthesis in the skin. In this study, we examined the target genes of IL-13 by the cDNA microarray analysis in human dermal fibroblasts. We focused on the human α2(I) collagen gene, which was induced by IL-13 by the microarray analysis. We investigated the mechanisms regulating the human α2(I) collagen gene expression by IL-13 in dermal fibroblasts.

Interferon-γ, LY294002, PD98059, SB202190, SB203580, and wortmannin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla CA). Anti-STAT6 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Cultures—Human dermal fibroblasts were obtained by skin biopsy of six healthy donors. All of the biopsies were obtained with informed consent and institutional approval. Primary explant cultures were established in 25-cm2 culture flasks in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin, as described previously (14Ihn H. Tamaki K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Ihn H. Yamane K. Asano Y. Kubo M. Tamaki K. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. The fibroblasts between the third and sixth subpassages were used for experiments. Microarray—The cDNA microarray hybridization experiments were performed using Intelligene Human CHIP 1K version 1.0 (codes X1071), Intelligene Human DNA CHIP for endocrine disruption study version 1.1 (codes X103) and Intelligene Human Cytokine CHIP Version 3.0 (codes X104; Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protocol and the complete listing of nearly 1000, 240, and 550 genes on Intelligene Human CHIP 1K, Intelligene Human DNA CHIP for endocrine disruption study, and Intelligene Human Cytokine CHIP are available on the web, respectively. An approximately 300-bp cDNA region of each gene, which has minimal homology against other genes registered at cDNA data base, is spotted on this DNA chip. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated and used to prepare cDNAs that were fluorescently labeled with either Cy3 (IL-13-untreated) or Cy5 (IL-13-treated) fluorescent dyes. The samples were mixed and applied to DNA microarrays. The DNA arrays were scanned using ScanArray (GS Lumonics), and the data were analyzed using the Quant Array (BM BIO, Tokyo, Japan) (16Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Nakaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16797-16803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A gene expression ratio (Cy5/Cy3) of >1.5 or <0.67 was considered significant. Immunoblotting—Dermal fibroblasts were cultured until they were confluent. The cells were serum-starved in MEM and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h prior to cytokine treatment. After incubation with the indicated reagent, the condition medium was collected. The remaining cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots of conditioned media (normalized for cell numbers) or cell lysates (normalized for protein concentrations as measured by the Bio-Rad reagent) were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (17Ihn H.

Then the filters were incubated overnight with secondary antibody, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The densities of bands were measured using densitometer. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (18Ihn H.

RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nylon filters (Roche Applied Science). The filters were UV cross-linked, prehybridized, and sequentially hybridized with probes for α2(I) collagen and GAPDH. The membranes were then washed, exposed to x-ray film, and scanned with a densitometer. Plasmid Construction—Generation of a –3500 COL1A2/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct consisting of the human collagen α2(I) gene fragment (+58 to –3500 bp relative to the transcription start site) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was previously described (21Ihn H.

After incubation overnight, the medium was replaced with MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin or with MEM containing various amounts of cytokines, and incubation was continued for 48 h. The cells were harvested in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 8) and fractured by freeze thawing. Extracts, normalized for protein content as measured by the Bio-Rad reagent, were incubated with butyryl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol for 90 min at 37 °C. Butyrated chloramphenicol was extracted using an organic solvent (2:1 mixture of tetramethylpentadecane and xylene) and quantitated with scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine statistical significance. Nuclear Run-on Transcription—Nuclear run-on transcription analysis was performed according to a modified protocol that uses digoxigeninlabeled UTP (24Merscher S. Hanselmann R. Welter C. Dooley S.

BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei (2 × 107) from control and IL-13-treated fibroblasts were incubated with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Applied Science). Purified mRNA from each treatment was hybridized to nylon filters containing linearized and immobilized cDNA plasmids (5 μg) of α2(I) collagen, corresponding vector, and GAPDH. After hybridization, the digoxigenin-chemiluminescent detection procedure was performed exactly following the manufacture's instructions (Digoxigenin System User's Guide for Filter Hybridization; Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation—To prepare the extracts of total cellular proteins, the fibroblasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. 500 μg of total cellular protein were incubated with antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI3K or STAT6 at 4 °C overnight, followed by 2 h of incubation with protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) at 4 °C. After three washes in lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1000). The membrane was washed and then incubated with a secondary antibody against mouse IgG (1:500) for 1 h. As a loading control, immunoblotting was also performed using antibodies against p85 or STAT6 (1:1000). Treatment of Dermal Fibroblasts with the STAT6 Antisense Oligonucleotide—We used a STAT6 20-mer antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (CGGTCCATCTCAGAGAAGGC), which overlaps the promoter of the STAT6 gene. This same sequence has been found to be sufficient in blocking STAT6 transcription in vitro (27Hill S. Herlaar E. Le Cardinal A. van Heeke G. Nicklin P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A sense oligonucleotide served as the control. Transient transfection was performed using the Lipofectin technique with oligonucleotides as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was done using the Mann-Whitney test for the comparisons of means. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Effects of IL-13 on Gene Expression Profiles as Measured by cDNA Microarray Analysis—The technique of differential hybridization of cDNA expression arrays was used to identify differences in the expression pattern of genes between control and IL-13-treated fibroblasts. Among nearly 1800 genes, over 1700 of them showed no significantly different hybridization signal between control and IL-13-treated cultures. The results for important genes are shown in Table I. Human α2(I) collagen gene showed significant induction by IL-13 (5.96-fold). However, transforming growth factor-β-related genes did not show significant induction by IL-13 (TGF-β1, 1.01-fold; TGF-β2, 0.34-fold; TGF-β3, 0.41-fold; TGF-β receptor type II, 0.62-fold; and TGF-β receptor type III, 0.78-fold).Table ISummary of IL-13-regulated genes identified by microarray analysisGene nameGene accession numberExpression ratioGenes most highly inducedα2(I) collagenNM_0000895.96Activating transcription factor 3NM_0040242.60Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1AF2206562.32G protein-coupled receptorU677842.02Hexokinase 1AF0163652.02Nescient helix loop helix 1M967390.84Arabidopsis chlorophyll ab-binding proteinAB0387141.72Genes most decreasedCarcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1X163540.12Hepatic leukemia factorM955850.13Neuropeptide Y receptor Y1NM_0009090.14Protein kinase C-binding protein 2AF2215200.15Aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A1AL0312300.17Interleukin-16M903910.23Early growth response 2NM_0003990.26Transcription factor AP-2γU856580.31Coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptorNM_0019920.34γ-Aminobutyric acid A receptor ϵU922850.34Human proteinase activated receptor-2U670580.36Tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 11AF0537120.36G protein-coupled receptor 37U874600.37tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 10bAF0162660.40α1 integrinX687420.41Rac/Cdc-42 guanine exchange factor 6D253040.41Bullous pemphigoid antigen 1NM_0017230.44Nephronophthisis 1NM_0002720.44Bone morphogenetic protein 4NM_0012020.46Thyroid hormone receptor interactor 4NM_0162130.46Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6U396570.46Nuclear antigen Sp100AF0563220.48Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1X723040.49Bone morphogenetic protein 7NM_0017190.49Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1NM_0056580.50Bone morphogenetic protein 6NM_0017180.56Interferon regulatory factor 2NM_0021990.57Transmembrane protein 1AB0015230.58Transforming growth factor-β-related genesTransforming growth factor-β1NM_0006601.01Transforming growth factor-β2NM_0032380.34Transforming growth factor-β3NM_0032390.42Transforming growth factor-β receptor IIINM_0032430.78Transforming growth factor-β receptor IID506830.62 Open table in a new tab Human α2(I) Collagen Gene Expression in Human Dermal Fibroblasts Is Up-regulated by IL-13—We investigated the effects of IL-13 on the expression of α2(I) collagen gene in human dermal fibroblasts. First, we investigated the effects of IL-13 on type I collagen protein expression in dermal fibroblasts. We investigated the dose dependence of the effect of IL-13 on the expression of type I collagen. Human dermal fibroblasts were cultured until they were confluent and then incubated for an additional 24 h under conditions of serum starvation. The cells were subsequently incubated with the indicated doses of IL-13 prior to the collection of medium. IL-13 increased the synthesis of type I collagen into conditioned medium (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, to examine the time dependence of the effect of IL-13 on the expression of type I collagen, the fibroblasts were incubated in serum-free medium for the indicated time in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IL-13, which was added 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h prior to the collection of medium. Type I collagen protein level was elevated after 12 h and markedly increased after 24 h, and the increase was sustained up to after 72 h, compared with the level in control cells (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, we compared the effects of IL-13, IL-4, TGF-β, or interferon-γ on type I collagen protein expression by dermal fibroblasts. IL-13 or IL-4 induced type I collagen expression modestly, whereas TGF-β had the strongest effect (Fig. 1, E and F). To determine whether the IL-13-mediated induction of type I collagen protein expression was correlated with an increase of the mRNA level, human dermal fibroblasts were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml IL-13 under the same conditions, and mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting. The human α2(I) collagen mRNA level was elevated after stimulation with IL-13 for 6 h and increased after 12 h in comparison with the control level (Fig. 2). Therefore, the effect of IL-13 on the type I collagen protein level paralleled that on the mRNA level. Mechanisms of IL-13-mediated α2(I) Collagen Gene Up-regulation—To establish whether the increase in α2(I) collagen mRNA levels after IL-13 treatment involves transcriptional activation, we tested the effect of actinomycin D on IL-13-induced α2(I) collagen gene expression. Fibroblasts were treated with IL-13 for 6 h in the presence or absence of a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D (400 ng/ml). Cell viability was determined with trypan blue stain, which demonstrated that actinomycin D did not cause cell death. Actinomycin D completely blocked the IL-13-mediated increase in α2(I) collagen mRNA, suggesting that IL-13 stimulation of α2(I) collagen mRNA involves direct activation of transcription of the α2(I) collagen gene and/or other genes involved in α2(I) collagen gene regulation (Fig. 3). In addition, we asked whether this stimulation requires the synthesis of new proteins. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was added to fibroblasts together with IL-13 for 6 h. Cell viability was determined with trypan blue stain, which demonstrated that cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) did not cause cell death. Cycloheximide did not change α2(I) collagen mRNA in IL-13-treated fibroblasts (Fig. 3), suggesting that IL-13-mediated up-regulation of α2(I) collagen mRNA is independent of new protein synthesis. Transcriptional Activation of the Human α2(I) Collagen Gene by IL-13—We next examined the effect of IL-13 on the promoter activity of the human α2(I) collagen gene. The direct measurement of the specific gene transcription using nuclear run-on transcription analysis showed a elevation in the rate of α2(I) collagen gene transcription in fibroblasts treated with IL-13 (4.02-fold) (Fig. 4A). This result was confirmed by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay using the –3500 COL1A2/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs. IL-13 induced the promoter activity of α2(I) collagen gene in a dose-dependent manner, which was maximal at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that IL-13 mediates the transcriptional activation of the α2(I) collagen gene. LY294002 and STAT6 Antisense Oligonucleotide Inhibits IL-13-mediated Up-regulation of α2(I) Collagen Promoter Activity and Type I Collagen Protein—To investigate which intracellular signaling pathway plays a crucial role in transcriptional activation of the human α2(I) collagen gene in dermal fibroblasts, we examined the effects of inhibitors of intracellular signaling, such as PI3K, MEK/ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), on the promoter activity of the α2(I) collagen gene. As shown in Fig. 5A, the promoter activity of the α2(I) collagen gene induced by IL-13 was inhibited by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the promoter activity of the gene induced by IL-13 was not changed by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK/ERK, SB202190, or SB203580, specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, the synthesis of type I collagen protein induced by IL-13 was inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, B and C). Wortmannin, another PI3K inhibitor, decreased the synthesis of type I collagen protein induced by IL-13. In contrast, the synthesis of type I collagen protein was not changed by PD98059 or SB203580. PI3K is composed of the p110 catalytic subunit and the p85 regulatory subunit. The activity of PI3K is regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. Immunoprecipitation using anti-PI3K p85 antibodies revealed a significant phosphorylation (2.4-fold) of p85 after 5 min of treatment with IL-13, followed by a slow decrease in the cellular level of the phosphorylated p85 (Fig. 5D).Fig. 5LY294002 and STAT6 antisense oligonucleotide inhibits IL-13-mediated up-regulation of α2(I) collag"

Necdin shows a significant homology to MAGE (melanoma antigen) family proteins, all of which contain a large homology domain. MAGE-D1 (NRAGE, Dlxin-1) interacts with the Dlx/Msx family homeodomain proteins via an interspersed hexapeptide repeat domain distinct from the homology domain. Here we report that necdin associates with the Msx homeodomain proteins via MAGE-D1 to modulate their function. In vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that MAGE-D1 directly interacted with necdin via the homology domain and Msx1 (or Msx2) via the repeat domain. A ternary complex of necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx2 was formed in vitro, and an endogenous complex containing these three proteins was detected in differentiating embryonal carcinoma cells. Co-expression of necdin and MAGE-D1 released Msx-dependent transcriptional repression. C2C12 myoblast cells that were stably transfected with Msx2 cDNA showed a marked reduction in myogenic differentiation, and co-expression of necdin and MAGE-D1 canceled the Msx2-dependent repression.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The necdin gene is expressed predominantly in postmitotic neurons (2Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H.

In primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia from mouse embryos, down-regulation of endogenous necdin expression results in a severe impairment of neuronal maturation and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells (12Takazaki R.

Necdin knockout mice show a phenotype resembling Prader-Willi syndrome, a genomic imprinting-associated neurobehavioral disorder, suggesting that the absence of necdin impairs neuronal differentiation or maturation (5Gerard M.

These findings suggest that necdin facilitates terminal differentiation and prevents apoptosis in neurons and that necdin has a similar function in terminally differentiated non-neuronal cells. Necdin shows a significant homology to MAGE family proteins, the remarkable feature of which is a large central region termed MAGE homology domain (MHD). 1The abbreviations used are: MHD, MAGE homology domain; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MHC, myosin heavy chain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; E, embryonic day. MHD is consistent with the functional region through which necdin interacts with various proteins such as SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, E2F1, E2F4, p53, NEFA, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U, and p75 neurotrophin receptor (4Taniguchi N.

For example, necdin, MAGE-D1 (18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A.

The fact that most of the necdin interactors are related to cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis suggests that necdin exerts its diverse biological activities through its MHD. Recently, the necdin homologous protein MAGE-D1(also designated NRAGE or Dlxin-1) has been characterized as a regulator of apoptosis and transcriptional modulators. NRAGE, a rat homolog of human MAGE-D1, binds to p75 neurotrophin receptor via the MHD and confers nerve growth factor-dependent apoptosis through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent mitochondrial pathway (18Salehi A.H.

In this study, we attempted to examine the association between necdin and MAGE-D1 in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that necdin interacts with Msx homeodomain proteins via MAGE-D1, releases Msx-dependent transcriptional repression, and promotes muscle differentiation by canceling Msx-induced repression. These indicate that two types of MAGE proteins cooperate to regulate the function of Msx homeodomain proteins in cellular differentiation. Immunoblotting—Tissues of ICR mouse embryos were homogenized with a lysis buffer containing 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. C2C12, COS-7, and N1E-115 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, harvested, and suspended in the lysis buffer. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured and induced to differentiate as described (25McBurney M.W. Reuhl K.R. Ally A.I. Nasipuri S. Bell J.C. Craig J. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and incubated with anti-MAGE-D1 antibody (1:1,000) or anti-necdin antibody (NC243) (26Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 22: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse MAGE-D1 polyclonal antibody was raised in New Zealand rabbit against purified maltose-binding protein (MBP)-MAGE-D1 (amino acids 1–775) fusion protein. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel), necdin and MAGE-D1 were detected by the chemiluminescence method (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry—Tissues in ICR mice at E12.5 and E14.5 were fixed by transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The whole embryos were immersed in the same fixative followed by cryoprotection with 20% sucrose and cut at a thickness of 20 μm by a cryostat. The sections mounted on glass slides coated with gelatin were incubated with anti-necdin antibody (NC243) (1:500) and anti-MAGE-D1 antibody (1:300) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% normal goat serum at room temperature for 3 h. The tissues were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500) (Cappel). Fluorescent images were observed with a fluorescence microscope (BX60–34-FLAD1, Olympus), taken by CCD camera system (M-3204C, Olympus), and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. In Vitro Binding—cDNA encoding MAGE-D1 (amino acids 1–775) and MAGE-D1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotide primers and inserted directionally into pMALC2 (New England Biolabs). MBP-MAGE-D1 fusion proteins were affinity-purified with amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Purified fusion proteins (5 μg) bound to amylose resin (40 μl) were incubated with purified His-tagged necdin (amino acids 1–325) (50 ng) at 4 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of the binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (10Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm maltose. His-tagged necdin was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected with an anti-necdin antibody (C2) (1:1,000) (1Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) by the chemiluminescence method. For detection of the complex of MAGE-D1 and Msx, cDNAs encoding mouse Msx1 (amino acids 1–297) (a gift from Dr. C. Abate-Shen, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) and Msx2 (amino acids 1–267), which was isolated from the library of neurally differentiated P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, were cloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. MBP-MAGE-D1 fusion proteins (5 μg) bound to amylose resin (40 μl) were incubated with GST-Msx1 or GST-Msx2 fusion proteins (1 μg) at 4 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of the binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted and detected by Western blotting using an anti-GST antibody (1:2,000) (Sigma) as above. Co-immunoprecipitation—cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged MAGE-D1 and its deletion mutants were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Combinations of the expression vectors p3xFLAG-necdin (amino acids 1–325), Myc-tagged MAGE-D1, and Myc-tagged MAGE-D1 deletion mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells and harvested 48 h after transfection as described previously (11Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell extracts (400 μg) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with an anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (1:5) or antibody NC243 (1:100) in 200 μl of a lysis buffer containing 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The complexes were pelleted with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane, and blotted with antibody 9E10 (1:10) or antibody NC243 (1:3,000) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel). For detection of the complexes containing Msx1 (or Msx2), cDNAs encoding Msx1 and Msx2 were inserted into p3xFLAG expression vector (Sigma). Combinations of the expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged Msx1 and Msx2 were transfected into COS-7 cells, and Msx-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated and detected with anti-FLAG antibody M2 and anti-MAGE-D1 antibody. For analysis of the ternary complex of necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx1 (Msx2), combinations of expression vectors for FLAG-tagged necdin, Myc-tagged MAGE-D1, and Myc-tagged Msx1(Msx2) were transfected into COS-7. The complex was precipitated with antibody NC243 (1:100) and detected with antibody 9E10 (1:10) as above. Immunoaffinity Purification—To detect the complex containing necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx2, P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured and induced to differentiate by retinoic acid treatment for 4 days as described previously (25McBurney M.W. Reuhl K.R. Ally A.I. Nasipuri S. Bell J.C. Craig J. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were applied to HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with IgG fractions of anti-necdin (NC243) antibody, anti-MAGE-D1 antibody, or preimmune antiserum. Bound proteins were eluted with 2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). Fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed with cold acetone, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibody NC243 (1:3,000), anti-MAGE-D1 antibody (1:1,000), and anti-Msx2 polyclonal antibody (H-70, 1:300) (Sigma). Integrated signal intensities were quantified with a chemiluminescence image analyzer (LAS-1000, FujiFilm). Msx-dependent Transcription—N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were cultured and transfected as described (11Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For Gal4-mediated luciferase assay, cDNAs encoding Msx1 (amino acids 1–297) and Msx2 (amino acids 1–267) were inserted into pBIND (Promega) to make Gal4-Msx1 (pBIND-Msx1) and Gal4-Msx2 (pBIND-Msx2), respectively. Combinations of pBIND-Msx1, pBIND-Msx2, Myc-MAGE-D1, and FLAG-necdin were transfected into N1E-115 cells along with pG5luc reporter vector (Promega). For Wnt1 enhancer luciferase reporter assay, combinations of expression vectors encoding FLAG-Msx1 (FLAG-Msx2), Myc-MAGE-D1, and FLAG-necdin were infected into N1E-115 cells along with the Wnt1 luciferase reporter construct (pGL2-WIP) (provided by Dr. C. Abate-Shen) (27Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Muller H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold) using a reagent kit (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). Transfection efficiency was normalized with co-transfected LacZ reporter plasmid (pRc-LacZ). Immunocytochemistry—C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as a growth medium. p3xFLAG-Msx2 and p3xFLAG (4 μg each) were transfected into C2C12 cells by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). G418-resistant colonies were obtained after a 14-day incubation, and C2C12 cells expressing FLAG-Msx2 and FLAG were subcultured in the growth medium for 7–14 days. Myogenic differentiation was initiated by incubating confluent cloned cells for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum as a differentiation medium (28Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min and permeabilized with methanol/acetone (1:1) at –20 °C for 20 min. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:300) and an antibody against MHC (MF-20) (1:2) (a gift from Dr. T. Komiya, Osaka City University) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% normal goat serum at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 120 min with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500), treated with 3.3 μm Hoechst 33342 for chromosomal DNA detections, and observed with the fluorescence microscope. Recombinant Adenoviruses—Adenoviruses expressing LacZ, necdin (amino acids 1–325), and Myc-tagged MAGE-D1 (amino acids 1–775) were constructed using AdEasy adenoviral system (Stratagene). DNAs encoding LacZ, necdin, and Myc-MAGE-D1 were inserted into pShuttle-CMV, amplified, and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloned C2C12 cells were infected with each adenovirus at 1.5 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml and cultured in the growth medium for 24 h and then in differentiation medium for 72 h. Efficiency of muscle differentiation was judged by MHC expression with antibody MF-20 (1:2) and MyoD (M-318, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:500). MHC expression levels relative to tubulin expression levels were quantified with the image analyzer. Interactions between Necdin and MAGE-D1 in Vitro and in Vivo—We first analyzed the expression patterns of necdin and MAGE-D1 in mouse embryo by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1). Endogenous ∼43-kDa necdin protein was detected almost exclusively in the brain and skeletal muscle at embryonic day (E) 18.5 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, endogenous ∼85-kDa MAGE-D1 protein was expressed in a ubiquitous manner, although the levels in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and kidney were higher than those in the small intestine and liver. In various cell lines, necdin was detected only in neurally differentiated P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, whereas MAGE-D1 was expressed in C2C12 myoblast cells, COS-7 kidney cells, N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, and P19 cells (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry revealed that necdin and MAGE-D1 were concentrated in the preplate (i.e. a structure composed of early differentiated postmitotic cells) of the forebrain at E12.5 and skeletal muscle tissues in the hind limb at E14.5 (Fig. 1C). In developing neural tube, MAGE-D1 immunoreactivity was distributed in the ventricular zone containing a mixed population of neuroepithelial stem cells and neuronal progenitors as well as in postmitotic cells at the marginal zone. Because expression of necdin and MAGE-D1 overlapped in these regions, we speculated that necdin and MAGE-D1 potentially form a heterodimer in vivo. Interactions between Necdin and MAGE-D1—To investigate whether necdin and MAGE-D1 form a heterodimer in vitro, we constructed various MAGE-D1 deletion mutants fused to MBP and examined their interactions with His-tagged necdin (Fig. 2, A–C). Full-length MAGE-D1 (amino acids 1–775) and deletion mutants encompassing the MHD (amino acids 466–775 and 553–688) interacted with His-tagged necdin, indicating that necdin and MAGE-D1 form a heterodimer via the MHD. We then examined the interaction between necdin and MAGE-D1 in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 2, D and E). Full-length MAGE-D1 and MAGE-D1ΔN was co-immunoprecipitated with necdin, but MAGE-D1ΔC failed to bind necdin (Fig. 2E, upper panel). Necdin was also co-immunoprecipitated with MAGE-D1 (Fig. 2E, lower panel). These results together suggest that necdin complexes with MAGE-D1 in vitro and in vivo. Interactions of MAGE-D1 with Msx1 and Msx2—Because MAGE-D1 (Dlxin-1) possesses a specific domain that interacts with Dlx/Msx family homeodomain proteins (23Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we examined whether MAGE-D1 interacts in vitro with Msx1 and Msx2 (Fig. 3, A–C). Msx1 and Msx2 bound to MBP-MAGE-D1 fusion proteins containing the WQXPXX repeats (amino acids 1–775, 1–479, and 291–441), but the deletion mutants lacking the repeat domain (amino acids 466–775 and 1–291) failed to interact with Msx1 and Msx2. We next examined whether MAGE-D1 binds to Msx1 and Msx2 in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation assay using COS-7 cells, which express endogenous MAGE-D1 (Fig. 3D). FLAG-Msx1 and FLAG-Msx2 were co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous MAGE-D1. Conversely, endogenous MAGE-D1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Msx1 and FLAG-Msx2. These data indicate that MAGE-D1 directly binds to Msx1 and Msx2. Formation of a Complex Containing Necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx—We next examined the formation of a complex containing necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4). Msx1 was co-immunoprecipitated with necdin in the presence and absence of MAGE-D1 (Fig. 4A). The complex formation between necdin and Msx1 in the absence of MAGE-D1 is likely because of the presence of endogenous MAGE-D1 in COS-7 cells. Similarly, Msx2 was co-immunoprecipitated with necdin (Fig. 4B). Neither Myc-Msx1 nor Myc-Msx2 was co-immunoprecipitated with a necdin deletion mutant (necdinΔ243–306), which was defective in MAGE-D1 binding activity, when co-expressed with MAGE-D1 in this assay system (data not shown). These results suggest that necdin interacts with Msx1 and Msx2 via MAGE-D1. We then attempted to detect an endogenous complex containing necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx2 in tissue lysates by immunoaffinity purification. However, we were unable to find normal tissues or primary cells that contain high levels of Msx and necdin for biochemical analyses. Furthermore, we failed to detect the Msx protein in skeletal muscle tissues of the hind limb at E14.5 and E18.5 by Western blotting (data not shown). We alternatively used P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, whose endogenous Msx2 expression is up-regulated upon cell aggregation (29Marazzi G. Wang Y. Sassoon D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Expression of necdin and Msx2 was up-regulated in retinoic acid-treated P19 cells, but MAGE-D1 expression levels remained almost unchanged during the course of neural differentiation (Fig. 4C). For detection of the endogenous complex, extracts of retinoic acid-treated P19 cells were subjected to the immunoaffinity purification using antibodies against necdin and MAGE-D1 (Fig. 4, D and E). Both MAGE-D1 and Msx2 bound to immunopurified necdin, and both necdin and Msx2 bound to immunopurified MAGE-D1. About 2% of the amounts of necdin and MAGE-D1 in the lysate were recovered after immunoaffinity purification. Under these conditions, 0.9 and 0.3% of the amounts of Msx2 and MAGE-D1, respectively, in the lysate bound to necdin, whereas 0.7 and 0.5% of the amounts of Msx2 and necdin, respectively, in the lysate bound to MAGE-D1. These results suggest that the endogenous complex containing necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx2 is present in neurally differentiating P19 cells in vivo. Release from Msx-dependent Transcriptional Repression by Necdin and MAGE-D1—Because Msx1 and Msx2 are potent repressors of the Wnt1 promoter (30Iler N. Rowitch D.H. Echelard Y. McMahon A.P. Abate-Shen C. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we examined whether a complex of necdin and MAGE-D1 modulates the Msx-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 5). We carried out the Msx-dependent transcriptional assay in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, which express endogenous MAGE-D1 but not necdin as shown in Fig. 1B. Transfection of expression vectors for Gal4-Msx1 and Gal4-Msx2 resulted in the repression (44 and 32% of control values, respectively) of GAL4 site-containing reporter, whereas co-transfection with necdin and MAGE-D1 released the repression to 95 and 97% of the control levels, respectively (Fig. 5A). Necdin alone released the repression by Gal4-Msx1 and Gal4-Msx2 to 70 and 80%, respectively, presumably due to endogenous MAGE-D1 present in N1E-115 cells. We next examined the effects of these proteins on the transcription of the Wnt1 promoter (WIP) containing the Msx-binding site (30Iler N. Rowitch D.H. Echelard Y. McMahon A.P. Abate-Shen C. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Msx1 and Msx2 also repressed the transcription of the WIP promoter (41 and 30% of the control level, respectively), whereas the activity was recovered to 80 and 67% of the control level, respectively, by co-expression of necdin and MAGE-D1. Necdin alone released the repression by Msx1 and Msx2 to 65 and 50%, respectively. These observations indicate that necdin releases Msx-dependent transcriptional repression via MAGE-D1. Release from Msx2-induced Myogenic Repression by Necdin and MAGE-D1—Because Msx2 inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts (28Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar, 31Takahashi K. Nuckolls G.H. Takahashi I. Nonaka K. Nagata M. Ikura T. Slavkin H.C. Shum L. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we used this cell line as a model system to examine the effects of necdin and MAGE-D1 on Msx-dependent myogenic repression. We established C2C12 myoblast cells that stably express FLAG-Msx2. In wild-type C2C12 cells, MHC (i.e. a marker for skeletal muscle differentiation) and MAGE-D1 were distributed predominantly in the cytosol of multinucleated differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis revealed that differentiated C2C12 cells expressed MHC and MAGE-D1, whereas necdin was undetected in C2C12 cells even under differentiated conditions (Fig. 6B). We then analyzed myogenic differentiation of FLAG-Msx2-expressing C2C12 clones. Under differentiation conditions, only a few MHC-positive mononucleated cells appeared in Msx2-expressing C2C12 cultures, indicating an impairment in myotube formation (Fig. 6C). C2C12 cells expressing FLAG-Msx2 differentiated into myocytes at much lower efficiency than control C2C12 cells as judged by MHC expression levels (Fig. 6D). We then examined the effects of necdin and MAGE-D1 on myogenic differentiation of Msx2-expressing C2C12 cells (Fig. 7). Expression of necdin by adenovirus vector-mediated gene transfer up-regulated MHC expression and promoted myotube formation, whereas infection of adenoviruses expressing LacZ and MAGE-D1 had little effect on MHC expression (Fig. 7A). Necdin and MAGE-D1 increased MHC expression ∼9 times the control level (Fig. 7, B and C). Necdin alone up-regulated the MHC expression 3 times the control level, presumably because of the presence of endogenous MAGE-D1. Similarly, necdin and MAGE-D1 up-regulated the expression of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD ∼5 times the control level, and necdin alone increased the MyoD level ∼3 times the control level (Fig. 7B). The complex of necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx2 in the nuclear fraction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 7D). Co-expression of necdin and Myc-tagged MAGE-D1 formed the complex efficiently. This may be because exogenous MAGE-D1, when co-expressed with necdin, tends to accumulate preferentially in the nucleus. Expression of MAGE-D1, necdin, or both in control C2C12 cells, which express no endogenous Msx2, failed to promote the myogenesis (data not shown). These data indicate that necdin and MAGE-D1 released Msx2-induced myogenic repression through formation of the complex with Msx2. The present study has shown that MAGE family members cooperate to modulate the function of Msx homeodomain proteins, which are key transcription factors for cellular differentiation (32Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The MAGE family proteins are grouped into two types based on their sequence similarities in the MHDs (33Barker P.A. Salehi A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Type I MAGE members (MAGE-A–C subfamilies) are expressed in undifferentiated cells such as transformed cells and testicular germ cells, whereas type II MAGE members are expressed in differentiated cells such as neurons. Necdin and MAGE-D1, whose functions have been best documented among MAGE proteins, are classified as type II MAGE proteins. Type II MAGE proteins may be divided further into two subgroups based on the similarities in the MHD sequences and molecular sizes; A subgroup (“necdin subgroup”) of type II MAGE proteins consists of relatively short proteins (<350 amino acid residues) whose MHD sequences are more homologous to that of necdin. This subgroup includes necdin, MAGE-F1, G1, and H1 in mammals, Drosophila MAGE (34Pold M. Pold A. Ma H.J. Sjak-Shieb N.N. Vescio R.A. Berensonb J.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2000; 24: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and zebrafish MAGE (35Bischof J.M. Ekker M. Wevrick R. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The other subgroup (“MAGE-D subgroup”) consists of larger proteins (>650 amino acid residues) bearing N-terminal extensions. This subgroup includes MAGE-D1-D4, MAGE-E1 (DAM-AGE) (36Albrecht D.E. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7014-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and MAGEL2 (NDNL1). Earlier studies have shown that MAGE-D1 interacts, via its MHD, with the death domain receptors p75NTR (18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and UNC5H1 (22Williams M.E. Strickland P. Watanabe K. Hinck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17483-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 (24Matsuda T. Suzuki H. Oishi I. Kani S. Kuroda Y. Komori T. Sasaki A. Watanabe K. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29057-29064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the RING finger protein Praja1 (37Sasaki A. Masuda Y. Iwai K. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22541-22546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The present study has shown that necdin is another MAGE-D1 MHD interactor. Because MAGE-D1 also associates with Msx/Dlx homeodomain proteins via the interspersed repeat domain district from the MHD (Ref 23Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and present study), MAGE-D1 serves as an adapter protein that links these MHD interactors with Msx/Dlx homeodomain proteins. Msx1 and Msx2 (previous Hox-7 and Hox-8, respectively) are two homologs of Drosophila muscle segment homeobox (msh) genes that are expressed in mouse embryos at critical stages of neural tube, neural crest, and craniofacial development (32Davidson D. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Therefore, Msx1 and Msx2 are thought to play important roles in organogenesis and cellular differentiation. For example, forced expression of Msx1 in myoblasts blocks terminal differentiation, and Msx1-expressing cells acquire a transformed phenotype (38Song K. Wang Y. Sassoon D. Nature. 1992; 360: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Msx1 inhibits transcription of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD, which is a target for homeobox gene regulation (39Woloshin P. Song K. Degnin C. Killary A.M. Goldhamer D.J. Sassoon D. Thayer M.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Msx proteins serve as transcriptional repressors and negative regulators of differentiation by preventing cell cycle exit and blocking terminal differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (28Hu G. Lee H. Price S.M. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2373-2384PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Msx2 prevents differentiation and stimulates cell proliferation at the extreme ends of osteogenesis (40Dodig M. Tadic T. Kronenberg M.S. Dacic S. Liu Y.H. Maxson R. Rowe D.W. Lichtler A.C. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Msx homeodomain proteins generally repress terminal differentiation of mesenchymal cells. The present findings showed that necdin releases Msx2-induced repression of myogenic differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 7). This supports the notion that necdin promotes terminal differentiation of postmitotic cells by repressing cell proliferation (11Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Takazaki R. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of endogenous regulation of Msx function by necdin/MAGE proteins in cellular differentiation remains to be elucidated. It has most recently been reported (41Brunelli S. Tagliafico E. De Angelis F.G. Tonlorenzi R. Baesso S. Ferrari S. Niinobe M. Yoshikawa K. Schwartz R.J. Bozzoni I. Cossu G. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that Msx2 and necdin combined activities are required for smooth muscle differentiation in mesoangioblast stem cells, a class of vessel-derived stem cells that can differentiate into different mesodermal cell types. In a mesoangioblast clone that spontaneously expresses a smooth muscle phenotype, Msx2 and necdin are expressed at least 100 times the stem cell level. Co-expression of Msx2 and necdin, but not either alone, induces a number of smooth muscle markers, and their down-regulation through RNA interference results in a decreased expression of smooth muscle markers. These findings suggest that Msx2 and necdin, presumably in the presence of endogenous MAGE-D1, cooperate to promote the smooth muscle differentiation of mesoangioblast stem cells. Furthermore, these raise the possibility that Msx-dependent differentiation of specific cell types is modulated physiologically by necdin and necdin-related MAGE proteins via MAGE-D1. In the nervous system, necdin is expressed predominantly in postmitotic neurons, whereas MAGE-D1 is in proliferative neural progenitors and young postmitotic neurons (18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 42Kendall S. Goldhawk D. Kubu C. Barker P. Verdi J. Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed that MAGE-D1 is expressed in postmitotic cells such as neurons and skeletal myocytes as well as in neuronal progenitors (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we detected overlapping expression of necdin and MAGE-D1 in the preplate, which consists of early differentiated postmitotic cells, in developing mouse brain. These observations suggest that these MAGE proteins form a heteromeric complex in vivo during terminal differentiation and maturation of neurons. In differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, Msx2 mediates death signals from bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (29Marazzi G. Wang Y. Sassoon D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Msx2 also mediates the proapoptotic signals from BMP-4 in ventricular zone neural progenitor cells (43Israsena N. Kessler J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have identified the complex containing necdin, MAGE-D1, and Msx in neurally differentiating P19 cells in vivo (Fig. 4, C–E). Therefore, necdin likely suppresses the Msx-mediated proapoptotic signals by forming a complex with Msx and MAGE-D1 during neuronal differentiation. This is consistent with the idea that necdin has an anti-apoptotic function in neuronal differentiation (11Kobayashi M. Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42128-42135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Takazaki R. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Necdin and MAGE-D1 may also form a complex with Dlx family homeodomain proteins, which have been reported to interact with the murine MAGE-D1 ortholog Dlxin-1 (23Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both necdin and MAGE-D1 were highly expressed in the preplate (Fig. 1C) and the ganglionic eminence in developing mouse brain (3Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells in these regions express Dlx family homeodomain proteins such as Dlx1, Dlx2, Dlx5, and Dlx6 (44Stuhmer T. Anderson S.A. Ekker M. Rubenstein J.L. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of Dlx2 and Dlx5 induces the phenotype of GABAergic neurons (44Stuhmer T. Anderson S.A. Ekker M. Rubenstein J.L. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 245-252PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the complex of necdin and MAGE-D1 modulates the function of Dlx homeodomain proteins in terminal differentiation and specification of GABAergic neurons. Further information about the functional interactions of MAGE proteins with Msx/Dlx homeodomain proteins will lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying organogenesis and cell type specification in mammals.

https://openalex.org/W2012333696,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays a role in mutually exclusive processes such as proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell types. IGF-I is a potent mitogen and motogen for dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vivo and in vitro. However, in differentiated VSMCs, IGF-I is only required for maintaining the differentiated phenotype. Here we investigated the VSMC phenotype-dependent signaling and biological processes triggered by IGF-I. In differentiated VSMCs, IGF-I activated a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, recruited by insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The activated SHP-2 then dephosphorylated IRS-1 Tyr(P)-895, resulting in blockade of the pathways from IRS-1/Grb2/Sos to the ERK and p38 MAPK. Conversely, such negative regulation was silent in dedifferentiated VSMCs, where IGF-I activated both MAPKs via IRS-1/Grb2/Sos interaction-linked Ras activation, leading to proliferation and migration. Thus, our present results demonstrate that the IRS-1/SHP-2 interaction acts as a switch controlling VSMC phenotype-dependent IGF-I-induced signaling pathways and biological processes, and this mechanism is likely to be applicable to other cells.

BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). IGFs activate the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) tyrosine kinase, resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules and/or direct interaction with them (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). The major targets of IGF-IR are three adaptor proteins: IRS-1, Shc, and Gab1. IRS-1, an important substrate for both the insulin receptor and IGF-IR, contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites that recognize Src homology 2 domain-containing signaling molecules, such as Grb2, Nck, the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p85 PI3K), and SHP-2 (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Of these, the binding of Grb2 associated with Sos to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 activates Ras, which switches on the Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade (3Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The ligand-engaged IGF-IR triggers another pathway involving PI3K. The interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-IRβ or insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and p85 PI3K activates PI3K and its downstream molecules, protein kinase B (PKB(Akt)) and p70S6K (4Oldham S. Hafen E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Shc, an Src homology 2 domain-containing substrate for receptor tyrosine kinases, interacts directly with IGF-IR (5Giorgetti S. Pelicci P.G. Pelicci G. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, it recruits the Grb2-Sos complex and activates the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK axis (3Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Gab1 functions as an adaptor protein downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases including IGF-IR (6Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 interacts with Grb2, p85 PI3K, and SHP-2 (7Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the cross-talk among IGF-induced signaling pathways is critical for regulating the variety of biological processes described above. Recent studies (8Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the involvement of IGF-induced signals in the mutually exclusive processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. For instance, pharmacological study showed that although the MAPK pathway induced by IGF-I is involved in the mitogenic response of myoblasts, the PI3K/p70S6K pathway is critical for myogenic differentiation. In hematopoietic cells, IGF-I signaling via IRS-1 plays a role in proliferation and via Shc in differentiation (9Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-23430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, Shc-Grb2 complex formation, and ERK activation is observed in proliferating, but not differentiating, cells (10Boney C.M Smith R.M. Gruppuso P.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1638-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In osteoblasts, IGF-IR-mediated signals via the PI3K, ERK, and p38 MAPK pathways are all involved in differentiation (11Yeh L.C. Adamo M.L. Olson M.S. Lee J.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4181-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the downstream pathways of IGF-I signaling seem to depend on the cellular context. IGF-I is also a potent mitogen and motogen for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vivo and in vitro (12Bornfeldt K.E. Rainco E.W. Nakano T. Groves L.M. Krebs E. Ross R. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 93: 1266-1274Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Bayes-Genis A. Conover C.A. Schwartz R.S. Circ.

Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C856-C868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transcripts (16Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) inhibit IGF-I-induced VSMC proliferation and migration in culture. Targeted overexpression of IGF-I in arteries in vivo (17Zhu B. Zhao G. Witte D.P. Hui D.Y. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3598-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and infusion of IGF-I into the circulatory system (18Chen Y. Capron L. Magnusson J.O. Wallby L.A. Arnqvist H.J. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1998; 8: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have been shown to accelerate neointimal formation after vascular injury. On the other hand, we recently reported a primary culture system of VSMCs that exhibit a differentiated phenotype, in which isolated VSMCs are cultured on laminin under IGF-I-stimulated conditions (19Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Kimura K. Nishida W. Saga H. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Nishida W. Yoshida K. Ohkawa Y. Kitabatake A. Aoki J. Arai H. Sobue K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By using this culture system, we demonstrated that IGF-I is critically involved in maintaining the differentiated phenotype via the PI3K/PKB(Akt) pathway and that the coordinated activation of ERK and p38 MAPK triggered by other growth factors induces VSMC dedifferentiation. Taking these findings together, we concluded that changes in the balance between the strengths of the PI3K/PKB(Akt) and the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways determines the VSMC phenotype. However, none of these studies, including those using VSMCs, revealed the cellular phenotype-dependent switching machinery of the IGF-induced signaling pathways. Here we studied the VSMC phenotype-dependent actions of IGF-I by characterizing the IGF-I-induced signaling pathways. In differentiated VSMCs, SHP-2 preferentially associated with IRS-1 and inhibited the interaction between IRS-1 and Grb2/Sos, resulting in a blockade of the pathways from Ras to ERK and p38 MAPK. Therefore, in differentiated VSMCs, IGF-1 solely activates the PI3K/PKB(Akt) pathway, which plays a role in maintaining the differentiated phenotype. Conversely, the proliferation and migration of dedifferentiated VSMCs in response to IGF-I were because of an IGF-I-induced interaction between IRS-1 and Grb2/Sos, followed by the activation of Ras and its downstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK. This is the first report demonstrating that the cellular phenotype-dependent IRS-1/SHP-2 interaction functions as a switch for IGF-I signalings and distinct biological processes. Reagents and Antibodies—Signaling inhibitors (LY294002, wortmannin, PD98059, SB203580, and SB220025) were purchased from Calbiochem. Commercially available antibodies were purchased as follows: anti-ERK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-PKB(Akt), anti-IGF-IRβ, anti-Sos, anti-Grb2, anti-SHP-2, anti-Gab1, and anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Shc and anti-Grb2 antibodies (Transduction Laboratories); anti-BrdUrd antibody (DAKO); anti-HA (3F10) antibody (Roche Applied Science); anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-α-tubulin (DM 1A) antibodies (Sigma); anti-IRS-1 and anti-p85 PI3K, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), and anti-Ras (RAS10) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-IRS-1 Tyr(P)-895, Tyr(P)-1172, and Tyr(P)-1222 antibodies (BioSource); and anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) SM2 antibody (Yamasa). Anti-SHPS-1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. T. Matozaki (Gunma University). Anti-caldesmon (CaD) and anti-calponin (CN) antibodies (21Takahashi M. Hayashi K. Yoshida K. Ohkawa Y. Komurasaki T. Kitabatake A. Ogawa A. Nishida W. Yano M. Monden M. Sobue K. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were also used. VSMC Cultures—To obtain a large scale preparation of VSMCs, we modified our original method (20Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Nishida W. Yoshida K. Ohkawa Y. Kitabatake A. Aoki J. Arai H. Sobue K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as follows. Briefly, the aortae were quickly removed from ether-anesthetized 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats and were incubated for 30 min in the buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (Yakult) and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Then the thin layers of adventitia and endothelium were carefully stripped off. The medial VSMC layers were minced well, and digested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml collagenase, 0.5 mg/ml elastase (Sigma), and 5 mg/ml BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Isolated VSMCs were filtered through a nylon membrane. The cells thus obtained were plated on laminin-coated plastic dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA and other additions, as indicated. Passaged VSMCs were prepared from the medial VSMC layers of rat aortae as described previously (22Pukac L. Huangpu J. Karnovsky M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 548-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). VSMCs passaged 2–5 times were used as dedifferentiated VSMCs. Expression of SMC Marker Genes—The expression of h- and l-CaDs, CN, and MHC SM2 was quantified by reverse transcriptase-PCR normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA as described previously (20Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Nishida W. Yoshida K. Ohkawa Y. Kitabatake A. Aoki J. Arai H. Sobue K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi M. Hayashi K. Yoshida K.

Kinase Assays—The activities of endogenous kinases or exogenously expressed FLAG-ERK and FLAG-p38 MAPK were determined after immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-PKB(Akt), or anti-FLAG antibodies. The kinase activities in the immunoprecipitates were assayed as described elsewhere (19Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Kimura K. Nishida W. Saga H. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Hayashi K. Saga H. Chimori Y. Kimura K. Yamanaka Y. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Circulation. 2003; 108: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Assay conditions for FLAG-ERK and FLAG-p38 MAPK activities were as follows. VSMCs were cotransfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-ERK2 or -p38 MAPK and control plasmid or the expression plasmids for ΔmSos, RasN17, RasV12, myc-SHP-2wt, myc-SHP-2DN, IRS-1-HAwt, IRS-1-HAF1172/F1222, or IRS-1-HAF895. After 24 h, they were stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. To confirm the expression of exogenous recombinant proteins, the cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblot. The rat IRS-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kadowaki (University of Tokyo). Mutant IRS-1 cDNAs were constructed using PCR-associated mutagenesis, and their sequences were confirmed. The expression plasmids for RasN17 and RasV12 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Hirano (Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine). Interactions between Signaling Molecules—VSMCs of both phenotypes under quiescent culture conditions were stimulated with the indicated amounts of IGF-I and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin, for 30 min at 0 °C. The interaction of signaling molecules because of exogenously expressed wild-type or mutant SHP-2 or IRS-1 was analyzed as follows. VSMCs were cotransfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-Grb2 and control plasmid or the expression plasmid for myc-SHP-2wt or myc-SHP-2DN (Fig. 5A), or they were transfected with the expression plasmid for IRS-1-HAwt, IRS-1-HAF1172/F1222, or IRS-1-HAF895 (Fig. 5B). They were then stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Equal amounts (400 μg of protein) of the cell extracts were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 6 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblot by using the indicated antibodies. Target proteins were detected with a SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce) and quantified using the NIH Image program. Ras Activation Assay—The Ras activity was monitored using a Ras assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. In brief, the VSMC extracts were incubated with 15 μg of the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1-agarose beads for 30 min. Ras bound to Raf-1 RBD was detected by immunoblot using an anti-Ras antibody and then quantified. PTPase Assay—VSMCs cultured under quiescent conditions were stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) (20 ng/ml) for 5 min. The SHP-2 protein in the cell extracts was immunoprecipitated using an anti-SHP-2 antibody. The PTPase activities in the immunoprecipitates were assayed using tyrosine-phosphorylated Raytide as a substrate (25Huang Q. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Che W. Ohta S. Osawa M. Yoshizumi M. Glassman M. Yan C. Berk B.C. Abe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29330-29341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation and Migration Assays—VSMCs of both phenotypes were cultured under quiescent conditions for 24 h and then stimulated with the indicated amounts of IGF-I. VSMC proliferation was determined by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (20 μm) for 20 h. Incorporated BrdUrd was visualized by staining with an anti-BrdUrd antibody, followed by labeling with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes) and Hoechst. The migration of differentiated VSMCs (four 1.5-mm diameter fields in each experiment) was monitored for 48 h by a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) mounted on an Olympus IX-70 microscope. The migration of dedifferentiated VSMCs was assayed by wound healing. Confluent cultures of dedifferentiated VSMCs were wounded with a single-edged razor blade. After stimulation with the indicated amounts of IGF-I for 48 h, the numbers of migrated cells were counted. The proliferation of dedifferentiated VSMCs transfected with wild-type or mutant HA-tagged IRS-1-expressing plasmids was assayed as follows. Dedifferentiated VSMCs (40–50% confluence) were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and were cultured for 24 h. After serum starvation, they were cultured in the basal medium containing IGF-I (100 ng/ml) and BrdUrd for 20 h. The expression of HA-tagged IRS-I derivatives was visualized with anti-HA antibodies and Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated secondary antibodies. The migration of dedifferentiated VSMCs transfected with the indicated expression plasmids was monitored as described above. After stimulation with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) for 48 h, the expression of HA-tagged IRS-I derivatives was visualized as described above. The numbers of migrated cells and cells expressing each of HA-tagged IRS-1 derivatives were counted. VSMC Phenotype-dependent IGF-I Signaling Pathways—As demonstrated previously (19Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Kimura K. Nishida W. Saga H. Sobue K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Nishida W. Yoshida K. Ohkawa Y. Kitabatake A. Aoki J. Arai H. Sobue K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), primary cultured VSMCs plated on laminin under IGF-I-stimulated conditions showed the differentiated phenotype, as indicated by a spindle-like cell shape, carbachol (CCH)-induced contractility (Fig. 1A), and high expression of SMC markers, such as h-CaD, CN, and MHC SM2, at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B). By contrast, passaged VSMCs, even when cultured under quiescent conditions, displayed a fibroblast-like shape change (Fig. 1A), loss of CCH-induced contractility (Fig. 1A), and down-regulation of SMC marker expression in addition to isoform conversion of CaD from the h-to l-form (Fig. 1B), indicating the dedifferentiated phenotype. By using both phenotypes of VSMCs, we first examined the dose-dependent response to IGF-I (Fig. 1, C–E). Consistent with our previous study (20Hayashi K. Takahashi M. Nishida W. Yoshida K. Ohkawa Y. Kitabatake A. Aoki J. Arai H. Sobue K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), IGF-I (2 ng/ml) markedly activated PKB(Akt) in differentiated and dedifferentiated VSMCs, and its activation reached a maximum (more than 10-fold activation) at 20 ng/ml IGF-I (Fig. 1C). R3IGF-I, an IGF-I analog lacking affinity for IGF-binding proteins, showed a potency equivalent to IGF-I in activating PKB(Akt) in both phenotypes of VSMCs, at concentrations from 2 to 100 ng/ml (data not shown), suggesting that the IGF-I-induced signaling is IGF-binding protein-independent. The PKB(Akt) activation by IGF-I in both VSMC phenotypes was suppressed by LY294002 (10–30 μm) or wortmannin (10–30 nm), but not by PD98059 (20–30 μm) or SB203580 (10–20 μm), indicating that IGF-I induces the PKB(Akt) activation via PI3K. Notably, IGF-I, even at high concentrations (100 ng/ml), did not activate ERK or p38 MAPK in differentiated VSMCs, whereas it dose-dependently activated them in dedifferentiated VSMCs; their activations reached a maximum (more than 15- and 5-fold activations of ERK and p38 MAPK, respectively) at 20 ng/ml IGF-I (Fig. 1, D and E). In particular, the activation rates of PKB(Akt) and ERK by IGF-I were nearly identical, but p38 MAPK showed a slightly different IGF-I dose responsibility. The IGF-I-induced ERK activation was suppressed by PD98059 (20–30 μm) but not by SB203580 (10–20 μm), LY294002 (10–30 μm), or wortmannin (10–30 nm) (Fig. 1D). The p38 MAPK activation by IGF-I was only suppressed by SB203580 (10–20 μm, Fig. 1E) or SB220025 (10–20 μm, data not shown). These results indicate that IGF-I activates distinct VSMC phenotype-dependent signaling pathways. IGF-I-induced Interactions between Signaling Molecules— Signaling molecules, including IGF-IR, IRS-1, PI3K, Gab1, PK-B(Akt), Sos, Grb2, Ras, ERK, p38 MAPK, SHP-2, SHPS-1, and Shc, have been shown to be involved in IGF-I signaling in a variety of cells, including VSMCs (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 3Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A.

We compared the expression of these signaling molecules (Fig. 2). The IGF-IRβ, IRS-1, Shc, Gab1, SHPS-1, Sos, and Ras proteins were markedly up-regulated in dedifferentiated VSMCs compared with differentiated VSMCs, whereas ERK, p38 MAPK, p85 PI3K, PKB(Akt), SHP-2, and Grb2 proteins were equally expressed in both VSMC phenotypes. Thus, some signaling molecules show different expression profiles in different VSMC phenotypes. To elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in VSMC phenotype-dependent IGF-I signalings, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation and interactions of the signaling molecules. After IGF-I (2 and 100 ng/ml) stimulation, an anti-IGF-IRβ antibody specifically coimmunoprecipitated two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses of 97 and 185 kDa in both VSMC phenotypes. We identified these proteins as IGF-IRβ (97 kDa) and IRS-1 (185 kDa) by using their respective antibodies (Fig. 3, A and D). An anti-IRS-1 antibody also coimmunoprecipitated IGF-IRβ in an IGF-I dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-IRβ and/or IRS-1 formed a complex with p85 PI3K but did not associate with Shc in either VSMC phenotype (Fig. 3, A and B, and D–F). We detected a stable complex of Grb2 and Sos in the anti-Grb2 (Fig. 3C) and anti-Sos (data not shown) immunoprecipitates of both VSMC phenotypes with or without IGF-I stimulation. Immunoblotting of the anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-IRS-1, and anti-Sos antibodies showed that a complex of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and Grb2/Sos formed in the dedifferentiated, but not in the differentiated, VSMCs (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the tripartite complex composed of IRS-1, Grb2, and Sos depends on the IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Immunoblotting of the anti-Sos immunoprecipitates with anti-IRS-1 and anti-Grb2 antibodies showed the same interactions in the IGF-I-stimulated dedifferentiated VSMCs (data not shown). The same tripartite complex was also detected in the anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B). Neither the IGF-I-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc nor an Shc and IGF-IRβ or Grb2/Sos interaction was detected in either VSMC phenotype. As a control, PDGF-BB markedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and an interaction between Shc and Grb2/Sos (Fig. 3F). The protein recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the Shc immunoprecipitates from both phenotypes of VSMC was an IgG heavy chain, because anti-phosphotyrosine antibody cross-reacted with IgG heavy chain in rabbit antibodies (Fig. 3F). Because PDGF-BB or 18:1 lyso-phosphatidic acid potently induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in both VSMC phenotypes (Fig. 3F and data not shown), IGF-I signaling in VSMCs is Shc-independent. Thus, our results suggest that tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 preferentially recruits the Grb2-Sos complex in dedifferentiated but not in differentiated VSMCs. VSMC Phenotype-dependent Interaction of Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and SHP-2—IRS-1 is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues in response to IGFs. Among them, phosphorylated Tyr-895 of IRS-1 has been identified as a binding site for Grb2 (26Ward C.W. Gough K.H. Rashke M. Wan S.S. Tribbick G. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5603-5609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We analyzed the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Tyr-895 by using an anti-IRS-1 Tyr(P)-895 antibody. The IRS-1 Tyr-895 was markedly phosphorylated by IGF-I stimulation only in dedifferentiated VSMCs (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the IGF-I-induced tripartite complex formation between tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and Grb2/Sos in dedifferentiated, but not in differentiated, VSMCs (Fig. 3). It is well documented that tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 interacts with SHP-2, the ubiquitous PTPase containing the SH2 domain, leading to the positive or negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-linked events (27Noguchi T.

We characterized the tyrosine phosphorylation of these SHP-2-binding sites using anti-IRS-1 Tyr(P)-1172 and Tyr(P)-1222 antibodies, respectively. In a preliminary experiment, the former antibody specifically recognized IRS-1 Tyr(P)-1172, but the latter did not recognize Tyr(P)-1222 (data not shown). We therefore analyzed the phosphorylated Tyr-1172 of IRS-1 in IGF-I-stimulated VSMCs. In response to IGF-I stimulation, IRS-1 Tyr-1172 was significantly phosphorylated in both VSMC phenotypes (Fig. 4A). We then examined the possible involvement of SHP-2 in the VSMC phenotype-dependent interaction between IRS-1 and Grb2/Sos. In both VSMC phenotypes under quiescent and IGF-I-stimulated conditions, almost all of the SHP-2 protein was extractable by nonionic detergents. Notably, IGF-I dose-dependently enhanced the PTPase activity of SHP-2 in differentiated VSMCs, whereas its effect was less significant in dedifferentiated ones. As a control, PDGF-BB enhanced the PTPase activity of SHP-2 in both the VSMC phenotypes (Fig. 4B). The PTPase activities might be mainly originated from the SHP-2 PTPase activity itself, because exogenously expressed Myc-tagged PTPase-dead (dominant-negative) SHP-2 (myc-SHP-2"

We have reported previously that NFATs play an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and thrombin, respectively. To understand the role of NFATs in vascular disease and development, we have now studied the role of these transcriptional factors in VSMC motility. PDGF-BB and thrombin induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner. Blockade of NFAT activation resulted in substantial reduction in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility. PDGF-BB and thrombin also induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in NFAT-dependent manner. Furthermore, IL-6 dose-dependently caused VSMC motility. A neutralizing anti-rat IL-6 antibody inhibited VSMC motility induced by IL-6, PDGF-BB, and thrombin. In addition, exogenous addition of IL-6 rescued both PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by the blockade of NFAT activation. Together, these results for the first time demonstrate that NFATs mediate both RTK and GPCR agonist-induced VSMC motility via induction of expression of IL-6.

Sustained inflammation at the site of vascular injury is now believed to be a triggering event in the pathogenesis of vessel wall diseases (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Both the dysfunctional endothelial cells and inflammatory cells at the site of vascular injury produce a large number of molecules with a broad spectrum of biological activities (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

The availability of these bioactive molecules at the site of vascular injury, therefore, provides a permissive milieu for VSMC dedifferentiation (9Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The dedifferentiated VSMC acquire their embryonic non-contractile and synthetic state phenotype and via their migration from media to intima and multiplication in intima contribute to the progression of lesions such as restenosis after angioplasty (10Regan C.P. Adam P.J. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several studies (11Ferns G.A.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H. Motani A.S. Reidy M.A. Ross R. Science. 1991; 253: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 12Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) have reported that inhibition of expression or bio-activity of growth factors or cytokines that are produced at the site of vascular injury ameliorates lesion progression. Since a large number of molecules are involved in arterial wall lesions, identifying the unifying mechanisms of these molecules may eventually lead to development of better therapeutics against these vascular diseases. Nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFATs) are members of a multigene family of transcription factors that belong to the Rel group (13Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). These are named as NFATc1 (also known as NFATc or NFAT2), NFATc2 (also known as NFATp or NFAT1), NFATc3 (also known as NFAT4 or NFATx), and NFATc4 (also known as NFAT3), and each of these molecules appeared to be expressed as several isoforms by alternative splicing (13Macian F.

Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). An additional member of the NFAT family of transcription factors is NFAT5, which was cloned and characterized in recent years (16Rodriguez C.L. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although all five NFATs exhibit a similar DNA binding specificity, NFAT5 differs from the rest of the four members in its lack of co-operativity with Fos or Jun proteins (16Rodriguez C.L. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In regard to the functional role of these transcription factors, earlier studies (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar) have reported the presence of NFATc1, NFATc2, and NFATc3 mainly in T cells regulating the expression of cytokine genes such as interleukin (IL)-2. However, later studies (13Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 18Stevenson A.S. Gomez M.F. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol.

Studies with knock-out mice also established a role for NFATs in non-immune cells as observed from: 1) knock-out mice for NFATc1 failed to develop normal cardiac valves (20De la Pompa J.L.

Interestingly, one of the members of the NFAT family transcription factors, namely NFATc4, was reported to play a role in cardiac hypertrophy (25Molkentin J. Lu J-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). In contrast to NFATc1 to NFATc4, NFAT5 was shown to be involved in volume regulation (26Rodriguez C.L. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Lin F. Novobrantseva T.I. Bronson R.T. Igarashi P. Rao A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 2392-2397Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). NFATc1 to NFATc4 exist in the cytoplasm as phosphoproteins in resting state, and their activation requires dephosphorylation. A calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase known as calcineurin has been reported to specifically dephosphorylate and activate these NFATs (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). In regard to NFAT5, both calcineurin-dependent and -independent mechanisms were reported to be involved in its regulation (27Rodriguez C.L. Aramburu J. Jin L. Rakeman A.S. Michino M. Rao A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Trama J. Lu Q. Hawley R.G. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Activated NFATs translocate to the nucleus, bind to consensus DNA sequence GGAAAAT present in the promoter regions of genes as monomers or dimers via their Rel homology domain, and activate transcription (13Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, other than the phenotypic observations made from the knock-out mice models (20De la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. waheham A. Marengere L.

Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), the functional aspects of NFATs in non-immune cells are largely unclear. Toward understanding the functional role of NFATs in non-immune cells, we have reported previously that their activation is required for RTK and GPCR agonist-induced VSMC proliferation (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we tested their role in RTK and GPCR agonist-induced VSMC motility. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin, the RTK and GPCR agonists, respectively, stimulated VSMC motility in a dose- and NFAT-dependent manner. PDGF-BB and thrombin also induced the expression of IL-6 in NFAT-dependent manner. In addition, IL-6 dose-dependently caused VSMC motility and a neutralizing anti-rat IL-6 antibody suppressed VSMC motility induced by IL-6, PDGF-BB, and thrombin. Furthermore, exogenous addition of IL-6 rescued PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by the blockade of NFAT activation. Together, these findings for the first time show that NFATs mediate both RTK and GPCR agonist-induced VSMC motility via induction of expression of IL-6. Reagents—Aprotinin, IL-6, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, sodium deoxycholate, leupeptin, HEPES, dithiothreitol, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human PDGF-BB was bought from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Consensus NFATc oligonucleotide 5′-CGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATA-3′, 3′-GCGGGTTTCTCCTTTTAAACAAAGTAT-5′ (SC-2577) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). T4 polynucleotide kinase and luciferase assay kit were procured from Promega (Madison, WI). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Neutralizing anti-rat IL-6 antibodies were obtained from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The rat IL-6 ELISA kit was from Pierce. Cell Culture—VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aortae of 100-150-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation as described earlier (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were quiesced by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. Cell Motility—VSMC motility was measured by cell wounding assay (30Zhuang D. Ceacareanu A.C. Lin Y. Ceacareanu B. Dixit M. Chapman K.E. Waters C.M. Rao G.N. Hassid A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H2103-H2112Google Scholar). Quiescent confluent monolayers of VSMC were wounded with a sterile pipette tip to generate a cell-free gap of ∼1-mm width and the wound location in the culture dish marked. Cells were washed and fresh serum-free DMEM was added and photographed to record the wound width at 0 h. Cells were then treated with and without the indicated concentrations of PDGF-BB or thrombin in the presence and absence of the indicated inhibitors or antibodies for 24 h. To prevent replicative DNA synthesis, hydroxyurea was added to the medium to a final concentration of 5 mm just before the addition of agonist. Photographs were taken again at the end of the 24-h incubation period at the marked wound location. Cell migration was measured using the NIH image 1.62 program, and the cell motility was expressed as distance migrated in micrometer units. Wherever pGFP or pGFPVIVIT are used, cells were first transfected with these plasmid DNAs for 48 h and then quiesced before they were subjected to agonist-induced motility. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PGDF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure described by Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 counts/min of 32P-labeled consensus NFAT oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Trisglycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (NFATc, 5′-CGC CCA AAG AGG AAA ATT TGTTTCATA-3′) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase kit as per the supplier's protocol (Promega). To test the effect of VIVIT on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced NFAT-DNA binding activity, cells were first transfected with either pGFP or pGFPVIVIT plasmids for 48 h and quiesced before they were subjected to treatments with agonists and nuclear extract preparation. IL-6 ELISA—After appropriate treatments, cell culture medium was collected, and IL-6 released into the medium was measured using an ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). RT-PCR Analysis of IL-6 mRNA—Total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was quantified, and 1 μg of it from control and each treatment was used for the RT-PCR reaction. The RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR system with platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The reaction mix in a total volume of 50 μl consists of 1× reaction buffer, 1 μg of RNA, a 0.5 μm concentration each of forward (5′-ATGAAGTTTCTCTCCGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGGTAGGAAGGACTATT-3′) rat IL-6 specific primers, and 2 μl of SuperScript III RT/platinum Taq polymerase. RT-PCR amplification was carried out in a Gene Amp 2400 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an initial first strand cDNA synthesis reaction at 55 °C for 30 min. The PCR reaction was performed at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The final extension reaction was carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. Fifteen microliters of the PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, photographed, and quantified by densitometry. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—VSMC were plated evenly onto 100-mm dishes and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 50-80% confluence, medium was replaced, and cells were transfected with 3 μg/dish of pT8NFAT-Luc plasmid (32Hedin K.E. Bell M.P. Kalli K.R. Huntoon C.J. Sharp B.M. McKean D.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5431-5440PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hours after transfection, VSMC were quiesced and treated with and without PGDF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) for 16 h, and cell lysates were prepared. VSMC lysates were normalized for protein and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Turner Luminometer (TD-20/20). To test the effect of VIVIT on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced NFAT-Luc activity, cells were co-transfected with either pGFP or pGFPVIVIT along with pT8NFAT-Luc plasmid for 48 h and quiesced before they were subjected to treatments with agonists and measuring luciferase activity. Statistics—All the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar pattern of results. Data are presented as mean ± S.D., and the treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. NFATs are phosphoproteins and exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive state. These transcription factors are activated via dephosphorylation. Calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, specifically dephosphorylates NFATs leading to their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (12Lindner V. Reidy M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3739-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, they bind as monomers or dimers via their Rel homology domain to a consensus DNA sequence GGAAAAT present in the promoter region of genes and induce transcription (24Graef I.A. Chen F. Chen L. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Previously we have reported that the RTK and GPCR agonists, PDGF-BB and thrombin, respectively, cause translocation of NFATs, particularly NFATc1, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in VSMC (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that NFATs are involved in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC proliferation. To understand the role of NFATs in vascular wall remodeling, we have now tested their involvement in VSMC motility. Toward testing this hypothesis, we first measured their activity in response to PDGF-BB and thrombin in VSMC. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm), a potent inhibitor of calcineurin (17Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar), for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extracts containing an equal amount of protein from control and PDGF-BB or thrombin-treated VSMC were incubated with 100,000 counts/min of 32P-labeled consensus NFAT oligonucleotide probe, and the protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. PDGF-BB and thrombin increased NFAT-DNA binding activity by 2-3-fold as compared with control (Fig. 1A). CsA significantly blocked the NFAT-DNA binding activity induced by both PDGF-BB and thrombin. NFATc1 to NFATc4 possess a highly conserved calcineurin-binding site PxIxIT in their regulatory domain at the NH2 terminus. Based on this information a peptide, namely, VIVIT that specifically competes with NFATs for binding to calcineurin, was developed (33Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Expression of GFPVIVIT in T cells inhibited only calcineurin-sensitive NFAT-dependent, but not calcineurin-sensitive, NFAT-independent inducible expression of IL-2, IL-3, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (33Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of CsA on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced NFAT-DNA binding activity, VSMC were transfected with pGFP or pGFPVIVIT, growth-arrested for 48 h, and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. An equal amount of nuclear protein from control and each treatment was analyzed for NFAT-DNA binding activity as described above. Consistent with the effect of CsA, GFPVIVIT but not GFP reduced PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced NFAT-DNA binding activity (Fig. 1A). To find whether the increased NFAT-DNA binding activity leads to a corresponding up-regulation in NFAT-dependent transcription, VSMC were transfected with a plasmid (pT8NFAT-Luc) in which a luciferase reporter gene expression is controlled by NFAT-dependent IL-2 promoter and quiesced (33Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for 6 h in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm), and cell extracts were prepared. Cell extracts from control and agonist-treated VSMC normalized for protein were assayed for luciferase activity. Consistent with NFAT-DNA binding activity, luciferase activity was also increased by about 2-fold in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-treated VSMC versus control (Fig. 1B). CsA blocked both PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1B). CsA alone had no effect on basal luciferase activity. Similarly, forced expression of GFPVIVIT but not GFP inhibited both PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with our previously published findings (29Yellaturu C.R. Ghosh S.K. Rao R.K. Jennings L.K. Hassid A. Rao G.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Having demonstrated the activation of NFATs by both RTK and GPCR agonists, we now examined their role in VSMC motility. A cell-free gap was generated in a monolayer of quiescent VSMC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then treated with and without various doses of PDGF-BB or thrombin for 24 h, and cell motility was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both PDGF-BB and thrombin induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum VSMC motility was observed in response to 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB and 0.1 unit/ml thrombin. To address the role of NFATs in PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility, we now studied the effect of CsA and GFPVIVIT. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, both CsA and GFPVIVIT inhibited PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility. Earlier studies from other laboratories (34Abbott K.L. Loss II, J.R. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have indicated that NFATs are involved in the regulation of expression of IL-6 in response to PDGF-BB in VSMC. To understand the mechanisms by which NFATs mediate PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility, we tested the effect of PDGF-BB and thrombin on IL-6 expression. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for various times, and total cellular RNA was isolated. An equal amount of RNA from control and each treatment was analyzed by RT-PCR for IL-6 mRNA using its specific primers. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, both PDGF-BB and thrombin induced the expression of IL-6 mRNA in a time-dependent manner with a maximum response at 2-h treatment. Next we tested the effect of CsA and VIVIT on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced IL-6 mRNA expression. Both CsA and VIVIT significantly reduced IL-6 mRNA expression induced by PDGF-BB and thrombin (Figs. 5, A and B, and 6, A and B). To find whether CsA also blocks the IL-6 expression at protein level, quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) for 24 h, and IL-6 release into the culture medium was determined using an ELISA kit specific for IL-6. Both PDGF-BB and thrombin treatments caused the release of IL-6 into the culture medium, and CsA significantly blocked this effect (Fig. 7A). Forced expression of GFPVIVIT also blocked PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced IL-6 release into the culture medium (Fig. 7B).Fig. 3Blockade of NFAT activation inhibits PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility.A, a cell-free gap was made in a monolayer of VSMC and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) for 24 h, and cell motility was measured using the NIH image 1.62 program.

A cell-free gap was made in a monolayer of quiescent VSMC and treated with and without various doses of IL-6 for 24 h, and cell motility was determined. IL-6 induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 8). To find whether IL-6 mediates PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced motility, we next studied the effect of a neutralizing anti-rat IL-6 antibody on VSMC motility induced by IL-6 as well as PDGF-BB and thrombin. Neutralizing anti-rat IL-6 antibodies significantly blocked VSMC motility induced by all three agonists (Fig. 9, A and B). If NFATs mediate PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility via induction of expression of IL-6, then one would expect that exogenous addition of IL-6 rescues PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by blockade of NFAT activation. To test this, a cell-free gap was made in a monolayer of quiescent VSMC and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) or thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of CsA (10 μm) with and without a combination of the indicated doses of IL-6 for 24 h, and cell motility was determined. As shown in Fig. 10, A and B, IL-6 rescued both PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by CsA in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, IL-6 negated the inhibitory effect of GFPVIVIT on PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility (Fig. 10, C and D).Fig. 9Neutralizing anti-rat IL-6 antibodies block IL-6-, PDGF-BB-, and thrombin-induced VSMC motility.

These results demonstrate that NFATs mediate PDGF-BB- and thrombin-induced VSMC motility via induction of expression of IL-6. A role for NFATs in cell migration was previously suggested by the findings that the levels of NFATc2 and NFAT5 are increased in human breast carcinomas and their up-regulation correlated with increased carcinoma invasiveness (35Jauliac S. Rodriguez C.L. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 7: 540-544Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In this regard, the present study provides direct and mechanistic evidence for the role of NFATs in cell migration. Earlier work from our laboratory as well as others (19Boss V. Abbot K.L. Wang X.F.

Furthermore, overexpression of NFATc1 enhanced PDGF-BB-induced expression of IL-6 in VSMC (34Abbott K.L. Loss II, J.R. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it is likely that NFATc1 is involved in the mediation of VSMC motility in response to RTK and GPCR agonists. Several studies (25Molkentin J. Lu J-R. Antos C.L. Markham B.

A requirement for NFAT function was also demonstrated in vessel wall assembly (22Horsley V. Friday B.B. Matteson S. Kegley K.M. Gephart J. Pavlath G.K. J.

A role for NFATs in the regulation of cell proliferation was also suggested by the finding that forced expression of a constitutively active NFATc1 in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocyte fibroblasts leads to their transformation (39Neal J.W.

Future studies are required to test the involvement of NFATs in vessel wall diseases such as restenosis after angioplasty.

Mechanisms that direct LRP to function in these distinct pathways likely involve its association with distinct cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. We tested the hypothesis that the association of various adaptor proteins with the LRP cytoplasmic domain is modulated by its phosphorylation state. Phosphoamino acid analysis of metabolically labeled LRP revealed that this receptor is phosphorylated at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues within its cytoplasmic domain, whereas inhibitor studies identified protein kinase Cα (PKCα) as a kinase capable of phosphorylating LRP. Mutational analysis identified critical threonine and serine residues within the LRP cytoplasmic domain that are necessary for phosphorylation mediated by PKCα. Mutating these threonine and serine residues to alanines generated a receptor that was not phosphorylated and that was internalized more rapidly than wild-type LRP, revealing that phosphorylation reduces the association of LRP with adaptor molecules of the endocytic machinery. In contrast, serine and threonine phosphorylation was necessary for the interaction of LRP with Shc, an adaptor protein that participates in signaling events. Furthermore, serine and threonine phosphorylation increased the interaction of LRP with other adaptor proteins such as Dab-1 and CED-6/GULP.

LRP is synthesized as a single chain 600-kDa precursor that is processed by furin into a 515-kDa heavy chain and an 85-kDa light chain (7Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The heavy chain of LRP contains multiple clusters of cysteine-rich low density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats that function in ligand recognition, whereas the light chain contains multiple epidermal growth factor repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. In addition to α2-macroglobulin-protease complexes and apoE-containing lipoproteins, LRP also recognizes proteases such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (8Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (9Hahn-Dantona E. Ruiz J.F. Bornstein P. Strickland D.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon binding to LRP, ligands are rapidly internalized via coated pit-mediated endocytosis and are subsequently degraded in lysosomes. LRP also plays a role in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (12Ogden C.A. deCathelineau A. Hoffmann P.R. Bratton D. Ghebrehiwet B. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). This may require association of LRP with a specific adaptor protein, CED-6/GULP, as recent data reveal that the ced-6/gulp gene in Drosophila is one of seven genes required for engulfment (13Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Cell. 1998; 93: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and that the human homolog of CED-6/GULP binds to the second NPXY motif within the LRP cytoplasmic domain (14Su H.P. Nakada-Tsukui K. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Li Y. Bu G. Henson P.M. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11772-11779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although its function as a cargo transporter is well established, evidence is accumulating indicating that LRP may also play important roles in modulating signaling events. Thus, LRP has been implicated as a component of the receptor complex for midkine, a heparin-binding growth factor with migration-promoting and survival-promoting activities (15Muramatsu H. Zou K. Sakaguchi N. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and has been suggested to be responsible for the effect that tissue-type plasminogen activator has on late phase long-term potentiation (16Zhuo M. Holtzman D.M. Li Y. Osaka H. DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue-type plasminogen activator has also been shown to directly increase vascular permeability in the early stages of blood-brain barrier opening through an LRP-mediated cell signaling event (17Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Moore E.G. Bugge T.H. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Another LRP ligand, activated α2-macroglobulin, mediates calcium influx specifically in neurons present in primary cultures of mouse cortex upon association with LRP (18Bacskai B.J. Xia M.Q. Strickland D.K. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). LRP is phosphorylated at Tyr63 within its cytoplasmic domain via platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor activation (19Boucher P. Liu P. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Anderson R.G. Herz J. J.

Gotthardt M. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that direct LRP to function in cargo transport or in signaling pathways remain unknown, but likely involve the association of specific adaptor proteins with its cytoplasmic tail. This portion of LRP contains two NPXY motifs that are capable of interacting with cytoplasmic adaptor proteins harboring phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains (22Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B.

Phosphorylation of Tyr63, which is located within the terminal NPXY motif in the LRP cytoplasmic domain, provides a recognition site for Shc (20Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatov N. Migliorini M.M. Loukinov D. Ulery P.G. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3589-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), an adaptor protein that participates in signaling pathways. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation initiated by growth factor activation, the LRP cytoplasmic domain is also phosphorylated at serine residues by protein kinase A (25Li Y. van Kerkhof P. Marzolo M.P. Strous G.J. Bu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At this time, however, the role of serine phosphorylation in LRP function remains unknown. Mutation of a critical serine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of an LRP minireceptor slightly delays LRP-mediated endocytosis, suggesting a role for phosphorylation of LRP in endocytosis (25Li Y. van Kerkhof P. Marzolo M.P. Strous G.J. Bu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to investigate the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP modulates its function by altering the affinity for cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. Our results reveal that serine and threonine phosphorylation of LRP modulates its phosphorylation at Tyr63, where a number of adaptor molecules bind, and modifies its association with adaptor proteins such as Shc, Dab-1 (Disabled-1), and CED-6/GULP. Cell Lines, Proteins, Antibodies, and Reagents—Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI-38) and SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like cell lines (COS-1) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LRP-null Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (CHO13-5-1) have described previously (26Fitzgerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J.

Expression Constructs—The expression vector of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with the LRP cytoplasmic domain was prepared using the pGEX2 vector. The cytoplasmic domain cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 4426–4525 of human full-length LRP was amplified by PCR using the full-length cDNA of human LRP (28Ulery P.G. Beers J. Mikhailenko I.

For convenience, the first amino acid following the transmembrane domain was numbered 1 as suggested by Li et al. (29Li Y. Paz M.M. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol.

Mutation of all three serine residues (S73A/S76A/S79A) with T16A is designated as T16A/3S. All mutations/substitutions were performed using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol, and GST fusion protein was expressed and purified following the manufacturer's instructions.

All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. mDab-GST was generously provided by Dr. Joachim Herz, and the Shc plasmid was generously provided by Dr. K. S. Ravichandran. Wild-type and Mutant LRP-expressing Stable Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell Lines—LRP-null CHO13-5-1 cells were grown to 30–40% confluency in 150-mm plates and transfected with cDNA from full-length wild-type LRP (cloned into pcDNA3.1(–)) or full-length mutant T16A/3S LRP (cloned into pcDNA3.1(–)) using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, the cells were placed under selection pressure (600 μg/ml G418 or hygromycin); and 2 weeks later, 100 colonies were picked for both wild-type and mutant LRPs, and positive clones were subcloned twice before being used for the experiments. PKC Assay—In vitro phosphorylation of purified full-length wild-type LRP and wild-type and mutant LRP cytoplasmic tail-GST fusion proteins was carried out using the BIOTRAK™ PKC assay system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min using 7.5 μg of GST fusion protein, 0.2 μg of human recombinant PKCα, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in 1.2 mm ATP buffer with calcium, lipid, and dithiothreitol buffers. As a positive control, the PKC substrate peptide provided in the kit was used; and as a negative control, purified GST was used. For quantitative analysis, reactions were terminated with stop reagent (300 mm orthophosphoric acid containing carmosine red), spotted on phosphocellulose membrane, washed, and assayed using a scintillation counter. For qualitative analysis, the kinase reactions were terminated by adding 5× SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane stained with Ponceau S, exposed, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Phosphorylation and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—PAC-1 cells or WI-38 fibroblasts were grown to 70–80% confluency in 150-mm plates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), preincubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 3–4 h, and labeled for 30 min to 1 h with 1 mCi/plate [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) with or without kinase inhibitors and PMA. Similarly, LRP-null CHO13-5-1 cells stably transfected with full-length wild-type or T16A/3S mutant LRP were washed and preincubated in phosphate-free DMEM with serum for 3–4 h and labeled for 1 h with 1 mCi/plate [32P]orthophosphate. Labeling was terminated by placing the culture plates on ice and washing the cell layers three times with ice-cold phosphate-free DMEM. Cell extracts were made in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (EMD Biosciences). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LRP polyclonal antibody R2629 as described below. Immunoprecipitates were washed and boiled in 2× nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min. Proteins were then separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and exposed Biomax-ML film or measured using a PhosphorImager. After evaluating LRP phosphorylation, membranes were blocked and then probed with anti-LRP light chain antibody 5A6 (0.5 μg/ml) to measure total LRP expression. For COS-1 cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged wild-type or T16A/3S mutant LRP-β, 48 h after transfection, cell layers were preincubated in phosphate-free medium with serum and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described above. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with antibody 9E10 (10 μg/ml). After assessing LRP-β phosphorylation, the membranes were probed with anti-Myc IgG polyclonal antibody. To determine whether 32P was incorporated into serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues, immunoprecipitates from 32P-labeled WI-38 fibroblasts were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The band corresponding to phosphorylated LRP was excised, washed, and hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl at 110 °C for 60 min. The liquid hydrolysates were dried, resuspended in 10 μl of water, and spotted along with nonradioactive phosphoamino acid standard mixture on glass-backed cellulose TLC plates. One-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out using the Hunter thin-layer peptide mapping electrophoresis system (HTLE-7002, CBS Scientific, Del Mar, CA). After visualizing the phosphoamino acid standards with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone, the TLC plates were exposed to Biomax-MS film with an intensifying screen at –70 °C to detect 32P incorporated into serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Ligands (PKCα and bovine serum albumin (BSA)) were coated on 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl) with 2 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% BSA in TBS and 2 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then incubated with increasing concentrations of purified human LRP, wild-type LRP cytoplasmic tail-GST fusion protein, or GST in TBS, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Bound LRP was detected with antibody 8G1 (0.5 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, and bound wild-type LRP cytoplasmic tail-GST was detected using polyclonal antibody R704 (1 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Wells were developed using tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and absorbance was measured at 590 nm. Measurement of the Endocytic Rate Constant—LRP-null CHO13-5-1 cells stably transfected with full-length wild-type or T16A/3S mutant LRP were grown to 70% confluency in 6-well culture plates. The endocytic rate constant was measured by internalized/surface analysis as described by Wiley and Cunningham (30Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild-type or T16A/3S LRP were incubated with 1 ml of 125I-labeled antibody 8G1 (specific activity of 2–10 μCi; 1.5 μg/ml to 10 nm) with or without unlabeled antibody 8G1 (75 μg/ml to 500 nm) in prewarmed assay medium (Ham's F-12 medium) containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.5% BSA at 37 °C for 2, 4, 6, and 8 min. At the indicated times, the culture dishes were placed on ice, and cells were extensively washed with chilled buffers (twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and 0.5% BSA and twice with DPBS). Cells were treated with trypsin (0.5 ml/well) and proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice, and the detached cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 7 min. Radioactivity associated with the supernatant (proteinase K-released cell-surface 125I-labeled antibody 8G1) and cell pellet (internalized 125I-labeled antibody 8G1) was quantified. The endocytic rate (ke) was calculated from the slope of the internalized/surface versus time plot. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were grown to 70% confluency in M199 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with antibiotics and glutamine in 150-mm culture plates. For treatment with PMA (150 nm), staurosporine (7 nm), or Gö 6976 (10 nm), cell layers were washed and treated with 1% Nutridoma™ NS (Roche Applied Science) in M199 medium for 1 h. Cell layers were washed twice with cold DPBS and lysed on ice in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. After preclearing with rabbit IgG and protein G-Sepharose, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody R2629 and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and boiled in 2× nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min. Samples were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with antibody 5A6 (0.2–0.4 μg/ml) in 5% milk in TBS and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. After 3 washes, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:10,000) in 5% milk in TBS and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, washed three times, and developed with chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). The bands were visualized with Biomax Light film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For visualizing PKCα, the membranes were stripped using a Re-blot Western blot recycling kit (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and probed with anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody as described above. GSH Pull-down Assay—GSH-Sepharose was prepared by coupling glutathione to epoxy-activated Sepharose. COS-1 cells were grown to 40% confluency in 150-mm plates and transfected with 10 μg of expression vector containing Myc-tagged wild-type or T16A/3S mutant LRP-β using FuGENE 6 in DMEM and 10% serum. 48 h after transfection, the cell layers were washed twice with cold DPBS, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. After preclearing with 75 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GSH-Sepharose for 2–3 h at 4 °C, wild-type and mutant cell lysates were incubated with varying concentrations (3, 1.5, and 0.75 μg) of Dab-1-GST fusion protein or control GST protein (3 μg) and 75 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GSH-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Following the incubation, Sepharose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and boiled in 2× nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min. Samples were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1 μg/ml) in 5% milk in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. After 3 washes, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody (1:10,000) in 5% milk in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, washed three times, and developed with chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). The bands were visualized with Biomax Light film. Transient Transfection of Shc, HA-GULP, and LRP-β in COS Cells for Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—COS-1 cells were grown to 30–40% confluency in 150-mm plates and transfected with 7.5 μg of Shc or HA-GULP plasmid and 7.5 μg of empty vector (pSec-Tag) or Myc-tagged wild-type, T16A/3S mutant, or NPVY/APVA mutant LRP-β. 48 h after transfection, the cell layers were washed twice with cold DPBS, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Cell lysates were precleared with non-immune IgG-protein G complex for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Shc- and LRP-β-expressing cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Shc monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) or antibody 9E10 (10 μg/ml). Similarly, HA-GULP- and LRP-β-expressing cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA IgG polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) or anti-Myc IgG polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and boiled in 2× nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min. Samples were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. LRP Is Phosphorylated at Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine Residues—Previous studies have reported that LRP is phosphorylated at serine (25Li Y. van Kerkhof P. Marzolo M.P. Strous G.J. Bu G. Mol. Cell.

We sought to fully characterize the phosphorylation of LRP and to study the role this may play in LRP function. To this end, human WI-38 fibroblasts, which express high levels of LRP, were metabolically labeled by incubation with [32P]H3PO4 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either affinity-purified anti-LRP IgG antibody R2629 or preimmune IgG as a control. The results of this experiment (Fig. 1A) demonstrate that a phosphorylated protein with an apparent mass of 85 kDa was immunoprecipitated by anti-LRP IgG antibody (lane 1), but not by preimmune IgG (lane 2). The phosphorylated band shown in lane 1 has an identical mobility on SDS-PAGE as the light chain of LRP as revealed by immunoblotting the immunoprecipitates with monoclonal antibody 5A6, which is specific for the LRP β-subunit (data not shown). To identify the types of amino acid residues within the LRP cytoplasmic domain that are phosphorylated, LRP metabolically l"

Dramatic light-dependent changes in its subcellular localization are believed to play an important role in light adaptation of photoreceptor cells. Here we show that visual arrestin binds microtubules. The truncated splice variant of visual arrestin, p44, demonstrates dramatically higher affinity for microtubules than the full-length protein (p48). Enhanced microtubule binding of p44 underlies its earlier reported preferential localization to detergent-resistant membranes, where it is anchored via membrane-associated microtubules in a rhodopsin-independent fashion. Experiments with purified proteins demonstrate that arrestin interaction with microtubules is direct and does not require any additional protein partners. Most importantly, arrestin interactions with microtubules and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin are mutually exclusive, suggesting that microtubule interaction may play a role in keeping p44 arrestin away from rhodopsin in dark-adapted photoreceptors.

In response to stimulation by extracellular stimuli, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G protein-coupled receptors; ROS, rod outer segments; DRM, detergent-resistant membranes; DSM, detergent-soluble membrane; WT, wild type; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinedi-ethanesulfonic acid; P-Rh*, phosphorylated rhodopsin; Rh*, unphosphorylated rhodopsin; P-Rh, phosphorylated rhodopsin. assume a distinct conformation (R*), which activates G proteins and initiates a downstream signaling cascade. Signaling by most GPCRs is rapidly quenched by a conserved mechanism. First, G protein-coupled receptor kinases recognize and phosphorylate the activated receptor. Next, the phosphorylated active receptor binds the cytosolic protein, arrestin, which prevents further receptor-G protein interaction. For most GPCRs, arrestin binding also initiates receptor internalization (1Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1037-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In retinal rods, visual arrestin specifically binds to activated and phosphorylated rhodopsin (P-Rh*), thereby blocking the activation of transducin (Gt), and terminating photo-transduction (3Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4389-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that arrestin also inhibits dephosphorylation of P-Rh*, preventing the reentry of rhodopsin into the phototransduction pathway (6Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Jakes S. Ingebritsen T.S. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15770-15773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of arrestin can be facilitated by conversion of P-Rh* to phosphoopsin as all-trans-retinal dissociates and is reduced to all-trans-retinol (7Hofmann K.P. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, timely binding and dissociation of arrestin are equally important for proper function of rod photoreceptors. In mice lacking visual arrestin (8Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), rhodopsin kinase (9Chen C.K. Burns M.E. Spencer M. Niemi G.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3718-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), or rhodopsin kinase phosphorylation sites on the rhodopsin C terminus (10Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S.

Excessive signaling in all these models eventually results in light-dependent retinal degeneration (8Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of visual arrestin (12Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) yielded important insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the functional cycle of arrestin. Arrestin is an elongated two-domain molecule. Its basal conformation (inactive state) is maintained by the interactions among five charged residues in the fulcrum of the molecule (polar core) and by the interaction of its C-tail with the N-domain. The initial binding of arrestin to phosphorylated receptor destabilizes the polar core (13Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11451-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and releases the arrestin C-tail (14Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The disruption of these constraining intramolecular interactions allows arrestin transition into a high affinity receptor-binding state involving the movement of the two arrestin domains relative to each other (15Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hirsch J.A. Velez M.G. Gurevich Y.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43961-43967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Photoreceptors have at least two forms of arrestin that lack the C-tail. First, in some species they express a splice variant of arrestin, termed p44, that is identical to the full-length arrestin (p48) except that the last exon encoding the C-terminal 35 amino acids is replaced by an alternative exon encoding a single alanine residue (16Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, calpain can cleave off the last 27 amino acids from receptor-bound arrestin (17Azarian S.M. King A.J. Hallett M.A. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24375-24384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of arrestin are present in bovine and human photoreceptors at a level of less than 10% of the amount of full-length arrestin (16Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Azarian S.M. King A.J. Hallett M.A. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24375-24384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence indicate that they may play a distinct role in the regulation of phototransduction. The activation energy required for binding of p44 to P-Rh* is reduced in half compared with full-length arrestin (18Pulvermuller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The lack of the C terminus also reduces arrestin specificity for P-Rh* so that the truncated forms can bind to light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin (Rh*), as well as to dark phosphorylated rhodopsin (P-Rh) (17Azarian S.M. King A.J. Hallett M.A. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24375-24384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Pulvermuller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka-Nawrot M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is important because small amounts of P-Rh are known to be present in photoreceptors even at low levels of light (20Lee K.A. Craven K.B. Niemi G.A. Hurley J.B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This may be attributable to the relatively high basal activity of rhodopsin kinase (22Rim J. Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7064-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and its ability to be activated by a single Rh* to phosphorylate hundreds of inactive rhodopsin molecules (23Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Binder B.M. O'Connor T.M. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19826-19830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By using time-resolved measurements of phosphodiesterase activity in a calorimetric assay, Langlois and co-workers (25Langlois G. Chen C.K. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Vuong T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) compared the ability of p44 and full-length arrestin to inhibit effector activity in response to dim flashes. Both forms of arrestin were able to shorten the responses, but p44 was 10 times more potent than full-length arrestin. Another reported difference between full-length and p44 arrestin is that most p44 is anchored to the membrane, unlike full-length arrestin, which is a soluble protein translocating to the membrane only upon receptor phosphorylation (3Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4389-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Kuhn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In addition, the two forms differ in their distribution between the inner and outer segments of the rod cell. In dark-adapted rods, full-length arrestin is localized to the inner segment and moves to the outer segment upon light exposure (26Broekhuyse R.M. Tolhuizen E.F. Janssen A.P. Winkens H.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Philp N.J. Chang W. Long K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Whelan J.P. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 29Zhang H. Huang W. Zhu X. Craft C.M. Baehr W. Chen C.K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 231-237PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mendez A. Lem J. Simon M. Chen J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3124-3129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, p44 was reported to be constitutively present in the outer segments (16Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schroder et al. (31Schroder K. Pulvermuller A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43987-43996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have proposed that membrane anchoring of p44 is because of its ability to bind dark P-Rh and that this interaction prevents p44 from binding to activated rhodopsin prior to its phosphorylation. Recently we found that arrestin p44 is localized to the detergent-resistant portion of the outer segment membrane (“lipid rafts”), whereas membrane-bound full-length arrestin is present in the detergent-soluble fraction (32Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because rhodopsin is present in both microdomains, the reason for the specific localization of these two very similar arrestins was unclear. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differential localization of full-length and truncated arrestin in photoreceptor cells. Materials—Frozen bovine retinas were from Lawson Co. Inc. (Lincoln, NE). Recombinant arrestins were produced in Escherichia coli as described earlier (33Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tubulin and taxol were from Cytoskeleton Inc., and heparin-agarose was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to arrestin raised against amino acid residues 301-320 (SCT-128) was generously provided by Clay Smith (University of Florida); anti-opsin antibody (1D4) was a gift from Dr. R. Molday (University of British Columbia), and anti-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. 35S-Labeled methionine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the TnT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system was from Promega. Protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. Preparation of Rod Outer Segment Membranes—Rod outer segments (ROS) were prepared under dim red light using sucrose gradient centrifugation as described earlier (29Zhang H. Huang W. Zhu X. Craft C.M. Baehr W. Chen C.K. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 231-237PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the membranes, ROS were passed through a 21-gauge needle five times, and the suspension was centrifuged in a table-top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in ROS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and stored at -70 °C. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Membranes—ROS membranes were resuspended in 0.5 ml of Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to a final rhodopsin concentration of 25 μm and incubated for 5 min on ice. The lysate was mixed with an equal amount of 80% sucrose solution made in Buffer B. The mixture was transferred to the bottom of a centrifuge tube and layered successively with 1 ml of 30% sucrose and 0.5 ml of 5% sucrose. Following centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 16 h, a light-scattering band of DRM formed at the 5-30% sucrose interface. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected starting from the top of the gradient, and the pellet at the bottom of tube was solubilized in 0.25 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Caveolin-enriched DRM were found in fractions 3-5 of the total 12 fractions. The fractions from the gradient were subjected to Western blot analysis for protein detection. Analysis of in Vitro Translated Arrestin—In vitro translation was carried out using the TnT kit (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 35S-Labeled products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To study the interactions of 35S-labeled arrestins with ROS membranes, radiolabeled arrestin (50 fmol) was incubated with the membrane (25 μm rhodopsin) in 50 μl of Buffer B for 10 min at room temperature in the dark or with illumination. The membranes were then washed with ROS Buffer B to remove unbound arrestin and subjected to DRM fractionation as described above. Preparation of Immobilized Arrestin and Tubulin—E. coli expressed, purified arrestin-(1-378) or tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was coupled to Aminolink Plus coupling gel (Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were suspended in coupling buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and incubated with 0.1 ml of Aminolink Plus coupling gel overnight in a total volume of 0.3 ml. The beads were then washed with coupling buffer and incubated with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to block the remaining active sites for 30 min at room temperature. The matrix was then washed with 1 m NaCl and stored in the coupling buffer at 4 °C. Affinity Chromatography—100 μl of the affinity beads (tubulin or arrestin-(1-378) coupled to Aminolink) was equilibrated with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5% sodium cholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors). ROS DRM were lysed in RIPA buffer and added to the beads, which were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The resins were then washed with 10 ml of RIPA buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.1 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.9. The eluate was neutralized with 5 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.8, concentrated by lyophilization, and analyzed by Western blot. Analysis of Rhodopsin Phosphorylation by Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Mass Spectrometry—Phosphorylation of rhodopsin in ROS homogenates was performed in vitro as described in the figure legends. The phosphorylation state of rhodopsin in DRM and total ROS membranes was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, as described previously (20Lee K.A. Craven K.B. Niemi G.A. Hurley J.B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DRM or total ROS membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 54,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman Optima ultracentrifuge. The pellet was washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then incubated at 30 °C for 4 h in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 ng/μl endoproteinase AspN (Roche Applied Science). Soluble peptides were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 54,000 rpm. The supernatants (∼50 μl) were acidified with 5 μl of 5% acetic acid and stored at -70 °C. Samples were then analyzed using an autosampler injecting 10-μl aliquots onto a 260-μm × 5-cm capillary column packed with Vydac C18 resin at a flow rate of ∼1 μl/min. Samples were loaded in 0.08% heptafluorobutyric acid and eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.08% heptafluorobutyric acid. The sample was then passed over a second column (Vydac C18 resin, 75 μm × 8 cm) packed in the needle used to deliver the peptides into the mass spectrometer (New Objective, Inc., Woborn, MA). The exact concentration of acetonitrile used to elute the peptides varied with flow rate and the length of the columns but generally ranged from 11 to 15% acetonitrile. The sample was delivered to the mass spectrometer by microspray through a 15-μm needle (New Objective, Inc.). For all experiments, we used a Finnegan LCQ deca ion trap mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. Data from the mass spectrometer were filtered through narrow mass windows (1.5-2 daltons) centered on the predicted masses of the various phosphorylated forms of bovine rhodopsin (in their doubly charged state) as follows: 0P, 969.0; 1P, 1009.0; 2P, 1049.0; 3P, 1089.0; 4P, 1129.0; 5P, 1169.0; and 6P, 1209.0. We confirmed the identity of eluting peptides by collision-induced dissociation. To obtain the relative amounts of the various phosphorylated species in a given sample, we integrated the area under peaks confirmed by collision-induced dissociation to be rhodopsin C termini. The relative amount of each species was calculated as a fraction of the total amount of rhodopsin peptide after correction for the decreased efficiency of phosphopeptide detection (20Lee K.A. Craven K.B. Niemi G.A. Hurley J.B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To map the major sites of phosphorylation, we performed collision-induced dissociation on mono-phosphorylated peptides as described previously in detail (20Lee K.A. Craven K.B. Niemi G.A. Hurley J.B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Collision-induced dissociation was performed with an activation amplitude of 20.5, activation Q value of 0.25, activation time of 50 ms, and isolation width of 2.5 m/z. Ions in the collision-induced dissociation spectra were assigned with the aid of Sherpa lite 4.0 software. Analysis of Protein Complexes on Linear Sucrose Gradients—Isolated DRM were solubilized in 1 ml of Buffer B containing 2% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. The lysate was then layered on top of a 10-40% linear sucrose gradient (volume: 10 ml) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Eighteen 0.5-ml fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Preparation of Axoneme—Axonemes were prepared from ROS as described by Fleischman et al. (37Fleischman D. Denisevich M. Raveed D. Pannbacker R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 0.5 ml of ROS (500 μm rhodopsin) were solubilized in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors for 1 h on ice. The detergent-soluble material and the axoneme were separated by centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose step gradient consisting of three steps (5 ml each) of 40, 50, and 60% (w/v) sucrose in ROS buffer. The axoneme-enriched fraction that appears as a distinct band at the 50:60% sucrose interface was collected. The axoneme was diluted ∼5-fold and centrifuged in Beckman Airfuge at 20 pounds/square inch and then solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Microtubule Binding (Spin-down) Assay—Binding of arrestin to microtubules was assayed using reagents supplied by Cytoskeleton Inc. Microtubules were prepared in vitro as follows. Purified tubulin (> 99% pure) was incubated at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm GTP, pH 6.9) at 35 °C for 15 min. Taxol was added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. This resulted in a microtubule population averaging 2 μm long. These microtubules (10 μg) were mixed with recombinant arrestin (2 μg) in 50 ml of PEM buffer and layered over 200 μl of 50% glycerol solution supplied by the manufacturer. The tube was centrifuged in the Beckman Airfuge at 20 pounds/square inch for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant and pellet were collected and analyzed by Western blot. Separation of Microtubules and Membranes by Gel Filtration—Sephadex G-25 columns (1 ml) were equilibrated with ROS buffer. ROS membranes were loaded on the column and eluted with 1 ml of ROS buffer, and 0.15-ml fractions were collected. Membranes absorbed at the top of the column were eluted with SDS-containing buffer. All fractions were then concentrated and analyzed by Western blotting with arrestin, tubulin, and rhodopsin. Turbidimetric Evaluation of Microtubule Assembly—The assembly/disassembly of tubulin was measured by using a light scattering assay according to the instructions provided by Cytoskeleton, Inc. For the microtubule assembly assays, tubulin (3 mg/ml final concentration) in PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol) containing 1 mm GTP at 4 °C was mixed with arrestin-(1-378) (5 μm), full-length arrestin (5 μm), and MAP2 (2 μm). Microtubule assembly was initiated by raising the temperature to 37 °C, and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored over 50 min in a Tecan microtiter plate reader. Fluorescence Analysis of Rhodamine-labeled Tubulin Disassembly—MAP-free tubulin and rhodamine-labeled tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) were premixed at a ratio of 4:1 (unlabeled/labeled) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in PEM buffer containing 1 mm GTP at 37 °C for 30 min to form microtubules. Arrestin-(1-378) (5 μm) alone, full-length arrestin (5 μm), and MAP (2 μm), or buffer was then added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions (10 μl) were diluted in 50 μl of 60% glycerol and gently mixed. A 4-μl aliquot was then placed on a glass slide with a coverslip, and microtubule patterns were observed by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Localization of Truncated Arrestin to DRM—Truncated (p44) arrestin is present in the DRM of bovine ROS, whereas full-length (p48) arrestin is virtually excluded from the DRM (Fig. 1A). To elucidate the specific structural features of p44 and full-length arrestin required for their differential localization in membrane microdomains, we first established that recombinant arrestins behave similarly to their endogenous counterparts. We expressed 35S-labeled full-length arrestin (WT) and its shorter version (residues 1-367), which is structurally and functionally similar to p44 (19Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and reconstituted them with bovine ROS membranes. Arrestins-(1-404) (WT) and -(1-367) are both bound to ROS membranes containing P-Rh*. Further analysis of their distribution in membrane domains showed that most of the full-length arrestin was present in the detergent-soluble membrane fractions (fractions 7-12), whereas most of the arrestin-(1-367) was found in the DRM (Fig. 1B). As expected, in the absence of P-Rh* (light in the absence of ATP), binding of full-length arrestin to the membranes was negligible (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the p44-like arrestin-(1-367) bound to the membranes in the absence of ATP, and it was concentrated in the DRM fractions. To understand further what part of the arrestin molecule is responsible for its differential localization, we expressed a series of arrestin deletion mutants 1-191, 1-376, 1-378, 1-380, and 1-394, and we studied their binding to membranes containing P-Rh*. All of the arrestin mutants bound to the rhodopsin-containing membranes, but only arrestins-(1-376), -(1-378), and -(1-380) were enriched in the DRM. Arrestins-(1-394) and -(1-191) were mostly present in the DSM (Fig. 2), suggesting that the amino acid sequence between 191 and 367 is required for specific targeting of the molecule to the DRM fraction, and the failure of arrestin-(1-394) to localize to the DRM is because of masking of the sequence required for DRM localization. Rhodopsin Phosphorylation Status in the DRM and DSM—To test whether selective localization of truncated arrestin to the DRM occurs because of a difference in rhodopsin phosphorylation, we illuminated ROS membranes in the presence of [32P]ATP, and we fractionated the membranes to compare rhodopsin radiolabeling in the DRM and DSM. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was no apparent difference in rhodopsin phosphate incorporation between the two fractions. Because rhodopsin can be phosphorylated at several sites, we also performed a mass spectrometry analysis assessing the number of phosphates/mol of rhodopsin in the isolated DRM and total ROS membrane rhodopsin. Because over 80% of rhodopsin is present in the detergent-soluble fraction, the analysis of total membranes provided a good estimate of the phosphorylation of DSM rhodopsin. As expected, rhodopsin was largely unphosphorylated in the dark in both the DRM and DSM (Fig. 3B). Upon light activation, the distribution of single-, double-, and triple-phosphorylated rhodopsin was identical in the two membrane pools, suggesting that there is no significant difference in rhodopsin phosphorylation between the DRM and DSM. The distribution of phosphorylation sites in monophosphorylated rhodopsin in DRM and DSM was also virtually identical (Fig. 3C). Thus, specific targeting of p44 to the DRM is independent of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Arrestin Is Anchored to the DRM via a Peripheral Membrane Protein—To find out whether truncated arrestin localization to the DRM requires rhodopsin activation, we incubated recombinant arrestin-(1-367) with dark-adapted ROS membranes. As shown in Fig. 4A, arrestin-(1-367) bound to the membranes in the dark and partitioned to the DRM, similar to endogenous p44. Thus, targeting of the shorter variant of arrestin to the DRM is independent of either phosphorylation or activation of rhodopsin, suggesting that it is anchored via a rhodopsin-independent mechanism. This finding disagrees with our earlier report (32Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) where p44 arrestin was present in lower amounts in DRM in the dark. However, subsequently we found tha"
https://openalex.org/W2003452946,"One of the final steps in the biosynthesis of the widely used anti-tumor drug daunorubicin in Streptomyces peucetius is the methylation of the 4-hydroxyl group of the tetracyclic ring system. This reaction is catalyzed by the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent carminomycin 4-O-methyltransferase DnrK. The crystal structure of the ternary complex of this enzyme with the bound products S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and 4-methoxy-ϵ-rhodomycin T has been determined to a 2.35-Å resolution. DnrK is a homodimer, and the subunit displays the typical fold of small molecule O-methyltransferases. The structure provides insights into the recognition of the anthracycline substrate and also suggests conformational changes as part of the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. The position and orientation of the bound ligands are consistent with an SN2 mechanism of methyl transfer. Mutagenesis experiments on a putative catalytic base confirm that DnrK most likely acts as an entropic enzyme in that rate enhancement is mainly due to orientational and proximity effects. This contrasts the mechanism of DnrK with that of other O-methyltransferases where acid/base catalysis has been demonstrated to be an essential contribution to rate enhancement.

Daunorubicin and doxorubicin are aromatic polyketide antibiotics that exhibit high cytotoxicity and are widely applied in the chemotherapy of a variety of cancers (1Di Marco A. Gaetani M. Orezzi P. Scarpinato B.M. Silvestrini R. Soldati M. Dasdia T. Valentini L. Nature. 1964; 201: 706-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Arcamone F. Franceschi G. Penco S. Selva A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1969; 13: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These and related anthracyclines consist of a cyclic polyketide backbone, 7,8,9,10-tetrahydrotetracene-5,12-quinone, glycosylated at position C7 or C10 (Fig. 1). Diversity is generated by variations in the modification of the aglycone moiety and the composition of the attached carbohydrate. Biosynthesis of daunorubicin/doxorubicin starts with the formation of the polyketide backbone catalyzed by a class II polyketide synthase with subsequent cyclization of the polyketide chain (3Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6600-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These steps lead to the formation of aklavinone, a common intermediate in the synthesis of most anthracyclines. This aglycone is then further modified through a series of steps, i.e. hydroxylation, glycosylation, methylester hydrolysis, decarboxylation, methylation, and, in the case of doxorubicin, oxidation by the action of tailoring enzymes (4Wang Y.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation of these polyketide antibiotics is usually required for biological activity and often occurs as the initial modification step (3Shen B. Hutchinson C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6600-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Matsuzawa Y. Oki T. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1981; 34: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The genes for the entire pathway of daunorubicin biosynthesis in Streptomyces peucetius have been cloned (11Stutzman-Engwall K.J.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3427-3434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dnrK gene of this cluster codes for an anthracycline 4-O-methyltransferase that catalyzes one step in daunorubicin biosynthesis, the methylation of carminomycin at the C4 hydroxyl group (Fig. 1) (8Madduri K. Torti F. Colombo A.L. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3900-3904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain of DnrK consists of 355 amino acids, and the sequence contains the DLGGGXG fingerprint that is characteristic for the binding site of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; ϵ-T, ϵ-rhodomycinone-rhodosamine (ϵ-rhodomycin T); M-ϵ-T, 4-methoxy-ϵ-rhodomycin T; DbrT/A: 11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin T/A; AknT/A, aclacinomycin T/A; RdmB, aclacinomycin-10-hydroxylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; ϵ-T, ϵ-rhodomycinone-rhodosamine (ϵ-rhodomycin T); M-ϵ-T, 4-methoxy-ϵ-rhodomycin T; DbrT/A: 11-deoxy-β-rhodomycin T/A; AknT/A, aclacinomycin T/A; RdmB, aclacinomycin-10-hydroxylase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. (8Madduri K. Torti F. Colombo A.L. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3900-3904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several homologous enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of anthracyclines in various Streptomyces species have been described to date. For instance, the closest relative is DauK, which is involved in daunorubicin biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. strain C5 (9Dickens M.L. Priestley N.D. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and displays a 95% sequence identity to DnrK. Another enzyme with high sequence similarity is RdmB (52% sequence identity), which is involved in rhodomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces purpurascens (13Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2942-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of this enzyme, determined by x-ray crystallography, shows the typical methyltransferase fold and an AdoMet binding site characteristic for these enzymes (14Jansson A. Niemi J. Lindqvist Y. Mäntsälä P. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is, however, noteworthy that RdmB does not act as a methyltransferase but is a regiospecific hydroxylase (4Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mantsala P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and therefore appears to be an odd member of this group of enzymes.DnrK has a rather broad substrate specificity and can methylate other anthracyclines in addition to carminomycin, for instance ϵ-rhodomycin T (Fig. 1). Here, we describe the crystal structure of a ternary complex of DnrK with the bound products SAH and 4-methoxy-ϵ-rhodomycin T (M-ϵ-T) to a 2.35-Å resolution. The structure provides insights into the recognition of the anthracycline substrate by these methyltransferases and also reveals conformational changes as part of the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Replacement of a putative catalytic base by site-directed mutagenesis results in little change in catalytic activity. This observation suggests that DnrK most likely acts as an entropic enzyme in that rate enhancement is mainly due to orientational and proximity effects. This is different from the mechanism of other related O-methyltransferases where acid/base catalysis has been demonstrated to be an essential catalytic step (15Martin J.L. McMillan F.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12 (Correction (2003) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.13, 140): 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning—The dnrK open reading frame was amplified from S. peucetius ATCC 27952 chromosomal DNA by PCR (using 5′-CCGAATTCCACAGCCGAACCGACGGTCG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CTCGAGCGGCCGCATCAGGCGCCGGTGGCC-3′ as the reverse primer), cloned in the glutathione S-transferase fusion expression plasmid pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) using the EcoRI and NotI sites, and sequenced to confirm the published nucleotide sequence (8Madduri K. Torti F. Colombo A.L. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3900-3904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Expression and Purification—Recombinant DnrK was produced and purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein according to the plasmid manufacturer's instructions (cultivation at 30 °C and induction overnight with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside). After thrombin cleavage to remove the glutathione S-transferase part, DnrK was purified by anion exchange chromatography using a HiPrep 16/10 Q XL column (0-1 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and gel exclusion chromatography employing a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column in an Äkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; all components from Amersham Biosciences). The yield of pure protein was 36 mg from 5 liters of culture. The cloning procedure and the subsequent protease cleavage of the fusion protein resulted in the removal of the N-terminal methionine of DnrK and the addition of five amino acids at the N-terminal so that the N-terminal sequence of the recombinant enzyme is gspnsTAEPTV (small letters denote the amino acids resulting from the vector pGEX4T-3).Mutagenesis—PCR mutagenesis was performed by the four-primer method with the Y142W mutagenic primers 5′-GCAAGCCGTTCTggGAGGACCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGTCCTCccAGAACGGCTTGC-3′ (small letters indicate the site of mutation). The original dnrK primers were used as distal primers. The PCR products were cloned, sequenced, expressed, and purified as described for the wild-type enzyme.HPLC—HPLC of anthracyclines was performed on LiChrospher 100 RP18 columns using 70:30 acetonitrile/60 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 3.6, as eluent. In analytical HPLC, a 5-μm particle size column (250 × 4 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used in a Shimadzu VP series chromatography system with a diode array detector. In preparative HPLC, a 10-μm particle size column (250 × 4 mm) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min was employed. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences API 365 liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system (electro-spray ionization, positive ions).Anthracycline Substrates—Aclarubicin (also called aclacinomycin A or AknA) was purchased from Calbiochem, and daunorubicin was from Sigma. AknT was produced from AknA by partial hydrolysis as described (16Niemi J. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Parssinen R. Kopio A. Mäntsälä P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and purified by preparative HPLC. ϵ-Rhodomycin T was produced by culturing Streptomyces galilaeus ATCC 31615 transformed with the 11-hydroxylase expression plasmid pJN018 (5Niemi J. Wang Y. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mantsala P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (13Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2942-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in E1 medium as described (16Niemi J. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Parssinen R. Kopio A. Mäntsälä P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After partial hydrolysis, the monoglycoside was purified by preparative HPLC. Carminomycin was produced by culturing Nonomuraea roseoviolacea subsp. carminata DSM 44170 (originally Actinomadura roseoviolacea, (17Gauze G.F. Sveshnikova M.A. Ukholina R.S. Gavrilina G.V. Filicheva V.A. Antibiotiki. 1973; 18: 675-678PubMed Google Scholar) in E1 medium. The product was recovered and purified as above. DbrA was prepared by incubating 1 mg of AknA for 2 h at 37 °C in a 10-ml reaction mixture containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 μm AdoMet, 1 mm glutathione, 24 μg/ml purified aclacinomycin methylesterase (RdmC), and 37 μg/ml purified RdmB (18Wang Y. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anthracycline products were recovered by solid phase extraction as described below, and DbrA was purified by preparative HPLC. DbrT was produced from DbrA by partial hydrolysis and preparative HPLC as described for AknT.Enzyme Assay—DnrK activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 80 μm AdoMet, 40 μm substrate, and 90 μg/ml enzyme, which was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C; the reaction was terminated, and the anthracycline products were recovered by solid phase extraction using Supelco DSC-18 columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. The products were assayed by analytical HPLC.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization of the ternary complex of DnrK was carried out at 20 °C using the vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of a protein solution (9.4 mg/ml DnrK, including 3 mm ϵ-rhodomycinone-rhodosamine (ϵ-T), 10 mm AdoMet, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5) were mixed with an equal amount of mother liquid. Hampton research kits were used for crystallization screening. Crystals were obtained after 1 week using 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.5). One crystal form grew in space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 60.8 Å, b = 102.0 Å, and c = 124.4 Å and contained two subunits per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 54%. The x-ray data was collected at 100 K at beam line ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France to a resolution of 2.5 Å. The crystals could be frozen directly due to the high content of polyethylene glycol 4000 in the mother liquid.A second crystal form of the DnrK ternary complex was obtained using 1.6 m ammonium sulfate as a precipitant in 0.1 m MES buffer at pH 6 at room temperature. Diffraction data from these crystals were collected at 100 K at beam line 7-11, MAX-lab, Lund, Sweden to 2.35 Å resolution. The crystals were of space group C2 with the cell dimensions a = 210.7 Å, b = 53.1 Å, c = 83.1Å, and β = 105°. These C2 crystals have two subunits per asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 60%.All diffraction images were indexed and processed with the program MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar). The program SCALA of the CCP4 program package (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar) was used for scaling. Space group determination was based on the auto-indexing of the diffraction patterns by examining the scaling statistics and pseudo-precession photographs generated with the program PATTERN (21Lu G.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of the DnrK ternary complex was solved initially in the P212121 crystal form by molecular replacement using the program Molrep (22Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). The search model was that of a ternary complex of the homologous hydroxylase RdmB, AdoMet, and substrate. 2A. Jansson, G. Schneider, and J. Niemi, manuscript in preparation. The monomer of RdmB was used as a search model, and a rotation and translation search was used to find the position of the two subunits in the asymmetric unit, giving a solution with an R-factor of 57.5% and correlation coefficient of 0.39.The program REFMAC 5.0 (23Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) was employed for refinement by the maximum likelihood residual. A set of reflections, ∼8% for every data set, was set aside for the calculation of Rfree. The protocol consisted of initial rigid body refinement, which was followed by restrained conjugate gradient minimization. Isotropic B-factor refinement and bulk solvent correction were used. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied whenever possible to improve the data to parameter ratio, but care was taken not to include parts of the structures that differed between the two non-crystallographic symmetry-related subunits. Thus, the rigid Rossman-like fold was tightly restrained, whereas other parts of the structure were kept rather loosely restrained by noncrystallographic symmetry. Water molecules were added by ARP/WARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Rounds of refinement were followed by manual inspection of the electron density maps using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The refinement protocol converged at an R-factor of 20.3% and an Rfree of 27.0%.This refined model was used to solve the C2 crystal form by molecular replacement using Molrep (22Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar). A solution was found using the monomer as a search model with a correlation coefficient of 0.266 and an R-factor of 56.2%. The bound ligands had been removed from the search model, and the correctness of the solution was verified by electron density appearing for these ligands in the initial 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. Refinement of this crystal form followed the same procedure as described above, and the final model has an R-factor of 19.4% and an Rfree of 24.1%.The geometry of the structures was analyzed with PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the details of the refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The refined atomic coordinates and observed structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession numbers 1TW2 (DnrK/SAH/M-ϵ-T, P212121) and 1TW3 (DnrK/SAH/M-ϵ-T, C2).Structural Comparisons—Pairwise and multiple sequence alignments were made using BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) and ClustalW (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar), respectively. Secondary structure alignments were carried out with TOP (29Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the LSQ option in O, using default parameters (25Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Figures were drawn using PyMOL (30DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlo, CA2002Google Scholar), VMD (31Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27-38): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36841) Google Scholar), and BOBSCRIPT (32Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 133-138Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar).RESULTSIn Vitro Methylation of Anthracyclines by DnrK—Purified DnrK was tested for methyl transferase activity in vitro using different anthracycline glycosides. Carminomycin, ϵ-T, DbrT, and AknT produced new HPLC peaks. The product from carminomycin methylation co-eluted with authentic daunorubicin, and the product from ϵ-T methylation had a mass spectrum consistent with O-methylation. The identity of this product as the 4-O methylated compound was later verified by crystallographic analysis (see below). On the other hand, no new products were observed for AknA or DbrA, indicating that DnrK cannot methylate substrates with a tri-sugar chain.Activity of the Y142W Mutant—When ϵ-T was incubated in the presence of equal amounts of recombinant native DnrK and the purified mutant Y142W, methylation by the mutant enzyme proceeded at 48% of the rate of the recombinant native control as assessed by the HPLC peak area.Quality of the Maps and the Model—DnrK was co-crystallized with the substrate ϵ-T and the cofactor AdoMet. Two crystal forms, P212121 and C2, were obtained under different crystallization conditions, and these crystals diffracted to 2.5- and 2.35-Å resolution, respectively. The structures of both of the complexes were determined with molecular replacement. The final P212121 model is a dimer consisting of amino acids 14-351 in chain A and 3-352 in chain B, two SAH molecules, two product molecules, and 165 water molecules. The only missing residues are flexible residues at the N- and C termini of the protein. The electron density for the polypeptide chain and the bound ligands is well defined (Fig. 2). The A and B chains superpose with an r.m.s.d. of 1.28 Å for all Cα atoms. This relatively high r.m.s.d. value is due to localized differences in the conformation of the polypeptide chain described further below.Fig. 2Electron density maps.Top, stereo picture of the initial, unrefined 2Fo - Fc electron density map for the bound product and surrounding amino acids in the active site of DnrK.

As in the case of the complex crystallized in space group P212121, the electron density for the polypeptide chain and the bound ligands is well defined, except for a few residues at the N- and C termini. Residue Glu-283 in the C2 model is the only amino acid in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, but it is well defined by electron density. The two chains in space group C2 give a r.m.s.d. value of 0.57 Å upon the superposition of all Cα atoms.The structures of the subunits determined in the two different space groups do not differ significantly from each other, with one exception (see below). The C2 and P212121 dimers superimpose with an r.m.s.d. difference of 0.47 Å for the A chains and 1.35 Å for the B chains. Overall, in both crystal forms the A chain is better defined in density than the B chain, including the bound ligands. This is also reflected by the B-factors for the bound ligands, which are consistently higher for the B than for the A chains (Table I). In the following we will mainly discuss the model of the DnrK ternary complex determined in the C2 crystal form because of its higher resolution and better electron density maps.Overview of the Structure—The subunit of DnrK is built up by an N-terminal domain with a mainly helical structure except for two β-strands, a middle all-helical domain, and the C-terminal Rossman-like fold comprising a central parallel β-sheet (β3-β9) surrounded by eight helices (γ13-α21). (Fig. 3). The C-terminal domain contains the binding site for the cofactor AdoMet with the conserved DLGGGXG fingerprint. The substrate/product is positioned between the middle and C-terminal domains (Fig. 3), and residues from both of these domains are involved in binding the substrate. The fold of DnrK very much resembles that of RdmB (14Jansson A. Niemi J. Lindqvist Y. Mäntsälä P. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the AdoMet-dependent hydroxylase homologous to DnrK. Both subunits superimpose with an r.m.s.d. difference of 1.14 Å for 345 Cα atoms. The only difference in the secondary structure elements between the two enzymes is an additional helix (γ19) in DnrK, which is inserted between β7 and α20.Fig. 3Schematic view of the homodimer of the ternary complex of DnrK-SAH-product. Monomer A is yellow, monomer B is purple, and the bound ligands are shown in cyan ball-and-stick models and labeled. Secondary structure elements in the A monomer are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal domain is extensively involved in the dimer interface (buried surface area of 3697 Å2) that involves 15 hydrogen bonds but is otherwise dominated by hydrophobic interactions. The secondary elements mainly engaged in dimer formation are α1, α2, γ6, α7, α8, and α19. In both crystal forms DnrK is found as a tightly packed dimer. Analysis of crystal packing shows that the interactions with neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice are rather weak in space group in P212121 (pH 8.5). The largest interaction area with an adjacent molecule is only 511 Å2, indicative of crystal contacts rather than a protein-protein interface. In space group C2, the interface to the closest neighbor comprises 930 Å2 and might thus indicate formation of a tetramer. The relatively small size of this interface suggests that the tetramer may not be very stable. Gel filtration experiments with DnrK, both in the absence and presence of AdoMet and substrate, indicate that at low (6.5) and high pH (7.5) the enzyme forms a mixture of dimer and tetramers in solution, consistent with the crystallographic analysis.AdoMet/SAH Binding Site—In DnrK the cofactor AdoMet (with the exception of the methyl group) is well defined by electron density. The AdoMet/SAH binding site is located in the C-terminal domain at the carboxyl end of the β-strands of the nucleotide binding fold, and the cofactor is bound to DnrK in a similar manner as in other small molecule methyltransferases. The cofactor interacts with the enzyme via an extensive hydrogen bond network and a few hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4, top). The adenine ring forms stacking interactions with the side chains of Trp-257 and Phe-237, and Asp-236 forms a hydrogen bond to the N6 amino group. The ribose moiety is anchored to DnrK through hydrogen bonds of the O2* and O3* hydroxyl groups to the side chains of Glu-209 and Arg-152. Ser-251 interacts with both the carboxyl group as well as the amino group of AdoMet/SAH, and the latter also forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly-186. Most of these interactions are conserved between DnrK and RdmB with the exception of Arg-152, which is replaced by an alanine residue in RdmB. Furthermore, the hydrogen bond of the carboxyl group of AdoMet-SAH to the side chain of Tyr-171 (corresponding to Phe-167 in DnrK) observed in RdmB (14Jan"

A role in the control of chromosome dynamics was first suggested when SUMO was identified as high-copy suppressor of the centromere protein CENP-C mutants. CENP-C itself contains a consensus sumoylation sequence motif that partially overlaps with its DNA binding and centromere localization domain. To ascertain whether CENP-C can be sumoylated, tandem mass spectrometry (MS) based strategy was developed for high sensitivity identification and sequencing of sumoylated isopeptides present among in-gel-digested tryptic peptides of SDS-PAGE fractionated target proteins. Without a predisposition to searching for the expected isopeptides based on calculated molecular mass and relying instead on the characteristic MS/MS fragmentation pattern to identify sumolylation, we demonstrate that several other lysine residues located not within the perfect consensus sumoylation motif ψKXE/D, where ψ represents a large hydrophobic amino acid, and X represnts any amino acid, can be sumolylated with a reconstituted in vitro system containing only the SUMO proteins, E1-activating enzyme and E2-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9). In all cases, target sites that can be sumoylated by SUMO-2 were shown to be equally susceptible to SUMO-1 attachments which include specific sites on SUMO-2 itself, Ubc9, and the recombinant CENP-C fragments. Two non-consensus sites on one of the CENP-C fragments were found to be sumoylated in addition to the predicted site on the other fragment. The developed methodologies should facilitate future studies in delineating the dynamics and substrate specificities of SUMO-1/2/3 modifications and the respective roles of E3 ligases in the process.

(small ubiquitin-like modifier) proteins is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism in a diverse range of cellular processes (1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Through a three-step enzymatic pathway analogous to ubiquitylation, sumoylation is initiated by ATP-dependent formation of a thioester bond between the C-terminal glycine of a SUMO protein and a catalytic cysteine of the SUMO-specific E1-activating enzyme, known as SAE1/SAE2 and Uba2p/Aos1p for human and yeast, respectively. The activated SUMO protein is then trans-esterified from the E1 enzyme to the catalytic cysteine of an E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, which in turn catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and the ∈-amino group of lysine residue in the substrate proteins. Ubc9 was reported to recognize and bind directly to a consensus sumoylation motif ψKXE/D, where ψ represents a large hydrophobic amino acid L, I, V, or F, and X represents any amino acid (3Melchior F.

Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although sumoylation can be accomplished in vitro without an E3-like enzyme, several E3 ligases, e.g. PIAS, RanBP2, and PC2, have been identified which may aid Ubc9 in substrate selection and ligation efficiency in vivo (2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 6Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Unlike yeast and other invertebrates, which contain only a single SUMO gene, vertebrates carry three. Human SUMO-1 protein exhibits 44% sequence identity with human SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 proteins, while SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 proteins share 86% sequence identity. All SUMO proteins from yeast to human share the conserved ubiquitin domain and the C-terminal diglycine cleavage/attachment site (3Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 7Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The most prominent difference between the SUMO proteins and ubiquitin is the presence of a highly variable N-terminal extension in all SUMO proteins, which is rich in charged amino acids, glycines, and prolines. This extension varies from 16 to 23 amino acids and is reasonably well conserved within, but not between, different SUMO-1/2/3 proteins. At present, human SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 are thought to be functionally non-overlapping and respond differently to stress signaling (2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Although all three SUMO isoforms utilize the same E1-activating and E2-conjugating enzymes, the molecular basis for their substrates preference and the additional recruitment of E3 ligases, especially in relation to the selective use of sumoylation sites conforming and not conforming to the minimal consensus motif, remain unclear. SUMO-2/3, like yeast SUMO (Smt3), but not SUMO-1, contain a consensus ψKXE sumoylation site in their N-terminal extension. Accordingly, oligomerization of SUMO-2/3 or Smt3 chains can be demonstrated in vivo and effected with the reconstituted in vitro sumoylation system in the absence of E3 (8Tatham M.H. Jaffray E.

Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47938-47945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, formation of SUMO-1 chains with as yet unknown linkage apparently can only be demonstrated in the presence of an E3 ligase activity (10Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar).Sumoylation is a dynamic, reversible process, and often only little or no modified protein can be detected under physiological conditions (1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). It should be noted that direct biochemical evidence for the implicated isopeptide or the sumoylation site has been generally lacking for most reported sumoylation cases due to its low abundance. To date, only a handful of isopeptides have been physically defined by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (8Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 9Bencsath K.P. Podgorski M.S. Pagala V.R. Slaughter C.A. Schulman B.A. J. Biol.

The isopeptide formation and hence the sumoylation site were directly inferred from the molecular mass detected but in general not further verified by MS/MS sequencing analysis. This approach is problematic in view of the increasing probability in finding a non-consensus sumoylation site nor can it distinguish the exact sumoylated lysine residue in the event that the implicated endoproteinase-digested peptide carries more than one lysine residues. To better define the sumoylation site specificity and to delineate the respective roles of SUMO-1 versus SUMO-2/3, a high sensitivity MS/MS sequencing strategy for unambiguous identification of the isopeptide and sumoylation site is critically needed. By adopting an in vitro sumoylation system with defined components, we have thus undertaken to first develop the enabling analytical techniques while gearing toward addressing the role of sumoylation in regulating chromosome dynamics.The centromere is a highly ordered structure of the eukaryotic chromosomes which provides the site for microtubule (spindle) attachment during cell division (13Pluta A.F. Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Goldberg I.G. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The first implication of sumoylation in centromere functions came from the original isolation of the yeast SUMO (Smt3) as a high copy suppressor of a mutation in the Mif2 gene, the yeast homologue of the gene for mammalian centromere protein CENP-C (14Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). CENP-C is an essential component of the kinetochore inner plate, which contributes to the formation of functional centromeres for correct chromosome segregation. Temperature-sensitive CENP-C mutants in vertebrate cells could likewise be suppressed by overexpression of SUMO-1 (15Fukagawa T. Regnier V. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3796-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite several studies, which demonstrated the localization of SUMO at or adjacent to the kinetochore and how sumoylation may affect centromeric chromosome cohesion (reviewed in Refs. 1Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar and 2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), the mechanistic details remain largely unknown nor is it clear whether critical centromeric proteins like CENP-C are themselves sumoylated. Molecular dissection of CENP-C revealed that the protein is composed of several functional domains (16Brown M.T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Lanini L. McKeon F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Yang C.H. Tomkiel J.

Notably, its partial overlapping with a sumoylation consensus sequence of VKSE at aa 533–536 raises an intriguing possibility that regulated sumoylation of CENP-C may affect its functions.Using the methodologies developed, which were first validated against SUMO-2/SUMO-2 and SUMO-2/Ubc9 conjugation, we report here that a C28 fragment of CENP-C encoding aa 432–683 (Fig. 1), which includes the consensus sumoylation site, DNA binding and centromere localization regions, and two nuclear localization signals, could be in vitro sumoylated by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 at the expected site in the absence of any E3 ligases. In addition, another C10 fragment of CENP-C encoding aa 678–764, which comprises a Mif2 homology block at aa 737–759, could also be sumoylated in vitro by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 at two distinct sites, neither of which corresponds to the consensus sequence motif. We further demonstrate that SUMO-1 could be attached to SUMO-2 and the characteristic MS/MS fragmentation pattern associated with SUMO-2 isopeptides could be utilized as an effective fingerprint in identifying sumoylation site at high sensitivity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The C28 cDNA encoding aa 432–683 of human CENP-C was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using poly(A)-containing RNAs from HeLa cells, as well as primers of 5′-CGGATCCAGAACACTTGATGTGGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCTCCAGTTCCTCTAAAACTGAAGT-3′, and then cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of bacterial expression vector pET-21b (His-tag at the C terminus). The C10 cDNA encoding aa 678–764 of human CENP-C was also amplified using primers of 5′-CGGATCCCACTTCAGTTTTAGAGGAA-3′ and 5′-GTGCTCCAGTCCTGATGGCCTTCCTTGATA-3′ and then cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pET-21b. The human cDNA encoding the active form (exposing diglycine motif) of SUMO-1GG was obtained by PCR from the FLAG-SUMO-1 cDNA described previously (22Su H.L. Li S.S.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding the active form of SUMO-2GG was obtained by PCR from the hSMT3 cDNA reported previously (23Mannen H. Tseng H.M. Cho C.L. Li S.S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both SUMO-1GG and SUMO-2GG cDNAs were subsequently cloned into pET-32 Xa (both His-tag and S-tag at the N terminus). The human Ubc9 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using poly(A)-containing RNAs from HeLa cells and then cloned into pET-21b and pET-32 Xa. The Escherichia coli BL21 strain was used as host cells for protein expression. His-tag proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The purified proteins from pET-32 Xa were cleaved with Factor Xa to remove both His-tag and S-tag.In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—The in vitro sumoylation system employed in this investigation contains E1 enzyme (159 ng of SAE1/SAE2, LAE Biotechnology, Taichung, Taiwan), E2 enzyme (2 μg Ubc9), SUMO-1GG or SUMO-2GG protein (5 μg), and C28-His or C10-His protein substrate (5 μg) in sumoylation buffer (2 μl of 500 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 100 mm ATP, 0.5 μl of 40 mm dithiothreitol, an ATP-regenerating system, including 0.5 μl of 400 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 μl of 140 units/ml creatine kinase, 0.5 μl of 24 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase). The sumoylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After termination with SDS buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, reaction products were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue.Identification of Sumoylation Sites by Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Following SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised from gels, reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide, and in-gel-digested with sequencing grade, modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted and subjected first to nanoLC-nanoESI-MS/MS analysis for protein identification as described previously (24Lee C.L. Hsiao H.H. Lin C.W. Wu S.P. Huang S.Y. Wu C.Y. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 2472-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequently, MALDI-MS detection and MS/MS sequencing of isopeptides in reflectron mode were performed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser (355 nm wavelength, <500-ps pulse, and 200 Hz repetition rate in both MS and MS/MS modes). 1000 and 10,000 shots were accumulated in positive ion mode MS and MS/MS modes, respectively. The tryptic digested peptide samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acids and premixed with a 5 mg/ml matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid for spotting onto target plate. For collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS operation, the indicated collision cell pressure was increased from 3.0 × 10–8 torr (no collision gas) to 5.0 × 10–7 torr, with the potential difference between the source acceleration voltage and the collision cell set at 1 kV. The resolution of timed ion selector for precursor ion was set at 100, which would allow in a mass window of about 50 Da for precursors at m/z 5000. Both MS and MS/MS data were acquired using the instrument default calibration. At a resolution above 10,000 in MS mode, accurate mass measurement (<50 ppm) of the monoisotopic isopeptide signals is possible when further adjusted against an internal reference peak at m/z 5557.8 derived from autolytic cleavage of the modified trypsin.RESULTSSumoylation of SUMO-2 and Ubc9 —The in vitro sumoylation system employed in this investigation contained E1 (SAE1/SAE2)-activating enzyme, E2 (Ubc9)-conjugating enzyme, the active SUMO proteins (SUMO-1GG or SUMO-2GG), with and without the centromere proteins (C28-His or C10-His), and an ATP-generating system, including creatine kinase. To better define the sumoylation reaction products as visualized by SDS-PAGE analysis, reactions of the active SUMO proteins with the E1/E2 enzymes were first investigated prior to the addition of the substrate proteins. Fig. 2 shows that in the absence of E1 enzyme, no reaction product could be detected (lanes 2 and 4), but one (lane 1) and two (lane 3) additional protein bands were clearly visible when E1 enzyme was added to the SUMO-1GG/E2 and SUMO-2GG/E2 reaction mixtures, respectively. By LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of the respective in-gel tryptic digests, bands 2 and 3 were found to contain peptides derived from SUMO-1 and SUMO-2, respectively, in addition to those from Ubc9 (data not shown). Band 1 on the other hand only afforded peptides matching to SUMO-2. Since the tagged SUMO proteins and Ubc9 alone ran as protein bands close to 20 kDa (data not shown), the results indicated that the SUMO proteins can be stably conjugated to Ubc9 and ran as bands 2 and 3 and that only SUMO-2, but not SUMO-1, can itself be sumoylated to give a higher molecular weight product (band 1).Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of sumoylation reaction products. The in vitro sumoylation reactions contained the E2 (Ubc9) and SUMO-1GG/2GG with and without the E1 enzyme, as well as creatine kinase (CK). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue for visualization of the protein bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MS/MS Characteristics of SUMO-2-conjugated Isopeptides— The monoisotopic mass of the SUMO-2-conjugated SUMO-2 isopeptide, in which the Gly93 of C-terminal tryptic peptide of aa 62–93 from one SUMO-2 was conjugated to the sumoylation site at Lys11 within the tryptic peptide of aa 8–21 from another SUMO-2, was calculated to be 5159.34. By nanoESI-MS analysis on a quadrupole/time-of-flight instrument of sufficiently high mass accuracy and resolution, a pair of well resolved, quadruply charged isotopic signal clusters could be detected with the respective monoisotopic molecular ions [M+4H]4+ occurring at m/z 1290.848 and 1294.847 (Fig. 3A, inset). The former corresponds exactly (within 10 ppm) to the expected isopeptide, while the latter at 16 mass units higher most likely was derived from the same peptide but containing an oxidized Met78 residue. The relative ratio of these two peaks varied from batch to batch, implying different degree of induced oxidation during sample preparation. To confirm the isopeptide linkage assignment predicted by previous MALDI-TOF MS study (8Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), the isopeptides detected here as singly charged [M+H]+ molecular ions on a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument were selected as precursors for MALDI CID-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 3). Two well known fragmentation characteristics facilitated the spectral assignment. First, peptide fragmentation by MALDI-MS/MS is often dominated by facile cleavages at C terminus of an Asp residue (25Wattenberg A. Organ A.J. Schneider K. Tyldesley R. Bordoli R. Bateman R.H. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For tryptic peptides where the positive charge tends to be localized to C-terminal Lys or Arg residue, the MS/MS spectra will be dominated by a series of y ions, the most abundant of which are derived from cleavages at Asp. In the case of the SUMO-2 conjugated SUMO-2 isopeptide carrying an oxidized Met (m/z 5180.6, Fig. 3A), the major ions at m/z 624.5 (y5), 2456.5 (y22), 2785.7 (y25), 3029.7 (y27), 4060.1 (y36), and 4915.3 (y44) effectively and unambiguously confirmed the peptide sequence. Other y ions, y5–y10, followed by the apparent absence of y11–y13 and the reappearance of the y ion series at y14 clearly define the SUMO-2 sumoylation site at Lys11. Second, consistent with the presence of an oxidized Met residue, the major fragment ions y36 and y44 and the molecular ion that contains the oxidized Met were accompanied by facile neutral loss of HSOCH3 (64 mass units) (26Jiang X. Smith J.B. Abraham E.C. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 1309-1310Crossref Google Scholar, 27Lagerwerf F.M. van de Weert M. Heerma W. Haverkamp J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1905-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), giving rise to ions at m/z 3996.0, 4951.3, and 5116.9, respectively. These neutral losses were not observed in the MS/MS spectra of isopeptides with non-oxidized Met, e.g. that of the monoisotopic [M+H]+ molecular ion signal at m/z 5164.3 (data not shown).Fig. 3MALDI-MS/MS spectra of the SUMO-2-conjugated SUMO-2 isopeptides carrying an oxidized Met78 residue (A) or a trypsin missed cleavage site at Arg61 (B). In A, the majority of the fragment ions could be assigned to the y ion series as annotated, which were commonly accompanied by neutral loss of H2O (18 mass units) giving rise to pairs of signals. Ions that carry the oxidized Met also afforded neutral loss of HSOCH3 (64 mass units). The quadruply charged molecular ion signals corresponding to the isopeptides containing a non-oxidized and oxidized Met as detected by nanoESI-MS analysis are shown as the inset in A. The spectrum in B is normalized to the intensity of the b12 ion signal, but only the portion below 50% intensity is shown. Localization of an Arg residue near the N terminus contributed to the predominance of the b ion series except for a couple of y ions as annotated. Neutral loss of H2O (18 mass units) is also evident for the b21, b23, and b26 ions. The labeled m/z values for this and other mass spectra figures mostly correspond to monoisotopic accurate masses as originally annotated by the instrument except for signals at above m/z 3500, especially those of relatively weak intensity, which may not afford full isotopic resolution and may thus be labeled according to the detected peak top, usually at several mass units higher than the theoretical monoisotopic masses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is important to note that, depending on the substrate proteins, the molecular weight of the SUMO-2-conjugated isopeptide will naturally be different. However, the tryptic fragment corresponding to the C-terminal peptide of SUMO-2 will remain the same. The four Asp residues, namely Asp71, Asp80, Asp82, and Asp85, will always induce four major fragment ions due to cleavage at their C termini with mass intervals corresponding to 1014 (TPAQLEMED) or 1030 (TPAQLEMoxED), 244 (ED), and 329 (TID) mass units. Detection of this characteristic MALDI-MS/MS pattern is thus a first indication that the parent ion signal is most probably a SUMO-2-sumoylated isopeptide. As reported by others (8Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), there is a tendency of missed cleavage by trypsin at the Arg61 located immediately upstream of the 62–93 C-terminal peptide. As a consequence of the additional two residues Phe60-Arg61 at the N terminus, strong fragment ion signals corresponding to the b ion series could be found to dominate the MS/MS spectrum in place of the y ions, a phenomenon best rationalized as charge localization at the N-terminal Arg in preference to the C-terminal Lys. Consequently, the mass intervals of 1014/244/329 are now defined by the b ions, namely b12 (m/z 1420.6), b21 (m/z 2435.0), b23 (m/z 2679.0), and b26 (m/z 3008.2) ions for all SUMO-2-conjugated isopeptides carrying the missed cleavage which, together with the prominent b4 ion at m/z 566.3, constitute the signature pattern (Fig. 3B). The complementary y ions could still be detected albeit at lower intensity, e.g. y44 and y36 at m/z 4900.4 and 4044.3, respectively, which can be further used as supporting evidence for confident sequence mapping. Interestingly, we noted that if the SUMO-2-sumoylated tryptic peptide from the substrate protein is itself terminating with an Arg residue instead of Lys, the presence of Arg at both the C and N termini of the isopeptide would lead to both y and b ion series as exemplified by the SUMO-2-sumoylated S-tag isopeptides (supplemental Fig. S1). In this case, the isopeptide, which did not carry the extra FR residues, afforded the expected y ion series dominated by y17, y20, and y22 (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, the isopeptide with additional N-terminal FR residues due to missed cleavage afforded strong b4, b12, b21, and b23 ion signals, as well as y17, y20, y22, y31, and y39 ions (Fig. S1B), due to the Arg residue at the C terminus of the sumoylated tryptic peptide, ETAAAKFER.Sumoylation of Ubc9 at the Non-consensus Site—Identification of peptides matching to both SUMO-2 and Ubc9 from band 3 (Fig. 2) implicated a covalent complex of the two proteins. Two putative isopeptides were detected by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis at high mass range, with their monoisotopic [M+H]+ molecular ion signals accurately mass-measured at m/z 4110.9 and 4414.0, respectively, corresponding to a FR residual mass difference. Both isopeptides were subjected to MS/MS sequence mapping and the resulting y and b ions detected (Fig. 4) confirm their identities, localizing the Lys sumoylation site to the C-terminal peptide of Ubc9, _AQAKKFAPS-COOH, similar to analogous position reported for yeast Ubc9 (_AKQYSK-COOH) conjugation with Smt3p (9Bencsath K.P.

The putative isopeptide carrying the catalytic Cys93 of Ubc9 with thiol ester bond to SUMO-2 was not detected. This may reflect that such isopeptide is transient and unstable whereby the conjugated SUMO protein will be rapidly transferred to substrate proteins. In the absence of other substrate proteins in the in vitro system, Ubc9 may itself act as an acceptor, utilizing a non-consensus site near its C terminus. It is reasonable to assume that SUMO-1 can likewise sumoylate Ubc9, probably at the same site, to yield the protein band 2 in Fig. 2. Indeed, a candidate SUMO-1/Ubc9 isopeptide was barely detectable by MALDI-MS analysis of its tryptic digestion products, further MS"

PlGF exerts its biological function through the binding and activation of the seven immunoglobulin-like domain receptor Flt-1, also known as VEGFR-1. Here, we report the first detailed mutagenesis studies that provide a basis for understanding molecular recognition between PlGF-1 and Flt-1, highlighting some of the residues that are critical for receptor recognition. Mutagenesis analysis, performed on the basis of a structural model of interaction between PlGF and the minimal binding domain of Flt-1, has led to the identification of several PlGF-1 residues involved in Flt-1 recognition. The two negatively charged residues, Asp-72 and Glu-73, located in the β3-β4 loop, are critical for Flt-1 binding. Other mutations, which bring about a significant decrease in PlGF binding activity, are Gln-27, located in the N-terminal α-helix, and Pro-98 and Tyr-100 on the β6 strand. The mutation of one of the two glycosylated residues of PlGF, Asn-84, generates a PlGF variant with reduced binding activity. This indicates that, unlike in VEGF, glycosylation plays an important role in Flt-1 binding. The double mutation of residues Asp-72 and Glu-73 generates a PlGF variant unable to bind and activate the receptor molecules on the cell surface. This variant failed to induce in vitro capillary-like tube formation of primary endothelial cells or neo-angiogenesis in an in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay.

Human PlGF is encoded by a single gene, but alternative splicing of mature mRNA (6Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Ferraro M.G. Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Del Vecchio S. Lei K.J. Chou J.Y.

Apart from the differences in the number of amino acids, these isoforms also differ in their ability to bind heparin. The presence of a highly basic 21-amino acid insert at the C-terminal end of the protein confers upon PlGF-2 the ability to bind heparin molecules. Recently, however, a novel variant of PlGF, termed PlGF-4, was reported (9Yang W. Ahn H. Hinrichs M. Torry R.J. Torry D.S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2003; 60: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This splice variant is believed to have the same sequence as PlGF-3 plus the heparin binding domain previously thought to be present only in PlGF-2. PlGF is secreted as a glycosylated homodimer. The most characteristic feature of PlGF is the presence of a cysteine-knot motif, consisting of an eight-residue ring formed by three intrachain and one interchain disulfide bond.The VEGF-A homodimer exerts its biological activities through activation of two distinct tyrosine kinase receptors: fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1 (Flt-1; also known as VEGFR-1) and the kinase domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase receptor (KDR/Flk-1; also known as VEGFR-2) (10Sato Y.

VEGF-A is central to several physiological as well as pathological conditions (11Ferrara N. Carver-Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W.

The PlGF homodimer, on the other hand, binds and induces auto-phosphorylation of only Flt-1 (13Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the knockout of Plgf does not affect development, reproduction, or normal postnatal life but impairs angiogenesis and arteriogenesis during pathological conditions such as tumor growth, ischemic conditions, and wound healing (5Carmeliet P.

Up-regulation of PlGF by endothelial cells leads to displacement of VEGF from VEGFR-1. As a result, increased amounts of VEGF are available to bind to the mitogenic response-inducing receptor, VEGFR-2. Administration of recombinant PlGF amplifies VEGF-driven angiogenesis in vivo, stimulating the formation of mature and durable vessels in the ischemic heart and enlarging collateral arterioles in the ischemic limb with marked perfusional and functional improvement (16Luttun A. Tjwa M. Moons L. Wu Y. Angelillo-Scherrer A. Liao F. Nagy J.A. Hooper A. Priller J. De Klerck B. Compernolle V. Daci E. Bohlen P. Dewerchin M. Herbert J.M. Fava R. Matthys P. Carmeliet G. Collen D.

Furthermore, the blocking of Flt-1 activity with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody suppresses neovascularization in tumors and ischemic retina as well as in angiogenesis and inflammatory joint destruction in autoimmune arthritis (16Luttun A.

Altogether, these data clearly indicate that the PlGF/Flt-1 pathway plays a central role in pathological angiogenesis (5Carmeliet P. Moons L. Luttun A. Vincenti V. Compernolle V. De Mol M. Wu Y.

Flk-1 is trans-phosphorylated by Flt-1 following activation by PlGF, indicating that PlGF can exert its action also through Flk-1 receptor (19Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A. Moons L. Lambrechts D. Kroll J. Plaisance S. De Mol M. Bono F. Kliche S. Fellbrich G. Ballmer-Hofer K. Maglione D. Mayr-Beyrle U. Dewerchin M. Dombrowski S. Stanimirovic D. Van Hummelen P. Dehio C.

Experiments have shown that PlGF and VEGF-A form heterodimers when co-expressed within the same cell (20DiSalvo J. Bayne M.L. Conn G. Kwok P.W. Trivedi P.G. Soderman D.D. Palisi T.M. Sullivan K.A.

The function of the PlGF/VEGF heterodimer is still under debate. Indeed, it has been shown that PlGF-1 antagonizes VEGF-driven angiogenesis and tumor growth by forming heterodimers that are functionally inactive (22Eriksson A. Cao R. Pawliuk R. Berg S.M. Tsang M.

However, the recombinant PlGF/VEGF heterodimer has been successfully used to stimulate both in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis (19Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A. Moons L. Lambrechts D.

Investig. 1996; 98: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, PlGF and VEGF-A activate Flt-1 in a different manner because only PlGF is able to stimulate the phosphorylation of specific Flt-1 tyrosine residues and to modulate the expression of distinct downstream target genes (19Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A. Moons L. Lambrechts D. Kroll J. Plaisance S. De Mol M. Bono F. Kliche S. Fellbrich G. Ballmer-Hofer K. Maglione D. Mayr-Beyrle U. Dewerchin M. Dombrowski S.

Despite functional diversity, the two molecules share 42% amino acid sequence identity, which in turn is reflected in the remarkable topological identity between VEGF-A and PlGF-1 (24Muller Y.A.

This study allows the generation of PlGF variants that can be employed as molecular tools to eventually dissect the relationship between PlGF, VEGF-A and related receptors. While this manuscript was in preparation, the three-dimensional structure of PlGF-1 in complex with Flt-1D2 was published (28Christinger H.W. Fuh G. De Vos A.M. Wiesmann C. J. Biol.

HUVEC cells (Cambrex) were grown in endothelial basal medium (EBM-2) containing endothelial growth factor supplements (EGM-2 bullet kit, Cambrex). The cDNAs coding for hPlGF-1 (29Maglione D. Guerriero V. Rambaldi M. Russo G. Persico M.G. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and hFlt-1 were cloned in the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector, and the resulting plasmids were named pchPlGF-1 and pchFlt-1, respectively.Construction of PlGF Variants—Eleven PlGF variants were obtained by PCR technique using pchPlGF-1 as template and appropriate primers (available upon request). For each mutant, PCR was performed using a couple of complementary primers mapping the region encoding the amino acid to be mutated to alanine and bearing the specific nucleotide modification (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). For the preparation of the variant with the double mutation, primers carrying both mutations were utilized. Primers were designed to use the same PCR conditions: 95 °C 30 s, 1 cycle; 95 °C 30 s, 55 °C 1 min, 72 °C 12 min, 16 cycles. Then the methylated template DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI for 60 min at 37 °C. The amplified DNA was purified and used to transform competent bacteria. In all cases, the plasmids were sequenced in both directions by the dideoxynucleotide method using SP6 and T7 standard primers. The following 10 PlGF-1 single residues were mutated to Ala: Asn-16, Pro-25, Gln-27, Cys-60, Asp-72, Glu-73, Asn-74, Asn-84, Pro-98, and Tyr-100. The eleventh PlGF-1 variant to be generated was the double mutant D72A/E73A.Transient Transfection and Selection of Stable Cell Lines—Transient transfections were performed in the HEK 293T cell line with either pchPlGF-1 vector or the plasmids carrying the PlGF-1 variants using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Cells were exposed to DNA precipitate for 16 h. The precipitate was removed, and fresh medium was added. After 24 h the medium was replaced with serum-free medium followed by another 24 h of incubation after which the medium was recovered, centrifuged to eliminate cell debris, and stored at -80 °C for further analysis.For stable transfections, the HEK 293 cells were used. After 48 h of transient expression, selection medium containing Geneticin (Invitrogen) at 0.7 mg/ml was added and replaced every 3 days. Among the isolated stable clones, the cell lines 293-hPlGF-1 (for wt PlGF-1) and 293-Q27A-PlGF-1, 293-D72A-PlGF-1, and 293-D72A/E73A-PlGF-1 (for the PlGF-1 variants) were selected for the expression of similar amount of the protein of interest, as determined by quantitative ELISAs. The 293-pcDNA3 cell line stably transfected with the empty vector was also established. The cell line 293-h-Flt-1 was selected for the maximal amount of hFlt-1 expression as determined by Western blot analysis.Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of conditioned cell media obtained from transient transfections, were precipitated overnight at -20 °C with two volumes of chilled acetone and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 3,000 × g. The pellets were suspended in SDS loading buffer, loaded onto a nonreducing 12% SDS-PAGE, and following electrophoresis, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene difluoride filters were first blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with 5% dried milk in TBT (25 mm Tris pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated for 1 h at RT with anti-human PlGF polyclonal antibody diluted in the blocking buffer at 1 μg/ml. After three washings of 10 min each with TBT, the filter was incubated for 1 h at RT with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with HRP and diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer. For detection, the chemiluminescent ECL reagent was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.ELISAs—For quantitative determination of PlGF-1 variants, anti-human PlGF polyclonal antibody, diluted at 1 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.5, was used to coat a 96-well plate, 100 μl/well, overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.004% Tween 20 (PBT), and their aspecific sites were blocked for 3 h at RT with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 200 μl/well. The wells were washed as described above, and recombinant PlGF, at concentrations ranging from 15.6 to 1,000 pg/ml, or the conditioned media from HEK-293T transfected with PlGF-1 variants were diluted in PBET (PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, 0.004% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed again, and biotinylated anti-human PlGF polyclonal antibody, diluted in PBET at 500 ng/ml, was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 1 h at RT. Wells were washed and incubated with a solution containing a preformed avidin and biotinylated HRP macromolecular complex (Vectastain elite ABC kit) for 1 h at RT. After the last wash, 100 μl of HRP substrate composed of 1 mg/ml of ortho-phenylenediamine in 50 mm citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5, 0.006% H2O2 was added and incubated for 40 min in the dark at RT. The reaction was blocked by adding 30 μl/well of 4 n H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad BenchMark). PlGF-1 variant concentrations were determined by interpolation of the standard curve using linear regression analysis.To determine the binding activity of PlGF-1 variants to Flt-1, a 96-well plate was coated with a soluble form of human Flt-1 (Flt-1/Fc chimera) at 0.5 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.5, 100 μl/well, overnight at RT. The plate was washed five times with PBT, and after the blocking of the aspecific sites of wells, aliquots of conditioned media were diluted in PBET and added at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 ng/ml. The binding reaction was performed for 1 h at 37 °C and 1 h at RT. Wells were washed as described and incubated with a biotinylated anti-human PlGF polyclonal antibody, 300 ng/ml in PBET, for 1 h at 37 °C and 1 h at RT. The detection was performed as described above. All of the ELISAs reported are the means of three independent experiments.Flt-1 Phosphorylation Analysis—Subconfluent 293-hFlt-1 cells were starved overnight in serum free medium. The medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was preincubated for 5 min with 100 μm Na3VO4 to inhibit endogenous phosphatase activity. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with wt PlGF-1 or with the PlGF variants Q27A, D72A, or D72A/E73A at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 ng/ml. Conditioned medium from 293-pcDNA3 cells was used as control. After stimulation, cells were first washed with pre-chilled 100 μm Na3VO4 and then lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm zinc acetate, 100 μm Na3VO4 and a mixture of protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were recovered and stored at -80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad reagent). To immunoprecipitate Flt-1, 5 μg/ml of a goat polyclonal antibody against human Flt-1, preincubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose, was added to 1 mg of protein extract and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the resin was recovered by centrifugation, washed once with complete lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer without detergent, and finally with Tris-buffered saline. The pellets were loaded on a reducing 8.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blot as described above.For the phosphotyrosine detection, mouse antibody against phosphotyrosine (anti-pY), diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, was used as primary antibody, and a goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody, diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer, was used as secondary antibody. The same filter was stripped with 0.2 n NaOH in Tris-buffered saline for 5 min at RT and used for Flt-1 detection obtained using a goat anti-human Flt-1 antibody diluted at 800 ng/ml in blocking buffer. Donkey anti-goat HRP-conjugated antibody, diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer, was used to detect the primary antibody.For phospho-Erk and Erk1-2 detection, mouse anti-pErk-1 and goat anti-Erk, were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Densitometry analyses to quantify the degree of Flt-1 and Erk phosphorylation were performed using ImageQuant version 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences).Capillary-like Tube Formation Assay—A 24-well plate was coated with Matrigel (230 μl/well) for 30 min at 37 °C. HUVECs (8 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 500 μl of EBM-2 in the presence of either wt PlGF-1 or PlGF-1 variants at concentrations ranging from 100 to 300 ng/ml. EGM-2 and EBM-2 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. After 6 h of incubation, capillary-like tube formation was examined under an inverted phase microscope. Cells were fixed with PBS containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde and photographed. To confirm the specificity of PlGF-1 activity, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (2.5 μg/ml) was preincubated with the conditioned media containing either wt PlGF-1 or D72A/E73A-PlGF-1 variant overnight at 4 °C. The assays were performed in triplicate.Chicken Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay—Fertilized chicken eggs were incubated under conditions of constant humidity at 37 °C. On the forth day of incubation, a window was opened in the egg shell after removal of 3-4 ml of albumen so that the developing CAM was kept detached from the shell. The window was sealed with a piece of glass, and the eggs were incubated at 37 °C. On the ninth day, pellets of 3 × 106 cells of stable clones over-expressing wt PlGF-1, the PlGF-1 variants Q27A, D72A, or D72A/E73A, or the stable clone transfected with the empty vector were applied on the chorioallantoic membrane of 10 eggs for each sample. The allantoic vessels around the cell pellets were counted under a stereomicroscope and photographed with a digital camera at the time of cell implants and 72 h later.RESULTSModel-based Selection of PlGF-1 Residues Involved in Flt-1 Recognition—The structure-based sequence alignment of PlGF and VEGF is shown in Fig. 1A. A structural model of PlGF-1/Flt-1D2 interaction was built based on the three-dimensional structure of PlGF-1 (25Iyer S. Leonidas D.D. Swaminathan G.J. Maglione D. Battisti M. Tucci M. Persico M.G.

The model predicted a similar type of interaction as that observed for VEGF-A in that the binding is essentially driven by hydrophobic interactions.

Recent work also has implicated Cdk5 in exocytosis and synaptic plasticity. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 modifies secretion in neuroendocrine cells, synaptosomes, and brain slices; however, the specific mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that dominant-negative inhibition of Cdk5 increases quantal size and broadens the kinetics of individual exocytotic events measured by amperometry in adrenal chromaffin cells. Conversely, Cdk5 overexpression narrows the kinetics of fusion, consistent with an increase in the extent of kiss-and-run exocytosis. Cdk5 inhibition also increases the total charge and current of catecholamine released during the amperometric foot, representing a modification of the conductance of the initial fusion pore connecting the granule and plasma membrane. We suggest that these effects are not attributable to an alteration in catecholamine content of secretory granules and therefore represent an effect on the fusion mechanism itself. Finally, mutational silencing of the Cdk5 phosphorylation site in Munc18, an essential protein of the late stages of vesicle fusion, has identical effects on amperometric spikes as dominant-negative Cdk5 but does not affect the amperometric feet. Cells expressing Munc18 T574A have increased quantal size and broader kinetics of fusion. These results suggest that Cdk5 could, in part, control the kinetics of exocytosis through phosphorylation of Munc18, but Cdk5 also must have Munc18-independent effects that modify fusion pore conductance, which may underlie a role of Cdk5 in synaptic plasticity.

Exocytosis, the process of vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release, is tightly regulated and requires inherent cellular mechanisms both to monitor and to adjust to changing secretory needs. Exocytosis proceeds through two alternative mechanisms: 1) full fusion, where the initial fusion pore expands, eventually collapsing into the target membrane and releasing all vesicular content, and 2) kiss-and-run exocytosis, where the fusion pore reverses, vesicle integrity is reformed, and partial release of content is achieved (1Alvarez de Toledo G.

Endocytosis also alternates between discrete modes of full membrane retrieval and kiss-and-run (6Kjaerulff O. Verstreken P. Bellen H.J. Nat.

Cdk5 is a potential candidate as a common regulator of the mode of endo- and exocytosis because it also is implicated in exocytosis. The total amount of secretion is promoted by Cdk5 in neuroendocrine cells (27Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacological inhibition increases secretion in synaptosomes (30Tomizawa K. Ohta J. Matsushita M. Moriwaki A. Li S.-T. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and striatal slices (31Chergui K. Svennigsson P. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2191-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether Cdk5 can regulate late events in exocytosis such as a switch to kiss-and-run.We investigated whether Cdk5 controls the mode of exocytosis by measuring the late stages of exocytosis using carbon fiber amperometry in adrenal chromaffin cells. Inhibition of Cdk5 by overexpression of a dominant-negative form (dnCdk5) increased quantal size and temporal parameters of individual amperometric spikes, indicative of a preferential switch toward full fusion events. Expression of dnCdk5 also enhanced flux through the initial fusion pore. Cdk5 overexpression shortened the kinetics of individual amperometric spikes, functionally analogous to that seen with protein kinase C phosphorylation of Munc18. Finally, overexpression of a Munc18 mutant (T574A) unphosphorylatable by Cdk5 mimicked the effects of dnCdk5 on amperometric spikes but not amperometric feet, supporting the hypothesis that Cdk5 regulation of exocytosis is not exclusively via phosphorylation of Munc18.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection of Chromaffin Cells—Freshly isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (32Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods: Intracellular Messengers. 20. Humana Press, Totawa, NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar) were plated on non-tissue culture-treated 10-cm petri dishes and left overnight at 37 °C. Non-attached cells were resuspended in growth medium at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Plasmids (encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein and one of Cdk5, dnCdk5, or T574A Munc18) were mixed and added at 20 μg/ml, and cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. Cells were immediately diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml with fresh growth medium and maintained in culture for 3–5 days. The cDNAs for Cdk5 and P35 were gifts from Dr. J. H. Wang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) and were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1). dnCdk5 (D144N) (28Lilja L. Yang S.-N. Webb D.-L. Juntti-Berggren J.

Wild type Munc18 was similarly used as template for site-directed mutagenesis to produce T574E and T574A mutants.Expression of Plasmids in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1 (controls) or the indicated plasmid using 3 μl of FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 72 h, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of SDS dissociation buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a monoclonal antibody against Cdk5 (Oncogene Research Products) or against Munc18 (BD Biosciences). For subsequent blotting for Hsc70, the blot was stripped for 30 min (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycine, pH 2.5) and probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against Hsp70 (Sigma).Secretion of Growth Hormone from Cell Populations—The secretion assay was performed as described previously (33Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were maintained in culture in 24-well trays at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were transiently co-transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with 1 μg each of the indicated plasmids and a plasmid encoding growth hormone (GH). For transfection with Cdk5 and P35, 0.5 μg of each plasmid was used with 1 μg of GH plasmid. After removal of culture medium, cells were washed in Krebs buffer and permeabilized for 6 min with 20 μm digitonin. Secretion was then induced by challenging cells with either 0 μm or 10 μm free Ca2+ for 15 min. Buffer samples and cells were then assayed for GH levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Binding of Recombinant Proteins to GST-Syntaxins Using a Microtitre Plate Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Wild type Munc18 and mutants (T574A and T574E) were expressed and purified as full-length His-tagged proteins. The cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin was expressed as a GST fusion protein.Binding assays were performed using the following protocol. Briefly, GST-syntaxin was bound to a glutathione-coated 96-well plate at a concentration of 200 ng/well in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The primary protein was removed, and the plate was washed three times with 200 μl of PBST (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.02% Triton)/well. His-tagged wild type Munc18 or mutant (T574E or T574A) were added in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) at various concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 nm). Plates were again incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary protein was removed, and the plate was washed three times with 200 μl of PBST. Primary antibody to the His tag was then added to each well at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was removed, and the plate was washed three times with 200 μl of PBST. Plate wells were then incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-mouse IgG; 1:5,000 dilution in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody was removed, and the plate was washed as before. Plate wells were next incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:250 dilution in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was removed, and the plate was washed as before. Wells were then incubated in 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 5–10 min until intense blue color was visible, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μlof2 m HCl, which produced a yellow color. The extent of binding of the Munc18 (or mutant) to syntaxin was determined by measuring A450 using a Molecular Devices plate reader. Extent of binding was normalized to maximal binding.Amperometric Recording—Electrophysiological recording conditions were as described previously (11Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F.

Briefly, cells were incubated in bath buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5), and a 5 μm-diameter carbon fiber was positioned in direct contact with a target cell. Exocytosis in cells was stimulated with a permeabilization/stimulation buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 μm digitonin, and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 6.5) pressure-ejected from a glass pipette on the opposite side of the cell. Amperometric responses were monitored with a VA-10 amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany) and saved to computer using Axoscope 8 (Axon Instruments). Experiments were carried out in parallel on control and transfected cells from the same batch of cells. Transfected cells were identified by expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Previous studies in our laboratory have established that 95% of cells co-express proteins from both plasmids in the transfection (11Barclay J.W. Craig T.J. Fisher R.J. Ciufo L.F. Evans G.J.O.

Recordings were alternated between untransfected and transfected cells using the same carbon fiber to eliminate any effects of interfiber variability. For all analyses, data were derived from cells from multiple cell preparations.Analysis—Amperometric data were exported from the Axoscope and subsequently analyzed using Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Spikes were selected for analysis, provided that the spike amplitude was greater than 40 pA, to remove any confounding effects of diffusion by selecting fusion events not occurring directly underneath the end of the carbon fiber. Spike feet were defined from foot onset (time at which the amperometric current rose 2.5× above noise level) to spike onset (time at which the amperometric spike current began to rise, determined by differentiation of the amperometric trace). All of the data are shown as mean ± S.E. or as a box plot of median values. Significance was tested using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test specifically because the data were nonparametrically distributed; thus, this was the appropriate statistical test.RESULTSEffect of Cyclin-dependent Kinase 5 on Total Secretion from PC12 Cells—Overexpression of P25, an activator protein of Cdk5, in adrenal chromaffin cells enhances secretion of growth hormone induced by 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP) (27Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4027-4035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DMPP is a nicotinic receptor agonist, and therefore induced secretion is dependent on levels of receptor activation and calcium influx, as well as late stage mechanisms of exocytosis. It has subsequently been shown that Cdk5 phosphorylates P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels that are known to be present in neurosecretory cells and that this phosphorylation can alter calcium influx (30Tomizawa K. Ohta J. Matsushita M. Moriwaki A. Li S.-T. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the effect of Cdk5 on total amounts of exocytosis was independent of calcium entry by assaying secretion of growth hormone in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells (33Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding Cdk5, its activator protein P35, or a dominant-negative mutant, D144N (dnCdk5), along with a plasmid encoding growth hormone to allow assay of secretion from transfected cells. For all three constructs, overexpression of the protein had no effect on total levels of calcium-induced secretion (Fig. 1). To test the hypothesis that a concomitant increase in both Cdk5 and P35 was required to enhance secretion, both plasmids were co-transfected into cells with growth hormone, and the resultant extent of total secretion was assayed. Co-expression of Cdk5 and P35 also failed to elicit any increase in total growth hormone secretion (Fig. 1).Effect of Cdk5 on Individual Secretory Events in Adrenal Chromaffin Cells—To test whether Cdk5 has an effect on the dynamics of individual secretory events, mammalian expression vectors encoding either wild type Cdk5 or dnCdk5 were transfected into cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Individual exocytotic events were monitored by carbon fiber amperometry following exposure of the cells to a mixture of digitonin and calcium to directly activate exocytosis (Fig. 2). Each transient current spike recorded by the carbon fiber electrode in amperometric mode represents a single secretory event. Previous work has shown that use of digitonin permeabilization does not modify the characteristics of exocytotic events in chromaffin cells (36Graham M.E. O'Callaghan D.W. McMahon H.T. Burgoyne R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7124-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 37Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Holz R.W. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18329-18335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of a cell-permeabilized system circumvents any subsidiary upstream effect on receptor activation or calcium channel kinetics. Recordings were alternated between untransfected cells and cells overexpressing either Cdk5 (Fig. 2A, i) or dnCdk5 (Fig. 2B, i) within the same dish to remove any potential effects of carbon fiber variability. Consistent with a lack of effect of Cdk5 on total amounts of secretion, the frequency of amperometric spikes was unaffected by either construct (Fig. 2, A, ii, and B, ii). Furthermore, the frequency distribution of individual fusion events did not appear to be altered by expression of Cdk5 or dnCdk5 (Fig. 2, A, iii, and B, iii).Fig. 2The number of exocytotic events as assayed by amperometry is not altered by overexpression of (A) Cdk5 or (B) dnCdk5 (D144N).i, exemplary amperometric responses from adrenal chromaffin cells following addition of digitonin and Ca2+ of both control and transfected cells. ii, amperometric spike frequency is unaltered by Cdk5 or dnCdk5. Amperometric spikes were analyzed from (A) 28 control (n = 471 spikes) and 27 Cdk5-transfected (n = 342 spikes) cells and from (B) 21 control (n = 312 spikes) and 21 dnCdk5-transfected (n = 327 spikes) cells. iii, overexpression of Cdk5 or dnCdk5 did not have any apparent effect on the frequency time course of amperometric spikes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although the total number of exocytotic events and rate of secretion were unaffected by Cdk5, closer examination of individual spike parameters revealed that Cdk5 had a critical effect on the kinetics of single fusion events. Although the total charge of amperometric spikes was unaffected in cells overexpressing Cdk5 (Fig. 3A), the enzyme significantly increased the speed of individual spikes, resulting in a reduced amperometric spike half-width, rise time, and fall time (Fig. 3, B–D). Cdk5 is an endogenously expressed enzyme, and thus, overexpression of wild type enzyme may not be expected to reveal the full potential function of Cdk5. This possibility was tested directly by overexpressing dnCdk5, which should inhibit endogenously active kinase. In opposition to the effects of Cdk5, dnCdk5 increased the quantal size of individual secretory events and broadened the amperometric spike. The amperometric charge was 22% larger in cells overexpressing dnCdk5 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the kinetics of individual fusion events were significantly slowed, resulting in a longer half-width, rise time, and fall time of amperometric spikes (Fig. 4, B–D).Fig. 3Overexpression of Cdk5 speeds up individual exocytotic events.A, Cdk5 did not affect the average amperometric spike charge. Cdk5 overexpression did, however, shorten the timing of amperometric spikes. The half-width (B), rise time (C), and fall time (D) of amperometric spikes were all significantly decreased in cells expressing Cdk5. Spike parameters and statistical comparison were taken from the same batch of cells as presented in Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Dominant-negative inhibition of Cdk5 increases quantal size and slows individual exocytotic events.A, dnCdk5 significantly increased amperometric charge. dnCdk5 has the opposite effect to Cdk5 on the temporal parameters of amperometry. The half-width (B), rise time (C), and fall time (D) of amperometric spikes were all increased. Spike parameters and statistical comparison were taken from the same batch of cells as presented in Fig. 2B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An effect on the kinetics of exocytosis may be a consequence of an alteration of the amplitude of individual amperometric spikes; however, there was no effect of either Cdk5 or dnCdk5 on this parameter (Fig. 5, A and B). The contrasting effects of the two constructs on individual fusion events were also not a consequence of differential expression efficiency, as both constructs are expressed at similar levels over endogenous Cdk5 when transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 5C). Cellular protein levels were not affected by transfection, as evident from a reprobing of the blot with a monoclonal antibody directed against Hsc70 (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5Changes to quantal charge and amperometric spike timing are not the result of an alteration to spike amplitude. The amplitude of individual amperometric spikes is unaltered in cells overexpressing either (A) Cdk5 or (B) dnCdk5. C, there was no difference in expression efficiency for either Cdk5 or dnCdk5 constructs. Expression efficiency was detected by Western blotting of transfected HeLa cells, as expression efficiency in chromaffin cells is too low to distinguish from background expression. Note low background expression of endogenous Cdk5 observed in controls. There was no difference in the level of an endogenous protein standard, Hsc70, between transfected or untransfected cells. Control cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of Cdk5 on Fusion Pore Dynamics—Transient current prespikes preceding the amperometric spike proper are termed feet and represent the steady-state flux of neurotransmitter released through a stable fusion pore (38Chow R.H. von Ruden L.

To assess neurotransmitter flux through the fusion pore prior to full release, the feet of the amperometric spikes were analyzed (for examples of amperometric feet, see Fig. 6A). Amperometric feet are not ubiquitous events, instead occurring in ∼10–30% of spikes (38Chow R.H. von Ruden L. Neher E.

In order to clarify the role of Gi2 in this site, we first administered pertussis toxin by an exo-utero manipulation method into the lateral ventricle of mouse brain at embryonic day 14.5. Examination at embryonic day 18.5 revealed that pertussis toxin-injected embryos had brains with thinner cerebral cortices, made up of fewer constituent cells. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling revealed fewer numbers of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the cerebral cortices of pertussis toxin-injected embryos, suggesting impaired proliferation of neuroepithelial cells. Next we cultured neural progenitor cells from rat embryonic brains and evaluated the mitogenic effects of agonists for several Gi-coupled receptors that are known to be expressed in the ventricular zone. Among agonists tested, endothelin most effectively stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in the presence of fibronectin, via the endothelin-B receptor. This was associated with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and pertussis toxin partially inhibited both endothelin-stimulated DNA synthesis and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Injection of endothelin-3 into the ventricle of embryonic brains increased numbers of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the cerebral cortex, whereas injection of an endothelin-B receptor antagonist decreased them. These findings indicate that Gi2 mediates signaling from receptors such as the endothelin-B receptor to maintain mitogenic activity in the neural progenitor cells of developing brain.

The generation of neurons is regulated by several diffusible signals including the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), 1The abbreviations used are: FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PTX, pertussis toxin; ET, endothelin; E, embryonic day; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SFM, serum-free medium. neurotrophin-3, and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which bind receptor-tyrosine kinases (1Ghosh A.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 240-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other signals caused by binding of an agonist for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (6Li B-S. Ma W. Zhang L. Barker J.L. Stenger D.A. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as gp130 ligands (7Hatta T. Moriyama K. Nakashima K. Taga T. Otani H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5516-5524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been also shown to stimulate DNA synthesis in neural precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Receptor-tyrosine kinases and GPCRs can both activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and there is evidence that FGF-2 utilizes a G protein to transmit signals to the MAPK pathway (8Fedorov Y.V. Jones N.C. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins function as signal transducers from receptors in the cell membrane to intracellular effectors. They consist of three subunits (α, β, γ) and are classified into four subfamilies, Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 (9Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The α-subunits of Gi family G proteins, including Gi, Go, transducin, and gustducin, are specifically ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin (PTX) to become unable to couple with GPCRs. Therefore, PTX serves as a useful tool to explore Gi-mediated signal transduction both in vitro and in vivo. The α- and/or βγ-subunits of Gi and Go directly regulate adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and K+ and Ca2+ channels. βγ-subunits released from Gi/o indirectly stimulate ERK (9Hepler J.R.

In early embryonic brains, Gαi2 and Gγ5 are highly expressed in the ventricular zone but their levels decrease with development (12Morishita R. Shinohara H. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. J.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, levels of Gαo and Gγ2, which are limited to the marginal zone, increase with the addition of newly generated neuronal cells from the ventricular zone (12Morishita R. Shinohara H. Ueda H.

Therefore, the expression of Gi2 (Gαi2βγ5) seems to be consistently involved in neurogenesis, both in embryonic and postnatal brains. To clarify the role of Gi2 in the developing brain, we first injected PTX into the lateral ventricle of mouse embryos, and found suppression of neuroepithelial cell proliferation. Next, an in vitro survey of several Gi-coupled receptor agonists revealed that endothelins (ETs) have potent mitogenic activity for neural progenitor cells via their action on ET-B receptors, and such an effect of ET was confirmed in vivo. Animal Preparation—Each female mouse (Jcl: ICR) or rat (Sprague-Dawley) was mated with a male overnight and noon of the day to confirm a vaginal plug was designated as embryonic day (E) 0.5. All the treatments of animals and the experimental procedures were conducted following the guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals, Mie University School of Medicine and the Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center. Exo-utero Microinjection—PTX or the vehicle was injected into the ventricular cavity of developing mouse embryos at E14.5 with the exo-utero microinjection method, as previously reported (7Hatta T. Moriyama K. Nakashima K. Taga T. Otani H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5516-5524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Muneoka K. Wanek N. Bryant S.V. J. Exp. Zool. 1986; 239: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In short, pregnant mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (70 mg/kg body weight) and injected with 1.4 mg of ritodrine (Sigma) dissolved in saline solution (0.1 ml) to relax the myometrium. The abdominal wall was cut, and the uterus gently pulled out of the peritoneal cavity. The uterine walls were cut longitudinally and 4-6 embryos were selected for injection, while other embryos were removed. By using glass pipettes (60-80-μm in diameter) under a binocular microscope, 1 μl of PTX (0.1 μg, Calbiochem) or the vehicle was injected into the ventricular cavity of the experimental and the control groups, respectively. After the uterus was returned to within the body, ∼2 ml of warmed Hank's solution were gently injected, to prevent unexpected adhesions within the peritoneal cavity, and the abdominal wall was sutured. Then the animals were returned to the mouse room after confirmation of recovery from the anesthesia. The embryos were fixed at E18.5 for counting total cells in the cerebral cortices. To label proliferating cells, intraperitoneal injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 50 mg/kg of body weight) was performed on pregnant females at E16.5, and the animals were sacrificed 2 h after BrdUrd injection to collect embryos. For examination of the effect of ET, 1 μl of ET-3 (10 μm), BQ788 (1 mm), or vehicle was injected into the ventricle of embryos at E14.5, BrdUrd was injected at E15.5, and the animals were sacrificed 2 h later. To evaluate whether PTX could affect cell migration of newly generated neural cells, BrdUrd was administered 3-4 h prior to the injection of PTX or vehicle at E14.5, followed by the fixation of embryos at E16.5. Tissue Preparation for Histology—The embryos were fixed in toto in a mixture of 10% formalin and 70% methanol overnight. After observation for external malformations, their brains were resected and processed for embedding in paraffin. Serial coronal sections (6-μm thick) were prepared and every tenth section was stained with cresyl violet (Nissl staining). BrdUrd Immunohistochemistry—Sections of the parietal cortex (at the level of the supraoptic nucleus) were deparaffinized and treated with 1% H2O2 in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and with 2 n HCl for 2 h at room temperature to denature the DNA. After the sections were treated with 10% horse serum in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) for 10 min, they were incubated with mouse anti-BrdUrd antibodies (1:100, Roche Diagnostics) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 with 0.5 m NaCl at 4 °C overnight, followed by visualization of binding sites with diaminobenzidine through the ABC method (Elite ABC system, 1:100, with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibodies, 1:200; Vector Laboratories). Cell Counts—For cell counts, sections of parietal cortex (at the level of the supraoptic nucleus) were photographed and developed at the final magnification of ×280. For each cerebral cortex, Nissl stain-positive cells and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in ten different columnar zones (about 35-μm wide) extending from the ventricular lumen to the pial surface of the cerebral cortex. The choice of imaging areas and cell counts were performed blindly. Detection of Apoptotic Cells—Sections close to those used for BrdUrd immunostaining were subjected to terminal deoxytransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, which was performed with an in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Samples were analyzed by following immunostaining with peroxidase conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody and reaction with diaminobenzidine. Primary Culture of Neural Progenitor Cells of Rats—Neural progenitor cells were cultured according to the method described previously (20Zhu G. Mehler M.F. Zhao J. Yung S.Y. Kessler J.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with modifications. Forebrains of rat embryos at E13.5 were dissected and dissociated by incubation with 0.2% trypsin for 15 min followed by repeated trituration. To remove contaminating fibroblasts tightly attached to the dishes, dissociated cells were seeded onto 100-mm uncoated culture dishes in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum in serum-free medium (SFM). After 4 h incubation, cells floating or lightly attaching to fibroblasts were collected for seeding to culture dishes coated with poly(2-hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate) (Sigma, 1.6 mg/cm2) (21Torii M. Matsuzaki F. Osumi N. Kaibuchi K. Nakamura S. Casarosa S. Guillemot F. Nakafuku M.

Refreshment with a half volume of the medium was performed at 3 days. The SFM consisted of DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and nutrient additives including 0.01% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V), 30 nm selenium, 15 nm triiodo-l-thyronine, 40 nm biotin, 25 μg/ml apo-transferrin, 1 nm hydrocortisone, and 25 μg/ml insulin (all of these reagents were from Sigma). Neurospheres were dissociated by initial incubation with 0.05% trypsin for 10 min followed by repeated trituration. Dissociated cells were plated onto dishes precoated with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) plus or minus 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Nacalai Tesque), propagated in SFM with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and used for the various experiments. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—This was performed essentially as described previously (6Li B-S. Ma W. Zhang L. Barker J.L. Stenger D.A. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated progenitor cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded to 12-well plates and cultured for 48 h in SFM in the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and then for 24 h in SFM without FGF-2 to decrease the basal levels of proliferation. PTX (20 ng/ml) was added for the last 6 h. Exposure to agonists was for 24 h, with 0.2 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine introduced for the last 6 h of the incubation at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 5% trichloroacetic acid was added for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed once with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and a mixture of 0.1 m NaOH, and 1% SDS was added for 10 min. Samples were transferred to scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was counted with a Beckman LS6000IC scintillation counter. The agonists and antagonists used were as follows: ET-1 and ET-3 (Peptide Institute), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, Cayman Chemical), carbachol (Sigma), dopamine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), U-69593 (Biomol Research Laboratories), BQ123 (Research Biochemicals International), BQ788 (Sigma), and U0126 (Calbiochem). Cell Proliferation—Dissociated progenitor cells (4 × 105/dish) were plated to 35-mm dishes and cultured for 24 h in SFM in the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and then for 24 h in SFM without FGF-2. PTX (20 ng/ml) was added for the last 6 h. Various agonists were then introduced with incubation for a further 3 days. Cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with 0.2% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C, and counted using a hematocytometer. Phosphorylation of ERK—Dissociated progenitor cells (5 × 105/dish) were plated to 35-mm dishes and cultured for 48 h in SFM in the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and then for 24 h in SFM without FGF-2. PTX (20 ng/ml), and inhibitors were added for the last 6 h and the last 30 min, respectively. At various times after addition of agonists, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1% SDS in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The amount of protein in each lysate was quantified using a micro bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The lysates (15 μg of proteins) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated or unphosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoblotting was performed employing a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and densitometry was achieved using a LAS-1000 (Fujifilm). Immunofluorescence Staining—Dissociated progenitor cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips within 35-mm dishes and cultured in SFM with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 for 48 h (undifferentiated cells) or for 24 h followed by further incubation in SFM without FGF-2 for 7 days (differentiated cells). To examine ET-induced differentiation, progenitor cells were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine plus fibronectin and cultured for 48 h in SFM in the presence of 10 nm ET-3, with 10 μm BrdUrd introduced for the last 24 h of the incubation. Cells were further cultured without ET-3 for 3 or 6 days. Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, and blocked in 10% goat serum in TBS for 1 h. Fixed cells were incubated with antibodies to Gαi2 (rabbit, 5 μg/ml) (22Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Gγ5 (rabbit, 10 μg/ml) (18Asano T. Morishita R. Ohashi K. Nagahama M. Miyake T. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), nestin (mouse, 1:2000, BD Pharmingen), β-tubulin type III (mouse, 1:400, Chemicon), glial fibrillary acidic protein (mouse, 1:600, Sigma), α-smooth muscle actin (mouse, 1:2000, Sigma), and BrdUrd (rat, 1:500, Harlan Sera-Lab) for 3 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS containing 1% goat serum, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG, or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rat IgG (1:400, Molecular Probes), for 1 h at room temperature. For differentiated cells after removal of FGF-2, incubation was with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for 5 min. After applying the coverslip, slides were examined under a laser-scanning microscope (FLUOVIEW, Olympus) equipped for fluorescence or an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 m, Carl Zeiss). Evaluation of PTX-mediated ADP-Ribosylation of G Proteins in the Cerebral Cortex of Mouse Brains or Cultured Cells—Two days after injection of PTX or vehicle solution at E14.5, embryos were collected from dams and whole brains without the cerebellum were dissected. Cultured neural progenitor cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml PTX at 37 °C for 6 h and washed with PBS. These samples were kept frozen at -80 °C until analysis. Frozen brains were homogenized at 0 °C in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 20 volumes (v/w) of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 20,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the membrane fraction. The brain membranes or neural progenitor cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% sodium cholate, sonicated and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant, referred to as the cholate extract, was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 μm [32P]NAD, 10 mm thymidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mml-α-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine with 10 μg/ml PTX, which had been preactivated by incubation with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), then aliquots (1.5 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, with subsequent autoradiography using x-ray film (RX-U, Fujifilm). The levels of Gαi2, Gαo, and Gβ proteins in cholate extracts were determined by immunoblotting with antibodies to Gαi2 (22Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Gαo (16Asano T. Semba R. Kamiya N. Ogasawara N. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Gβ (22Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), respectively. Statistical Analysis—All results are given as mean ± S.E. values. The significance of group differences was analyzed with the Student's t test for single comparisons, and with one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Effects of PTX on the Developing Mouse Brain—To block the function of Gi2 in the ventricular zone, PTX was injected into the lateral ventricle of mice at E14.5. When the embryos were fixed at E18.5, there was no significant decrease in body weight and crown-rump length of PTX-injected embryos compared with controls (Fig. 1, A and C). However, PTX-injected embryos showed a decrease in the head vault compared with those of controls (Fig. 1A) and the cerebral cortices taken from the PTX-injected embryos were smaller than those of control embryos (Fig. 1, B and C). When they were taken out at E19.5 (full term), most PTX-injected mice could hardly start respiration and died. To confirm the effect of PTX, ADP-ribosylation of endogenous Gi/o proteins was evaluated in cholate extracts from PTX- or vehicle-injected brains at E16.5 using [32P]NAD and exogenous PTX. The cholate extracts from PTX-injected brains showed much weaker 32P-labeled bands (34 ± 5% of the control, n = 6) than those from control brains, indicating that a large proportion of Gi/o proteins had already been ADP-ribosylated by the injection of PTX at E14.5 (Fig. 1D). Immunoblot analyses of the same extracts revealed levels of total Gαi2 and Gαo proteins in PTX-injected brains to be somewhat decreased (Gαi2, 72 ± 3% of the control; Gαo, 81 ± 4% of the control, n = 6; Fig. 1D), suggesting that the degradation of ADP-ribosylated Gα subunits is faster than that of unmodified ones. In contrast, the levels of Gβ (Fig. 1D, 101 ± 4% of the control, n = 6) and PTX-insensitive Gαq/11 proteins (101 ± 9% of the control, n = 6) were unchanged by PTX treatment. Brains of PTX-injected Embryos Have Thinner Cerebral Cortices with Fewer Constituent Cells and Fewer BrdUrd-positive Cells—Histological studies revealed that the cerebral cortex from PTX-injected embryos at E18.5 was thinner than those from controls (Fig. 2A) and the total cell number in this zone was significantly reduced (Fig. 2B). To label proliferating cells, BrdUrd was administrated 2 days after PTX injection, and embryos were fixed 2 h later. Immunostaining with an antibody against BrdUrd showed a decreased number of BrdUrd-positive cells in the cerebral cortex of PTX-injected embryos (Fig. 2, C and D). TUNEL staining of close sections revealed that injection of PTX did not significantly increase cell death in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 2, E and F). Moreover, PTX seems not to affect the migration of neural cells, because there was no significant decrease in the number of neural cells labeled with BrdUrd before PTX injection and migrated from the ventricular zone into the cortical plate (control, 39.8 ± 8.7; PTX, 35.5 ± 9.4 in the area shown by box in Fig. 2F, n = 4). These results suggest that Gi2 mediates signaling from GPCRs to maintain proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the developing brain. To investigate which receptors are coupled to Gi2 to stimulate neurogenesis, we next performed in vitro experiments using neural progenitor cells dissociated from rat embryonic brains. Characterization of Cultured Neural Progenitor Cells—Proliferative progenitor neurospheres were generated from forebrains of E13.5 rats, dissociated, and cultured in the presence of FGF-2. The majority of cells were nestin-positive, indicating that they retained properties of undifferentiated cells (Fig. 3A). These cells also expressed Gαi2 and Gγ5, as observed previously in the ventricular zone of embryonic brain (Fig. 3A) (12Morishita R. Shinohara H. Ueda H. Kato K. Asano T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2369-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among other PTX-sensitive Gα subunits, Gαo was expressed at a low level in these cells, but Gαi1 and Gαi3 were not detectable by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). After withdrawal of FGF-2 for 7 days, many cells expressed neuron-specific antigen (β-tubulin type III) or an astrocyte marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein) (Fig. 3B), in good agreement with the previously established observation that neural progenitor cells can differentiate either into neurons or glial cells. ETs Increase Proliferation of Neural Progenitor Cells through Gi2—Several Gi-coupled receptors have been found to be expressed in the ventricular zone of developing brains, including ET-B (24Tsaur M.-L. Wan Y.-C. Lai F.-P. Cheng H.-F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), LPA (25Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), muscarinic acetylcholine (6Li B-S. Ma W. Zhang L. Barker J.L. Stenger D.A. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), D3 dopamine (26Diaz J. Ridray S. Mignon V.N.G. Schwartz J.-C. Sokoloff P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4282-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and κ-opioid receptors (27Leslie F.M. Chen Y. Winzer-Serhan U.H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether agonists for these receptors might stimulate the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in neural progenitor cells, and compared the results with those for FGF-2, known to be a major mitogen which binds tyrosine kinase receptors. Among the agonists for Gi-coupled receptors, ET-3 was most effective, while LPA also significantly increased the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (Fig. 4). However, such stimulatory effects were not observed with the other agonists such as carbachol, dopamine, and U-69593 (an agonist for the κ-opioid receptor). In these experiments, we also found that ET-3-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation was greatly enhanced in the presence of fibronectin, but the FGF-2-mediated effect was not so augmented (Fig. 4). Laminin, another extracellular matrix component, was similarly effective (data not shown). Therefore, cell culture was carried out on dishes coated with poly-l-lysine plus fibronectin unless otherwise described. ET-1 and ET-3 revealed a similar dose-dependence for stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation with submaximal effects at 1 nm (Fig. 5A). The stimulatory effects were blocked by an ET-B receptor antagonist BQ788, but not by an ET-A receptor antagonist BQ123 (28Douglas S.A. Meek T.D. Ohlstein E.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 313-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the effects of ETs are mediated by the ET-B receptor. Because ET receptors are known to couple not only with Gi but also with Gq/11 and G13 (29Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kitamura K. Shiraishi N. Singer W.D. Handlogten M.E. Tomita K. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C930-C937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined whether Gi is indeed involved in stimulation of DNA synthesis. PTX treatment of neural progenitor cells partially decreased ET-3-enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5C), whereas the toxin completely ADP-ribosylated endogenous Gi/o proteins (Fig. 5C, inset), suggesting that both Gi2 and PTX-insensitive G proteins mediate ET-stimulated DNA synthesis. Pertussis toxin did not influence FGF-2-stimulated [3H]t"

To identify the motifs that direct the targeting of kidney NBC1 to basolateral membrane, wild type and various carboxyl-terminally truncated kidney NBC1 mutants were generated, fused translationally in-frame to GFP, and transiently expressed in kidney epithelial cells. GFP was linked to the NH2 terminus of NBC1, and labeling was examined by confocal microscopy. Full-length (1035 aa) and mutants with the deletion of 3 or 20 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end of NBC1 (lengths 1032 and 1015 aa, respectively) showed strong and exclusive targeting on the basolateral membrane. However, the deletion of 26 amino acid residues from the COOH-terminal end (length 1010 aa) resulted in retargeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane. Expression studies in oocytes demonstrated that the NBC1 mutant with the deletion of 26 amino acid residues from the COOH-terminal end is functional. Additionally, the deletion of the last 23 amino acids or mutation in the conserved residue Phe at position 1013 on the COOH-terminal end demonstrated retargeting to the apical membrane.

In all of the tissues examined to date, NBC1 is found to be located on the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells (4Soleimani M. Burnham C.E. J. Membr.

To identify possible motifs that are responsible for the targeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane, various COOH-terminally truncated NBC1 mutants were generated, fused translationally in-frame to GFP, and transiently expressed in cultured kidney epithelial cells. The results demonstrate that the deletion of amino acid residues 1010-1015 with the sequence QQPFLS results in the retargeting of NBC1 preferentially to the apical membrane. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved amino acid residue Phe at position 1013 within this domain recapitulates the retargeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane. The significance of the results will be discussed. Construction of GFP-NBC1 Full Length and Mutants—The full length and various COOH-terminally truncated NBC1 mutants were generated by PCR using the human full-length NBC1 DNA (3257 bp and 1035 aa residues) as a template (GenBank™ accession number AF007216). The truncated NBC1 proteins have COOH-terminal deletions of 3, 20, 26, or 50 amino acid residues and are designated as NBC1 CD3, CD20, CD26, or CD50, respectively. The resulting wild type and various COOH-terminally truncated NBC1 mutants were amplified and fused translationally in-frame to GFP by cloning into pcDNA3.1/NH2-terminal GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Full-length kNBC1 was amplified using the following primers: t986730, 5′-GAATTCGAGATGGCACTGAAAATGTGGAAGGG-3′ (sense), and t968120, 5′-AGCGGCCGCCTCAGCATGATGTGTGGCGTTCAAGGAATGT-3′ (antisense). These primers were used to generate full-length NBC1 cDNA from plasmid cytomegalovirus intron neomycin NBC1 plasmid (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This resulted in the expression of GFP-NBC1 fusion protein with the GFP fusing to the NH2 terminus of kNBC1 (GFP-NBC1). Using a similar approach, primer 1 (sense, above) and primer 3 (t80925, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAGTGGCGTTCAAGGAATGTTGGTGA-3′ (antisense)) were used to generate the NBC1-CD3 cDNA. This resulted in the expression of the GFP-NBC1 fusion protein, which coded the truncated NBC1 (CD3), with the deletion of the last three amino acid residues on the carboxyl-terminal end. For CD20, CD26, and CD50 (deletion of the last 20, 26, and 50 amino acid residues, respectively), the following (antisense) primers were used: CD20 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAGCAGCTTAGGAAAGGTTGCTGTTCCATGATGTCCATTGGAAT-3′; CD26 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAGCAGCTTAGGAAAGGTTGCTATTCCATGATGTCCATTGGAAT-3′; and CD50 3′ primer, 5′-TCAGTCACTGTCCAGACTTCCCTTCTT-3′. In separate experiments, we also generated NBC1 CD67 construct (67 amino acid deletion) using 3′ primer, 5′-CTATTTCTTGTCCTTTTCTGGAATGAC-3′. For the last series of experiments, we generated NBC1 CD23 construct (23 amino acid deletion) using 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAAGGTTGCTGTTCCATGATGTCCATTGGAAT-3′. The sense primer in all of the mutants was the same as in full-length NBC1 (see above). The diagram shown in Scheme 1 depicts the schematic constructs of human NBC1 truncated mutants. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single mutation of the conserved residue Phe at position 1013 was performed according to established methods and using manufacturer's instruction (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit). The primers used to mutate Phe to Ala at position 1013 were 5′-GACATCATGGAACAGCAACCTGCCCTAAGCGATAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTATCGCTTAGGGCAGGTTGCTGTTCGATGATGTC-3′. Transient Expression of GFP-NBC1 and GFP-NBC1 Mutants in MDCK Cells—MDCK cells were transiently transfected with the GFPNBC1 and GFP-NBC1 mutants and studied 48 h later according to established methods (2Burnham C.E.

Cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected at 80% confluence using 1 μg of DNA and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection efficiency was monitored using pCMV-SPORT β-galactosidase plasmid as control. A change in cell color in response to X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) addition was used as a marker for β-galactosidase expression. All of the cells were colabeled with peanut lectin or phalloidin as markers of apical membrane labeling or cell membrane labeling. Confocal Microscopy and Immunofluorescence Labeling—MDCK cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed 20 min with 3% formaldehyde in PBS, and washed three more times with PBS. Afterward, cells were permeabilized for 4 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed three times with PBS, and costained with PNA-lectin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or the selective F-actin dye TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma). Afterward, cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted on glass slides in Slow Fade with DAPI (Molecular Probes). Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Both Z-line and Z-stack images were obtained using the LSM 5 Image software (14Toledo M.S. Suzuki E. Hand K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34655-34664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to analyze the membrane targeting of GFP-NBC1 full-length and mutant constructs. Functional Expression of Full-length GFP-NBC1 and GFP-NBC1 Mutants in Oocytes—Stage IV-V oocytes were isolated as previously described and used for expression studies according to established methods (15Xu J. Wang Z.H. Barone S. Petrovic M. Amlal H. Conforti L. Petrovic S. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F41-F50Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The capped GFP-NBC1 (full-length), GFP-NBC1 CD26 (with the deletion of 26 amino acid residues at the COOH-terminal end), and GFP only (no NBC insert) cRNAs were generated using mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 Kit (from Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 50 nl of cRNA (0.5 μg/μl) was injected with a Drummond 510 microdispenser via a sterile glass pipette with a tip of 20-30 μm. After injection, the oocytes were maintained in a solution of the following composition (in mm): 96 NaCl; 2.0 KCl; 1.0 MgCl2; 1.8 CaCl2; 5 HEPES; 2.5 sodium pyruvate; 0.5 theophylline; 100 units/ml penicillin; and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.5. Injected oocytes were stored in an incubator at 17 °C and were used for electrophysiological experiments after 2-4 days. We did not perform intracellular pH recording with BCECF (2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester) on GFP constructs because of interference of the GFP signal with the BCECF recording. However, intracellular pH studies were performed on NBC1 mutants without GFP insert. Electrophysiology Studies—Oocytes were placed on a nylon mesh in a perfusion chamber and continuously perfused (3 ml/min perfusion rate). The perfusion solution had the following composition (in mm): 96 NaCl; 2 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 1.8 CaCl2, and 15 Hepes, pH 7.5. After a stabilization period, when the membrane potential (Vm) was constant, the perfusion solution was switched to a CO2/bicarbonate-containing solution of the following composition (in mm): 30 NaHCO3; 66 NaCl; 2 KCl; 1 MgCl2; 1.8 CaCl2; and 15 Hepes, pH 7.5; and gassed with 5% CO2. Experiments were performed at room temperature (22-25 °C). Membrane potentials were recorded with conventional microelectrode techniques by glass microelectrodes (resistance 3-5 megohms) filled with 3 m KCl and connected to an Axoclamp 2A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) (15Xu J. Wang Z.H. Barone S. Petrovic M. Amlal H. Conforti L. Petrovic S. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F41-F50Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The digitized signals were stored and analyzed on a personal computer using Axotape (Axon Instruments). Statistics—Results are given as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between the groups were performed by ANOVA. The data were considered significant if p < 0.05. Materials—High fidelity PCR amplification kit, GFP fusion TOPO TA expression kit, and LipofectAMINE™ 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 kit was purchased from Ambion. EndoFree plasmid maxi kit was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen. All of the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. In the first series of experiments, we examined the expression and targeting of GFP with or without the NBC1 insert in MDCK cells. Fig. 1a (left and right panels) shows that transfection of cultured cells with GFP vector alone (no NBC1 insert) results in the accumulation of GFP in the cytoplasm (Z-line images in left panel) with no localization on the membrane (Z-stack images in right panel). However, transfection with GFP-NBC1 full-length cDNA shows exclusive localization of the GFP in the membrane (as visualized by Z-stack, front view) in cells colabeled with phalloidin (Fig. 1b). The specific membrane labeling (apical versus basolateral) was examined using the Z-line image (side view) analysis. The results are demonstrated in Fig. 1c. Similar studies were performed with the GFP-NBC1 construct in MDCK cells colabeled with PNA-lectin dye, a very specific marker of apical membrane labeling in polarized cells (16Devonald M.A. Smith A.N. Poon J.P. Ihrke G. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Z-line (side view) images of the results (NBC1-GFP and PNA-lectin double labeling) are depicted in Fig. 1d. As demonstrated, the full-length NBC1 is targeted exclusively to the basolateral membrane domain (Fig. 1, c and d). These results are consistent with published reports on the basolateral localization of NBC1 in epithelial cells (4Soleimani M. Burnham C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Kurtz I. Petrasek D. Tatishchev S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 197: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Romero M.F. Fulton C.M. Boron W.F. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In the next series of experiments, we examined the expression of GFP-NBC1 mutants with 3 (CD3) or 20 (CD20) amino acid deletion from their carboxyl-terminal end (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 2a is a Z-stack (front view) image analysis of the expression of GFP-NBC1 CD3 colabeled with phalloidin in MDCK cells, showing GFP-NBC1 CD3 localization on the cell membrane. The Z-line (side view) image analysis of the expression studies doubly labeled with phalloidin or PNA-lectin demonstrate that NBC1-CD3 mutant is targeted to the basolateral membranes (Fig. 2, b and c). Fig. 3 depicts similar results with NBC1 mutant lacking the last 20 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end. The Z-stack (front view) image analysis of the expression of GFP-NBC1 CD20 colabeled with phalloidin (Fig. 3a) is shown in MDCK cells and demonstrates exclusive localization on the cell membrane. The Z-line image analysis (side view) of the expression studies demonstrates that NBC1-CD20 mutant is targeted to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3, b and c).Fig. 3Transfection of MDCK cells with GFP-NBC1 CD20 cDNA.a, expression of GFP-NBC1 CD20:Z-stack image analysis.

Transfection studies were performed as described above. The Z-stack analysis (front view) of the expression of GFP-NBC1CD26, colabeled with phalloidin, shows strong membrane as well as submembrane labeling with the GFP (Fig. 4a). The Z-line (side view) image analysis of the results shows the surprising and unexpected finding of apical membrane targeting of NBC1 (Fig. 4, b and c). Experiments were performed with both phalloidin (Fig. 4b) and PNA-lectin binding (Fig. 4c). Both methods clearly confirm that deletion of the last 26 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end causes the mistargeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane (Fig. 4, b and c). Some images show residual labeling of the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4, b and c), but clearly, the majority of the labeling is localized on the apical membrane with little cytoplasmic expression. To determine whether further truncation of the carboxyl-terminal end affects its membrane localization, NBC1 mutants with the deletion of 50 amino acid residues were generated, coupled to GFP, and transiently expressed in MDCK cells. Fig. 5a shows transfection of MDCK cells with the NBC1-CD50 mutant and indicates that GFP-NBC1 CD50 localized on the cell membrane as well as in the cytoplasm. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 (panels b and c), NBC1 mutant with the deletion of 50 amino acid residues shows persistence of labeling on the apical membrane. As noted, this mutant also demonstrates significant intracytoplasmic expression in addition to the apical labeling, indicating that progressive truncation of the COOH-terminal end of NBC1 beyond the last 26 amino acids on the COOH-terminal end may interfere with the targeting of NBC1 to cell membrane. In the next series of experiments, we examined the functional activity of NBC1-GFP CD26 mutant in oocytes by membrane potential measurement (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 2Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol.

For comparison, oocytes injected with GFP-NBC1 full length or GFP only (no NBC insert) cRNA were utilized. We were specifically interested in NBC1-CD26, as this is the mutant with the shortest truncation that shows mistargeting to the apical membrane (Fig. 4). As demonstrated (Fig. 6, bottom panel, representative tracing), exposure to CO2/HCO3− in oocytes expressing the full-length GFP-NBC1 (2-4 days after cRNA injection, 0.5 μg/μl) resulted in an immediate membrane hyperpolarization, which reached a peak within 1 min. The hyperpolarization showed very little decay during the time of exposure to CO2/HCO3− and was reversible upon returning to the CO2/HCO3−-free perfusion solution. This finding is consistent with published reports and indicates that NBC1 is highly electrogenic (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 2Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 284: F41-F50Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As noted, exposure to CO2/HCO3− in oocytes expressing GFPNBC1 CD26 mutant (2-4 days after cRNA injection, 0.5 μg/μl) also caused significant membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 6, middle panel, representative tracing). Control oocytes (GFP only) showed no alteration in membrane potential measurement in response to CO2/HCO3− exposure (Fig. 6, top panel, representative tracing). The summary results of the effect of CO2/HCO3− on membrane potential were -114.6 ± 6.0 mV in full-length GFP-NBC1-injected oocytes (n = 5), -106.1 ± 5.6 mV in GFP-NBC1 CD26-injected oocytes (n = 6), and -62 ± 3.8 mV in GFP-only injected oocytes (n = 5). The base-line membrane potentials (before exposure to CO2/HCO3−) were -49.4 ± 3.2 mV in full-length GFP-NBC1-injected oocytes, -53.2 ± 4.1 mV in GFP-NBC1 CD26-injected oocytes, and -50.9 ± 4.2 mV in GFP-only injected oocytes. As indicated, oocytes injected with either the full-length or the mutant NBC1 showed significant hyperpolarization (p < 0.01 versus no CO2/HCO3−), whereas GFP-only injected oocytes did not show any alteration in membrane potential in response to CO2/HCO3− exposure. The magnitude of hyperpolarization in response to CO2/HCO3− exposure was not different between the full-length and the CD26-truncated mutant (p > 0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the GFP-NBC1 mutant with the deletion of the last 26 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues is functionally active. In the last series of experiments, we examined the membrane targeting of NBC1-CD23 and mutants in which the conserved residue at position 1013 on the COOH-terminal end was mutated (F1013A) by site-directed mutagenesis. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 (panel A), deletion of the last 23 amino acid residues causes the retargeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane, indicating that the sequence FLS (residues 1013-1015) is essential for the targeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane. To identify the amino acid residue(s) responsible for the exclusive targeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane, mutants in which the conserved residue Phe was mutated (F1013A) were used for transfection in MDCK cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 (panel B), the F1013A mutation caused the retargeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane. The targeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane was examined using a series of mutants with progressive truncation of the carboxyl-terminal end that were fused in-frame to GFP and visualized by confocal microscope. The results demonstrated that the full-length NBC1 and mutants with up to 20 amino acid deletion from the carboxyl-terminal end are targeted to the basolateral membrane (Figs. 1, 2, 3). However, the NBC1 mutant with the deletion of 26 amino acids from its COOH-terminal end showed mistargeting to the apical membrane domain with some labeling observed on the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4). Additional truncations for up to 67 amino acid residues showed persistence of labeling on the apical membrane but also resulted in accumulation of mutant proteins in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). 2H. Li, L. Conforti, and M. Soleimani, unpublished observation. Membrane potential recording in oocytes demonstrated that the NBC1 mutant with deletion of 26 amino acid residues mediates Na+- HCO3− cotransport (Fig. 6), indicating that the apically targeted molecule is functionally active. Additionally, truncation of the last 23 amino acids or mutants in which the conserved residue Phe at position 1013 on the COOH-terminal end was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (F1013A) demonstrated retargeting to the apical membrane. We further find that other truncated mutants (up to 67 amino acid deletion) are functional, although at a much smaller rate when expressed in non-GFP forms and assayed by BCECF (data not shown). NBC1 is located basolaterally in various epithelia and mediates vectorial transport of bicarbonate. In kidney, NBC1 is located on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules and mediates the exit of bicarbonate from cell to blood (4Soleimani M. Burnham C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Kurtz I. Petrasek D. Tatishchev S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 197: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Romero M.F.

In pancreas, NBC1 is located on the basolateral membrane of ducts and mediates the entry of bicarbonate from blood to cell (4Soleimani M. Burnham C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 183: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Kurtz I. Petrasek D. Tatishchev S. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 197: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Romero M.F.

Studies on NBC1 have demonstrated that kNBC1 has a stoichiometry of three equivalents of bicarbonate per sodium, whereas the pNBC1 has a stoichiometry of two bicarbonates per sodium (11Soleimani M. Grassl S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Gross E. Hawkins K. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Cotton C.U. Hopfer U. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 597-603Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The difference in the stoichiometry allows for the change in the direction of NBC1 movement from absorptive (i.e. in kidney) to secretory (i.e. in pancreatic duct). The most salient feature of the current study is the identification of a carboxyl-terminal motif and residues that are essential for the targeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane. It is noteworthy that, in the absence of this motif (CD23 or CD26 amino acid deletion) or in mutants in which the conserved residue Phe at position 1013 is mutated, NBC1 is predominantly mistargeted to the apical membrane rather than accumulated in the cytoplasm. This observation raises the possibility that other existing motifs may be responsible for the targeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane. Alternatively, it is plausible that the mistargeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane occurs by default (as a result of the deletion of basolateral targeting domain). Further deletion of the carboxyl-terminal end beyond 26 amino acids (up to 67 aa residues) resulted in more intracytoplasmic accumulation of NBC1 (Fig. 5), 2H. Li, L. Conforti, and M. Soleimani, unpublished observation. indicating that the carboxyl-terminal end may play important role in membrane targeting of NBC1. The apically targeted NBC1 is functionally active (Fig. 6), raising the likelihood that possible mutations or deletions in the identified motif (QQPFLS) in human do not impair its functional activity. However such a mutation or deletion may cause significant impairment in bicarbonate reabsorption because of the absence of an exit pathway for bicarbonate transport in the basolateral membrane. In other words, the mistargeting of NBC1 to the apical membrane may impair the vectorial transport of bicarbonate and lead to proximal tubular acidosis. Whether motifs on the amino-terminal end of NBC1 play any role in basolateral membrane targeting of NBC1 remains speculative at the present and warrants detailed examination. Recent studies have identified mutations in the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger AE1 that are associated with distal renal tubular acidosis, a bicarbonate-wasting condition. AE1 is normally located on the basolateral membrane of α(A)-intercalated cells in cortical and outer medullary collecting duct and, in tandem with apical H+-ATPase, is responsible for majority of bicarbonate reabsorption in these nephron segments (21Borthwick K.J.

Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2178-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Bicarbonate wasting in these subjects raised the possibility that AE1 mutants either became functionally inactive or were retained intracellularly. However, studies with AE1 mutants have been less conclusive (23Bruce L.J. Cope D.L. Jones G.K. Schofield A.E. Burley M. Povey S. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. J. Clin.

Given the functionality of AE1 mutants in non-epithelial cells, Devonald et al. (16Devonald M.A. Smith A.N. Poon J.P. Ihrke G. Karet F.E. Nat.

This should lead to renal bicarbonate wasting and worsen distal renal tubular acidosis. It is worth mentioning that other mutations cause the retention of AE1 in the endoplasmic reticulum or in late endosomes/lysosomes, thus causing distal renal tubular acidosis by reducing bicarbonate exit across the basolateral membrane of the collecting duct (25Quilty J.A. Li J. Reithmeier R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F810-F820Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Toye A.M. Banting G. Tanner M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1399-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A GenBank™ search of other members of NBC/AE super-family demonstrated that a motif with high homology to the one identified in our studies is also expressed in NBC2, NBC4, NCBE, AE1, and AE2, all known bicarbonate transporters located on the basolateral membrane of various epithelia. An analysis of other known chloride/bicarbonate or anion exchangers from SLC26 family, which share little homology with NBC/AE superfamily, demonstrates that those anion exchangers that are targeted to the basolateral membrane (SLC26A1 and SLC26A7) contain motifs with high homology to the current motif (GenBank™ NM_022042 for A1, from residue 675 to 678 with aa sequence QLFL with full length of 701 aa; GenBank™ NM_134266 for Ala-7, from residue 343 to 346 with aa sequence QEFL with full length of 663 aa). However, SLC26 exchangers that are targeted to the apical membrane (SLC26A3 and SLC26A4) do not express any motif with high homology to the current motif. In conclusion, NBC1 mutants lacking the last carboxyl-terminal 23 or mutant in which the conserved residue Phe-1013 mutated into Ala-1013 show mistargeting to the apical membrane. We propose that a carboxyl-terminal motif with the sequence QQPFLS, which spans amino acid residues 1010-1015, and specifically the amino acid residue Phe at position 1013 are essential for the exclusive targeting of NBC1 to the basolateral membrane. Future studies should clarify the underlying mechanism of this targeting rearrangement and attempt to identify the molecules that interact with NBC1 through this motif."

We examined the effects of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-AR) on IKs in cardiac ventricular myocytes from transgenic mice expressing fusion proteins of IKs subunits and hβ2-ARs. KCNQ1 and β2-ARs were localized to the same subcellular regions, sharing intimate localization within nanometers of each other. In IKs/B2-AR myocytes, IKs density was increased, and activation shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction; IKs was not further modulated by exposure to isoproterenol, and KCNQ1 was found to be PKA-phosphorylated. Conversely, β2-AR overexpression did not affect L-type calcium channel current (ICaL) under basal conditions with ICaL remaining responsive to cAMP. These data indicate intimate association of KCNQ1 and β2-ARs and that β2-AR signaling can modulate the function of IKs channels under conditions of increased β2-AR expression, even in the absence of exogenous β-AR agonist.

IKs, the slowly activating component of the human cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current, is a major contributor to repolarization of the cardiac action potential (1Deal K.K. England S.K. Tamkun M.M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The IKs channel results from the co-assembly of two subunits KCNQ1 (Kv-LQT1) and KCNE1 (minK), (2Sanguinetti M.C.

Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). KCNQ1, the α-subunit of IKs, shares topological homology with other voltage-gated K+ channels in that its 676 amino acids encode six transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. KCNE1, the β subunit of IKs, encodes a protein containing 129–130 amino acids consisting of a single transmembrane spanning domain (4Kaczmarek L.K. Blumenthal E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The contribution of IKs to regulation of action potential duration is augmented by the sympathetic nervous system via activation of β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, adrenergic receptor; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; RyR, ryanodine receptor; ISO, isoproterenol; Ab, antibody; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ICD, intercalated disc; SSM, surface sarcolemmal membrane.

Physiol. 1982; 322: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sympathetic nervous system-mediated control of cardiac function results from binding of catecholamines to G protein-coupled receptors, including the β2-AR, resulting in activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins Gα and Gβγ and stimulation of adenylate cyclase leading to increased production of cAMP. This increased production of cAMP promotes activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which in turn activates downstream effector molecules including L-type Ca2+ channels, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels (or ryanodine receptors (RyR)) and delayed rectifier potassium channels. Sympathetic nervous system regulation of the delayed rectifier potassium channel is most marked for the slow component (IKs) rather than the fast component (IKr) (7Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. Scott A. Siegl P.K. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of the response to cAMP is achieved in part by channel-bound A kinase-anchoring proteins (8Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In the case of the IKs channel, a leucine zipper motif in the KCNQ1 C-terminal domain coordinates the binding of the A kinase-anchoring protein Yotiao (9Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), which in turn binds to and recruits PKA and PP1 to the channel to form a channel microsignaling domain to regulate the phosphorylation of Ser27 in the N terminus of KCNQ1 (9Marx S.O.

Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of the response to cAMP may also be due in part to receptor-channel co-localization. Here we have examined the subcellular localization of KCNQ1 and β2-AR in ventricular myocytes isolated from transgenic mice expressing an hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 fusion protein TG+ and transgenic mice expressing hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 and overexpressing β2-AR DTG+. To examine the effects of increased β2-ARs upon IKs, we have made use of a transgenic mouse overexpressing the β2-AR. These transgenic mice have >100-fold increase in β2-AR density accompanied by apparent maximal heart rate and cardiac contractility (11Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β2-AR has been shown to result in agonist-independent spontaneous activation (12Zhou Y.Y. Yang D. Zhu W.Z. Zhang S.J. Wang D.J. Rohrer D.K. Devic E. Kobilka B.K. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). β2-AR signaling has also been shown to be localized to the cell membrane, with regards to L-type Ca2+ channel modulation (13Chen-Izu Y. Xiao R.P. Izu L.T. Cheng H. Kuschel M. Spurgeon H. Lakatta E.G. Biophys.J. 2000; 79: 2547-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find the localization of KCNQ1 and β2-AR to share similar subcellular localizations and to be within a few nanometers of each other. Even in the absence of exogenous agonist, functional analysis of hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 channel activity (IKs) in cardiac myocytes isolated from DTG+ mice revealed maximal adrenergic up-regulation of IKs, and biochemical analysis indicated that the channel was PKA-phosphorylated in DTG+ mice. This PKA-dependent modulation of the IKs channel was not due to global increases in intracellular cAMP by receptor expression because we found that basal L-type calcium channel current (ICaL) was not up-regulated in these mice. Thus, our data reveal close coupling between β2-AR signaling and the IKs channel and indicate that, with sufficiently high level of β2-AR expression, the channel can be PKA-phosphorylated and up-regulated even in the absence of exogenous agonist. Transgenic mice expressing hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 fusion protein in the heart have been described in detail (9Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). These mice express functional slow delayed rectifier potassium channel currents (IKs) normally absent from murine cardiac ventricular myocytes. Transgenic mice overexpressing β2-AR (TG4) have also previously been described in detail (11Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). TG4 mice exhibit cardiac overexpression of the human β2-AR at >100-fold higher than endogenous myocardial levels. Strains of TG+ mice overexpressing β2-AR and hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 were crossed to produce double TG+ (DTG+) mice overexpressing both β2-AR and expressing hKCNQ1-hKCNE1. Both transgene constructs were under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter providing cardiomyocyte specific expression. Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis with primers specific for the α-myosin heavy chain promoter, β2-AR, and KCNQ1. Adult mice were humanely killed by intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of pentobarbital (100 mg kg-1), and acutely dissociated single ventricular myocytes were obtained by using previously described methods (14Mitra R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H1056-H1060PubMed Google Scholar, 15Powell T. Terrar D.A. Twist V.W. J. Physiol. 1980; 302: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) using ∼ 10,500 units of collagenase type II (Invitrogen) and ∼6 units of protease type XIV (Sigma). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University approved the protocols for all animal studies. Ventricular myocytes were isolated as above and plated onto laminin (Sigma) coated coverslip chambers and incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to allow cellular attachment. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized using 100% ethanol (15 min at -20 °C). The cells were rinsed (three times) in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 20 min with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline to reduce nonspecific binding. After overnight (5 °C) incubation with primary antibodies (Ab) against KCNQ1 (Santa Cruz) or β2-AR (Santa Cruz) cells were rinsed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, after which secondary Abs were added for 2 h at room temperature. IgGs conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 660 were used to label the primary Abs. After a further four washes, coverslips (#1) were mounted onto the microscope slides along with Slowfade™ light (Molecular Probes S-7461) and anti-fade reagent in a glycerol buffer. The coverslips were sealed in place using nail varnish. To determine the degree of nonspecific binding, incubation with secondary Ab alone was conducted (minimal fluorescence was observed; results not shown). The cells were viewed using a Nikon PCM2000 fluorescence confocal laser-scanning microscope. Alexa 488 was excited with 488-nm light, and fluorescence emissions were measured at greater than 505 nm. Alexa 660 was excited with 635-nm light, and fluorescence emissions were measured between 650 and 750 nm. The images were optimized by adjustment of photo multiplier gain to use the full linear range of pixel intensity, and fluorophore emissions were simultaneously recorded using separate photo multiplier tubes for each wavelength. Immunofluorescence images of each protein were obtained in the same cell. For the purposes of identifying the location of each protein, fluorescence intensity was used. All regions of the cell with fluorescence intensity equal to or greater than a threshold level were identified and marked in each image as a site of the protein as long as at least three contiguous pixels were at or above the threshold. Co-localization was marked when identical regions contained both proteins. The threshold was set using pixel intensity histograms of each immunofluorescence image. The most frequent pixel intensity after the black level peak was set as the threshold. Images were discarded for this analysis when noise in the image or saturation was significant. Analysis was carried out using Velocity software by Improvision (Coventry, UK). Immunohistochemical labeling of isolated ventricular myocytes was performed as above. Secondary Abs with one of the FRET pair Alexa 555 (donor) or Alexa 647 (acceptor) were used. This FRET pair has a Forster radius of 5.1 nm (Molecular Probes). The acceptor and donor fluorophores were excited with 543- and 635-nm light, and emissions were measured at 565–620 and 650–750 nm, respectively. Firstly, separate images were acquired for the individual fluorophore emissions (Alexa 555 and 647). Following this, excitation of the acceptor fluorophore alone (647-nm light only) for ∼5 min to photobleach the fluorophore was performed. After acceptor photobleaching, fluorescence emission from the donor fluorophore (Alexa 555) was recorded, using identical gains to those before acceptor photobleaching. Even at increased gains no fluorescence emission was observed from the acceptor after photobleaching. Any increase in emitted fluorescence from the donor fluorophore after acceptor photobleaching indicates FRET between donor and acceptor fluorophores was occurring prior to photobleaching. The occurrence of FRET between this particular pair of fluorophores requires a distance between them of 5.1 nm or less. Single ventricular myocytes were isolated as above. The membrane currents were recorded at room temperature using the whole cell patch clamp technique (16Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). Solutions used for recording IKs were as follows, superfusion solution 132 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, plus E-4031 (5 μm) to block IKr and nisoldipine (1 μm) to block ICaL. Patch pipettes of nominal resistance of 0.5–3 mΩ were used and were filled with an internal solution of 110 mm aspartic acid (potassium salt), 5 mm ATP-K2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3. Whole cell L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) were recorded using a superfusion solution containing 132 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm CsCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, plus tetrodotoxin (30 μm) (Calbiochem) to block INa, and internal solution contained 50 mm aspartic acid, 5 mm K2ATP, 60 mm CsCl, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3. Access resistance was 2–10 mΩ. In experiments to study IKs membrane potential was held at -65 mV with prepulse depolarizations from -40 mV to +60 mV for 2 s imposed at 0.067 Hz before a 2-s test pulse to -40 mV. To ensure IKs stabilization after the membrane rupture or drug application, IKs was monitored by prepulse depolarizations (2 s) to +60 mV followed by a return pulse (2 s) to -40 mV at 0.067 Hz. Unless otherwise noted, isochronal activation of IKs was studied by analysis of deactivating tail currents recorded at -40 mV after 2-s depolarizing pulses in 20-mV increments. IKs tail currents resulting from this test pulse were recorded. In experiments to study the effects of inhibiting cAMP dependent protein kinase, the selective and potent inhibitor of PKA, H-89 (Sigma) (5 μm) (17Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was included in the IKs superfusion solution described above. In experiments to study ICaL, membrane potential was held at -40 mV to inactivate INa. ICaL activation was measured by 150-ms test pulses to a series of potentials (10-mV increments) at 0.2 Hz from -40 mV to +60 mV. To examine the effects of cAMP upon ICaL the membrane permeable cAMP analog (pCPT-cAMP) (Sigma) (0.5 mm) was added to the superfusion solution. To ensure ICaL stabilization after membrane rupture or drug application, ICaL was monitored by depolarizations (150 ms) to +10 mV at 0.2 Hz. To obtain peak amplitudes, the leak currents were digitally subtracted by the P/N method (N = 6). Note that the representative traces shown in the figures are raw traces without subtracting the leak currents. The activation curves were fitted with Boltzmann equations to determine the influence of β-AR stimulation, overexpression of β2-AR, or effect of drugs on the voltage for which the half of channels are available (V1/2) and the slope factor for the curve (k). Immunoprecipitation and PKA Back-phosphorylation of KCNQ1 Channels—Heart homogenates were prepared by homogenizing ∼1.0 g of cardiac tissue in 1.0 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-maleate, 10 mm NaF, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (complete tablets from Roche Applied Science), pH 7.0. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. After determining the protein concentrations of the supernatants, the samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use. The cardiac KCNQ1 channel was immunoprecipitated from heart samples by incubating 500 μg of homogenate with anti-KCNQ antibody (Santa Cruz) in 0.5 ml of a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mm NaF, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 0.25% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h, after which the beads were washed three times with 1× kinase buffer containing 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris/piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 6.8. After resuspending the beads in 10 μl of 1.5× kinase buffer containing 5 units of PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma), back-phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated KCNQ1 was initiated with 5 μl of 100 μm Mg-ATP containing 10% [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was terminated after 8 min at room temperature with 5 μl of stop solution (4% SDS and 0.25 m dithiothreitol). The samples were heated to 95 °C, size-fractionated on 10% PAGE, and KCNQ1 radioactivity was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting value was divided by the amount of KCNQ1 protein and expressed as the inverse of the PKA-dependent 32P signal. Western Analysis—The proteins were size-fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE for KCNQ1, and the immunoblots were developed using anti-KCNQ1 Ab (custom made by Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) (18Kurokawa J. Chen L. Kass R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2122-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using (GARRGpSAGL) as the antigenic peptide) diluted in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline/Tween. Immunoblot signals were quantified by densitometry. Graphical and statistical data analysis was carried out using Origin 7.0 software (Microcal, Northampton, MA), Excel (Microsoft), and Clampfit 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The data are presented as the mean values ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed with Student's t test for simple comparisons; differences at p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Two-sample comparisons were performed using unpaired Student's t test. Localization of KCNQ1 and β2-AR in Murine Ventricular Myocytes—Using double labeling immunohistochemical techniques combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy KCNQ1 and β2-AR were found to be in similar subcellular localizations in ventricular myocytes. In cells isolated from the hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 (TG+) mice, KCNQ1 was localized to the intercalated disc (ICD) regions, the surface sarcolemmal membrane (SSM), and the transverse (T-) tubules (see arrows A–C in Fig. 1A, panel ib). In these myocytes β2-AR were also located in ICD, SSM, and T-tubules (Fig. 1A, panel iib). In ventricular myocytes from DTG+ mice, expressing hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 and overexpressing β2-ARs, a similar localization for KCNQ1-KCNE1 and β2-ARs to the ICD, SSM, and T-tubules was observed (Fig. 1B). KCNQ1 and β2-AR were determined to be highly co-localized in myocytes from both TG+ and DTG+ mice. However, the resolving power of conventional confocal microscopy is limited to ∼0.2 μm. With cardiac T-tubules being up to 300 nm in diameter, it would be possible for proteins to appear co-localized without in fact having an intimate association or localization with each other. To investigate this further we made use of FRET to provide substantially increased spatial resolution. Acceptor Bleaching FRET between Imunohistochemically Labeled KCNQ1 and β2-AR in Murine Ventricular Myocytes— Using dual labeling immunohistochemical techniques and acceptor bleaching FRET methods combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy, an intimate localization of KCNQ1 and β2-AR within nanometers of each other was seen. For the particular pair of fluorophores used here the distance between them must be 5.1 nm or less for FRET to occur. Any increase in donor fluorescence after acceptor photobleaching indicates the occurrence of FRET before photobleaching The increased intensity of donor fluorescence seen after acceptor photobleaching (Fig. 2, compare A and D; also see Fig. 2F) indicates there is an intimate and close localization between KCNQ1 and β2-AR, within nanometers of each other (Fig. 2). Effect of β-AR Stimulation on IKs in Ventricular Myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 Mice—We have previously shown that IKs channels are regulated in the hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 mouse in response to PKA stimulation (9Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 3, stimulation of β-AR using the β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) increases IKs in myocytes isolated from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 mice, as reflected in the increase of outward current measured in response to depolarization and in the decay of outward current (tail) after termination of depolarizing pulses. IKs tail currents in myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 mice were significantly (p < 0.05) increased for all prepulse potentials examined. In addition to the increase in IKs tail current, ISO induced a hyperpolarizing shift in the IKs activation curve in myocytes from these mice (Fig. 3 and Table I). Thus, the hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 channel is regulated by agonist-induced β-AR stimulation in the TG+ mice in a manner strikingly similar to the effects of β-AR stimulation on IKs in other species, such as guinea pig, where a similar channel is endogenously expressed (6Kass R.S. Wiegers S.E. J. Physiol. 1982; 322: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Walsh K.B. Kass R.S. Science. 1988; 242: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We next asked whether or not similar IKs regulation could be detected in myocytes from DTG+ mice with overexpression of β2-AR in addition to expression of hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 channels.Table IEffects of ISO on IKs channel availability and amplitude in hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 myocyteshKCNQ1-hKCNE1V½kImaxItail 60mVnmVpA/pFpA/pFControl41.0 ± 3.817.4 ± 0.85.5 ± 1.03.9 ± 0.710ISO28.7 ± 4.1ap < 0.05 versus control (paired t test)20.6 ± 1.37.4 ± 1.3ap < 0.05 versus control (paired t test)5.8 ± 1.0bp < 0.01 versus control (paired t test)10a p < 0.05 versus control (paired t test)b p < 0.01 versus control (paired t test) Open table in a new tab IKs in Ventricular Myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 and hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR Mice—We characterized IKs in ventricular myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 and hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR (DTG+) mice. We detected robust expression of IKs in these cells and found that IKs current density was consistently greater in DTG+ myocytes compared with TG+ (hKCNQ1-hKCNE1) myocytes. IKs tail current density was significantly (p < 0.05) greater in ventricular myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR mice at all prepulse potentials examined. In addition to a larger IKs tail current, a hyperpolarizing shift in the normalized IKs tail current was recorded in myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR mice (Fig. 4 and Table II). Thus, similar to β-AR stimulation in hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 myocytes, overexpression of β2-AR produces an increase in IKs and altered channel gating even in the absence of exogenous agonist. Overexpression of β2-AR resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) increased current density (∼135%), and activation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction in myocytes from DTG+ mice compared with TG+ mice expressing the hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 transgene alone (Table III). We found no further increase in IKs density or change in activation voltage dependence with β-AR stimulation in DTG+ mice (Fig. 5 and Table III), suggesting that β2-AR overexpression results in maximal activation of IKs. These results suggest that overexpression of β2-AR results in maximal up-regulation of IKs without the application of additional β-AR agonist.Table IIEffects of overexpression of β 2-AR on IKs channel availability and amplitude in hKCNQ1-hKCNE1 myocytesTG+/DTG+V½kImaxItail 60mVnmVpA/pFpA/pFhKCNQ1-hKCNE136.2 ± 5.015.4 ± 1.65.1 ± 0.84.0 ± 0.78hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR15.2 ± 2.7ap < 0.05 versus control (Student's t test)16.2 ± 1.910.0 ± 2.39.2 ± 1.76a p < 0.05 versus control (Student's t test) Open table in a new tab Table IIIEffects of ISO on IKs channel availability and amplitude in hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β 2-AR myocyteshKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-ARV½kImaxItail 60mVnmVpA/pFpA/pFControl16.4 ± 2.916.8 ± 2.310.4 ± 2.89.4 ± 2.55ISO15.2 ± 4.317.7 ± 1.39.4 ± 2.78.3 ± 1.75 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5IKs in ventricular myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR mice is insensitive to β-AR stimulation.A, voltage dependence of IKs current density (pA/pF).

B, voltage dependence of normalized IKs tail currents showing the voltage dependence of channel activation. No significant difference is seen in the absence or presence of ISO (1 μm). The half-maximal activation (V1/2) for IKs in myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR mice is 16.4 ± 2.9 mV in contrast to 15.2 ± 4.3 mV in the presence of ISO.

These results suggest that this channel complex may be PKA-phosphorylated in the mouse model. To address this possibility we used back-phosphorylation experiments to determine the relative PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels in our DTG+ mice. In this procedure immunoprecipitated proteins are incubated with radioactively labeled ATP. The more PKA-phosphorylated a protein, the less radioactive phosphate it will be able to incorporate. Back-phosphorylation experiments revealed greater PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 in DTG+ mice overexpressing β2-ARs compared with PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1 in our TG+ mice, consistent with the predictions of our functional data (Fig. 6). Inhibition of PKA in Myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR Mice—Results from the above back-phosphorylation experiments show KCNQ1 phosphorylation to be increased in the presence of overexpression of β2AR. Consistent with functional data this increased phosphorylation of KCNQ1 is thought to result from the action of PKA, which becomes activated as a result of spontaneous action of overexpressed β2ARs (even in the absence of agonist). To confirm the observed increase in phosphorylation of KCNQ1 and the concomitant increase in IKS is in fact due to the action of PKA, we examined IKs in ventricular myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2AR mice in the presence of H-89, a selective inhibitor of PKA. In the presence of H-89 a significant (p = 0.01) reduction (20 ± 4.6%) in IKs peak tail current density (pA/pF) was observed (Fig. 7). This clearly confirms the functional involvement of PKA phosphorylation in the maximal activation of IKs observed in ventricular myocytes from hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR mice. Effect of Overexpressing β2-AR on ICaL in Ventricular Myocytes—The maximal activation of IKs seen with the overexpression of β2-AR may simply be the result of a global increase in intracellular cAMP or alternatively a more localized and specific increase that selectively modulates the IKs channel. To examine this possibility we recorded L-type Ca2+ channel currents ICaL in ventricular myocytes isolated from mice overexpressing β2-AR, both with and without hKCNQ1-hKCNE1, in a cardiac-specific fashion. The first indication that IKs modulation with β2-AR overexpression is localized and specific was the lack of modulation of ICaL seen with β2-AR overexpression. ICaL density and the activation voltage dependence was the same for myocytes from wild type, β2-AR overexpressing and hKCNQ1-hKCNE1/β2-AR mice (Fig. 8A)"

However, new platinum-group element analyses indicate that Popigai was formed by the impact of an L-chondrite meteorite. Such an asteroidal projectile is difficult to reconcile with a cometary origin. Perhaps instead the higher delivery rate of extraterrestrial matter, dust, and large objects was caused by a major collision in the asteroid belt."
https://openalex.org/W2068384228,"All proteins of the villin superfamily, which includes the actin-capping and -severing proteins such as gelsolin, scinderin, and severin, are calcium-regulated actin-modifying proteins. Like some of these proteins, villin has morphologically distinct effects on actin assembly depending on the free calcium concentrations. At physiological calcium (Ca2+) villin nucleates and bundles actin, whereas at higher concentrations it caps (>50 μm) and severs (>200 μm) actin filaments. Although Ca2+-binding sites have been described in villin, the functional characterization of these sites has not been done previously. In the present study we functionally dissect the calcium-dependent actin-capping and -depolymerizing sites in villin. Our analysis reveals that villin binds Ca2+ with a Kd of 80.5 μm, a stoichiometry of 5.97, and a Hill's coefficient of 1.2. Using the NMR structure of villin 14T and the gelsolin-actin/Ca2+ crystal structure, six putative sites that result in Ca2+-induced conformational changes were identified in human villin and confirmed by mutational analysis. Molecular dynamics studies support the mutational analysis and provide a model for structural difference in the A93G mutant that prevents the calcium-induced conformational changes in the S1 domain of villin. Furthermore, we determined that villin expresses at least two types of Ca2+-sensitive sites that determine separate functional properties; site 1 (Glu-25, Asp-44, and Glu-74) regulates actin-capping, whereas sites 1 and 2 (Asp-86, Ala-93, and Asp-61), together with the intra-domain calcium-sensitive sites in villin, regulate actin depolymerization by villin. This is the first study that employs sequential mutagenesis to biochemically and functionally characterize the calcium-sensitive sites in villin. Such mutational analysis and functional characterization of the actin-capping and -depolymerizing sites are unknown for other proteins of the villin family.

This is the first study that employs sequential mutagenesis to biochemically and functionally characterize the calcium-sensitive sites in villin. Such mutational analysis and functional characterization of the actin-capping and -depolymerizing sites are unknown for other proteins of the villin family. Villin belongs to a family of actin-binding proteins that contain 3–6 repeats of a conserved domain. In villin, gelsolin, and scinderin there are six such segmental repeats (S1–S6 in villin and G1–G6 in gelsolin). Villin contains an additional domain (S7), the headpiece, which imparts it with the ability to cross-link actin filaments. Villin can nucleate, sever, cap, and cross-link actin filaments in a calcium-regulated manner. Both villin and gelsolin demonstrate the Ca2+-induced conformational changes referred to as the “hinge mechanism” in villin (1Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the “hinge/latch mechanism” in gelsolin (2Lin K.M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27746-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we have recently demonstrated that villin undergoes a large Ca2+-dependent conformational change, which includes an increase in the α-helical content of the protein (3Kumar N. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24915-24918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have identified two residues, Asp-467 and Asp-715, in human villin that function as hinge/latch residues and regulate this major Ca2+-dependent conformational change in villin. Like gelsolin, the villin core (S1–S6) retains most of it ligand binding properties including G-actin, F-actin, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and calcium-binding sites. Villin contains an additional F-actin and a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding site in the headpiece domain (4Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike gelsolin but like scinderin, the association of villin with actin is Ca2+-dependent (6Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sakurai T. Kurokawa H. Nonomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15979-15983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, maximal actin severing by villin requires significantly higher Ca2+ concentrations than for severing by gelsolin (6Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although villin and gelsolin share structural similarity (45% homology at the amino acid level), the villin core and the gelsolin core are not functionally identical (8Finidori J. Friederich E. Kwiatkowski D.J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Glenney et al. reported for the first time the presence of a single tight calcium-binding site with a Kd of 2.5 μm in villin, supporting the functional importance of calcium ions in the microvillus organization and stability (9Glenney Jr., J.R. Bretscher A. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6458-6462Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These studies were done using equilibrium dialysis with 45Ca. Subsequently, Hesterberg and Weber reported the presence of three Ca2+-binding sites in villin including two rapidly exchanging (not tightly bound) sites, one each in the core and the headpiece and a third non-exchangeable (tightly bound) high affinity Ca2+-binding site in the villin core (10Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were done using the chromatographic method of Hummel and Dreyer (11Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The non-exchangeable site was predicted to be a site buried in the villin core, inaccessible to the solvent (10Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding constants reported by Hesterberg and Weber were 4.6 μm for full-length villin, 3.5 μm for the villin core, and 7.4 μm for the headpiece (10Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Walsh et al. reported that different calcium-binding sites regulate the actin-capping and -cutting activities of villin (12Walsh T.P. Weber A. Davis K. Bonder E. Mooseker M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6099-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they reported that the calcium-binding sites regulating actin severing had a much lower affinity for calcium than did the sites regulating actin capping (12Walsh T.P. Weber A. Davis K. Bonder E. Mooseker M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6099-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The calcium-binding sites regulating the capping activity of villin were saturated at 10 μm Ca2+, suggesting a Kd of <0.1 μm for actin capping (12Walsh T.P. Weber A. Davis K. Bonder E. Mooseker M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6099-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the actin-severing activity of villin required 200 μm Ca2+ (12Walsh T.P. Weber A. Davis K. Bonder E. Mooseker M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6099-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This binding constant was analogous to the binding constants reported by Hesterberg and Weber (10Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by Glenney et al. (9Glenney Jr., J.R. Bretscher A. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6458-6462Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The binding kinetics for actin capping and severing were confirmed in functional studies by Northrop et al., where it was reported that the calcium requirements for actin capping and severing by villin differed by as much as four orders of magnitude (13Northrop J. Weber A. Mooseker M.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Bishop M.F. Dubyak G.R. Tucker M. Walsh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9274-9281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like Walsh et al., Northrop et al. concluded that 10 μm Ca2+ was saturating for capping but did not support the actin-severing functions of villin, which required 100–200 μm Ca2+ (13Northrop J. Weber A. Mooseker M.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Bishop M.F. Dubyak G.R. Tucker M. Walsh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9274-9281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity between the reported Ca2+ binding constants, including the rapidly exchanging calcium sites described by Hesterberg and Weber (10Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the calcium-binding sites reported to date for villin are consistent with a Ca2+-binding site that may regulate actin capping but not actin severing. Thus, the calcium-binding constants that support the actin-severing activity of villin have not been described previously. The specific residues involved in calcium binding were identified by Markus et al. employing the solution structure of 14T (14Markus M.A. Nakayama T. Matsudaira P. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using calcium titration, Markus et al. identified two calcium-binding sites in 14T (Glu-25, Asp-44, or Glu-74) as a strong Ca2+-binding site with a Kd of 1.8 mm and a weak Ca2+-binding site (Asp-86 or Glu-87) with a Kd of 11 mm (14Markus M.A. Nakayama T. Matsudaira P. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The relatively low affinity of these sites suggests that the calcium affinity of villin increases in the context of the full-length protein and/or in the presence of actin. Recent studies with the villin and gelsolin knock-out mice support the idea that the actin-severing functions of these proteins are physiologically important to their role in cell migration. However, the Ca2+-binding sites regulating the actin-severing function of villin are not well characterized. Furthermore, whereas Ca2+-binding sites (at least three) have been described for villin, the residues involved in the Ca2+-induced conformational changes in villin have not been identified. The goal of this study was to better describe the structural basis of the interaction of villin with Ca2+ to elucidate the molecular basis of cytoskeletal reorganization by villin. Of all the proteins of the villin superfamily, the Ca2+-binding sites are best described for the homologous protein gelsolin, which has been crystallized in the presence of actin and Ca2+ ions (15Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T.

However, even for this protein, the Ca2+ binding sites regulating actin capping and actin severing have not been functionally distinguished. In the following report, we used mutational analysis to identify the residues that generate Ca2+-induced conformational changes in villin as well as map these sites with the actin-capping and -depolymerizing activities of villin. Two crystal structures were used to predict the putative Ca2+-sensitive sites in human villin, namely the villin 14T crystal (Fig. 1A) and the actin-bound gelsolin crystal structure (Fig. 1B). Several aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and alanine residues were chosen because of their correspondence to residues involved in calcium binding by gelsolin. Anionic residues were mutated to polar neutral residues such as asparagine or glutamine as well as the nonpolar residue leucine. Modeling studies on the same mutants were performed to explore the structural differences in calcium-sensitive regions. Using this approach, we identified two major Ca2+-regulated sites in the amino-terminal domain of villin, one of which regulates only actin depolymerization and the other both actin capping and actin depolymerization by villin. In addition, we identified four additional sites contained within the villin homologous repeats (S2–S6) that regulate calcium-induced conformational changes in villin and modify the actin-depolymerizing activity of villin. Materials—Escherichia coli BL21 competent cells and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit were from Stratagene, the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX2T was from Amersham Biosciences, glutathione-Sepharose 4B FastFlow was from Amersham Biosciences, GelCode Blue was from Pierce, monoclonal antibodies to villin were from Transduction Laboratories, and the muscle actin polymerization kit and the actin-binding kit were purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). All other chemicals were from Sigma or Invitrogen. Calcium-induced Conformational Changes in Villin—Ca2+-induced conformational changes in villin were examined by recording the quenching of villin's intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence essentially as described previously (20Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ca2+ (final concentration between 0 and 1.3 mm) was added at 0.3-μl increments, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded 5 min after each addition. The apparent dissociation constant, Kd, was calculated using the equation presented here in Equation 1,ΔF=ΔFmax×[Ca2+]T/Kd+[Ca2+]T(eq.1) where F is the fluorescence quenching at a given Ca2+ concentration, Fmax is the total fluorescence quenching of villin saturated with Ca2+, and [Ca2+]T is the total concentration of Ca2+. Fmax is estimated by curve fitting of the binding data using the Hyperbol-fit program in MicroCal Origin. Alternatively, the intrinsic association constant, Ka, as well as the stoichiometry of binding, ρ, were derived from the graphical method of Stinson and Holbrook (21Stinson R.A. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) using the equation presented in Equation 2,1/(1−θ)Ka={[Ca2+]T/θ}−ρ[Villin]T(eq.1) where θ is the fractional binding (F/Fmax), ρ is the stoichiometry of binding, [Ca2+]T is the total concentration of Ca2+, and [Villin]T is the total protein concentration. When 1/(1 - θ) is plotted against [Ca2+]T/θ, a straight line with a slope of Ka and an intercept of [Villin]T × (ρ)(Ka) is obtained. The stoichiometry of interaction, ρ, can be calculated by dividing the intercept with the protein concentration as described previously (5Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The spectra were recorded in buffer A (2 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3), 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EGTA (calcium-free buffer) or buffer A plus 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm CaCl2 with 2 μm protein and corrected for buffer fluorescence. The free calcium concentration, which was 1 nm in the case of calcium-free buffer and 1 mm in the case of Ca2+-containing buffer, was calculated using the apparent dissociation constant of Ca-EGTA determined by Harafuji et al. (22Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Calcium-sensitive Site Mutants—Human villin cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T1 was used as a template to mutate the putative calcium-sensitive sites in human villin. The aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and alanine residues in full-length human villin were substituted with the neutral amino acids asparagine, glutamine, leucine, or glycine, respectively, by designing complementary primers and using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to make single base changes as described previously (5Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Modeling of Calcium Bound/Free Villin—Two crystal structures contributed to the development of the wild-type NH2-terminal domain of villin. The villin 14T crystal structure (23Markus M.A. Matsudaira P. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), entry 2VIK in the Protein Data Bank (24Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar), contributed the structure of residues 2–108 (residues 1–107 in 2VIK, which lacks the NH2-terminal methionine). Residues 109–127 were modeled in the Molecular Operating Environment program (MOE) (2002; Chemical Computing Group, Montreal) by homology to residues 108–125 from the gelsolin segment 1 complex with actin and calcium ions (25Weeds A.G. Gooch J. McLaughlin P. Pope B. Bengtsdotter M. Karlsson R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (entry 1EQY in the Protein Data Bank). The A93G mutation was modeled in the context of the wild-type models by side-chain substitution and the addition of hydrogen atoms in the MOE program. The goal of the modeling studies was to explore the structural differences promoted by replacement of alanine at position 93 with glycine, which does not alter the availability of a carbonyl group for calcium binding. The two starting models were geometry-optimized with the MMFF94 force field and were used as starting points for molecular dynamics simulations. Constant volume and constant temperature simulations were performed at 300 K with 1-fs time steps. An initial equilibrium phase of 60 ps was followed by a data collection phase of 500 ps during which one structure was sampled every picosecond to generate a 500 structure trajectory. All distances between atom pairs are reported as averages over the 500 structure trajectories. Actin Depolymerization Kinetics—The basis of this assay is that the fluorescence intensity of pyrene-labeled actin is much greater for polymeric actin than for monomeric actin. The ability of villin to sever actin filaments was determined by its effect on the rate and extent of decrease in the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C using the FluoroMax3 spectrofluorometer essentially as described previously (26Zhai L. Zhao P. Panebra A. Guerrerio A.L. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36163-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 365 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 407 nm. The actin capping activity of wild-type and mutant villin proteins was measured essentially as described previously (5Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). F-actin villin (wild-type or mutant) seeds were prepared by polymerizing unlabeled G-actin (in buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, and 2.5 μm CaCl2, pH 7.5) with the addition of 150 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2. 290 nm villin-actin seeds were used as nuclei for polymerization with pyrene-labeled G-actin (1.4 μm) in a reaction volume of 200 μl. The increase in fluorescence was measured over time as described above. Protein Conformation—To determine the effect of specific mutations on the overall stability of the villin molecules, fluorescence-monitored urea denaturation was performed on each recombinant protein essentially as described earlier (27Zhai L. Kumar N. Panebra A. Zhao P. Parrill A.L. Khurana S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11750-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, each recombinant protein was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of urea in 30 mm MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild-type. buffer (pH), and tryptophan fluorescence emission maxima (λmax) were recorded for each protein at different concentrations of urea. Kinetics of Ca2+-induced Conformational Changes in Villin—The addition of calcium has been shown to change the structure of the villin molecule (1Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect allowed us to measure the tryptophan quenching of villin to identify changes in the conformation of the villin protein following its association with Ca2+. Villin has an emission maximum of 337 nm, and Ca2+ induces a dose-dependent and saturable quenching of villin's intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence without shifting its emission maxima (Fig. 2A). Tryptophan fluorescence measurements were also made in the presence of MgCl2 alone (supplemental Fig. S1 in the on-line version of this article) or CaCl2 with or without MgCl2 (supplemental Fig. S2 in the on-line version of this article). The presence of MgCl2 (1 mm) did not significantly affect Ca2+-induced tryptophan fluorescence quenching, which was consistent with similar observations made by Hesterberg and Weber (10Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inset of Fig. 1A shows tryptophan-quenching spectra between 0–2.5 μm Ca2+. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was plotted against the Ca2+ concentration (fit to a single hyperbola), and the dissociation constant, Kd, was calculated for wild-type villin as 80.5 ± 5.7 μm (Fig. 2B). The inset of Fig. 2B shows tryptophan fluorescence data obtained between 0–200 μm fit to a single hyperbola. This binding constant corresponds to the binding constant of full-length villin and not to that of individual Ca2+-binding sites in villin. The tryptophan fluorescence data was also fit using two hyperbolic terms (Fig. 2C) and suggested two Ca2+-induced transitions in the villin protein with apparent Kd values of 0.50 ± 0.07 and 93.92 ± 33.32 μm, respectively. The two hyperbolic fits gave a higher standard deviation and a larger residual sum of squares. Similar studies done with gelsolin also report two Ca2+-induced transitions with significantly high standard deviation values (6.0 ± 3.6 and 0.05 ± 0.01 μm) (28Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3101-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the single hyperbola fits the data well, gives a low residual sum of squares that is compatible with the experimental variance, gives a meaningful Kd value with low standard deviation, and is the simpler of the two models, we applied the goodness of fit criteria and assumed that, in villin unlike in gelsolin, there may be only one calcium-induced conformational change. The fractional binding of villin to calcium was plotted against the total calcium concentration, and the stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding to villin was estimated as 5.97 with an association constant, Ka, of 0.0125 μm (Fig. 2D). This finding suggests that six Ca2+ ions could bind per molecule of villin. The Hill's coefficient was calculated as 1.19, indicating positive cooperativity among the Ca2+-binding sites in villin; thus, binding of one Ca2+ ion can facilitate binding of other Ca2+ ions to villin (Fig. 2E). Molecular Characterization of Calcium-sensitive Sites in the Amino-terminal Domain of Villin—Based on the NMR structure of the S1 domain of villin (14Markus M.A. Nakayama T. Matsudaira P. Wagner G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we developed a model for Ca2+-induced conformational changes in villin that includes several putative Ca2+-binding residues in human villin including Gul-25, Asp-44, and Glu-74 (site 1) and Asp-61, Asp-86, and Ala-93 (site 2; Fig. 1A). Based on the crystal structure of the homologous protein gelsolin, we predicted additional residues that could participate in Ca2+-induced conformational changes in villin, i.e. the so-called type 2 Ca2+-binding sites in each of the six homologous domains of villin (Fig. 1B) (17Choe H. Burtnick L.D. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. Robinson R.C. Choe S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Gelsolin contains two classes of calcium-binding sites, namely type 1 sites shared between actin and gelsolin domains and type 2 calcium-binding sites contained within gelsolin (17Choe H. Burtnick L.D. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. Robinson R.C. Choe S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of these sites in the Ca2+-induced conformational changes in villin, we generated point mutants in which each of these residues was replaced by a neutral amino acid with the closest structural resemblance. The side-chain carbonyl group of Asn or Gln might effectively substitute for the single oxygen of an acidic residue. Thus, a reduction of calcium binding in these mutants would indicate the involvement of both oxygen atoms in calcium binding. The nonpolar side chain of Leu is incapable of coordinating calcium and, thus, a decrease in calcium binding is expected for these mutants. The alanine predicted to coordinate calcium through its backbone carbonyl group was mutated to glycine because of its unique structural properties. Ca2+-induced conformational changes were analyzed using tryptophan fluorescence. Both polar residues of the same size (Glu mutated to Gln and Asp mutated to Asn) and nonpolar residues of similar size (Glu or Asp mutated to Leu) were selected to investigate the involvement of anionic residues (Leu mutants) and whether one or both oxygen atoms of the acidi"

Physiological studies using muscle fibers have not yet fully provided the details of the initiation process of the catch state. The process was extensively studied by using an in vitro reconstitution assay with several phosphatase inhibitors. Actin filaments bound to thick filaments pretreated with the soluble protein fraction of muscle homogenate and Ca2+ (catch treatment) in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration (the catch state). Catch treatment with >50μm okadaic acid, >1μm microcystin LR, 1 μm cyclosporin A, 1 μm FK506, or 0.2 mm calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide fragment produced almost no binding of the actin filaments, indicating protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) was involved. Use of bovine calcineurin (PP2B) and its activator calmodulin instead of the soluble protein fraction initiated the catch state, indicating that only PP2B and calmodulin in the soluble protein fraction are essential for the initiation process. The initiation was reproduced with purified actin, myosin, twitchin, PP2B, and calmodulin. 32P autoradiography showed that only twitchin was dephosphorylated during the catch treatment with either the soluble protein fraction or bovine calcineurin and calmodulin. These results indicate that PP2B directly dephosphorylates twitchin and initiates the catch state and that no other component is required for the initiation process of the catch state. “Catch” is the state where some invertebrate muscles sustain high tension for long periods at low ATP hydrolysis rates.

Invertebrate muscles such as the smooth adductor and byssus retractor muscles of bivalves maintain high tension with little energy expenditure after active contractions (1Rüegg J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1971; 51: 201-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 2Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1990; 96: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This high tension state, called the “catch state,” is terminated by a neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytryptamine (3Twarog B.M. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1954; 44: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PP2B, protein phosphatase 2B; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PP2B, protein phosphatase 2B; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. through an increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. When a catalytic subunit of PKA was added to chemically demembranated catch muscles, the passive tension of the catch state diminished (4Pfitzer G. Rüegg J.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1982; 147: 137-142Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a target protein(s) by this kinase thus causes relaxation of the catch tension. Twitchin is a candidate for this target protein. Originally identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (5Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Morerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Benian G.M. Ayme-Southgate A. Tinley T.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 138: 235-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is also called “mini-titin” and is abundantly present in molluscan muscles (7Vibert P. Edelstein S.M. Castellani L. Elliott Jr., B.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. York M.L. Castellani L. Edelstein S. Elliott B. Nyitray L. Adv. Biophys. 1996; 33: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Studies with the anterior byssus retractor muscle of the mussel suggested that its phosphorylation by PKA was involved in the relaxation of the catch state (9Siegman M.J. Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PKA phosphorylates 2–3 serine residues of the mussel catch muscle twitchin (10Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relaxation of the catch state, the regulation of the reverse reaction, i.e. initiation of the catch state, has not been well characterized yet, since the reaction in vivo seems to occur in parallel with the activation of muscle contraction. Therefore, how initiation signals are relayed onward and amplified in cascades and which types of phosphatases dephosphorylate twitchin to initiate the catch state are still not clear. Castellani and Cohen (12Castellani L. Cohen C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that skinned catch muscles, from which endogenous phosphatase was extensively washed out, restored their ability to maintain catch tension following addition of exogenous bovine calcineurin (12Castellani L. Cohen C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase (13Tonks N.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 747: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) classified as a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) (14Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, calcineurin-like phosphatases might be involved in the regulation of the catch, and they could dephosphorylate the target protein, i.e. twitchin. As Castellani and Cohen (12Castellani L. Cohen C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) describe in their report, however, “a more complicated scheme involving a cascade of kinases/phosphatases is, of course, also possible.” It has not yet been determined whether calcineurin-like phosphatase directly or indirectly dephosphorylates twitchin in catch muscles. By using thick and thin filaments isolated from catch muscles of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, our group devised a powerful assay based on direct visualization of the binding of thin filaments to thick filaments in vitro under conditions corresponding to the catch state (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These in vitro experiments are much more useful than those using muscle fibers to identify components essential for the catch state and to reveal phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades relaying signals onward since the catch state can be reconstituted with purified proteins, and each interaction is separately analyzed without interference of other components. Indeed, our group showed that the myofilament components essential for the catch state are myosin, twitchin, and actin, whereas other components such as paramyosin, catchin (16Yamada A. Yoshio M. Oiwa K. Nyitay L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and tropomyosin are not (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By extending this in vitro reconstitution assay, we have now clarified the relationship between the extent of twitchin phosphorylation and the binding of actin filaments to thick filaments, and we have determined the type of phosphatase involved in the initiation of the catch state based on the degree of inhibition of its initiation by phosphatase inhibitors. In addition, purified twitchin is dephosphorylated by PP2B, and this dephosphorylation is coupled with the initiation of the catch state in vitro. With this study, together with the previous one (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we have completely reconstituted the catch-relaxation cycle by using only the purified and characterized proteins myosin, twitchin, actin, PKA, PP2B, and calmodulin, and we completely clarified the regulation scheme of the catch contraction. Proteins—The soluble protein fraction was prepared from the byssus retractor and posterior smooth adductor muscles of M. galloprovincialis. The muscles were homogenized in buffer A containing 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 20 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.0). After centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was extensively dialyzed against buffer A, and the soluble protein fraction was obtained as the supernatant of the same centrifugation. Contaminated myosin and twitchin were removed as described elsewhere (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Synthetic thick filaments were prepared from the precipitate of the muscle homogenate after the extraction of the soluble protein fraction. The precipitate was extracted by using 0.4 m KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 30 min, 5 volumes of cold water were added to the supernatant. The formed filaments were collected by the same centrifugation, and the precipitate was dissolved in the same solution. Synthetic thick filaments were obtained by dialysis of this solution against buffer A without stirring. They were treated to be in either the relaxed or catch state as follows. To prepare synthetic thick filaments in the relaxed state, the filaments (2–3 mg/ml) were first mixed with the soluble protein fraction (about 0.1 mg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 10-5m cAMP. After 1 h at room temperature (24 °C), the filaments were collected by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 20 min and suspended in buffer A. To prepare synthetic thick filaments in the catch state, the filaments and the soluble protein fraction were first mixed in the presence of about 10-5m free Ca2+. After 1 h at room temperature, an excess amount of EGTA was added to reduce the free Ca2+ concentration to about 10-7m, and the filaments were collected by centrifugation and suspended in buffer A. Myosin and twitchin were purified from the same muscles as described elsewhere (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Myosin filaments were again made by dialysis. To get twitchin in the catch state (the dephosphorylated state), it was first mixed with the soluble protein fraction in the presence of about 10-5m free Ca2+, and after 1 h, the excess EGTA was added as mentioned above. The mixture was applied to a Mono S HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Twitchin was eluted stepwise by 0.22 m NaCl in the same solution and then dialyzed against buffer A. In Vitro Reconstitution Assay of Catch State—In vitro reconstitution assay was performed basically as reported elsewhere (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Binding of actin filaments to thick filaments in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration (<10-7m) was observed under a light microscope. Thick filaments were first suspended in 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, and 10 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and then mixed with actin filaments of rabbit skeletal muscle (2 μg/ml) labeled with TRITC phalloidin (Sigma, P-1951). After 2 min at room temperature, the mixture was observed under a light microscope (IX-70, Olympus) with an oil immersion objective (PlanApo, ×100, N.A. 0.5–1.35, Olympus) and an SIT camera (C-2400–08, Hamamatsu Photonics). Thick filaments and actin filaments were observed under dark field illumination with an oil immersion condenser lens (DC-W, Olympus) and fluorescence illumination with a WIG filter set (Olympus), respectively. Actin filaments bound to thick filaments in the catch state but they did not in the relaxed state. The following “catch treatment” was used to convert thick filaments from the relaxed to catch state. They were mixed with either the soluble protein fraction of muscle (about 0.2 mg/ml protein) or 0.2 μm bovine calcineurin (Sigma, C-1907) and 2 μm bovine calmodulin (Sigma, P-2277) in the presence of 10-5m free Ca2+. After 10 min at room temperature, an excess amount of EGTA was added to terminate the treatment. Conversely, the following “relaxation treatment” was used to convert thick filaments from the catch to relaxed state. They were mixed with either the soluble protein fraction (0.2 mg/ml protein) or 2 μg/ml bovine PKA (Sigma, P-5511) in the presence of 10-5m cAMP and 1–4 mm ATP. In autoradiography experiments, [γ-32P]ATP was added in the relaxation treatment. The mixture was kept at room temperature for 10 min. The inhibitors of kinase and phosphatase used in this study were purchased from the following: okadaic acid (Wako, 150-01653), microcystin LR (Wako, 136-12241), cyclosporin A (Alexis Biochemicals, 380-002-M100), FK506 (Calbiochem, 342500), calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (Sigma, C-3937), and the peptide inhibitor of PKA (Sigma, P-0300). Gel Electrophoresis and Autoradiography—SDS-PAGE was performed under the discontinuous buffer system (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). After the gel was dried, it was exposed to an x-ray film (Fuji, RX-U) with intensifying screens at -80 °C for 2–4 days and developed. Reconstitution of Catch State Using Synthetic Thick Filaments—In our previous study, the catch state was reconstituted by using native thick filaments, and nearly half of them did not bind to fluorescence-labeled actin filaments tightly in the catch state (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity of the native thick filaments can lead to misinterpretation of the results of the in vitro catch assay, so we needed an assay system that would enable us to judge the state more clearly and easily. We prepared synthetic thick filaments after high salt extraction of the precipitate of the muscle homogenate (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). They consisted of the main components of native thick filaments twitchin, myosin (a heavy chain and light chains), catchin (16Yamada A. Yoshio M. Oiwa K. Nyitay L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and paramyosin, with a small amount of actin (Fig. 4B, lane 1). They were observed as bundles of long filaments (see Fig. 1, for example) with a dark field light microscope. When they were pretreated with the soluble protein fraction of muscles and cAMP (i.e. relaxation treatment; see “Experimental Procedures” for details), they did not bind to fluorescence-labeled actin filaments in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1A, left panels, relaxed state). After treatment with the soluble protein fraction and Ca2+ (i.e. catch treatment), they bound to actin filaments (Fig. 1A, middle panels, catch state), and subsequent relaxation treatment caused detachment of actin filaments (Fig. 1A, right panels, relaxed state) under the same solution conditions. These results are essentially the same as those for the native thick filaments (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating that the synthetic ones reproduced the catch and relaxed states of muscle. Furthermore, they did not show the heterogeneity found in the native thick filaments; all bundles bound to many actin filaments in the catch state and bound to almost none in the relaxed state. The difference between the catch and relaxed states was thus more evident with the synthetic thick filaments (as indicated in a comparison of Fig. 1A with Fig. 2 of Ref. 15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used synthetic thick filaments for our in vitro studies of the catch state.Fig. 1Initiation and termination of the catch state of the synthetic thick filaments using the soluble protein fraction.A, when the synthetic thick filaments in the relaxed state were mixed with fluorescence-labeled actin filaments, they did not bind in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration (left). After catch treatment with the soluble protein fraction (SF) of muscle, they bound to actin filaments (center), and further relaxation treatment made them detached from actin filaments under the same solution condition (right). B, when the catch treatment was performed with the diluted soluble protein fraction (from “1/1” to “1/8,” indicating the amount of the soluble protein fraction), the degree of binding depended on the amount of the soluble protein fraction. Without the soluble protein fraction (0), there was no binding, the same as before treatment. Each observation consists of a dark field image (upper) and a fluorescence image (lower) in the same field of view; and the bar indicates 20 μm in A and 30 μm in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2Effects of phosphatase inhibitors on the initiation of the catch state. Catch treatment of the synthetic thick filaments with the soluble protein fraction was performed in the presence of various concentrations of okadaic acid (A) and microcystin LR (B) and in the presence of 1 μm cyclosporin A (C, left), 1 μm FK506 (C, center), and 0.2 mm calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (C, right). After the treatment, the binding of fluorescent actin filaments to thick filaments in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration was assayed. Each observation consists of two images, as in Fig. 1, and the bar indicates 20 μm in all photographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of Phosphatase Inhibitors on Initiation of Catch State—At the termination of the catch state in vivo, the intracellular cAMP concentration increases and PKA is activated (4Pfitzer G. Rüegg J.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1982; 147: 137-142Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent studies with skinned muscle fibers (9Siegman M.J. Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and in vitro reconstitution systems (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation of twitchin controls the catch state. These studies also suggest that twitchin is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases during the initiation of the catch state. In our in vitro assay system, the initiation of the catch state occurred during the catch treatment (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), so dephosphorylation of twitchin should have occurred during the catch treatment. To identify which types of phosphatases work during the initiation of the catch state using the in vitro assay system, we studied the effects of several types of phosphatase inhibitors during catch treatment on the binding of actin filaments to synthetic thick filaments. Some phosphatase inhibitors, such as okadaic acid and microcystin LR, inhibit different types of phosphatases at particular concentrations. The concentrations (Ki values) of okadaic acid where phosphatase activity is inhibited to half are 150 nm for protein phosphatase 1, 0.032 nm for protein phosphatase 2A, and 5 μm for PP2B (18Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). The Ki values of microcystin LR are 0.05 nm for protein phosphatase 1, 0.008 nm for protein phosphatase 2A, and 200 nm for PP2B (19MacKintosh C. Beattie K.A. Klumpp S. Cohen P. Codd G.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). These inhibitors do not inhibit protein phosphatase 2C. Thus, the concentrations of these inhibitors where the activity becomes about half would suggest the type of phosphatase involved. When the catch treatment was performed with a smaller amount of soluble protein fraction, fewer actin filaments bound to the synthetic thick filaments (Fig. 1B). When the phosphatase activity was about ¼, only a few actin filaments bound to synthetic thick filaments. The catch treatment was then performed in the presence of various concentrations of either okadaic acid (Fig. 2A) or microcystin LR (Fig. 2B). Only a few actin filaments bound when the catch treatment was performed in the presence of 50 μm okadaic acid or 1 μm microcystin LR. Thus, the Ki values for okadaic acid and microcystin LR were estimated to be about 20 and 0.5 μm, respectively. These results indicate that PP2B is most likely involved in the initiation of the catch state. To confirm the involvement of PP2B, we studied the effects of specific inhibitors for PP2B. Cyclosporin A and FK506 bind to and specifically inhibit PP2B in the presence of immunophilins (20Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3586) Google Scholar). Calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide is a specific inhibitor for PP2B (21Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, actin filaments did not bind to thick filaments after the catch treatment in the presence of 1 μm cyclosporin A, 1 μm FK506, or 0.2 mm calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that immunophilins were present in the Mytilus catch muscles, and PP2B was involved in the initiation of the catch state. The fact that Ca2+ is required for the initiation of the catch state (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is consistent with this, since PP2B is a Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase (13Tonks N.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 747: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It should be noted that after the catch treatment without these phosphatase inhibitors, actin filaments bound to synthetic thick filaments even in the presence of these inhibitors (data not shown). The results indicate that these inhibitors did not inhibit the binding of actin filaments in the catch state but did inhibit the initiation of the catch state. Although the above results indicate that PP2B is involved in the initiation of the catch state, it is not clear whether PP2B and its activator calmodulin (13Tonks N.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 747: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are the only components in the soluble protein fraction of muscles essential for the initiation of the catch state. We thus performed the catch treatment with bovine calcineurin and calmodulin instead of the soluble protein fraction. We found that actin filaments again bound to synthetic thick filaments. Further relaxation treatment with bovine PKA terminated the catch state (Fig. 3). Thus, PP2B and calmodulin are essential components in the soluble protein fraction for the initiation of the catch state, and PKA is essential for its termination. It should be noted that the initiation of the catch state by PP2B and calmodulin did not require ATP. Protein Phosphorylation during Termination and Initiation of Catch State—To study protein phosphorylation during the termination and initiation of the catch state, we first prepared synthetic thick filaments in the catch state. The state was identified by observing the binding of actin filaments to the filaments in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 4A, panel 1). These synthetic thick filaments were considered to be in the dephosphorylated state. Subsequent relaxation treatment with the soluble protein fraction made actin filaments detached from the thick filaments (Fig. 4A, panel 2). The catch state was restored by the following catch treatment with the soluble protein fraction, resulting in the binding of actin filaments to the synthetic thick filaments (Fig. 4A, panel 4). The same results were obtained with bovine heart PKA in the relaxation treatment (Fig. 4A, panel 3) and with bovine calcineurin and calmodulin in the catch treatment (Fig. 4A, panel 5), instead of the soluble protein fraction. To examine which protein components were phosphorylated, the same relaxation treatments were performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, experiments revealed that twitchin, myosin heavy chain, catchin, and paramyosin were phosphorylated, whereas the myosin light chains were not (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). Twitchin was the most phosphorylated in both experiments, which is consistent with the results for skinned catch muscle fibers (9Siegman M.J. Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After the relaxation treatment in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, catch treatment was performed. Note that [γ-32P]ATP still existed in the medium during this catch treatment. Following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography experiments revealed that twitchin was dephosphorylated, whereas the other proteins were not, and that the myosin light chains were not phosphorylated (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that dephosphorylation of twitchin is correlated to the initiation of the catch state and that the phosphorylation of other proteins such as myosin, catchin, and paramyosin are not involved in the regulation of the catch state. Effects of Kinase and Phosphatase Inhibitors on Phosphorylation—We examined the effects of a specific inhibitor of PKA to confirm the type of kinase in the soluble protein fraction that is responsible for phosphorylation of twitchin. When a peptide inhibitor of PKA (22Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added during relaxation treatment, actin filaments did not bind to synthetic thick filaments (data not shown). Autoradiography experiments showed that in the presence of this inhibitor, twitchin was not phosphorylated (Fig. 5A), whereas myosin and catchin were to some extent. The phosphorylations of myosin and catchin were thus due to other types of kinases. Dephosphorylation of twitchin during catch treatment was inhibited by 100 μm okadaic acid, 2 μm microcystin LR, 1 μm cyclosporin A, 1 μm FK506, or 0.2 mm calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (Fig. 5B). Because the catch treatment with these inhibitors failed to initiate the catch state in the in vitro reconstitution assays (see above), the results are consistent with the conclusion that dephosphorylation of twitchin initiates the catch state. It should be noted that twitchin was doublet bands in the SDS gels (Fig. 4). The band of higher mobility seemed to be a proteolytic product (see below). Even in its presence, synthetic thick filaments showed both the catch and relaxed states, as mentioned above. Reconstitution of Catch State and Protein Phosphorylation with Purified Myosin and Twitchin—As reported previously (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), actin filaments bind to thick filaments of purified myosin and twitchin in the catch state. We performed autoradiography experiments with these purified proteins to exclude possible effects of other components that the synthetic thick filament preparation contains. Twitchin was first treated with the soluble protein fraction and Ca2+ and was retrieved using Mono S cation-exchange chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). This treatment putatively dephosphorylated twitchin. When myosin filaments were mixed with this twitchin, they bound fluorescent actin filaments in the presence of MgATP at a low free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6A, panel 1). After relaxation treatment with the soluble protein fraction, only a few actin filaments bound to the thick filaments (Fig. 6A, panel 2). Further catch treatment with the soluble protein fraction restored the binding of actin filaments to thick filaments (Fig. 6A, panel 4). Bovine PKA was substituted for the soluble protein fraction in the relaxation treatment (Fig. 6A, panel 3). Further catch treatment with bovine calcineurin and calmodulin resulted in binding of actin filaments to the thick filaments (Fig. 6A, panel 5). Autoradiography experiments under the same conditions, but [γ-32P]ATP was added during the relaxation treatment, showed that twitchin was phosphorylated during the relaxation treatment and dephosphorylated during the catch treatment (Fig. 6B, Myosin + twitchin). These results were the same as those obtained with synthetic thick filaments containing paramyosin and catchin (see above). Such phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of twitchin was also observed without myosin (Fig. 6B, Twitchin). Overexposure of the SDS gel to the film (Fig. 6B, bottom panel) showed that the myosin heavy chain either with or without twitchin was slightly phosphorylated by the soluble protein fraction. However, no phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain was found with treatments with the bovine enzymes. This confirms that the phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain was due to kinases other than PKA and that this phosphorylation was not involved in the regulation of the catch state. It should be noted that purified twitchin was doublet bands and that the band of higher mobility in the SDS gel became thicker after the catch treatment with the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 6B, lane 4). The proteolysis was apparently because of Ca2+-dependent proteases in the soluble fraction. Such proteolysis was not found in the catch treatment with bovine calcineurin and calmodulin (Fig. 6B, lane 5). The same experiments were performed using myosin filaments alone (Fig. 6B, “Myosin”). The in vitro reconstitution assays revealed that they bound to no actin filaments even after the catch treatment (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The myosin heavy chain was slightly phosphorylated by treatment with the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 4) but was not phosphorylated with the bovine enzymes (lanes 3 and 5). Myosin light chains were not phosphorylated at all in any of the steps (data not shown). Reconstitution Assay of Catch State with Synthetic Thick Filaments—In this study we used synthetic thick filaments for reconstituting the catch state instead of native thick filaments, nearly half of which did not bind to actin filaments even in the catch state (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This previous observation might have been because of the heterogeneity of thick filaments or cells in muscle. Because the synthetic thick filaments were made by dialysis of the homogeneous solution of muscle proteins, they were also considered to be homogeneous. However, there might be other reasons for the apparent heterogeneity of the native ones. First, in the preparation of the native thick filaments, it was difficult to remove thin filaments completely from the muscle homogenate, and any remaining thin filaments without fluorescence might have occupied some part of the surface of the native thick filaments in the catch state. The present synthetic thick filaments contained only a small amount of actin (Fig. 4B), so more actin filaments with fluorescence could bind to the synthetic thick filaments than did to the native filaments. Second, it is well known that native thick filaments of catch muscles contain a much larger amount of paramyosin than myosin in their cores (23Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 56: 239-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 24Levine R.J.C. Elfvin M. Dewey M.M. Walcott B. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, the present synthetic thick filaments contained approximately equal amounts of paramyosin and myosin (Fig. 4B), and as we showed, paramyosin is not involved in the catch state. The density of myosin molecules in the synthetic thick filaments should be higher than in native ones, so the synthetic ones should have greater ability to bind to actin filaments in the catch state. In addition, they tended to form bundles, and these bundles were easier to observe with a dark field light microscope. These factors indicate that reconstitution assay of the catch state with synthetic thick filaments is more sensitive than that with native ones. Future examination of possible catch-like properties in other types of muscles should thus use synthetic thick filaments rather than native ones. PP2B Dephosphorylates Twitchin in Catch Muscles—Castellani and Cohen (12Castellani L. Cohen C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that although chemically skinned catch muscles lose their calcineurin-like phosphatase and their ability to maintain catch tension with extensive washing, the ability is restored by adding bovine brain calcineurin. They concluded that calcineurin-like phosphatase is required for catch contraction. Because the catch state is terminated by PKA (4Pfitzer G. Rüegg J.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1982; 147: 137-142Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), its reverse reaction, dephosphorylation, is required for the initiation of the catch state. Experiments with skinned muscles suggested that phosphorylation of twitchin is correlated with the relaxation of the catch state (9Siegman M.J. Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5383-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that purified twitchin is phosphorylated by PKA (10Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the target of the PKA is twitchin, the phosphorylation of which terminates the catch state of molluscan muscles. As for the reverse reaction, calcineurin-like phosphatase PP2B can apparently dephosphorylate twitchin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. However, no direct evidence has been presented that twitchin is the direct target for PP2B. A more complicated phosphatase cascade such as shown in vertebrate skeletal muscles was also possible. In vertebrate skeletal muscles, the activity of protein phosphatase 1 is regulated by a protein termed “inhibitor 1.” This protein is phosphorylated by PKA and dephosphorylated by PP2B, and its phosphorylated form inhibits protein phosphatase 1. Thus, PP2B dephosphorylates phosphoinhibitor 1 activating protein phosphatase 1, which dephosphorylates other phosphoproteins such as phosphorylase a (25Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that low concentrations of okadaic acid or microcystin LR, enough to inhibit protein phosphatase 1, did not affect the initiation of the catch state (Fig. 2, A and B). This indicates that the phosphatase cascade of PP2B and protein phosphatase 1, as found in vertebrate skeletal muscles (25Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), does not initiate the catch state. We also found that inhibitors specific to PP2B such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide inhibited dephosphorylation of twitchin and initiation of the catch state. This indicates that phosphatases other than PP2B do not dephosphorylate twitchin, initiating the catch state. In addition, we succeeded in initiating the catch state with myosin, twitchin, actin, bovine brain calcineurin (PP2B), and its activator calmodulin. In this step, twitchin was dephosphorylated, and this dephosphorylation occurred even without myosin. These results indicate that twitchin is the direct target of PP2B and that its dephosphorylation initiates the catch state. Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation Cycle Caused by PKA and PP2B—Our in vitro studies have clarified not only the protein components essential for the catch state and its regulation but also their relationships during the contraction-catchrelaxation cycle of the muscle. These components are actin, myosin, twitchin, PKA, PP2B, and calmodulin, and their relationships are summarized in Fig. 7. Twitchin is associated with myosin filaments (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the relaxed state, twitchin is phosphorylated, and actin filaments are dissociated from the myosin filaments. When the muscle is stimulated by acetylcholine, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration increases, and the Ca2+ activates not only myosin but also the PP2B. Thus, the active PP2B directly dephosphorylates twitchin during active contraction of the muscle. It should be noted that the present study showed no other component is required for this dephosphorylation. Cessation of the stimulation results in a decrease in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, which terminates the motile activity of the myosin molecules. Because twitchin is in the dephosphorylated state at this time, actin filaments tightly bind to the myosin filaments (the catch state). Phosphorylation of twitchin by the active PKA causes dissociation of the actin filaments from the myosin filaments, resulting in the termination of the catch state (the relaxed state). The two second messengers, cAMP and Ca2+, have the opposite effects in terms of the regulation of the catch state. If they simultaneously increase in catch muscle cells, both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of twitchin are promoted, resulting in the waste of ATP consumption. In bovine heart, PKA phosphorylates and inhibits cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase that breaks down cAMP. When the intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases, PP2B dephosphorylates and activates the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, resulting in a decrease in the cAMP concentration (26Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 241-247Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear whether such a system also works in catch muscles, it could be effective for precisely regulating the catch and preventing the waste of ATP consumption. Functions of Twitchin in Muscles—In vitro reconstitution experiments have revealed that twitchin is essential for the catch state (15Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Twitchin, or mini-titin, is a member of the titin/connectin family present in nematodes (5Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Morerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Benian G.M. Ayme-Southgate A. Tinley T.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 138: 235-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and molluscs (7Vibert P. Edelstein S.M. Castellani L. Elliott Jr., B.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. York M.L. Castellani L. Edelstein S. Elliott B. Nyitray L. Adv.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The family also includes arthropod projectin and vertebrate titin/connectin. Their amino acid sequences show that they contain one protein kinase domain that has a primary sequence similar to that of vertebrate smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase near their C terminus (5Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Morerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Benian G.M. Ayme-Southgate A. Tinley T.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because of this similarity and because bacterially expressed Aplysia twitchin kinase domain phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chains (28Heierhorst J. Probst W.C. Kohanski R.A. Buku A. Weiss K.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), their physiological substrates are considered to be myosin regulatory light chains. In our in vitro reconstitution experiments, however, we found no incorporation of 32P into the myosin light chains during either the relaxation or the catch treatment (Fig. 4B). Thus, the kinase activity of twitchin, if it exists, is not related to the regulation of the catch state. The physiological role of its putative kinase activity remains to be clarified."

The beneficial action of these agents likely involves rapid elimination of the nephrotoxic agents from the kidney by promoting diuresis. Adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) subtype present on renal proximal tubular epithelial and cortical collecting duct cells mediates the antidiuretic and cytoprotective actions of adenosine. These receptors are induced by activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, a transcription factor reported to mediate hyperosmotic stress-induced cytoprotection in renal medullary cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that induction of the A1AR in renal proximal tubular cells by NF-κB contributes to the cytoprotection afforded by osmotic diuretics. Exposure of porcine renal proximal tubular epithelial (LLC-PK1) cells to mannitol or NaCl produced a significant increase in A1AR. This increase was preceded by adenosine release and NF-κB activation. Expression of an IκB-α mutant, which acts as a superrepressor of NF-κB, abrogated the increase in A1AR. Cells exposed to mannitol demonstrated increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was attenuated by inhibiting xanthine oxidase with allopurinol. Allopurinol attenuated both the increase in A1AR expression and NF-κB activation produced by osmotic diuretics, indicating a role of adenosine metabolites in these processes. Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with cisplatin (8 μm) resulted in apoptosis, which was attenuated by mannitol but exacerbated by selective A1AR blockade. Administration of mannitol to mice increases A1AR expression and activation of NF-κB in renal cortical sections. Taken together, these data provide novel mechanisms of nephroprotection by osmotic diuretics, involving both activation and induction of the A1AR, the latter mediated through activation of a xanthine oxidase pathway leading to ROS generation and promoting activation of NF-κB.

Osmotic diuretic agents, such as mannitol are used in the prophylaxis of acute renal failure induced by antineoplastic agents (1Anand A.J. Bashey B. Ann. Pharmacother. 1993; 27: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), even though they have been supplemented recently by other agents. The beneficial action of osmotic diuretics derives from a reduction in time the nephrotoxic drugs are in contact with the renal tubules (2Daugaard G. Abildgaard U. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. Bruunshuus I.

Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Osmotic diuretics also induce a number of genes that aid in cell survival, including those for heat shock proteins, and genes involved in the synthesis of osmolytes, such as aldose reductase, betaine transporter, and the sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporter (5Sugihara K.

The induction of these genes is mediated by components of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAP kinase (7Wojtaszek P.A.

In general, the studies described above have all used high osmotic stressors to induce proteins of interest in renal medullary cells, since these cells are subjected to a relatively high osmotic environment in vivo during periods of water deprivation. The renal proximal tubules represent a primary site of action of osmotic diuretic agents. It is highly permeable to water, and as such, reabsorption of water is essentially isotonic. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, are actively transported into proximal tubular cells (11Safirstein R. Miller P. Guttenplan J.B.

The concentration of the antineoplastic agent, cisplatin, in the proximal tubular epithelial cells exceeds plasma concentrations by a factor of 5 (13Kuhlmann M.K. Burkhardt G. Kohler H. Nephrol.

We have recently shown that cisplatin administration increased the expression of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR) in different regions of the kidney, including the proximal tubule (14Bhat S.G. Mishra S. Mei Y. Nie Z. Whitworth C.A. Rybak L.P. Ramkumar V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 442: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), presumably via activation of NF-κB (15Nie Z. Mei Y. Ford M. Rybak L. Marcuzzi A. Ren H. Stiles G.L. Ramkumar V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes show differential localization in the kidney. Specific receptor expression is demonstrated in different nephron segments, such as the glomeruli, the thick ascending limb and collecting duct (16McCoy D.E. Bhattacharya S. Olson B.A. Levier D.G. Arend L.J. Spielman W.S. Semin. Nephrol. 1993; 13: 31-40PubMed Google Scholar) and the proximal tubules (17Coulson R. Proch P.S. Olsson R.A. Chalfant C.E. Cooper D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F263-F274PubMed Google Scholar). In the proximal tubule and the cortical collecting duct, adenosine stimulates the transport of sodium and phosphate via the apical surface (18Coulson R. Johnson R.A. Olsson R.A. Cooper D.R. Scheinman S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F921-F928PubMed Google Scholar), that of sodium and bicarbonate via the basolateral symporters (19Takeda M. Yoshitomi K. Imai M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F511-F519PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulates chloride channel activity (20Schwiebert E.M. Karlson K.H. Friedman P.A. Dietl P. Spielman W.S. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 834-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As such, a primary physiological role of renal adenosine is believed to be antidiuresis, mediated through activation of proximal tubule A1AR coupled to reabsorptive transport processes (21Balakrishnan V.S. Coles G.A. Williams J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F504-F510PubMed Google Scholar, 22Knight R.J. Bowmer C.J. Yates M.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to determine whether exposure to osmotic diuretics could induce A1AR in proximal tubular epithelial cells and whether activation of A1ARs could contribute to the protective action of mannitol against drug-induced nephrotoxicity. LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in renal epithelial growth media (REGM) supplemented with 0.5% serum, specifically formulated for renal epithelial cells. Cultures were maintained as monolayers on 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks/well plates at 37 °C, in 5% CO2, 95% ambient air, with the medium being replaced every 2-3 days. Male C57BL/6 mice (6-8-week-old) obtained from Harlan Laboratory (Indianapolis, IN) and were maintained on pulverized food and water. Animals were used according to the guidelines approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, followed by retro-orbital sinus injection of mannitol (0.8 g/ml/kg body weight) or an equal volume of saline (controls). Animals were sacrificed after 2 h (for NF-κB activity) or 20 h (for A1AR expression) by isoflurane inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Kidneys were removed, and the cortices were dissected out, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Cells were treated with mannitol for 24 h and subsequently harvested for radioligand binding assay. Cells were detached in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm EDTA and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin (Buffer A). This was followed by homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) at setting 7 for 40 s at 4 °C. Membranes were obtained by centrifugation of the homogenates at 2,000 × g for 10 min, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 40,000 × g for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended in Buffer A to yield a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The membrane suspensions were then treated with adenosine deaminase (5 units/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to eliminate endogenously released adenosine. Quantitation of A1AR was performed using the tritiated antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX) and the iodinated agonist radioligand N6-(4-aminobenzyl)-9-[5-(methylcarbonyl)-β-d-ribofuranosyl] adenine (125I-AB-MECA). For these assays, membrane preparations (∼40 μg of protein) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with either radioligand in the absence or presence of theophylline (1 mm) (for [3H]DPCPX binding) or 10 μm DPCPX (for 125I-AB-MECA binding) in order to define nonspecific binding. The total incubation volume was 250 μl. Samples were then filtered through polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GF/B glass-fiber filters using a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) and washed with 9 ml of ice cold Buffer A (without protease inhibitors), containing 0.01% CHAPS. Bound radioactivity was determined using either a scintillation or gamma counter. Isolation of total RNA was performed using TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) and selection of poly (A+) messenger RNA, using oligo (dT)-cellulose was performed as described previously (23Davis G.D. Dibner M.D. Batte J.F. Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 139-142Google Scholar). For PCR studies total RNA (1 μg each) was reverse-transcribed using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 15 μl. Five microliters of each of the reaction volumes were used for PCR amplification. Primers used include the canine A1AR consensus protein sequence ILGNULU (sense) and FALCWLP (antisense) and predictably generated a 770-bp fragment (24Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR were performed in a total volume of 50 ml using 2.5 mm MgCl2, using 36 amplification cycles. The amplified products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels, which were subsequently denatured, neutralized and transferred to nylon filters for Southern blot analysis. Filters were UV cross-linked and prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in a mixture containing 50% formamide, 6× SSC (20× SSC = 175 g NaCl, 88 g sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's (50× = 0.25 volumes of 4% bovine serum albumin, 0.25 volumes of 4% polyvinylpyrolidine, 0.25 volumes of 4% Ficoll, 0.25 volumes of dH2O, 0.5% sodium pyrophosphate), 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, using 1 × 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled A1AR cDNA probe. Hybridizations were performed by shaking blots in a waterbath at 42 °C for 16-20 h. Following hybridization, blots were washed twice (15 min each) at room temperature in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice (20 min each) with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 62 °C. The relative band intensities were determined by densitometric scanning on the GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) after exposing the blots to the imager screen for 1 h. For Northern blotting experiments, poly(A+) RNA samples (5 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/MOPS/formamide gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and cross-linked in Stratagene UV crosslinker. Prehybridization mixtures contained 5× SSC, 2× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide. Hybridization mixtures (10 ml) were essentially the same, except for the Denhardt's concentration being 2.5×, and the added 32P-radiolabeled canine cDNA probes encoding the A1AR at concentrations of 0.5-1 × 106 cpm/ml. Hybridization and washing conditions were similar as described for Southern blotting. Image was visualized and quantitated using a densitometric scanner (as above). These blots were stripped and reprobed with labeled cDNA probe encoding the human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for normalization. Intracellular production of free radicals (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) was detected in LLC-PK1 using 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) (25Caro A. Puntarlo S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1291: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Perez-Garcia F. Marin E. Canigueral S. Adzet T. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Ripple M.O. Henry W.F. Rago R.P. Wilding G. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on sterile 12-mm glass coverslips at 400 cells/mm2 in individual wells of 24-well tissue culture plates. The cells were treated with 100 mm mannitol (Sigma), in the absence and presence of 250 μm allopurinol (Sigma) for 24 h. Coverslips were washed with PBS and the cells loaded with H2DCFDA by incubating in 5 μm H2DCFDA for 20 min at 37 °C and washed with PBS. The cultures were analyzed for green fluorescence 1 h later using an Olympus fluorview confocal laser-scanning microscope using argon laser and a ×40 objective. LLC-PK1 cells were cultured to ∼20-40% confluency and transfected with a mixture containing 100-250 ng of plasmid DNA, 500-650 ng of carrier DNA and 3 μl/g DNA of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Lipofectin) in a volume of 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The mixtures were incubated for 45-60 min at room temperature and then added to the culture plate. After ∼6 h, regular renal epithelial growth media (supplemented with 0.5% serum medium) were added to the plate, and it was returned to the incubator for 24 h. For luciferase assays, cells were then lysed using 50 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and centrifuged at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 × g. The extract was used immediately or stored at -70 °C. Twenty microliters of cell extract was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent at room temperature and the chemiluminescent signal was determined in a luminometer using 1 min counts. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells and renal cortices as described previously (15Nie Z. Mei Y. Ford M. Rybak L. Marcuzzi A. Ren H. Stiles G.L. Ramkumar V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were suspended in Buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 s, and the cytosolic extract was separated. The nuclear pellet was washed with excess volume of Buffer B and then resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After incubating for 5 min at 4 °C with rotation, the extracts were centrifuged (5000 × g, 1 min), and the supernatant was used for DNA binding activity analyses. Nuclear extracts were incubated with double strand-specific κB oligonucleotide (5′-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (28Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Similar electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using a labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) for the AP-1 transcription factor binding sequence. Incubations were performed at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 15 μl of buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCL, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10,000 cpm of the labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels, performed with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (4.5 mm Tris, 4.5 mm boric acid, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Bands were imaged using the Phosphorimager and analyzed using Optiquant software. AnnexinV-FITC Assay—Cells were washed with PBS and harvested using 1 ml of 0.5% of trypsin/EDTA solution at 37 °C. Cells were then centrifuged at 220 × g for 5 min and immediately resuspended in the medium. Cells (∼5 × 10-5 cells/ml) were then incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature with 10 μl of media binding agent and 1.25 μl of a FITC conjugate of Alexa/5. Cells were next centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold 1× binding buffer (HEPES, NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, bovine serum albumin). Propidium iodide (10 μl) was then added, and samples were placed on ice away from light and analyzed immediately. Quantification of Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide signals was performed by a flow cell based bench top FACS Calibur Cytometer (BD Biosciences) with excitation wavelength of 488 nm and transmission wavelengths of 515-545 nm. Early apoptotic cells are reported in the lower right-hand quadrant of the dot plot, while necrotic or late apoptotic cells are reported in the upper right-hand quadrant of the plot. LLC-PK1 cells were also examined by fluorescence microscopy (using a Olympus fluorview confocal laser-scanning microscope), equipped with Argon (488 nm) and Krypton (568 nm) lasers for green and red fluorescence, respectively. Phase contrast images were observed using transmitted light. Apoptotic cells were detected as bright apple green, while necrotic cells appear with various intensities of yellow-red throughout the cytoplasm. Viable cells remain unstained. TUNEL Assay—Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was confirmed using the TUNEL assays, as detailed by the manufacturer. For this assay, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, pretreated with either vehicle or mannitol, and then treated with either vehicle or cisplatin for an additional 24 h. The monolayers were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized by addition of 100 μl of 20 μg/ml proteinase K solution (in Tris buffer at pH 8) at room temperature for 5 min, followed by incubation with 100 μl of 0.3% H2O2 at room temperature for 5 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. Monolayers were incubated with 100 μl of 1× terminal deoxythymidine (TdT) equilibration buffer at room temperature for 10-30 min, followed by incubation with TdT enzyme mix for 1.5-2 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of stop solution (0.5 m EDTA, pH 8) at room temperature for 5 min, followed by rinsing the cells with 1× TBS. Cells were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% bovine serum albumin, followed by addition of 100 μl of 1× dilution of peroxidase strepavidin for 30 min at room temperature in humidified chamber. Coverslips were then incubated with 100 μl of 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine solution for 5 min and then rinsed with distilled water. Methyl green counterstain solution was then added for 3 min, the excess stain drained off, and the samples rinsed three times with distilled water. DNase (1 μg/μl) in 1× TBS/1 mm MgSO4 was used to generate a true control. For the negative control, treatment with the TdT reaction mix was replaced by distilled H2O. LLC-PK1 cells were cultured and treated as described in the figure legends. Following specific treatments, cultures were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After two more washes with phosphate-buffered saline, nonspecific binding was reduced by exposing cover slips for 5 min with a solution containing 5% normal donkey serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. The cells were treated with A1AR monoclonal antibody, diluted 1:20 in 5% normal donkey serum along with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing four times in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were treated for 1 h with donkey anti-mouse IgG labeled with rhodamine (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:100 in 5% normal donkey serum, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. After four rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides using Aquamount. The cells were observed for red color on an Olympus confocal microscope using Krytpon (568 nm) laser and a ×40 objective. Protein concentrations were determined by the established Bradford protein assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin to prepare standard curves. Saturation curves and competition curves were analyzed by a computer-assisted curve fitting program (Graph PAD Prism Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical analyses were performed by the analysis of variance. Characterization of the Adenosine A1Receptor in LLC-PK1Cells—The presence of the A1 and A2AAR in LLC-PK1 cells have been determined by functional assays (30LeVier D.G. McCoy D.E. Spielman W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C729-C735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no studies to date have demonstrated the existence of AR subtypes in these cells by radioligand binding experiments or molecular biology techniques. Therefore, initial studies characterized the A1AR in membrane preparations obtained from LLC-PK1 cells by radioligand binding assays using the agonist radioligand 125I-N6-(4-aminobenzyl)-9-[5-(methylcarbonyl)-β-d-ribofuranosyl]adenine (AB-MECA), along with 10 μm DPCPX to define nonspecific binding. While this radioligand interacts with both the A1 and A3AR (31Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982PubMed Google Scholar), albeit with lower affinity for the latter receptor, the use of DPCPX, a selective antagonist to block the A1AR, provides a simple method for distinguishing this receptor subtype from the A3AR. The data were best fitted according to a one-site model by Graph Pad Prism Software (San Diego, CA), which indicates the receptor number (Bmax) of 42.4 ± 3.1 fmol/mg protein and equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.1 ± 0.3 nm (Fig. 1A). In competition experiments, 125IABMECA binding was inhibited by DPCPX, with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 1.6 ± 0.1 nm, characteristic of the interaction of this drug with the A1AR (Fig. 1B). The inability of DPCPX to completely inhibit 125I-ABMECA binding is indicative of this radioligand also interacting with other ARs (such as the A3AR), which are not targets of DPCPX. Radioligand binding was also inhibited completely by R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA), a relatively selective A1AR agonist, with a Ki of 1.2 ± 0.1 nm (data not shown). This relatively high affinity interaction of R-PIA is also characteristic of its preferential interaction with the A1AR, at lower concentrations, as opposed to the A3AR subtype. Similar to other G-protein-coupled receptors, addition of GTPγS to membrane preparations dramatically reduced the population of the A1AR in the high affinity state, and therefore the level of 125I-AB-MECA. The binding of 125I-AB-MECA was reduced by 37.5 ± 5.3% and 62.2 ± 7.0%, upon incubation of membranes with 0.1 and 10 μm of GTPγS, respectively (data not shown). The presence of A1AR in LLC-PK1 cells was also confirmed by Northern blotting studies (Fig. 1C, upper), using poly(A)+ preparations and a labeled bovine A1AR cDNA probe for detection of the transcript. Polymerase chain reactions were performed, using forward and reverse sequences derived from the canine A1AR cDNA. Primers used include amino acid sequences ILGNVLV (sense) and FALCWLP (antisense) common to the A1AR in several species (24Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences were identified as the A1AR by Southern blotting using a labeled canine A1AR cDNA probe (Fig. 1C). The figure shows the predicted 770-bp PCR fragments derived from the canine A1AR cDNA (lane 1), water blank (lane 2), LLC-PK1 cells (lane 3), rat kidney (lane 4), and testes (lane 5). Immunocytochemical assays, using a monoclonal antibody (32Ochiishi T. Saitoh Y. Yukawa A. Saji M. Ren Y. Shirao T. Miyamoto H. Nakata H. Sekino Y. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 955-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were performed to further determine the presence of A1AR on LLC-PK1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the presence of the A1AR was detected as a fluorescent halo, using confocal microscopy. Mannitol Increases Expression of the Adenosine A1Receptor in LLC-PK1Cells—To determine whether the expression of the A1AR is modulated by hypertonicity, LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to 100 mm mannitol for 24 h, and A1AR levels were determined by radioligand binding assay. Saturation curves performed using 125I-AB-MECA indicate an increase in the number of A1AR in cells exposed to mannitol for 24 h (Fig. 2A). In cells exposed to mannitol, the Bmax was increased from 39.7 ± 1.7 to 65.8 ± 6.0 fmol/mg protein, with no significant change in Kd values. Similar increases in A1AR was obtained when the antagonist radioligand ([3H]DPCPX) was used to quantitate receptor levels (data not shown). LLC-PK1 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of mannitol for 24 h showed dose-dependent increases in receptor number by 90 ± 17, 110 ± 15, and 157 ± 16%, following administration of 50, 100, and 200 mm mannitol, respectively (Fig. 2B). Time course studies indicate significant increases in A1AR at 16 h after addition of mannitol, with further increases observed by 24 h (data not shown). In another series of experiments, addition of NaCl to s"
https://openalex.org/W2085964834,"Biotin is an essential cofactor of cell metabolism serving as a protein-bound coenzyme in ATP-dependent carboxylation, in transcarboxylation, and certain decarboxylation reactions. The involvement of biotinylated proteins in other cellular functions has been suggested occasionally, but available data on this are limited. In the present study, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein was identified that reacts with streptavidin on Western blots and is not identical to one of the known biotinylated yeast proteins. After affinity purification on monomeric avidin, the biotinylated protein was identified as Arc1p. Using 14C-labeled biotin, the cofactor was shown to be incorporated into Arc1p by covalent and alkali-stable linkage. Similar to the known carboxylases, Arc1p biotinylation is mediated by the yeast biotin:protein ligase, Bpl1p. Mutational studies revealed that biotinylation occurs at lysine 86 within the N-terminal domain of Arc1p. In contrast to the known carboxylases, however, in vitro biotinylation of Arc1p is incomplete and increases with BPL1 overexpression. In accordance to this fact, Arc1p lacks the canonical consensus sequence of known biotin binding domains, and the bacterial biotin:protein ligase, BirA, is unable to use Arc1p as a substrate. Arc1p was shown previously to organize the association of MetRS and GluRS tRNA synthetases with their cognate tRNAs thereby increasing the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of these enzymes. Remarkably, not only biotinylated but also the biotin-free Arc1p obtained by replacement of lysine 86 with arginine were capable of restoring Arc1p function in both arc1Δ and arc1Δlos1Δ mutants, indicating that biotinylation of Arc1p is not essential for activity.

Biotin was first identified in 1934 by Kögl and Tönnis (1Kögl F. Tönnis B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1936; 242: 43-48Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) when they were studying the growth requirements of yeast cells in synthetic media. Even though its synthesis is restricted to plants, most bacteria, and certain fungi, the vitamin is now recognized as a general metabolic cofactor required by all forms of life. Like most water-soluble vitamins, biotin serves, in combination with the appropriate apoenzymes, as a coenzyme for a distinct set of catalytic reactions. These biotin-dependent enzymes catalyze key steps in various pathways of primary metabolism such as gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, amino acid metabolism, and energy transduction. At present, three different kinds of biotin-dependent reactions are known (2Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar): (i) ATP-dependent carboxylations such as the conversion of pyruvate or acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate and malonyl-CoA, respectively; (ii) the ATP-independent transcarboxylation of CO2 from a carboxylated donor such as (methyl)malonyl-CoA to an appropriate acceptor such as pyruvate; (iii) the energy-yielding decarboxylation of metabolites such as succinate or oxaloacetate which, in certain bacteria, may be used for anaerobic ATP generation. In all of these enzymes, the carboxyl group of biotin is bound covalently to the ϵ-amino group of a distinct lysine residue in the apoprotein. This particular lysine residue is located in a conserved protein domain, also known as the biotin binding domain. Independent of whether a biotin-dependent carboxylation, transcarboxylation, or decarboxylation reaction is catalyzed, the same chemically reactive intermediate, 1′-N-carboxybiotin, is formed. It was demonstrated by Lynen and co-workers (3Knappe J. Ringelmann E. Lynen F. Biochem. Z. 1961; 335: 168-176PubMed Google Scholar) that this allophanic acid-like biotin derivative contains the reactive carboxyl group on one of the two ureido nitrogens of the cofactor.The covalent attachment of biotin to its cognate apoproteins is mediated by a specific enzyme, biotin:protein ligase (BPL) 1The abbreviations used are: BPL, biotin:protein ligase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; His6, hexahistidine; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PYC, pyruvate carboxylase. 1The abbreviations used are: BPL, biotin:protein ligase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; His6, hexahistidine; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PYC, pyruvate carboxylase. or holo-(trans)carboxylase synthetase (HCS) (4Barker D.F.

The genes encoding this enzyme are BPL1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), birA in Escherichia coli (4Barker D.F. Campbell A.-M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1964; 239: 2858-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of the available completed genome sequences suggests that there is usually only one single biotin:protein ligase in each organism. As the only known exception, Arabidopsis thaliana contains both a cytoplasmic and a putative chloroplast version of the enzyme (7Denis L. Grossemy M. Douce R. Alban C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10435-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, biotin:protein ligases not only biotinylate different apoenzymes of the same organism but are often also able to modify heterologous apoproteins from different organisms (6Lane M.D. Young D.L. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2858-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) This broad substrate specificity is because of the high degree of similarity of all known biotin binding domains which is reflected in both their primary and tertiary structures (9Leon-del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).The firm though noncovalent binding of biotin to avidin, a protein present in chicken egg white, was discovered by Eakin et al. (11Eakin R.E. Snell E.E. Williams R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 535-543Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). An interaction of similar strength occurs between biotin and the bacterial protein streptavidin. Several widely used technologies of modern biochemistry and molecular biology rely on this very high affinity interaction. For instance, Western blotting with enzyme-linked streptavidin conjugates represents a very sensitive assay for biotin-containing cellular proteins (12Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 138-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Using this probe in our studies on yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylases, we identified a so-far unknown yeast protein of 45-kDa apparent molecular mass, exhibiting a strong interaction with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. Here, we show that this protein is encoded by ARC1, a gene encoding a yeast aminoacyl tRNA synthetase cofactor (13Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The Arc1 protein has no detectable sequence similarity to other known biotin proteins. Despite this fact, biotin is covalently linked to a specific lysine residue within the N-terminal domain of Arc1p. Biotin attachment requires the yeast biotin:protein ligase Bpl1p and cannot be performed by the E. coli biotin:protein ligase BirA. To our knowledge, Arc1p is the first known protein that is modified by biotin:protein ligase but has no role in carboxylation reactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Vectors, and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. For recombinant plasmid constructions, the S. cerevisiae/E. coli shuttle vectors YCplac33 (14Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar), p414MET25 (15Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), pVT-100U (16Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), pTRC-HISA (Invitrogen) and the E. coli plasmid pQE70 (Qiagen) served as recipients. Plasmid pFA6-HIS3MX6 (17Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti Segni C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and pFA6KanMX (18Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) were used for PCR amplification of HIS5 and KanMX insertion cassettes, respectively. Yeast cells were routinely grown in complex yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Cells with the KanMX insertion cassette were selected on yeast extract peptone dextrose medium that contained 200 μg/ml G418 (Roche Applied Science). Semisynthetic omission medium lacking either uracil (SS-U) or histidine (SS-H) contained 2% glucose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, and an otherwise complete set of amino acids and nucleic acid bases (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidmann J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Biotin-free synthetic media (SC-Bio) were prepared according to the formula indications of Invitrogen.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this workStrainGenotypeOriginJS91.15-23MATα ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 can1H.

Plasmids pHSK1 (from YCplac33) and pHSK3 (from p414MET25) were thus obtained. Using His6-encoding C-terminal and appropriate N-terminal primers, the ARC1 reading frame was PCR amplified from pHSK1 and integrated, as SphI/BamHI and PstI/BamHI restriction fragment, into pQE70 and pVT-100U, giving pHSK15 and pAB1, respectively. Correspondingly, the ARC1 deletion constructs pARC1-A, pARC1-B, pARC1-C, pARC1-D, and pARC1-E were pVT-100U-based expression plasmids containing PstI/BamHI-restricted ARC1 DNA fragments synthesized by PCR on pHSK1 as a template using the appropriate N-terminal end His-tagged C-terminal primers. To generate the BPL1 expression plasmid pVT100U-BPL1-ZZ, the BPL1 reading frame was amplified from genomic S. cerevisiae DNA using the appropriate primers. The DNA sequence encoding amino acids 7–140 of Arc1p (Arc1-N) was amplified by PCR and ligated to the pTRC-HISA vector DNA. The resulting construct, pTRC-HISA/Arc1-N, fuses an N-terminal His tag to the Arc1-N peptide.In Vitro Mutagenesis and Gene Disruptions—The targeted replacement of specific lysine residues in Arc1p by arginine was performed using a one- or two-step PCR procedure as described by Landt et al. (20Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In the two-step procedure used for plasmids pK79R, pK86R, pK89R, pK185R, and pK300R the internal primer contained the arginine triplet AGA at the appropriate positions, whereas the primers determining the N and C termini of Arc1p were the same as those used for pAB1 construction. Plasmids pK132R, pK133R, pK134R, and pK135R were constructed by a one-step PCR method using a His tag encoding an appropriately mutated C-terminal primer in combination with the N-terminal primer used for pARC1-A construction. Again, the resulting PCR products were integrated, as PstI/BamHI restriction fragments, into the yeast expression vector pVT-100U. For chromosomal ARC1 disruption, the N-terminal 812 bp of the ARC1 reading frame were removed, as a 1,087-bp NsiI/HpaI restriction fragment, from pHSK3 and replaced by an appropriate 1.33-kb KanMX-encoding PCR fragment prepared from pFA6KanMX4. Plasmid pHSK4 was thereby obtained. Using the one-step gene disruption procedure of Rothstein (21Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), the 2-kb SalI/BamHI restriction fragment of pHSK4 served for disruption of chromosomal ARC1 DNA in the haploid S. cerevisiae strain JS89.27-3. The los1Δ::HIS5 deletion was generated in strain JS91.15-23 by the “short flanking homology PCR” method. For homologous recombination with chromosomal yeast DNA, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ gene was amplified from plasmid pFA6-HIS3MX6. In the los1Δ disruption construct, 1,563 bp (from position –28 to + 1535 relative to the start codon) of LOS1 were replaced by the HIS5 marker.Affinity Purification of Biotinylated Yeast Proteins—S. cerevisiae cells were grown to mid logarithmic phase in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium. The harvested cells (20 g, fresh weight) were broken with glass beads, and the cleared lysate was dialyzed against PBS to remove free biotin. 30 ml of protein extract was loaded onto a 5-ml monomeric avidin-Sepharose column (Pierce), which was subsequently washed with PBS until the fractions were free of protein. Biotinylated proteins were then eluted from the column with PBS containing 2 mm biotin. 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) as described before (22Hoja U. Wellein C. Greiner E. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Alternatively, yeast transformants expressing His-tagged Arc1p constructs were grown in uracil-free SS-U selective medium. About 30 g of late logarithmic phase cells were harvested and disrupted with glass beads. The cleared lysate was adsorbed to 5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the columns were subsequently washed with PBS until the A280 had returned to background levels. Elution was performed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl containing stepwise increasing concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 m imidazole. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with monoclonal PentaHis antibodies (Qiagen).Heterologous Expression of Intact and C-terminally Truncated Arc1p in E. coli—For expression of intact Arc1p, plasmid pHSK15 was transformed to E. coli strain M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen). Transformants were grown overnight at 30 °C in 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 80 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and, after washing, resuspended in 200 ml of kanamycin-free LB medium. After a 1-h incubation ARC1 expression was induced with 5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were incubated for another 5 h at 30 °C. Then, cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 ml of PBS containing 2 mg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and subsequently disrupted by sonication. After a 20-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the cleared lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The N-terminal Arc1-N fragment encoded by plasmid pTRC-HISA/Arc1-N was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). The cells were grown at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.6 and induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, broken by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Arc1-N was purified by binding to Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and eluted with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl containing 40 mm imidazole.In Vitro Biotinylation of the Purified Arc1p Fragment, Arc1-N—For in vitro biotinylation, about 0.5 μg of purified Arc1-N was incubated with 40 μg of cell extract from JS89.27-3, the bpl1 mutant C25/17, or from JS89.27-3 transformed with plasmid pVT100U-BPL1-ZZ. After incubation at 30 °C for 3.5 h in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μm biotin, and 0.5 mm ATP the reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Protein biotinylation was analyzed by Western blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (22Hoja U. Wellein C. Greiner E. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).MALDI-TOF Analyses—A Coomassie-stained protein band of Arc1p was in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega) in principle as reported by Shevchenko et al. (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7767) Google Scholar) or by the endopeptidases Arg-C, Lys-C, or Glu-C (Roche Applied Science), respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For MALDI-TOF analysis a 0.5-μl aliquot of peptide digest was co-crystallized with α-cyano,4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (24Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar) or with a 9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid with 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (25Tsarbopoulos A. Karas M. Strupat K. Pramanik B.N. Nagabhushan T.L. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) on AnchorChip targets (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen) (26Gobom J. Schuerenberg M. Mueller M. Theis D. Lerach H. Nordhoff E. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Peptide fingerprints were acquired with a Reflex lll (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometer in reflector mode. The resulting peak lists were searched against the NCBI nonredundant data base using Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) allowing a 100-ppm tolerance for peptide mass values.RESULTSIdentification of Arc1p as a Novel Streptavidin-reactive Yeast Protein—Three different types of biotin-containing carboxylases are known in yeast, i.e. acetyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and urea amidolyase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is encoded by two different genes, ACC1 and HFA1 (27Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hoja U. Marthol S. Hofmann J. Stegner S. Schulz R. Meier S. Greiner E. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21779-21786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both encode high molecular mass (250 kDa for Acc1p, 242 kDa for Hfa1p) multienzymes catalyzing cytoplasmic and mitochondrial acetyl-CoA carboxylation, respectively. Similarly, two independent pyruvate carboxylases are encoded by the genes PYC1 and PYC2 (29Brewster N.K. Val D.L. Walker M.E. Wallace J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Urea amidolyase, the third known biotin-containing yeast enzyme, comprises two activities, urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase, which are fused within a single polypeptide of 202-kDa molecular mass (30Genbauffe F.S. Cooper T.G. DNA Seq. 1991; 36: 19-32Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because of the similar masses of the respective multifunctional proteins, Acc1p and Hfa1p on the one side and Pyc1p and Pyc2p on the other do not separate upon SDS-PAGE but superimpose at the ACC- and PYC-specific positions, respectively. As is shown in Fig. 1A, the Acc1p/Hfa1p and Pyc1p/Pyc2p carboxylase proteins present in the yeast cell homogenate are readily detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. In some of our experiments, Dur1,2p has also be seen as a faint band migrating slightly slower than Acc1p (cf. Fig. 7A). Besides these known carboxylases, however, an additional and so far unassigned streptavidin-reactive protein (p45 in Fig. 1) was uncovered by this assay. This protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa has occasionally been observed before (8Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lim P. Rhode M. Morris C.P. Wallace J.C. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but it has, to our knowledge, never been investigated in more detail. Homology searches in the yeast genome with biotin binding domains of known carboxylases revealed no unexpected hits.Fig. 7In vitro biotinylation of the purified Arc1p fragment, Arc1-N (amino acids 7–140). For biotinylation, Arc1-N was incubated with cell extracts of JS89.27-3 (wt), bpl1-C25/17, or JS89.27-3 transformants overexpressing BPL1 from the multicopy plasmid pVT100U-BPL1-ZZ (mc). In a control experiment, Arc1-N was incubated with buffer instead of yeast cell extracts (–). A, Western blot of the reaction products with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. In addition to Arc1-N biotinylation, this blot also detects endogenous biotin proteins present in the yeast cell extracts. In B the same samples are shown after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Therefore, identification of the 45-kDa protein seemed to us of particular interest.In a first step toward identification, the unknown protein was enriched from the yeast cell extracts by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin. Bound proteins were released by adding biotin to the wash buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The streptavidin-reactive 45-kDa protein eluting slightly in front of the yeast carboxylases, ACC and PYC, could be highly enriched by this procedure (Fig. 1B). The purified 45-kDa protein was subjected to endoproteinase digestion with subsequent Edman sequencing. Thereby, the two peptide sequences, LEINHDLDLPHEVI and APEKPKPSAIDFRVG, were obtained. These sequences were assigned to the S. cerevisiae open reading frame YGL105w encoding the Arc1/G4p1 protein (Swiss Protein Database P46672). Arc1p has been described both as a tRNA-binding protein and as an activator of MetRS and GluRS tRNA synthetases (13Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Besides this, it was reported, as G4p1, to bind specifically to quadruplex DNA (34Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20692-20697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). None of these characteristics relates to the canonical functions of known biotin-containing enzymes, nor is a typical biotin binding consensus motif evident from the Arc1p sequence. Therefore, a more detailed verification of Arc1p as a biotin-containing protein seemed necessary. For this, we disrupted the ARC1 gene by integration of the Geneticin resistance marker, KanMX. Details of the disruption protocol are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Probing a protein extract of the arc1Δ-null mutant, SC1478, with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase revealed that the 45 kDa signal observed with wild type cells had indeed been abolished (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the 45 kDa signal reappeared when ARC1 DNA was reintroduced into the arc1Δ mutant by transformation with the multicopy plasmid pAB1 (Fig. 2A). Correct production of pAB1-encoded Arc1p in the transformants is evident from the immune response of its His6-tagged recombinant protein with PentaHis monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2B). Together, these experiments confirmed that Arc1p in fact represents the novel streptavidin-reactive yeast protein, even though its calculated molecular mass of 42.1 kDa is somewhat lower than the experimentally observed value.Fig. 2A, streptavidin-reactive proteins in the arc1Δ cell homogenate before (lane 3) and after (lane 4) transformation with pAB1 are shown. For comparison, the response of an untransformed wild type strain (JS89.27-3) is shown in lane 2. In B, the same blot was probed with PentaHis monoclonal antibodies. S, molecular mass protein standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Biotin Is Covalently Linked to Arc1p—Streptavidin is well documented to bind to a variety of biotin-free peptides collectively referred to as strep tags (35Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These peptide tags can be added to a protein of interest and are useful for purification as well as for detection in Western blots. To exclude the possibility that Arc1p interacted with streptavidin in a biotin-independent way, we investigated whether Arc1p was capable of incorporating 14C-labeled biotin. Yeast cells are unable to produce biotin de novo and possess a high affinity biotin transporter (Vht1p) in their plasma membrane (36Stolz J. Ludwig A. Sauer N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This facilitates efficient labeling of endogenous proteins with [14C]biotin added to the culture medium (8Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Arc1-His6 protein was isolated from pAB1-transformed SC1478 cells after growth in the presence of [14C]biotin. The His-tagged Arc1p was adsorbed to Ni2+-agarose and subsequently eluted by increasing imidazole concentrations. The data in Fig. 3A indicate that the protein bound to the Ni2+-chelating column was radioactively labeled as was expected for biotinylated Arc1p. By SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and autoradiography, the radioactivity was clearly assigned to the 45 kDa protein band on the gel (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, one of the peptides derived from the [14C]biotin-labeled protein comprised the sequence LEVSSRDKLE, which corresponds to amino acids 109–118 of Arc1p. These results confirm that Arc1p contains protein-bound biotin and thus explain the streptavidin reactivity of the protein. Because Arc1p lacks the typical consensus motif of known biotin binding domains, the exact binding mode of the cofactor remained to be elucidated. As is indicated by the data shown in Table II, biotin binding to Arc1p is covalent because radioactively labeled biotin remained stably attached to the protein even after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Furthermore, biotin linkage to Arc1p proved resistant against alkaline hydrolysis, which argues for an amide rather than for an ester or thioester linkage.Fig. 3Affinity purification of [14C]biotin-labeled Arc1p on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (A) with subsequent identification by SDS-PAGE (B) and autoradiography (C).

https://openalex.org/W2094632981,"Regulation of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) by Ca2+ requires capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) (Cooper, D. M. F. (2003) Biochem. J. 375, 517–529), but whether Ca2+-sensitive phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are similarly discriminating has never been addressed. In the present study, a variety of conditions were devised to manipulate [Ca2+]i so that we could ask whether PDE1 selectively responds to different modes of elevating [Ca2+]i, viz. Ca2+ released from intracellular stores and various modes of Ca2+ entry. In 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells, the endogenous PDE1 (identified as PDE1A by reverse transcriptase-PCR) was largely insensitive to Ca2+ released from carbachol-sensitive stores but was robustly stimulated by a similar rise in [Ca2+]i due to carbachol-induced Ca2+ influx. Gd3+, which effectively blocked thapsigargin-induced CCE and its effect on PDE1A, also inhibited the activation of PDE1A by carbachol-induced Ca2+ entry. However, non-selective ionomycin-mediated Ca2+ entry also activated PDE1A, so that, unlike Ca2+-sensitive ACs, PDE1A cannot discriminate between the different sources of Ca2+ entry. Fractionation of the cells revealed that the Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated PDE activity was not present at the plasma membrane but was associated with the cytosol and the organellar compartments of the cell. Therefore, the apparent disparity between PDE1A and ACs is likely to be the consequence of their differential subcellular localization. Nevertheless, in a physiological context, where artificial modes of elevating [Ca2+]i are not available, as with ACs, a dependence on CCE would be evident, and it would be the duration of this influx of Ca2+ that would determine how long PDE1A was activated."
https://openalex.org/W2026737980,"Acetylation provides one mechanism by which the functional diversity of individual transcription factors can be expanded. This is valuable in the setting of complex multigene loci that are regulated by a limited number of proteins, such as the human β-globin locus. We have studied the role of acetylation in the regulation of the transcription factor NF-E4, a component of a protein complex that facilitates the preferential expression of the human γ-globin genes in fetal erythroid cells. We have shown that NF-E4 interacts directly with, and serves as a substrate for, the acetyltransferase co-activator PCAF. Acetylation of NF-E4 is restricted to a single residue (Lys43) in the amino-terminal domain of the protein and results in two important functional consequences. Acetylation of NF-E4 prolongs the protein half-life by preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This stabilization is PCAF-dependent, since enforced expression in fetal/erythroid cells of a mutant form of PCAF lacking the histone acetyltransferase domain (PCAFΔHAT) decreases NF-E4 stability. Acetylation of Lys43 also reduces the interaction between NF-E4 and HDAC1, potentially maximizing the activating ability of the factor at the γ-promoter. These results provide further demonstration that co-activators, such as PCAF, can influence individual transcription factor properties at multiple levels to alter their effects on gene expression.

Acetylation of NF-E4 prolongs the protein half-life by preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This stabilization is PCAF-dependent, since enforced expression in fetal/erythroid cells of a mutant form of PCAF lacking the histone acetyltransferase domain (PCAFΔHAT) decreases NF-E4 stability. Acetylation of Lys43 also reduces the interaction between NF-E4 and HDAC1, potentially maximizing the activating ability of the factor at the γ-promoter. These results provide further demonstration that co-activators, such as PCAF, can influence individual transcription factor properties at multiple levels to alter their effects on gene expression.

This modification leads to destabilization of local nucleosomal structure with induction of an open chromatin configuration, allowing access of the transcriptional machinery to core promoters (reviewed in Refs. 2Roth S.Y.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The sequelae of acetylation of these proteins range from altered DNA binding or cellular localization to changes in protein stability or protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 19Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). These significant changes in function occur in the context of modification of a small number of lysine residues within an individual protein and thus provide mechanisms to expand the roles for single factors in the regulation of complex multigenic loci.One such locus is the β-like globin cluster in which a linear array of five genes is expressed in a highly regulated tissue-specific and developmentally specific manner (20Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Majerus P.W. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 2nd Ed. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1994Google Scholar). To date, very few transcription factors that specifically influence the temporal profile of globin gene expression have been identified. One of these, EKLF is a red cell-specific activator that is critical for switching on high level adult β-globin expression (21Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 22Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F.

EKLF binds to the CACCC element in the proximal β-promoter, leading to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (24Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of EKLF is regulated by site-specific acetylation by p300 and CBP that results in an enhanced activation potential of the protein and increased binding to the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (12Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Zhang W. Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).NF-E4 is another globin-specific transcription factor (30Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This protein forms the stage selector protein complex (SSP) with the ubiquitous transcription factor CP2 (31Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The SSP facilitates the interaction of the γ-globin genes with the powerful enhancer elements contained in the locus control region in fetal erythroid cells through binding to the stage selector element (SSE) in the proximal γ-promoter (32Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of NF-E4 in the human fetal/erythroid K562 cell line and human cord blood progenitors leads to increased fetal globin gene expression (30Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In cord blood progenitors, where active competition between fetal and adult globin genes occurs, enforced expression of NF-E4 also leads to a reduction in β-globin gene expression (30Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that NF-E4 is a direct target of the co-activator PCAF. The resultant acetylation of Lys-43 in NF-E4 results in both an increase in the stability of the protein due to diminished targeting by ubiquitination and an alteration in protein-protein interactions that favor transcriptional activation. Thus, a single amino acid modification results in complementary functional changes that enhance the ability of NF-E4 to positively regulate fetal globin gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—K562 cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C and in 5% CO2 supplemented with 50 units of penicillin/ml and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml.Reagents and Antibodies—[14C]Acetyl-CoA (59 mCi/mmol) and sodium [3H]acetate (5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Tran35S-label was obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate, acetyl-CoA, ubiquitin, MG132, and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and monoclonal antirabbit immunoglobulin G, monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2), and anti-ubiquitin antibodies were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal anti-acetyl lysine and anti-HDAC1 antibodies were from Upstate (Waltham, MA). Anti-PCAF and anti-tubulin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-NF-E4-specific antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a C-terminal synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence LKTDSALEQTPQQLPSLHLS coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.Plasmids, Transfections, Luciferase, and β-Galactosidase Assays— The expression vectors GST-NF-E4 and GST-CP2 in pGEX were described previously (30Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For the GST-NF-E4 truncation constructs, PCR fragments corresponding to the shortened coding sequences were generated with BamHI and XhoI ends and were cloned into pGEX vectors. The plasmids pCX-PCAF, pCX-PCAFΔHAT, MSCV-IRES-PCAF-GFP, and MSCV-IRES-PCAFΔHAT-GFP were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Brandt (13Huang S. Qiu Y. Shi Y. Xu Z. Brandt S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6792-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing GST-PCAF-(352–832) and GST-CBP-(1098–1877) were kindly provided by Dr. Tony Kouzarides (14Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCDNA3.1-FLAG-ubiquitin was kindly provided by Dr. Ivan Dikic. The in vitro transcription/translation plasmid for PCAF-(1–832) was cloned by inserting an EcoRI/XhoI fragment from MSCV-IRES-PCAF-GFP into vector pSP72. Mutation of GST-NF-E4 to GST-K43R was accomplished with the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Retroviral vectors expressing HA-NF-E4 and HA-K43R were constructed by cloning fragments obtained by PCR amplification of coding sequences of pGEX-NF-E4 and pGEX-K43R into MSCV-IRES-GFP. The integrity of all constructs that generated fusion proteins was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Stable K562 cell lines overexpressing HA-NF-E4, HA-K43R, PCAF, and PCAFΔHAT were generated according to the protocols described previously, except that only the top 10% of GFP-positive cells were collected (30Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, 293T cells were transiently transfected with various plasmids by a calcium phosphate method (Invitrogen). For the reporter gene assays, native K562 cells or stable K562 cell lines overexpressing HA-NF-E4 and HA-K43R were co-transfected with HS2–53γ-Luciferase, containing hypersensitivity site 2 of the β-globin locus control region linked to the –53 γ-promoter relative to the CAP site and the firefly luciferase reporter gene (32Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and pCH110, containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by SV40 promoter as an internal transfection efficiency control by electroporation. For the TSA induction experiments, the transfected cells were divided into two aliquots, one of which was cultured in various concentrations of TSA for 20 h and the other in standard medium alone. For all other transfection experiments, cells were harvested after 36 h and lysed, and luciferase activity was determined on a Monolight 2001 luminometer using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in a spectrophotometer using the enzyme assay system (Promega), and the relative luciferase activities were calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. Three independent transfections were performed in duplicate.Metabolic Labeling—For 35S labeling, K562 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing Tran35S-label (20 μCi/ml; a mixture of cysteine and methionine) for 4 h. For 3H labeling, K562 cells were cultured in RPMI containing sodium [3H]acetate (1 mCi/ml) and 2 μm TSA for 2 h. Extracts were prepared and boiled after adding 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) to disrupt interactions between proteins before being subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific anti-NF-E4 antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples on beads were extensively washed with stringent washing buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium butyrate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by adding appropriate antibodies plus protein G-Sepharose beads, followed by incubation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with various specific antibodies and then washed extensively prior to incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse immunoglobulin G. After further extensive washes, the blots were visualized by using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All immunoprecipitations were performed in duplicate.Recombinant Protein Expression and GST Pull-down Assay—GST-fusion proteins were produced in BL21 Escherichia coli as described previously (30Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled NF-E4 and PCAF synthesized using the T7 TNT kit (Promega) and Tran35S-label (ICN) were incubated with GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione beads at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed extensively and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography.Determination of Protein Half-life—K562 cells stably expressing HA-NF-E4, HA-K43R, PCAF, and PCAFΔHAT were treated with cycloheximide (100 μm) to stop protein synthesis and incubated for the indicated times. Cells were lysed, and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting probed with the indicated specific antibodies. The protein signals were scanned and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis software (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Protein Acetylation Assay—2–3 μg of the indicated GST fusion protein or SCL and 200 ng of acetyltransferase protein were incubated in a reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 30 μm acetyl-coenzyme A or 1 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography of dried gels or by Western blotting with anti-acetyl lysine antibody.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Recombinant protein was used as the substrate in a ubiquitin reaction containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 5 μg of ubiquitin, 20 μm MG132, and 5 μl of crude rabbit reticulocyte (Promega) for 1 h at 30 °C. In some cases, GST fusion proteins were acetylated prior to the ubiquitination reaction by PCAF in the presence or absence of unlabeled acetyl-CoA. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by determination of ubiquitination by Western blotting analysis.In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—293T cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-FLAG-ubiquitin, and cell lysate was prepared 36 h later. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of protein was incubated with α-HA antibody at 4 °C overnight before protein G beads were added for 2 h. The beads were washed twice with NaCl (1 m) in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with Nonidet P-40 (1%), β-mercaptoethanol (0.05%), and EDTA (1 mm). Proteins were loaded onto SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as previously described (31Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using recombinant proteins. In some cases, recombinant NF-E4 was acetylated in vitro prior to binding DNA. Specific antibodies against NF-E4 or CP2 or specific or nonspecific cold oligonucleotide competitors in molar excess were added to the reaction mixture for 30 min on ice before the addition of the labeled SSE oligonucleotides.RESULTSAcetylation of NF-E4 in Vitro and in Vivo—Distinct functional parallels exist between the globin regulatory transcription factors EKLF and NF-E4. Both factors are expressed throughout erythroid ontogeny and yet exert their predominant effects at distinct developmental time points. Acetylation of EKLF is critical for its role as an adult globin gene activator, and we postulated that a similar posttranslational modification might also regulate NF-E4 function. We therefore examined the ability of NF-E4 to serve as a substrate for two acetyltransferases, PCAF and CBP. A purified GST-NF-E4 fusion protein was incubated with recombinant CBP or PCAF in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA and the incorporation of [14C]acetate determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Recombinant SCL (TAL1), which is acetylated in vitro by both acetyltransferases (13Huang S. Qiu Y. Shi Y. Xu Z. Brandt S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6792-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), served as the positive control, and GST alone served as the negative control. As shown in Fig. 1A, acetylation of GST-NF-E4 was observed in the presence of PCAF (lane 3) but not CBP (lane 2). Incorporation of [14C]acetate was dependent on the presence of NF-E4, since GST alone remained unlabeled (lane 1). SCL was acetylated in the presence of both co-activators (lanes 4 and 5). To determine whether NF-E4 was acetylated in vivo in a fetal/erythroid environment, human K562 cells were pulse-labeled with either [35S]methionine/cysteine or sodium [3H]acetate in the presence of TSA. Cellular extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-NF-E4 antibody, and precipitates were washed under stringent conditions. As a control, extracts were also immunoprecipitated with preimmune sera. As shown in Fig. 1B, NF-E4-specific antisera detected both the 35S-labeled NF-E4 (left panel) and acetylated NF-E4 (right panel). Neither species was detected with preimmune sera. To directly examine the role of PCAF in the acetylation of NF-E4 in a cellular context, we co-transfected the human cell line 293T with mammalian expression vectors containing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged NF-E4 (HA-NF-E4), and either the wild-type PCAF cDNA (PCAF) tagged with a FLAG epitope or a mutant PCAF that lacked the histone acetyltransferase domain (PCAFΔHAT) tagged with a FLAG epitope, or vector alone (13Huang S. Qiu Y. Shi Y. Xu Z. Brandt S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6792-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with preimmune sera (lane 1) or anti-HA antibody (lanes 2–4) and immunoblotted with either anti-HA antibody (α-HA) or antibody specific for acetylated lysine (α-AcK) (Fig. 1C). An increase in the level of acetylated NF-E4 was observed in the presence of PCAF compared with vector alone (compare lanes 2 and 3). The level of acetylated NF-E4 was decreased in cells transfected with PCAFΔHAT, consistent with its dominant negative role (lane 4). The expression of HA-NF-E4 and FLAG-PCAF/PCAFΔHAT were similar in the transfected lines (lower panels). These findings indicate that NF-E4 serves as a substrate for the acetyltransferase, PCAF.NF-E4 Interacts with PCAF in Vitro and in Vivo—Acetylation of transcription factors is usually mediated by a direct interaction between the factor and the specific acetyltransferase. To determine whether NF-E4 interacted directly with PCAF, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-chromatography assays (Fig. 2A). In vitro transcribed/translated [35S]methionine-labeled NF-E4 (lane 1) was applied to glutathione-Sepharose beads adsorbed with GST alone (lane 2); GST-PCAF-(352–832) (lane 3), which contains key regulatory domains including the HAT domain; and a positive control, GST-CP2 (lane 4). The labeled protein was retained on both the GST-PCAF and GST-CP2 matrices but not on GST alone. To further localize the region of NF-E4 that interacted with PCAF, we generated a series of truncation deletions of NF-E4 as GST fusion proteins and examined their ability to retain [35S]methionine-labeled PCAF (Fig. 2B). Only NF-E4 fusion proteins containing the first 25 amino acids were capable of interacting with PCAF (lanes 3–5). In contrast, fusion proteins that lacked only the N-terminal 17 amino acids did not interact (lane 6), and no PCAF was retained on the GST alone matrix (lane 2). To confirm the interaction in a cellular context, we transfected 293T cells with mammalian expression vectors containing the NF-E4 cDNA tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope (HA-NF-E4) and the PCAF cDNA tagged with a FLAG epitope (FLAG-PCAF) (Fig. 2C). Cellular extract was immunoprecipitated with an unrelated antibody (mock) or anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with either anti-HA antibody (top panel) or anti-FLAG antibody (bottom panel). Both PCAF and NF-E4 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, but not the unrelated antibody, indicating that the two proteins interact in a cellular context. Immunoprecipitation of lysate from nontransfected cells with the anti-FLAG antibody failed to bring down NF-E4 (data not shown). We then examined whether this interaction occurred in the absence of enforced expression of the proteins. K562 cell extract was immunoprecipitated with either preimmune sera or antibody to NF-E4 or PCAF, and the precipitates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-PCAF antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, PCAF co-immunoprecipitated with NF-E4 (lane 2), indicating that these two factors form a complex in native cells. No PCAF was observed with preimmune sera (lane 1).Fig. 2NF-E4 and PCAF interact in vitro and in cellular extracts.A, purified GST and GST fusion proteins containing amino acids 352–832 of PCAF (GST-PCAF-(352–832)) or full-length CP2 (GST-CP2) preadsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed/translated (IVT) NF-E4. Specifically bound protein was eluted from washed beads and visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Input represents 20% of the in vitro translated NF-E4 used in the assay. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. B, purified GST and GST fusion proteins containing amino acids 1–25, 1–48, 49–179, and 17–179 (top panel) of NF-E4 preadsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 35S-labeled PCAF. Specifically bound protein was eluted from washed beads and visualized by autoradiography (bottom panel) after SDS-PAGE. Input represents 5% of the in vitro translated PCAF used in the assay. C, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged NF-E4 and FLAG-tagged PCAF. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibody to the FLAG epitope (α-Flag) or an unrelated antibody (mock) and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA and anti-PCAF antibodies. NF-E4 protein was identified only in precipitates using anti-FLAG antisera. D, K562 cell extract was immunoprecipitated with either anti-NF-E4 or anti-PCAF antibodies. Preimmune sera served as the control. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PCAF antibody. PCAF protein was detected in precipitates from both anti-NF-E4 and anti-PCAF antibodies but not preimmune sera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identifying Acetylation Sites in NF-E4—To identify the residue(s) in NF-E4 that are acetylated by PCAF, we utilized our series of GST-NF-E4 truncation mutants (Fig. 3A, left panel). The proteins were subjected to a PCAF-dependent in vitro acetylation assay using unlabeled acetyl-CoA, and protein acetylation was detected using an antibody specific for acetylated lysine (α-AcK) (Fig. 3A, top right panel). Full-length NF-E4 (amino acids 1–179) (top panel, lane 5) and NF-E4 (amino acids 1–48) (lane 3) were both acetylated in vitro. In contrast, NF-E4 lacking the first 48 amino acids (lane 4), NF-E4 (amino acids 1–25) (lane 2), and GST alone (lane 1) remained unacetylated, despite significant levels of GST fusion protein expression (Fig. 3A, bottom right panel). This acetylation pattern was duplicated when acetylated lysine was detected by incorporation of [14C]acetyl-CoA in the in vitro assay (data not shown). These results localized the site of acetylation of NF-E4 to the residues between 26 and 48 and indicated that the acetylation status of the NF-E4 protein was accurately reflected by Western analysis"
https://openalex.org/W1978017921,"Transcriptional up-regulation of the myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2v) gene is an established marker for hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes. Despite the documentation on the role of several cis-elements in the MLC-2v gene and their cognate proteins in transcription, the mechanism that dictates the preferential increase in MLC-2v gene expression during myocardial hypertrophy has not been delineated. Here we describe the properties of a cardiac specific intronic activator element (IRE) that shares sequence homology with the repressor element, the cardiac specific sequence, in the chicken MLC-2v gene. The transcription factor, Nishéd, that recognizes both IRE and the cardiac specific sequence potentiates the transcription of the MLC-2v gene via interaction with another transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and the co-activator p300 at the IRE site. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent agonist of hypertrophy, causes induction of the MLC-2v gene transcription, which correlates well with the enhanced binding of Nishéd-nuclear factor of the activated T cells-p300 complex to IRE in the gel mobility shift assay. Losartan, an antagonist of Ang II receptor (AT1), abolishes the agonist-dependent stimulation of IRE/protein interaction and the consequent increase in MLC-2v gene transcription. These results together have thus established a transcriptional role of IRE as a direct target sequence of Ang II-mediated signaling that appears to be pivotal in the mechanism underlying the up-regulation of the MLC-2v gene during cardiac hypertrophy.

Garcia A.V. Ross R.S. Evans S.M. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the chicken MLC-2v gene, there is an additional upstream sequence, cardiac specific sequence (CSS) (17Dhar M. Mascareno E.M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18490-18497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Shen R.A. Goswami S.K. Mascareno E. Kumar A. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1676-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that represses the chicken MLC-2v gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Recently, we have identified and partly characterized a transcription factor, Nishéd, as a putative repressor that interacts with CSS (17Dhar M. Mascareno E.M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18490-18497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In studies using transgenic mice, the HF-1 box in the 250-bp rat promoter region of the rat MLC-2v gene was assigned a role in cardiac tissue specificity (20Lee K.J. Hickey R. Zhu H. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several inducible regulatory sequence elements have been identified in hypertrophy-responsive genes. For example, the serum-responsive element and SP-1 confer α-adrenergic stimulation to the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter (21Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A.

Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similarly, the GATA-binding element and its interaction with GATA-4, a zinc finger protein, mediate the induction of β-myosin heavy chain in left ventricular hypertrophy resulting from aortic constriction (23Hasegawa K.

More recently, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors was reported to induce the expression of target genes associated with hypertrophy via the formation of a protein complex involving GATA-4 (27Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), MEF2 (28Blaeser F. Ho N.

The HF-1 box implicated in tissue specificity above also confers the α-adrenergic inducible activation of the rat MLC-2v gene (3Lee H.R. Henderson S.A. Reynolds R. Dunnmon P. Yuan D. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7352-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of the regulatory proteins, HF-1b (30Zhu H. Nguyen V.T. Brown A.B. Pourhosseini A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), that interact with the HF-1b/MEF2 site and the CArG box in HF-1, respectively, has not been defined. Thus, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of MLC-2v gene in hypertrophy response remains elusive. Here we provide evidence of a new cardiac specific cis-regulatory element, intronic regulatory element (IRE), located in the first intron of the chicken MLC-2v gene. IRE shares a common core motif 5′-GAAG-CTTC-3′ with the upstream negative CSS element and plays a dual role, i.e. it overrides the repressive effect of CSS via its binding to a common transcription factor, Nishéd, and in hypertrophy, IRE responds to signals triggered by the hypertrophic ligand, angiotensin II (Ang II), to recruit activator proteins that induce MLC-2v gene transcription. Mutating the IRE sequence in the MLC-2v-luciferase reporter totally abolishes the Ang II-induced transcriptional up-regulation in transient transfection assays. In ovo treatment of the chick embryos with Ang II results in a selective increase in IRE-Nishéd complex formation in which Nishéd associates with NFATc4 and the co-activator p300, the major components of the endogenous IRE/protein binding activity in cardiac muscle cells. This ternary complex formation is enhanced in response to Ang II and is therefore likely to play a key role in the transcriptional up-regulation of the MLC-2v gene in hypertrophy. Primary Cardiac Cell Culture and Treatment—Hearts of 11-day-old White Leghorn chicken embryos (Spafas) were collected and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were dissociated from the ventricular tissues by successive enzymatic digestion using 0.1% pancreatin (Difco) at 37 °C. Dissociated cells from the first treatment were discarded, and those from the subsequent three treatments were combined, washed, and resuspended in growth medium (M199 with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 nmol/liter l-glutamine). The cells were differentially plated for 1 h in cell culture to remove contaminating non-myocytes and then plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well of 6-well cell culture dishes or 3 × 106 cells in 100-mm tissue culture plates and incubated overnight in M199 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), and l-glutamine (2 nmol/liter). The following day the cells were washed in PBS and cultured in serum-free M199 medium, containing penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine as above and 5 μg/ml insulin/selenium/transferrin (Invitrogen). Primary cardiac cells were treated with Ang II (Sigma) at 10-7m, which was added when needed, and cells were incubated for 2 h. Losartan (10-7m) (kindly provided by DuPont) was added 1.5 h prior to Ang II. Construction of Reporter Genes—Construction of pLC106CAT and pLC2.4CAT was described earlier (32Zarraga A.M. Danishefsky K. Deshpande A. Nicholson D. Mendola C. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13852-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pMLC2.1Luc is a 2.1-kb SmaI/StuI fragment of the MLC-2v gene cloned into the promoter-less vector, pGL2Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). A partial HindIII digest of the MLC-2v gene yields a 1.4-kb fragment that was cloned into pGL2-Basic to yield the pMLC106Luc reporter gene construct. The IRE sequence in pMLC2.1Luc was mutated (GAAGCTTC→ GtAcCccg) by using the Gene Editor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Primary chicken cardiomyocytes were transiently transfected 24 h after plating, using Fu-GENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) in 6-well plates with 1 μg of reporter gene construct and 10 ng of thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase-thymidine kinase vector, which was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. The promoter-less reporter vector, pGL2-Basic, was used as control. Luciferase assays were performed with the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA Extraction, Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from cardiomyocytes using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern hybridization, 5-10 μg of RNA was size-fractionated on a 1.4% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with either radiolabeled chicken MLC-2v or rat α-skeletal actin cDNA probes as described previously (1Goswami S.

Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Tissues from embryonic heart and skeletal muscles were dissociated, and cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors (Sigma P8340), 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm sodium fluoride. Nuclei were collected, and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously (1Goswami S. Qasba P. Ghatpande S. Carleton S. Deshpande A.K. Baig M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell.

Oligonucleotides corresponding to +141 to +169 bp of the MLC-2v gene 5′-GAGAGCAAGGGAAGCTTCGGGGTCTGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCAGACCCCGAAGCTTCCCTTGCTCTC-3′ containing the IRE sequence were used for GMSA. For GMSA with nuclear extracts from Ang II-treated cardiac cells, duplex oligonucleotides corresponding to +148 to +167 bp, 5′-AGGGAAGCTTCGGGGTCTGA-3′, 5′-TCAGACCCCGAAGCTTCCCT-3′, of the MLC-2v gene were used. GMSA was performed as described previously (1Goswami S. Qasba P. Ghatpande S. Carleton S. Deshpande A.K. Baig M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell.

Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 6-8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.375× TBE (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). Screening of cDNA Expression Library—Chicken skeletal muscle cDNA expression library cloned in the λZAP expression vector (Stratagene) was screened with IRE sequence as probe, and positive clones were isolated and characterized as described previously (17Dhar M. Mascareno E.M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18490-18497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hybrid Selection Assay and cDNA Synthesis—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from skeletal muscle using the Fast Track kit (Invitrogen). Ten μg of purified Nishéd cDNA insert was denatured, immobilized on a nylon membrane, and incubated with 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in hybridization buffer (42% formamide, 0.01 m PIPES, pH 6.4, 0.4 m NaCl) overnight at 42 °C. The filter was washed repeatedly with 1 ml of wash buffer (0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS) at 55 °C followed by three rinses in 2 mm EDTA. The selected RNA was eluted after boiling for 60 s in 300 μl of 1 mm EDTA and precipitated (33Miller J.S. Paterson B.M. Ricciardi R.P. Cohen L. Roberts B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 650-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RNA thus obtained was subjected to cDNA synthesis using the SUPERSCRIPT choice system for cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen), cloned into the plasmid BlueScript SK, and subsequently sequenced. Partial Purification of Nishéd Protein—Nishéd cDNA insert was obtained from the phagemid Bluescript by digesting with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET29b (Novagen). BL(21)DE3 bacterial cells were transformed with this construct, and cells were induced to make the recombinant protein according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Ang II Treatment of Chicken Embryos—Chicken eggs were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Ang II at a final concentration of 10-7m in PBS was injected daily for 12 days into the air sac of the embryos. Histological Analysis—The hearts were harvested from the embryos, rinsed in PBS, blotted dry, and weighed. Hearts were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% formaldehyde buffered with phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T Compound (Sakura Finetek) embedding medium for histological sectioning. Longitudinal 10-μm cryostat sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Total cell lysates from hearts were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (Sigma P8340), 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm sodium fluoride). 500 μg of total cell lysate was pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (50% v/v in RIPA buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Nishéd antibody, p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or NFATc4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C and captured with protein A-agarose beads. The precipitate was washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors, 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mm sodium fluoride) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (15-18%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane in electro-blotting buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol) for 1 h at 4 °C. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to glutathione S-transferase-fused Nishéd protein were generated by Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory Inc. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) with 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Glutathione S-transferase-depleted Nishéd antibodies were used as primary antibody at 1:4000 dilution in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Secondary detection was done using horseradish peroxide-coupled anti-rabbit antibody in the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence assay as per the supplier's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Values are given as percent activity relative to the activity of the wild type MLC-2v promoter, pMLC2.1Luc. Differences between experimental groups were evaluated for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA tests, and Tamhane's tests were performed post-hoc to test for significant differences.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2411-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that the MLC-2v promoter/reporter constructs, containing the 5′-flanking and intragenic region inclusive of the first intron, produce maximal transcription activity upon transient transfection in cardiac cells in culture compared with constructs without the intragenic sequence, suggesting that the first intronic sequence contains an activator element. This was consistent with the presence of a cardiac specific DNase I-hypersensitivity region located in the first intron of the gene (35Winter B.B. Arnold H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13750-13757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to identify the precise intronic sequence with a possible role in MLC-2v gene transcription, 3′ deletion of the MLC-2v-reporter constructs were generated (Fig. 1A). Plasmid pLC2.4CAT (2400 bp) contains 1307 bp of upstream promoter and a 1093-bp intragenic sequence containing exon 1, the first intron and part of exon 2. pΔ7LCCAT (1575 bp) has the identical upstream promoter sequence as in pLC2.4CAT and 268 bp of intragenic region. Plasmid pLC106CAT (1461 bp) is identical to pLC2.4CAT but contains 154 bp of intragenic sequence. When examined for the promoter activity by transient transfection in chicken primary cardiac cells in culture, pLC2.4CAT and pΔ7LCCAT show almost identical promoter activity reaching the level of pSV2CAT, whereas pLC106CAT was relatively inactive (22%) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the region between +154 to +268 bp contains an activator element. An examination of the sequence in this region revealed the presence of a palindromic sequence, 5′-GAAGCTTC-3′ at +151 to +158 bp within the first intron that shares the GAAG or CTTC sequence in the core motif of the previously characterized negative element (CSS) upstream in the MLC-2v promoter (17Dhar M. Mascareno E.M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18490-18497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To assess the role of this putative regulatory sequence, hereafter referred to as IRE, a substitution mutation was introduced (GAAGCTTC→ GTACCCCG) in the core IRE sequence, and the resulting plasmid, pMutIRELuc, was examined for the promoter activity in primary cardiac cells in culture (Fig. 2). The introduction of mutation in the IRE palindrome caused a significant loss (80%) compared with the parent plasmid pMLC2.1Luc. pMLC106Luc, where only one-half of the IRE palindrome was deleted, also showed a similar low level activity, suggesting that the wild type palindromic sequence within IRE is essential for the maximal activation of the MLC-2v gene. We speculated that because the activator IRE shares the palindromic motif with the negative element CSS, it is likely that IRE and CSS binding trans-acting factors play a cooperative function in the overall regulation of MLC-2v gene transcription.Fig. 2IRE is required for maximal activation of MLC-2v gene transcription. Primary cardiac cells were transfected with MLC-2v gene constructs, the wild type pMLC2.1Luc, the mutant pMutIRELuc, where the GAAGCTTC palindrome was replaced with GTACCCCG, and a 3′ deletion mutant, pMLC106Luc. Luciferase activity measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” was normalized with Renilla luciferase-TK activity. Data are plotted as % wild type MLC-2v promoter activity (% pMLC2.1Luc activity). Asterisks indicate significant differences (one way ANOVA, p < 0.05 versus pMLC2.1Luc).

Nuclear extracts from both tissues produced several DNA-protein complexes that were more abundant in skeletal muscle extracts (Fig. 3). The IREBP1 complex is distinctly visible in GMSA with skeletal muscle nuclear extracts and is much reduced in cardiac extracts, possibly because of differences in stability of proteins that form the IREBP1 complex in skeletal and cardiac tissues. Competition with 15- and 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled IRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, I) reduced all complex formation (Fig. 3). CSS (Fig. 3, C) oligonucleotide competed away the IREBP2 complex but not others indicating that IREBP2 recognizes the common core motif (Fig. 3). Thus, it appears that the two functionally disparate elements, CSS and IRE, share common DNA-binding proteins. Isolation of Recombinant Nishéd—Because it appeared that IRE and CSS binding complexes have a common protein(s), an expression screening of an adult chicken muscle cDNA library was done using both IRE and CSS oligonucleotides separately as probes, as reported previously (17Dhar M. Mascareno E.M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18490-18497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cDNA clone, Nishéd, thus isolated contains an insert of 1167 bp with an ORF of 132 amino acids but lacks the 5′ end of the ORF. Therefore, we performed hybrid selection to obtain the Nishéd selected mRNA, which was used as template for synthesizing the full-length cDNA. The cDNA was cloned into pBlueScript and sequenced, which confirmed that it contains the portion of the 5′-untranslated region, the conserved Kozak sequence, and a region encoding the first five amino acids that were missing in Nishéd. The full-length Nishéd cDNA has an ORF of 137 amino acids that encodes a protein of ∼15 kDa (Fig. 4). To evaluate the DNA binding potential of the recombinant Nishéd protein, its cDNA was in"

SHEP1 and Cas have several common functions, such as increasing c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity, promoting T cell activation, and regulating the actin cytoskeleton. However, it is unclear whether a physical association between SHEP1 and Cas is required for these activities. We reported previously that SHEP1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the EphB2 receptor; in this study, we further demonstrate that activated EphB2 inhibits SHEP1 association with Cas. To investigate whether phosphorylation negatively regulates the SHEP1-Cas complex, we have identified by mass spectrometry several SHEP1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites downstream of EphB2; of particular interest among them is tyrosine 635 in the Cas association/exchange factor domain. Mutation of this tyrosine to glutamic acid, but not to phenylalanine, disrupts Cas binding to SHEP1 without inhibiting Ras GTPase binding. The glutamic acid mutation also makes SHEP1 unable to promote Cas-Crk association, membrane ruffling, and cell migration toward epidermal growth factor (EGF), implying that these activities of SHEP1 depend upon a physical interaction with Cas. Association with Cas also seems to be necessary for EGF-induced SHEP1 tyrosine phosphorylation, which is mediated by a Src family kinase. It is noteworthy that EGF stimulation does not cause dissociation of SHEP1 from Cas. These data show that SHEP1 regulates membrane ruffling and cell migration and that binding to Cas is probably critical for these functions.

Cell migration is crucial during embryonic development to sort and position cells to their appropriate location within a tissue (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H.

It also plays a critical role in tissue repair, immune surveillance, inflammation, and cancer invasion and metastasis. The actin cytoskeleton is constantly undergoing reorganization in moving cells, concomitant with the formation and breakdown of cell substrate adhesion sites at the leading and trailing edges of the cell (1Ridley A.J.

Cas serves as a scaffold for multiple proteins through its various protein interaction modules, including an amino-terminal SH3 domain and multiple binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins. SH2 domain-containing proteins bind many tyrosine motifs in Cas that become phosphorylated upon integrin-mediated cell attachment and receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Many binding partners for Cas have been identified thus far, including nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase and Src, cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatases, and several adaptor proteins. The ability to form complexes with such a variety of signaling molecules enables Cas to coordinate diverse signals that influence cell behavior.A well characterized Cas signaling interaction involves recruitment of multiple copies of the Crk adaptor to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas, resulting in activation of downstream signaling pathways. The Cas-Crk complex promotes cell substrate adhesion through the Crk-associated exchange factor C3G, which activates the small GTPase Rap1 (5Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S.

The SHEP-Cas complex can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases through the SHEP SH2 domain and to integrins through Cas-mediated interactions. Thus, this complex has the characteristics of an integrator of signals from different classes of cell surface receptors.Increasing evidence suggests that SHEP proteins and Cas have a shared signaling function affecting cell proliferation and motility (15van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L.

However, it is unclear whether a physical association between SHEP proteins and Cas is required to trigger these cellular responses. Recent experiments with mutated proteins show that the SHEP family protein AND-34 causes relocalization of Cas to membrane ruffles and increased Src activity even in the absence of a direct interaction with Cas (24Riggins R.B. Quilliam L.A. Bouton A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28264-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Other findings support the importance of the SHEP1-Cas association for promoting cell polarization and other changes in cell morphology, increased c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, and T cell activation (22Sakakibara A. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4915-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Sakakibara A. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Katagiri T. J. Biol.

There are ambiguities in the interpretation of these experiments, however, because the structurally disruptive mutations that were used to evaluate the role of SHEP-Cas interaction probably affect multiple functions of either Cas or the SHEP proteins. For example, truncated SHEP proteins lacking the Cas-association domain also lack the exchange factor-like domain, making it difficult to distinguish the importance of the interaction with Cas versus the interaction with Ras GTPases.Herein, we identify tyrosine 635 in the Cas associationguanine nucleotide exchange factor (CA-GEF) domain of SHEP1 as a critical and selective site for SHEP1-Cas interaction because mutation of this single residue to glutamic acid (Y635E) disrupts the ability of SHEP1 to bind Cas without inhibiting the binding of Ras GTPases. It is interesting that the selectivity of the Y635E mutation indicates that Cas and Ras proteins have distinct modes of binding to the CA-GEF domain of SHEP1. Furthermore, the effects of the SHEP1 Y635E mutation suggest that the association of SHEP1 with Cas is required to promote epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent SHEP1 phosphorylation by Src, membrane ruffling, and cell migration toward EGF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The pcDNA3-SHEP1 vector contains nucleotides 33–2165 of the short isoform of mouse SHEP1 (also known as Chat) (GenBank™ accession number AB030442). This isoform was used because it is more widely expressed outside the hematopoietic system (18Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol.

After an initial immunoblot, some filters were stripped and then reprobed with different antibodies.Fig. 6Membrane-targeted SHEP1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and increases Cas phosphorylation by a Src kinase.A, myr-SHEP1, which is membrane-targeted by a myristoylation signal, is tyrosine phosphorylated. B, myrSHEP1 causes increased Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the myrSHEP1 Y635E mutant does not. 293 cells (A) or COS cells (B) transfected with the indicated constructs were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-SHEP1 (A) or anti-Cas (B) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PTyr) and re-probed with the immunoprecipitating antibody. C, dominant-negative, kinase-inactive Src (Src DN) inhibits Cas phosphorylation in 293 cells expressing myristoylated SHEP1, suggesting that a Src kinase phosphorylates Cas. Cas immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and reprobed with anti-Cas antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GST Pull-down Experiments—Hippocampal lysates were prepared using a modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0) containing 1 mm sodium pervanadate and protease inhibitors. GST-SHEP1 CA-GEF immobilized on glutathione beads was incubated with hippocampal lysate for 1 h. Pull-down experiments with GST-Cas fusion proteins were performed for 45 min with 293T cells transiently transfected with myrSHEP1 and lysed in Brij buffer (see previous section).MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—293T cells transiently transfected with SHEP1 and EphB2 or EphB2 alone were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and 5 mm EDTA. Lysates were incubated with 100 μg of anti-SHEP1 antibodies bound to 30 μl of GammaBind Plus Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed three times in the above buffer, boiled in 1% SDS, and reprecipitated (32Soans C. Holash J.A. Pavlova Y. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The samples were then washed three times in the above buffer and three times in 0.1% 1-O-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (98%) and 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Endoproteinase Glu-C/trypsin proteolytic digestions were performed with sequence grade proteases in 100 μl of100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight with endoproteinase Glu-C (50 ng/μl) first, followed by a overnight tryptic digestion at 37 °C (50 ng/μl). Endoproteinases were inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml). The digested samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were removed. The sedimented beads were washed twice with 200 L of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the supernatant and washes were combined with 20 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies conjugated to agarose (33De Corte V. Demol H. Goethals M. Van Damme J. Gettemans J. Vandekerckhove J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for overnight incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, and then packed into a 10-μl Geloader Tip (Eppendorf). The beads in the tip were washed three times with 60 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8. The phosphopeptides were eluted in 20-μl aliquots of 100 mm phosphate, pH 2.5, directly into a zip tip packed with C18, which had been equilibrated by washing 3 times with 20 μl of 75% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA followed three times with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA. After cycling each acid eluate through the zip tip five times, the tip was washed five times with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA. For samples submitted for MALDI analysis, phosphopeptides were eluted from the zip tip in 3 μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxcinnamic acid in 3 μl of 75% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA directly onto a target.Mass spectra were collected on a Voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser, delayed extraction, and a reflector. Spectra were externally calibrated with angiotensin I (MH+ = 1296.69), and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragments (1–17, MH+ = 2093.09; 18–39, MH+ = 2465.20; 7–38, MH+ = 3657.93). For interpretation of the mass spectra, a list of predicted molecular masses was generated by theoretical cleavage with specific endoproteinases using the MS-Digest program (prospector.ucsf.edu). Each peptide was assumed to contain at least one phosphate group. The masses of the peaks recorded in the mass spectra were matched to the calculated masses with an accuracy of at least 0.15%.Membrane Ruffling—Transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells were starved overnight in DME with 0.5% FBS starting 24 h after transfection. Twelve hours later, cells were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin in EDTA (Invitrogen), collected in DME with 0.5% BSA, washed, and kept in suspension for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were then allowed to attach on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 3 h, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% TX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with Alexa 594 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and DAPI (Molecular Probes). Co-expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used to identify transfected cells. For quantification, cells with ruffles were counted by an investigator blind to the transfected protein.Cell Migration—Transiently transfected COS cells were starved in DME with 0.5% FBS for 16 h. Cells (100,000 cells/well) were then seeded on Transwell filters (Corning Inc.) that had been coated on both sides with 10 μg/ml fibronectin and blocked with 1% BSA. Cells were allowed to migrate toward 20 ng/ml EGF in DMEM and 0.5% FBS. After migration, cells on the upper side of the filters were removed, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% TX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with DAPI, and mounted on glass slides. Transfected cells (positive for EGFP and DAPI) that had migrated to the bottom side of the filters were counted under a fluorescent microscope and expressed as the number of cells in 10 microscope fields (60× magnification). Untransfected cells (positive only for DAPI) were also counted separately as a control (not shown). Transfection efficiencies were determined from separate aliquots of transfected cells that were plated on glass coverslips. Lysates from the transfected cells were also probed by immunoblotting to verify expression of the transfected proteins (not shown).RESULTSEph Receptors and the EGF Receptor Both Enhance SHEP1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation but Have Different Effects on the Association of SHEP1 with Cas—We reported previously that SHEP1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues downstream of EphB2 (14Dodelet V.C.

Immunoprecipitation of SHEP1 from extracts of 293 human embryonal kidney cells expressing activated EphA2, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, showed that SHEP1 is similarly phosphorylated downstream of EphA2 (Fig. 1A). Hence, SHEP1 is a target of both EphA and EphB receptors. Other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF and NGF receptors, have been reported to enhance SHEP1 (Chat) phosphorylation on serine/threonine but not tyrosine residues in PC-12 cells (18Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In COS cells, however, we readily detected SHEP1 tyrosine phosphorylation after EGF receptor activation (Fig. 1B), as discussed by others (18Sakakibara A. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6404-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of different families of receptor tyrosine kinases can induce SHEP1 tyrosine phosphorylation.Because tyrosine phosphorylation is a well known mechanism for regulating protein interactions, we next examined whether the EGF receptor and EphB2 have an effect on the association of SHEP1 with Cas. We detected less Cas bound to SHEP1 in cells expressing activated EphB2 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, EGF receptor activation did not inhibit the interaction between SHEP1 and Cas (Fig. 1B).Activated EphB2 Causes Phosphorylation of Tyrosine 635 in the SHEP1 CA-GEF Domain—To identify the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SHEP1 in EphB2-tranfected cells, which may disrupt the association of SHEP1 with Cas, we used a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry approach. SHEP1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation from 293 cells transfected with both SHEP1 and EphB2 and digested with endoproteinase Glu-C or trypsin.

One member of this family, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), displays biological functions more restricted to the neuromuscular axis. We have recently identified two additional ligands for the CNTF receptor complex. Both are composite cytokines formed by cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associated to either the soluble type I cytokine receptor CLF or the soluble form of CNTF receptor α (CNTFRα). The present study was aimed at analyzing the interactions between the cytokine CLC and its different receptor chains. For this purpose, we modeled CLC/receptor interactions to define the residues potentially involved in the contact sites. We then performed site-directed mutagenesis on these residues and analyzed the biological interactions between mutants and receptor chains. Importantly, we found that CLC interacts with the soluble forms of CNTFRα and CLF via sites 1 and 3, respectively. For site 1, the most crucial residues involved in the interaction are Trp67, Arg170, and Asp174, which interact with CNTFRα. Surprisingly, the residues that are important for the interaction of CLC with CLF are part of the conserved FXXK motif of site 3 known to be the interaction site of LIFRβ. Obtained results show that the Phe151 and Lys154 residues are effectively involved in the interaction of CLC with LIFRβ. This study establishes the molecular details of the interaction of CLC with CLF, CNTFRα, and LIFRβ and helps to define the precise role of each protein in this functional receptor complex.

Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Binding of the cytokine to its nonsignaling α chain leads to the recruitment and dimerization of the signaling subunits gp130 and LIFRβ. The subsequent signaling cascade involves activation of the Janus kinase (JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) pathways (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar).One member of this family, CNTF, displays a narrow spectrum of activity restricted principally to the neuromuscular axis. It promotes the differentiation and survival of a wide range of cell types in the nervous system (18Arakawa Y. Sendtner M. Thoenen H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, CNTF maintains motor neuron viability in vitro, prevents the degeneration of axotomized motor neurons, and attenuates motor deficits in different strains of mice with neuromuscular deficiencies (19Stockli K.A.

Nature. 1992; 358: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In addition to its activities in the nervous system, CNTF has trophic effects on denervated skeletal muscle and is a regulator of muscular strength in aging (24Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L.

Kreher P. Gascan H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1257-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To exert its biological functions, CNTF binds first to the CNTF receptor α chain (CNTFRα) and subsequently recruits the transducing subunits gp130 and LIFRβ.The existence of additional ligand(s) for the CNTF receptor (CNTFRα) was first suggested by a study comparing the phenotypic consequences of disrupting CNTF versus CNTFRα genes. Unlike mice lacking CNTF, those lacking CNTFRα die perinatally and display severe motor neuron deficits. Thus, the CNTFRα subunit plays a critical role during development by serving as a receptor for a second developmentally important ligand. Moreover, a null mutation in the human CNTF gene does not lead to neurological disease (26Takahashi R. Yokoji H. Misawa H. Hayashi M. Hu J. Deguchi T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).We have recently identified additional ligands for the CNTF receptor complex as neuropoietin (8Derouet D. Rousseau F. Alfonsi F. Froger J. Hermann J. Barbier F. Perret D. Diveu C. Guillet C. Preisser L. Dumont A. Barbado M. Morel A. deLapeyriere O. Gascan H. Chevalier S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and as the composite cytokine formed by CLC (also known as novel neurotrophin-1/B cell stimulatory factor-3), associated to the soluble type I cytokine receptor CLF (13Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H. Froger J. Suard I. de Coignac A.B. Delneste Y. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We initially observed that CLC, although containing a signal peptide, was inefficiently secreted when expressed in mammalian cells (13Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H. Froger J. Suard I. de Coignac A.B. Delneste Y. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Its secretion could only be induced upon co-expression with CLF, leading to the formation of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine (13Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H. Froger J. Suard I. de Coignac A.B. Delneste Y. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Like CNTF, CLC/CLF recruits cells expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor on their surface; induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, LIFRβ, and STAT3 in neuroblastoma cells; and acts as a survival factor for motor neurons cultured in vitro (27Lelievre E. Plun-Favreau H. Chevalier S. Froger J. Guillet C. Elson G.C. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22476-22484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).We subsequently observed that CLC could also form a second secreted composite cytokine when associated with the soluble form of CNTFRα (sCNTFRα). Similarly to LIF, CLC/sCNTFRα displays activities on cells only expressing gp130 and LIFRβ on their surface (14Plun-Favreau H. Elson G. Chabbert M. Froger J. deLapeyriere O. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Hermann J. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Chevalier S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1692-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For both CLC/CLF and CLC/sCNTFRα, there is no covalent link between CLC and the soluble receptor portions. We have also demonstrated that a fusion protein comprising CLC covalently tethered to sCNTFRα via a glycine/serine linker shows enhanced activities compared with the native heterodimeric cytokine (28Guillet C.

Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F. Yu N. Wang J. Singh K. Zonin F. Vaisberg E. Churakova T. Liu M. Gorman D. Wagner J. Zurawski S. Liu Y. Abrams J.S. Moore K.W. Rennick D. de Waal-Malefyt R.

Willems F. Caignard A. Berglund P. Liljestrom P. Burny A. Chouaib S. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The association between CLC and CLF is also closely related to the recently described heterodimeric cytokine IL-27 where p28 binds the soluble receptor EBI-3 (7Pflanz S. Timans J.C. Cheung J. Rosales R. Kanzler H. Gilbert J. Hibbert L. Churakova T. Travis M. Vaisberg E. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J.D. Wagner J.L. To W. Zurawski S. McClanahan T.K. Gorman D.M. Bazan J.F. de Waal Malefyt R.

A. 1997; 94: 12041-12046Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy to underline that for CLC, p35, p19, and p28, an association to the soluble receptor counterpart is an absolute requirement to allow the cytokine moiety secretion. These studies reveal an interesting degree of mechanistic promiscuity between the IL-6 and IL-12-type ligands and their multichain receptor complexes.The IL-6 family cytokines belong to the long chain four α-helix bundle class first defined in 1991 (40Bazan J.F. Neuron. 1991; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that these cytokines interact successively with their receptor chains through three binding sites, numbered from 1 to 3 by analogy with growth hormone (GH) (41de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Cytokines requiring a co-receptor α chain bind to this receptor by site 1 formed by the association of the C-terminal parts of the AB loop and of the αD helix. gp130 interacts through binding site 2 located on the solvent exposed faces of the αA and αC helices of the cytokine. These sites are similar to sites 1 and 2 of GH (41de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). An additional site of interaction (site 3) corresponds to a second gp130-binding site for IL-6 and IL-11 and to a LIFRβ binding site for LIF, OSM, CT-1, and CNTF. The LIFRβ-binding site is characterized by an FXXK motif located at the N terminus of αD helix of the cytokine and constitutes the signature of this interaction. Based on the structural features of CLF and CNTFRα, these receptors were expected to interact with CLC via site 1.The present study was aimed at analyzing the interactions between the cytokine CLC and its different receptor chains. For this purpose, we modeled CLC to define different residues potentially implied in the interactions. We then performed site-directed mutagenesis on these residues and analyzed the biological interactions between mutants and receptor chains. Importantly, the results obtained reveal that interactions of CLC with either sCNTFRα or CLF involved different recognition patterns depending on the composite cytokine studied.MATERIALS AND METHODSSequence Alignments—Molecular modeling of proteins sharing low identity rates is guided by the quality of the alignment between template(s) and target sequences. To build a correct model for CLC, we aligned human CLC (GenBank™ accession number NP_037378.1) with the following orthologs and paralogs of the IL-6 family: murine CLC (NP_064336), human (NP_000605.1), murine (Q02011), rat (NP_037298.1), pig (O02732), chicken (P51642), and rabbit (P14188) CNTF; human (NP_001321), murine (NP_031821), and rat (NP_058825) CT-1; human (NP_002300), mouse (NP_032527), rat (NP_071532), pig (S23069), bovine (BAA19511), brush-tail possum (AAG32326), and mink (O62728) LIF; and human (NP_065391), mouse (XP_137493), and bovine (NP_783644) OSM. The multiple sequence alignment presented on Fig. 1 was obtained using the program T-Coffee (www.cmbi.kun.nl/bioinf/tools/T_COFFEE/) (42Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5383) Google Scholar) and rendered with GeneDoc (www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/) (43Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield D.W.I. EMBnew. news. 1997; : 4-14Google Scholar). Red- and black-shaded letters represent conserved hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues between sequences, respectively. Manual refinements of the alignment were introduced to improve the accuracy of the modeling phase.All cytokines that have a resolved structure (IL-6, vIL-6, CNTF, LIF, OSM, erythropoietin, and GH) and CLC were analyzed with the Network Prediction [email protected] server at the Pôle Bioinformatique Lyonnais (Lyon, France) (44Deleage G. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to build a consensus structure prediction on each sequence.Molecular Modeling—CLC and CNTFRα were homology modeled by satisfaction of spatial restraints using the program Modeler (45Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar) implemented on a SGI Octane work station (SGI, San Diego, CA). Human CNTF (Protein Data Bank code 1CNT) (46McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and LIF (Protein Data Bank code 1PVH) (47Boulanger M.J. Bankovich A.J. Kortemme T. Baker D. Garcia K.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were used as templates for the molecular modeling of CLC. In a first approach, the atomic coordinates of CNTF were used to model the hydrophobic core of the protein. This modeling step was required to fix side chain orientations of main residues potentially involved in the interaction of CLC with its receptor subunits. The GH loop fragment between Asn63 and Leu76 was subsequently used to model the corresponding part on CLC (Asp63-Leu76). In the third step of the analysis, a 12-residue α-helix was designed using the Biopolymer module of InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). This helix has been fitted to the short helix present on the GH-like modeled loop of CLC. This step increased the size of the AB loop αA′-helix in accordance with the secondary structure prediction (see Fig. 1). In the final steps of the molecular modeling process, the N-terminal part of the AB loop and the αD helix of LIF were used to model the corresponding fragment on CLC. CNTFRα was modeled based on the structure of IL-6Rα (Protein Data Bank code 1P9M) (48Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and of p40 for the DE loop (Protein Data Bank code 1F45) (49Yoon C. Johnston S.C. Tang J. Stahl M. Tobin J.F. Somers W.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3530-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All of the models were energy-minimized and quality-verified using the Profiles3D (50Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) and Procheck programs (51Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).Cells and Reagents—Cos-7 fibroblast cells, KB epidermoid carcinoma, and SK-N-GP neuroblastoma cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The culture medium of Ba/F3 cells modified to express the functional receptor subunits for CNTF (BAF GLC) was supplemented with 5 ng/ml human CNTF. CNTF, LIF, and IL-2 were from R & D Systems (Oxon, UK). The 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-CNTFRα (AN-E4 and AN-C2) (both IgG2a) and anti-human CLF (AN-F-C6) (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies were generated in our laboratory (14Plun-Favreau H. Elson G. Chabbert M. Froger J. deLapeyriere O.

The anti-protein C (HPC4) and anti-c-Myc antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science. The anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody and the mAb detecting phospho-705-STAT3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. The IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was bought from Diaclone (Besançon, France).CLC Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pcDNA3 vector containing the cDNA encoding the human CLC tagged at the C terminus with c-Myc and protein C epitopes was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were performed on the putative site 1 and site 3 residues of CLC as described under “Results.”Cell Transfection and Protein Purification—cDNAs encoding wild type CLC, CLC mutants, CLF, or sCNTFRα were transfected in Cos-7 cells using the ExGen reagent (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 72-h culture period, the supernatants were harvested and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography using an anti-protein C affinity column (Roche Applied Science). Protein purity and concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the gels using a bovine serum albumin standard.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—72 h after transfection with the appropriate cDNAs, the cell supernatants were harvested, and the cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1% Brij 96. The cell lysates and supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with either the anti-c-Myc, the anti-CLF (AN-F-C6), or the anti-CNTFRα (AN-C2) mAb (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The complexes were then isolated using beads coupled to protein A (Amersham Biosciences), submitted to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). The membranes were successively incubated with the biotinylated HPC4 mAb and a polystreptavidin-peroxidase solution. The reaction was visualized on x-ray film using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Tyrosine Phosphorylation Analysis—After a 24-h incubation period in serum-free medium, SK-N-GP cells were stimulated for 10 min with the appropriate cytokines (52Robledo O. Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Guillet C. Auguste P. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Pennica D. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4855-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cells were then lysed as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting” except that the detergent used was Nonidet P-40. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with a mAb specific for the tyrosine phosphorylated form of STAT3. The membranes were stripped in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 15-24 h and neutralized in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, before reblotting with an antibody recognizing all of the STAT3 isoforms.Flow Cytometry Analysis—BAF GLC cells were successively incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with transfected Cos-7 cells supernatants as indicated, the appropriate primary antibody or an isotype control antibody (10 μg/ml) and a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Fluorescence was subsequently analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer from Beckton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA).Biological Assays—For proliferation assays, BAF GLC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Serial dilutions of cytokines tested were performed in triplicate. After a 72-h incubation period, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well for the last 4 h of the culture, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For IL-6 production assays, KB cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well in culture medium containing 220 pg/ml of CNTF, LIF, WT purified CLC, or mutant purified CLC as indicated. After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested, and their IL-6 content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (13Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S.

https://openalex.org/W2050606679,"Combined biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic studies on the lactose permease of Escherichia coli suggest that Arg-144 (helix V) forms a salt bridge with Glu-126 (helix IV), which is broken during substrate binding, thereby permitting the guanidino group to form a bidentate H-bond with the C-4 and C-3 O atoms of the galactopyranosyl moiety and an H-bond with Glu-269 (helix VIII). To examine the relative interaction of Arg-144 with these two potential salt bridge partners (Glu-126 and Glu-269) in the absence of substrate, the covalent modification of the guanidino group was monitored with the Arg-specific reagent butane-2,3-dione using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In a functional background, the reactivity of Arg-144 with butane-2,3-dione is low (∼25%) and is reduced by a factor of approximately 2 by preincubation with ligand. Interestingly, although replacement of Glu-126 with Ala results in a 3-fold increase in the reactivity of Arg-144, replacement of Glu-269 with Ala elicits virtually no effect. Taken together, these results suggest that in the absence of substrate the interaction between Arg-144 and Glu-126 is much stronger than the interaction with Glu-269, supporting the contention that sugar recognition leads to rearrangement of charge-paired residues essential for sugar binding.

Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar) and contains over 1000 members, some of which are clinically relevant (e.g. the glucose transporters). As revealed by phylogenetic analysis, most members of this family have a similar topology consisting of 12 transmembrane domains, probably in α-helical conformation, suggesting that they are evolutionarily related (1Saier Jr., M.H. Beatty J.T. Goffeau A. Harley K.T. Heijne W.H. Huang S.C. Jack D.L. Jahn P.S. Lew K. Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which utilize free energy from an electrochemical proton gradient to catalyze the energetically uphill transport of d-galactopyranosides across the cell membrane or vice versa (3Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics: Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996Google Scholar). Typical of the MFS, LacY contains 12 transmembrane helices connected by hydrophilic loops, with both the N and C termini on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (4Foster D.L. Boublik M. Kaback H.R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 43: 13015-13019Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the substrate specificity of LacY is directed toward the galactopyranosyl ring of substrate and, most importantly, toward the C-4 OH of the galactopyranosyl ring. Galactose is the most specific substrate of LacY but has a very low affinity (Kd(app) ∼ 30 mm) (12Sahin-Tóth M. Akhoon K.M. Runner J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and substitutions at the anomeric position can markedly increase affinity up to 3 orders of magnitude by nonspecific interactions (15Sahin-Tóth M. Gunawan P. Lawrence M.C. Toyokuni T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13039-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An important advance with regard to unraveling the mechanism of LacY has been the solution of the x-ray structure of the inward facing conformation of a LacY mutant (C154G) with a bound lactose homologue, β-d-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (TDG) (7Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The overall structure reveals pseudo 2-fold symmetry between the N- and the C-terminal 6-helix domains, as proposed for other members of the MFS (16Hirai T. Heymann J.A. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1712-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Remarkably, similar pseudo symmetry and helical packing were also found simultaneously in the x-ray structure of the Pi/glycerol-3-phosphate (GlpT) antiporter of E. coli (17Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), another MFS member. This structural similarity is even more interesting because the two proteins have only ∼20% homology and catalyze completely different reactions. Interestingly, LacY and GlpT were crystallized in the same inward facing conformation, although the GlpT structure was obtained in the absence of bound ligand. The sugar-binding site in LacY is located in a large water-filled cavity open only to the cytoplasm at the pseudo 2-fold axis of symmetry situated in the approximate middle of the membrane (Fig. 1A). Arg-144 (helix V) and Glu-126 (helix IV) are the major determinants for sugar binding (Fig. 1B). Arg-144 determines the stereoselectivity of LacY forming a bidentate H-bond with the O-3 and O-4 atoms of the galactopyranosyl ring, whereas Glu-126 probably interacts with O-4, O-5, or O-6 via water molecules. Interestingly, however, indirect biochemical approaches suggest the presence of a salt bridge between Glu-126 and Arg-144 when substrate is not bound (18Frillingos S. Ujwal M.L. Sun J. Kaback H.R.

Furthermore, as predicted (23Guan L. Hu Y. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the structure exhibits hydrophobic stacking between the galactopyranosyl ring of TDG and the indole side chain of Trp-151 (Fig. 1B). The nature of this interaction has been extended recently (24Vazquez-Ibar J.L. Guan L. Svrakic M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by luminescence spectroscopy. Glu-269 also plays an important role in the architecture of the binding site in the inward facing conformation (Fig. 1B), and functional characterization of Glu-269 mutants indicates that this may be a key residue in coupling between sugar binding and H+ translocation (7Abramson J.

Thus, with the exception of aspartic acid, which demonstrates a dramatic alteration in the H+/TDG stoichiometry (25Ujwal M.L. Sahin-Tóth M. Persson B. Kaback H.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), all other replacements for Glu-269 do not bind sugar and are completely defective in all modes of translocation (28Sahin-Tóth M. Karlin A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the current structure, Glu-269 forms a salt bridge with Arg-144 and is situated in a position to form an H-bond with the indole nitrogen of Trp-151. Finally, studies combining chemical modification with mass spectrometry suggest an interaction between Glu-269 and the O-3 of p-nitrophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (NPGal), probably mediated by a water molecule (30Weinglass A.B. Whitelegge J.P. Hu Y. Verner G.E. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). From the combined data, it seems clear that understanding the role of Glu-269 in the structural organization of the binding site is essential to understand coupling between substrate and H+ translocation. In this paper, we present experiments that describe the interplay among Glu-126, Arg-144, and Glu-269 in sugar recognition. Experimentally, this is accomplished by engineering LacY to retain function and simultaneously produce a unique peptide containing Arg-144 on cleavage with cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Subsequently, the effects of substrate and mutations on the reactivity of Arg-144 can be probed using the Arg-specific reagent butane-2,3-dione (BD) (31Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. 1. CRC Press, New York1995: 187-208Google Scholar) and monitored by ESI-MS. Consistent with the x-ray structure, substrate protects against BD modification of Arg-144. Moreover, when Glu-126, the putative charge pair partner of Arg-144, is replaced with Ala, the reactivity of Arg-144 with BD increases ∼3-fold. Remarkably, replacement of another carboxyl group close to Arg-144 and within 5 Å of the substrate (E269A) elicits no significant effect on the reactivity of Arg-144. Taken together, the observations provide further evidence for a salt bridge between Glu-126 and Arg-144 that is broken during sugar binding, a process involving the rearrangement of interactions between essential residues. Materials—TDG,NPGal,p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside(NPGlc), diisopropylcarbodiimide (DiPC), and BD were purchased from Sigma. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) was purchased from Calbiochem. Synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys, and restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Construction of LacY Mutants—Two-step PCR mutagenesis of the genes encoding wild-type and C154G LacY (in plasmid pT7-5 bearing a His10 tag) generated products containing the double mutation R135M/R142S. These PCR products were subcloned back into wild-type LacY as PstI/KpnI fragments. Thereafter, PCR fragments containing the mutations E126A, E269A, and E126A/E269A were generated on the R135M/R142S and R135M/R142S/C154G backgrounds and subcloned back into wild-type LacY in pT7-5 as PstI/SpeI fragments. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transport Assays—E. coli T184 expressing given permease mutants were washed once with 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgSO4 and adjusted to an optical density of 10.0 at 600 nm (0.7 mg of protein/ml). Transport was initiated by the addition of [1-14C]lactose (5 mCi/mmol) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Samples were quenched at given times with 100 mm potassium Pi (pH 5.5), 100 mm LiCl and assayed by rapid filtration as described previously (32Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains, Growth, and LacY Purification—E. coli T184 (lacZ–Y–) transformed with pT7-5 encoding LacY mutants with a His10 tag was grown in 6 liters of Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C, respectively, containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell, and the membrane fraction was harvested by ultracentrifugation. Membranes were solubilized by DDM to a final concentration of 2%, and LacY was purified by cobalt affinity chromatography (Talon Superflow™, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (7Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Protein eluted with 200 mm imidazole was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% DDM, concentrated by using a Vivaspin 20 concentrator (30-kDa cutoff) (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany), and stored on ice. As determined by SDS-12% PAGE followed by silver nitrate staining, the preparations contained only a single band with an molecular mass of ∼33 kDa. Protein was assayed by using a micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence was recorded by a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ) equipped with a double grating monochromator, Glan Thompson polarizers, and a cuvette holder thermostatted at 25 °C. Time courses of 2-(4-maleimidoanalino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid labeling were conducted with 1 μm protein in 50 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% DDM in 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvettes with constant stirring at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding 2-(4-maleimidoanalino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid to a final concentration of 5 μm, and fluorescence was recorded over time. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 332 and 415 nm, respectively, and slits were 2 nm in both monochromators. DiPC, BD Labeling, and Sample Preparation for Reverse Phase HPLC of CNBr Fragments—DiPC and BD were freshly prepared as 1 m stocks dissolved in Me2SO. After dialysis of purified protein in 50 mm sodium Pi (pH 6.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% DDM (for DiPC modification) or 50 mm NaBO2 (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% DDM (for BD modification), the protein was reacted with DiPC or BD at 30 °C for a given time and immediately precipitated with CHCl3/MeOH, as described previously (33Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3160) Google Scholar). One aliquot (100 μl) of the aqueous protein solution at a concentration of 1–2 mg/ml was diluted 1:3 (v/v) with MeOH and mixed briefly. CHCl3 (100 μl) was added and mixed, yielding a single phase. Phase separation was accomplished by adding water (200 μl) and mixing vigorously. The phases were separated by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 2 min), yielding a precipitate at the interface. The bulk of the upper aqueous methanol phase was then carefully aspirated, and methanol (300 μl) was added. After gently mixing, insoluble protein in the single phase mixture was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. For cleavage of the protein, after drying, the pellet was resuspended in a saturated solution of CNBr in 90% formic acid (34Witkop B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1961; 16: 221-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and left for 2 h in the dark. Formic acid was removed in a vacuum centrifuge, and the pellet was left overnight in 0.5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The sample was dried again and resuspended in 60% formic acid immediately prior to RP-HPLC. HPLC—For the final purification of LacY after covalent modification with DiPC or BD, HPLC was used prior to ESI-MS in an in-line setup. To separate the CNBr peptides generated from LacY, a polystyrene/divinylbenzene co-polymer column (5 μm, 300 Å, 150 × 2.1 mm) (PLRP/S, Polymer Labs) at 40 °C was used for reverse phase chromatography (35Whitelegge J.P. Jewess P. Pickering M.G. Gerrish C. Camilleri P. Bowyer J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following equilibration in a mixture of 95% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to 5% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN:isopropanol (1:1)) for 5 min, the percentage of solvent B was increased to 40% over the next 25 min and further to 100% over the subsequent 120 min at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. All chromatographic separations were performed at 40 °C using a modified ABI 120A dual syringe pump HPLC equipped with a post-detector (A280) splitter for backpressure regulation. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API III triple quadrupole instrument operating in the positive ion mode as described previously (36Whitelegge J.P. Gundersen C.B. Faull K.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The orifice potential was ramped from 60 to 120 V across the mass range (600–2300 a.m.u.) for CNBr fragments. Tandem mass spectrometry fragment ion spectra were obtained by splitting the flow into the API III during RP-HPLC and collecting peptides of interest for infusion (3 μl/min) into a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca ion trap instrument with a 33-gauge stainless steel needle source at 3.3 kV. The nomenclature used for fragment ions is N-terminal fragments (b type) and C-terminal fragments (y type) (37Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). Engineering LacY to Probe the Reactivity of Arg-144—The group-specific modification reagent BD reacts specifically with the guanidino group of Arg enabling the environment of Arg-144 to be probed in a functional background (see Fig. 3A). Following modification of LacY by BD and cleavage with CNBr, the peptides produced are resolved by RP-HPLC in-line with ESI-MS. There are 12 Arg residues in LacY, three of which are in the CNBr fragment containing Arg-144 (30Weinglass A.B. Whitelegge J.P. Hu Y. Verner G.E. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), thus making quantification of Arg-144 modification challenging. Based on previous mutagenesis studies (39Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), LacY was engineered so that following cleavage with CNBr a small peptide containing only Arg-144 was produced by replacing two non-essential residues (R135M/R142S). To examine the environment of Arg-144 under conditions in which the predicted charge pair between Glu-126 and Arg-144 is broken by sugar binding, Glu-126 was replaced with Ala to generate mutant E126A/R135M/R142S. Likewise, to probe the effect of another substrate-binding residue (Glu-269) on the reactivity of Arg-144, Glu-269 was replaced with Ala to generate mutants E269A/R135M/R142S and E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S. Mutants R135M/R142S, E126A/R135M/R142S, E269A/R135M/R142S, and E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S were generated in the wild-type background (to assess transport activity of the mutants) and in the mutant C154G background (for comparison with the x-ray structure). E. coli T184 (lacZ–Y–) expressing wild-type LacY catalyzes lactose accumulation at a high rate to a steady state of ∼150 nmol/mg of protein in ∼10 min, which corresponds to a 100-fold concentration gradient (Fig. 2A). Similarly, mutant R135M/R142S demonstrates a similar rate and steady-state level of lactose accumulation, although mutants E126A/R135M/R142S, E269A/R135M/R142S, and E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S do not significantly accumulate lactose to levels higher than T184 transformed with a vector lacking the LacY gene (Fig. 2A). Like mutant C154G (40Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), mutant R135M/R142S/C154G demonstrates a very low level of lactose accumulation and, as expected, mutants E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G, E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G, and E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G do not accumulate lactose (Fig. 2B). However, purified mutant R135M/R142S/C154G binds TDG, whereas purified mutants E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G, E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G, and E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G do not (data not shown). CNBr cleavage of all R135M/R142S LacY constructs followed by RP-HPLC in-line with ESI-MS reveals a new peptide with a measured monoisotopic mass ([M+H]+) of 1097.2 compared with the expected monoisotopic mass of 1097.5. Notably, most of the observed ions existed in a doubly charged state with an m/z of 549.2 compared with the expected 549.25. Collision-activated dissociation of the doubly charged parent ion at m/z 549.2 revealed fragment ions consistent with the sequence 135SNFEFGSARM145 (Fig. 3B, I). BD reacts with mutant R135M/R142S/C154G, and cleavage with CNBr reveals that approximately 20% of the peptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 is modified rapidly; however, the reaction is completed at ∼25% modification in 20 min, most likely because of instability in water (Fig. 3C). The modified species has an m/z value of 592.2 for the doubly charged peptide and a measured monoisotopic mass of 1182.2 compared with the expected m/z and monoisotopic values of 592.25 and 1183.5, respectively. Collision-activated dissociation of the peptide reveals fragment ions consistent with the sequence 135SNFEFGSARM145 modified at Arg-144 by BD (Fig. 3B, II). Influence of Position 126 on the Reactivity of Arg-144 and Glu-269—Following determination of the reactivity of mutant R135M/R142S/C154G with BD (Fig. 3C), the reactivity was also determined for mutant E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G. Mutant E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G reacts rapidly with BD for ∼20 min, and the reaction is essentially complete thereafter. Strikingly, in contrast to mutant R135M/R142S/C154G, the extent of modification is ∼3-fold greater (Fig. 3C). Following reaction of mutant R135M/R142S/C154G with BD for 30 min, 33% of peptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 is modified (Fig. 4, compare I with II). Preincubation with the high affinity ligand NPGal reduces the rate of modification of the decapeptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 by over 2-fold (Fig. 4, compare II with III). The effect is substrate-specific because NPGlc, which has no measurable affinity for LacY, has no significant effect on the rate of BD modification (data not shown). Interestingly, with mutant E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G, the decapeptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 is modified by BD to over twice the extent of that observed with R135M/R142S/C154G (Fig. 4, compare V with II), and preincubation with NPGal has no effect whatsoever on BD modification (Fig. 4, V and VI). Because replacing Glu-126 with Ala elicits a marked effect on the extent of BD reactivity with Arg-144, the reactivity of another residue involved in binding (Glu-269) was probed (30Weinglass A.B. Whitelegge J.P. Hu Y. Verner G.E. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1467-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By this means, it can be determined whether the E126A mutation elicits a widespread conformational change in the protein or a localized alteration. As shown previously, reaction of mutant R135M/R142S/C154G with the carboxyl-specific reagent DiPC leads to covalent modification of ∼33% of the peptide 268GELLNASIM276 in 30 min (Fig. 5, compare I with II). Preincubation with NPGal reduces the rate of modification of 268GELLNASIM276 by ∼2-fold (Fig. 5, compare II with III). The effect is substrate-specific because NPGlc, which has no measurable affinity for LacY, exerts no significant effect on the rate of DiPC modification (data not shown). In mutant E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G, 268GELLNASIM276 is modified by DiPC at approximately the same rate (∼30% in 30 min) (Fig. 5, compare IV with V); however, in this mutant, preincubation with NPGal has little effect on DiPC modification (Fig. 5, compare V and VI). Influence of Position 269 on the Reactivity of Arg-144—The x-ray structure of LacY indicates that Arg-144 forms a salt bridge with Glu-269 in the presence of substrate. Therefore, the influence of Glu-269 on the reactivity of Arg-144 with BD was examined in the absence of substrate in mutants E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G and E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G. Following reaction of mutant E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G with BD for 30 min, ∼30% of peptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 is modified (Fig. 6, compare I with II). Preincubation with the high affinity ligand NPGal has no significant effect on BD modification of the decapeptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 (Fig. 6, compare II with III). Likewise, with mutant E269A/E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G, the decapeptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 is modified by BD to over twice the extent (∼66%) of that observed with E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G (Fig. 6, compare V with II), and preincubation with NPGal has no significant effect on BD modification (Fig. 6, V and VI). These differences in reactivity between mutants are constant over a time course (Fig. 7).Fig. 7BD modification of mutants E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G and E126A/E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G. Time courses are shown of 135SNFEFGSARM145 modification by BD in mutants E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G (1) and E126A/E269A/R135M/R142S/C154G (2). Comparison is made with mutants R135M/R142S/C154G (3) and E126A/R135M/R142S/C154G (4) (see Fig. 3C) shown in dashed lines. Purified LacY (∼40 μm) in DDM (pH 8.0) was incubated with 20 mm BD at 30 °C, leading to a mass shift of 86 Da. The total ion current from peptide 135SNFEFGSARM145 modified by BD divided by the total ion current from unmodified and modified 135SNFEFGSARM145 was used to calculate the percentage of modification of Arg-144. No measurable difference in the ionization efficiency of the unmodified and modified peptides was detected. Each point represents the average of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The x-ray structure of an inward facing conformation of LacY with bound substrate (7Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) provides a framework for understanding the molecular basis of substrate recognition and translocation by LacY, a paradigm for the MFS family of secondary membrane transport proteins. By integrating the structure with biochemical and biophysical analyses, a model for the mechanism for lactose/H+ symport has been proposed (7Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Influx consists of six steps starting from the outward facing conformation as shown in Fig. 8: (I) protonation of LacY; (II) binding of lactose; (III) a conformational change that results in the inward facing conformation; (IV) release of substrate; (V) release of proton; and (VI) return to the outward facing conformation. Using the x-ray structure of the inward facing conformation with substrate bound as a structural foundation, mass spectral techniques have been exploited to gain detailed insights into local alterations in structure induced by substrate binding. One surprise from the x-ray structure is the absence of a salt bridge between Glu-126 and Arg-144. Previous functional studies demonstrate that the carboxyl and guanidino side chains at positions 126 and 144, respectively, are critical for substrate binding (19Venkatesan P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9802-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Sahin-Tóth M. le Coutre J. Kharabi D. le Maire G. Lee J.C. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and translocation (41Frillingos S. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14284-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, close physical proximity of Glu-126 and Arg-144 has been inferred from site-directed spectroscopic studies with E126C/R144C LacY (42Zhao M. Zen K.-C. Hernandez-Borrell J. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15970-15977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and spontaneous disulfide formation (22Wolin C.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, the reactivity of Cys-148 (helix V) is reduced dramatically by removal of the carboxyl group from position 126 (19Venkatesan P. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9802-9807Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of all of these experiments must be placed within the context of either an inactive background (E126C/R144C) or changes in reactivity of an indirect reporter (Cys-148). In this study, by exploiting chemical modification and the ability of HPLC in conjunction with mass spectrometry to resolve complex mixtures, the environment of Arg-144 is analyzed directly on a functional background that permits analysis of substrate effects on native irreplaceable side chains. In a functional background, in which Arg-144 and Glu-126 are likely charge-paired, the Arg-specific reagent BD reacts with Arg-144. Furthermore, preincubation with a substrate analog reduces the rate of modification by a factor of two. However, when the charge pair is disrupted (E126A), the reactivity of Arg-144 with BD increases markedly. Two findings indicate that the interaction between Glu-126 and Arg-144 is being monitored primarily; (i) E126A causes a relatively large change in Arg-144 reactivity, but mutant E269A has little or no effect, and (ii) E126A causes essentially no change in the reactivity of Glu-269. From a mechanistic perspective, one interesting feature of the x-ray structure (Fig. 1B) is the relative proximity of Arg-144 to both Glu-126 (∼5.1 Å) and Glu-269 (∼4.7 Å) in the substrate-bound form. Thus, in the absence of substrate, it is notable that the E269A mutation leads to no significant increase in the reactivity of Arg-144 with BD, showing that the interaction of Arg-144 is significantly stronger with Glu-126 rather than with Glu-269. Hence, in the absence of substrate, Arg-144 forms a salt bridge with Glu-126 and does not significantly interact with Glu-269; however, on substrate binding, the salt bridge between Glu-126 and Arg-144 breaks in a coordinated manner as part of an integrated series of events leading to binding and translocation. Although these observations are made in the mutant C154G background that favors the inward facing conformation (Fig. 8, compare step IV, with steps V and VI), it is likely that substrate recognition in the outward facing conformation involves the same conformational changes (Fig. 8, compare steps II and III). In other words, sugar binding to LacY may involve a dynamic rearrangement of the interactions involved in substrate binding coupled with a conformational transition to the inward facing conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2060914655,"Intragenic complementation is a unique property of oligomeric enzymes with which to study subunit-subunit interactions. Complementation occurs when different subunits, each possessing distinct mutations that render the individual homomutant proteins inactive, interact to form a heteromutant protein with partial recovery of activity. In this paper, complementation events between human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and its homolog, duck δ2 crystallin, were characterized. Different active site mutants in δ2 crystallin complement by the regeneration of native-like active sites as reported previously for ASL. The complementarity of the ASL and δ2 crystallin subunit interfaces was illustrated by the <i>in vivo</i> formation of active hybrid tetramers from inactive ASL and inactive δ2 crystallin mutants. Subunits of both ASL and δ2 crystallin do not dissociate and reassociate <i>in vitro</i> at room temperature, even after 6 days of incubation, indicating that the multimerization interface is very strong. However, disruption of a salt bridge network in the tetrameric interface of δ2 crystallin caused a drastic acceleration of subunit dissociation. Double mutants combining these interface mutants with active site mutants of δ2 crystallin were able to dissociate and reassociate to form active tetramers <i>in vitro</i> within hours. These results suggest that exchange of subunits may occur without unfolding of the monomer. Intragenic complementation in these interface mutants occurs by reintroducing the native salt bridge interaction upon hetero-oligomerization. Our studies demonstrate the value of intragenic complementation as a tool for investigating subunit-subunit interactions in oligomeric proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2001527158,"The promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) encodes a growth/tumor suppressor protein that is essential for the induction of apoptosis in response to various apoptotic signals. The mechanism by which PML plays a role in the regulation of cell death is still unknown. In the current study, we demonstrate that PML negatively regulated the SAPK2/p38 signaling pathway by sequestering p38 from its upstream kinases, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6, whereas PML did not affect the SAPK1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway. PML associated with p38 both in vitro and in vivo and the carboxyl terminus of PML mediated the interaction. In contrast to other studies of PML and PML-nuclear bodies (NB), our study shows that the formation of PML-NBs was not required for PML to suppress p38 activity because PML was still able to bind and inhibit p38 activity under the conditions in which PML-NBs were disrupted. In addition, we show that the promotion of Fas-induced cell death by PML correlated with the extent of p38 inhibition by PML, suggesting that PML might regulate apoptosis through manipulating SAPK2/p38 pathways. Our findings define a novel function of PML as a negative regulator of p38 kinase and provide further understanding on the mechanism of how PML induces multiple pathways of apoptosis."
