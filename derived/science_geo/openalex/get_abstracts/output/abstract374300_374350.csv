https://openalex.org/W2034525444,"To take complete advantage of information on within-species polymorphism and divergence from close relatives, one needs to know the rate and the molecular spectrum of spontaneous mutations. To this end, we have searched for de novo spontaneous mutations in the complete nuclear genomes of five Arabidopsis thaliana mutation accumulation lines that had been maintained by single-seed descent for 30 generations. We identified and validated 99 base substitutions and 17 small and large insertions and deletions. Our results imply a spontaneous mutation rate of 7 x 10(-9) base substitutions per site per generation, the majority of which are G:C-->A:T transitions. We explain this very biased spectrum of base substitution mutations as a result of two main processes: deamination of methylated cytosines and ultraviolet light-induced mutagenesis."

Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the Prdm9 gene. First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome."

Here, we report a family of solid catalysts that can stabilize water-oil emulsions and catalyze reactions at the liquid/liquid interface. By depositing palladium onto carbon nanotube-inorganic oxide hybrid nanoparticles, we demonstrate biphasic hydrodeoxygenation and condensation catalysis in three substrate classes of interest in biomass refining. Microscopic characterization of the emulsions supports localization of the hybrid particles at the interface."
https://openalex.org/W2017584544,"Activating Stubborn Dopants Many applications of semiconductor light-emitting diodes and lasers, such as reading optical disks, benefit from shorter wavelengths, but this requires materials with larger energy gaps between their valance and conduction bands. The electronic conductivity of these materials often has to be increased by doping with impurity atoms. However, in nitride materials, such as GaN and AlGaN, hole doping with acceptor atoms such as Mg is ineffective at room temperature. Simon et al. (p. 60 ) grew a gradient of AlGaN on the surface of GaN and found that the polarization of the layer could field-ionize the acceptor dopants efficiently at room temperature. The heterostructure was used successfully in a light-emitting diode that emits in the ultraviolet."
https://openalex.org/W1963756058,"Homing in on Hotspots The clustering of recombination in the genome, around locations known as hotspots, is associated with specific DNA motifs. Now, using a variety of techniques, three studies implicate a chromatin-modifying protein, the histone-methyltransferase PRDM9, as a major factor involved in human hotspots (see the Perspective by Cheung et al. ). Parvanov et al. (p. 835 , published online 31 December) mapped the locus in mice, and analyzed allelic variation in mice and humans, whereas Myers et al. (p. 876 , published online 31 December) used a comparative analysis between human and chimpanzees to show that the recombination process leads to a self-destructive drive in which the very motifs that recruit hotspots are eliminated from our genome. Baudat et al. (p. 836 , published online 31 December) took this analysis a step further to identify human allelic variants within Prdm9 that differed in the frequency at which they used hotspots. Furthermore, differential binding of this protein to different human alleles suggests that this protein interacts with specific DNA sequences. Thus, PDRM9 functions in the determination of recombination loci within the genome and may be a significant factor in the genomic differences between closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W1970283686,"Mammalian meiotic recombination, which preferentially occurs at specialized sites called hotspots, ensures the orderly segregation of meiotic chromosomes and creates genetic variation among offspring. A locus on mouse chromosome 17, which controls activation of recombination at multiple distant hotspots, has been mapped within a 181-kilobase interval, three of whose genes can be eliminated as candidates. The remaining gene, Prdm9, codes for a zinc finger containing histone H3K4 trimethylase that is expressed in early meiosis and whose deficiency results in sterility in both sexes. Mus musculus exhibits five alleles of Prdm9; human populations exhibit two predominant alleles and multiple minor alleles. The identification of Prdm9 as a protein regulating mammalian recombination hotspots initiates molecular studies of this important biological control system."
https://openalex.org/W2093697965,"Prions are infectious proteins consisting mainly of PrP(Sc), a beta sheet-rich conformer of the normal host protein PrP(C), and occur in different strains. Strain identity is thought to be encoded by PrP(Sc) conformation. We found that biologically cloned prion populations gradually became heterogeneous by accumulating ""mutants,"" and selective pressures resulted in the emergence of different mutants as major constituents of the evolving population. Thus, when transferred from brain to cultured cells, ""cell-adapted"" prions outcompeted their ""brain-adapted"" counterparts, and the opposite occurred when prions were returned from cells to brain. Similarly, the inhibitor swainsonine selected for a resistant substrain, whereas, in its absence, the susceptible substrain outgrew its resistant counterpart. Prions, albeit devoid of a nucleic acid genome, are thus subject to mutation and selective amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1981447099,"Alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) is a cell-surface glycoprotein that acts as a receptor for both extracellular matrix proteins containing laminin-G domains and certain arenaviruses. Receptor binding is thought to be mediated by a posttranslational modification, and defective binding with laminin underlies a subclass of congenital muscular dystrophy. Using mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based structural analyses, we identified a phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycan on the mucin-like domain of recombinant alpha-DG, which was required for laminin binding. We demonstrated that patients with muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, as well as mice with myodystrophy, commonly have defects in a postphosphoryl modification of this phosphorylated O-linked mannose, and that this modification is mediated by the like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) protein. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie congenital muscular dystrophy."

Liu et al. (p. 64 ) fabricated devices in which one single-walled carbon nanotube connects two fluid reservoirs. In some of these devices, apparently those in which the nanotube is metallic, the ionic conductivity is anomalously higher than that expected from the bulk resistivity of the electrolyte. This high conductivity was exploited for the transport of single-stranded DNA, which was accompanied by large but transient increases in the ion current."
https://openalex.org/W2098792130,"Background Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. Methods/Principal Findings We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniae-positive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001). Conclusions/Significance The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W1992434868,"A Hidden Template The entropic challenge inherent in forming a ring-shaped molecule generally increases considerably with the size of the ring. Assuming that a linear precursor must bind its ends together, extending its length diminishes the likelihood of the opposite ends approaching one another. In the absence of an external force, how then can a family of molybdenum oxide rings, several nanometers in diameter (quite large at the molecular scale), self-assemble? Miras et al. (p. 72 , see the cover; see the Perspective by Whitmire ) have now uncovered an internal template guiding the process. By carefully controlling conditions in a flow reactor, they were able to halt the assembly process partway through and characterize a smaller molybdenum oxide core cluster, around which the larger ring was forming. Ejection of this template then yielded the hollow finished product."
https://openalex.org/W2058411257,"Be-Deviled Cancer Recently, a deadly transmissible cancer has emerged in Tasmanian devils, the largest existing marsupial carnivore. This disease, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), leads to the growth of large facial tumors that frequently metastasize to internal organs. DFTD is thought to be transmitted by biting, and leads to death of affected animals within months, usually by obstructing the animals' ability to feed. Consequently, in the last 10 years Tasmanian devil numbers have dropped by about 60%. There are no genetic tests, vaccines, or treatments available for this disease, and without intervention, models predict that DFTD could cause extinction of Tasmanian devils in the wild within 50 years. Several lines of evidence suggest that DFTD is transmitted as a clonal allograft, whereby the cancer cells themselves are the agents of tumor transmission. Murchison et al. (p. 84 ) examined this hypothesis in detail by genotyping 25 tumor-host pairs from around Tasmania at 14 microsatellite loci and at a variable mitochondrial polymorphism. DFTD tumors were indeed found to be genetically distinct from their hosts and almost completely genetically identical to one another, supporting the idea of transmission by allograft."
https://openalex.org/W2083641150,"The Depths of the Changes Over the course of the past glacial cycle, there have been two major types of rapid, large climate warming events: shorter-lived warm intervals lasting on the order of 1000 years and the last glacial-interglacial transition. Although both involved dramatic changes in large-scale ocean circulation, the extent to which those changes were similar is unclear. Roberts et al. (p. 75 ) analyzed the neodymium isotopic composition of the Fe-Mn oxide coatings of planktonic foraminifera and reconstructed patterns of Atlantic Ocean circulation during Heinrich event 1, a rapid global climate fluctuation about 14,000 years ago involving the destruction of Northern Hemisphere ice shelves and the last deglaciation. While both the source of deep water and the whole-ocean overturning rate shifted rapidly and synchronously during the last deglacial transition, only upper ocean circulation strength was affected during Heinrich event 1."
https://openalex.org/W1993497753,"The complement anaphylatoxin C5a is a proinflammatory component of host defense that functions through two identified receptors, C5a receptor (C5aR) and C5L2. C5aR is a classical G protein-coupled receptor, whereas C5L2 is structurally homologous but deficient in G protein coupling. In human neutrophils, we show C5L2 is predominantly intracellular, whereas C5aR is expressed on the plasma membrane. Confocal analysis shows internalized C5aR following ligand binding is co-localized with both C5L2 and beta-arrestin. Antibody blockade of C5L2 results in a dramatic increase in C5a-mediated chemotaxis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation but does not alter C5a-mediated calcium mobilization, supporting its role in modulation of the beta-arrestin pathway. Association of C5L2 with beta-arrestin is confirmed by cellular co-immunoprecipitation assays. C5L2 blockade also has no effect on ligand uptake or C5aR endocytosis in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, distinguishing its role from that of a rapid recycling or scavenging receptor in this cell type. This is thus the first example of a naturally occurring seven-transmembrane segment receptor that is both obligately uncoupled from G proteins and a negative modulator of signal transduction through the beta-arrestin pathway. Physiologically, these properties provide the possibility for additional fine-tuning of host defense."

https://openalex.org/W1995965685,"Masquerade describes the resemblance of an organism to an inedible object and is hypothesized to facilitate misidentification of that organism by its predators or its prey. To date, there has been no empirical demonstration of the benefits of masquerade. Here, we show that two species of caterpillar obtain protection from an avian predator by being misidentified as twigs. By manipulating predators' previous experience of the putative model but keeping their exposure to the masquerader the same, we determined that predators misidentify masquerading prey as their models, rather than simply failing to detect them."
https://openalex.org/W2028487454,"How to Get a Date Radiometric dating relies on measuring the abundance of a radioactive isotope and/or its decay products. By knowing a decay rate and an isotopic starting abundance—both assumed to be constant—an age is determined. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, Brennecka et al. (p. 449 , published online 31 December; see the Perspective by Connelly ) show that the known starting abundance of 238 U and 235 U isotopes in meteorites, which decay into 206 Pb and 207 Pb, respectively, is actually quite variable. Trace amounts of 247 Cm in the early solar system may have unexpectedly contributed additional 235 U, skewing the ratio. Pb-Pb dating, the method commonly used to date early solar system materials, may thus need a correction of up to 5 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2134276650,"Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into endothelial cells (hESC-ECs) has the potential to provide an unlimited source of cells for novel transplantation therapies of ischemic diseases by supporting angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. However, the endothelial differentiation efficiency of the conventional embryoid body (EB) method is low while the 2-dimensional method of co-culturing with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) require animal product, both of which can limit the future clinical application of hESC-ECs. Moreover, to fully understand the beneficial effects of stem cell therapy, investigators must be able to track the functional biology and physiology of transplanted cells in living subjects over time.In this study, we developed an extracellular matrix (ECM) culture system for increasing endothelial differentiation and free from contaminating animal cells. We investigated the transcriptional changes that occur during endothelial differentiation of hESCs using whole genome microarray, and compared to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We also showed functional vascular formation by hESC-ECs in a mouse dorsal window model. Moreover, our study is the first so far to transplant hESC-ECs in a myocardial infarction model and monitor cell fate using molecular imaging methods.Taken together, we report a more efficient method for derivation of hESC-ECs that express appropriate patterns of endothelial genes, form functional vessels in vivo, and improve cardiac function. These studies suggest that hESC-ECs may provide a novel therapy for ischemic heart disease in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2132626699,"Background Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the standard of care for HIV-1 infection, is considered to be successful when plasma viremia remains below the detection limit of commercial assays. Yet, cART fails in a substantial proportion of patients after the apparent success. No laboratory markers are known that are predictive of cART outcome in initial responders during the period of undetectable plasma viremia. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report the results of a retrospective longitudinal study of twenty-six HIV-infected individuals who initially responded to cART by having plasma viremia suppressed to <50 copies/ml. Eleven of these patients remained virologically suppressed, whereas fifteen experienced subsequent cART failure. Using sensitive methods based on seminested real-time PCR, we measured the levels of HIV-1 proviral (pr) DNA, unspliced (us) RNA, and multiply spliced RNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of these patients at multiple time points during the period of undetectable plasma viremia on cART. Median under-therapy level of usRNA was significantly higher (0.43 log10 difference, P = 0.0015) in patients who experienced subsequent cART failure than in successfully treated patients. In multivariate analysis, adjusted for baseline CD4+ counts, prior ART experience, and particular cART regimens, the maximal usRNA level under therapy was the best independent predictor of subsequent therapy failure (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 24.4 [1.5–389.5], P = 0.024). The only other factor significantly associated with cART failure was prior ART experience (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 12.3 [1.1–138.4], P = 0.042). Levels of usRNA under cART inversely correlated with baseline CD4+ counts (P = 0.0003), but did not correlate with either baseline usRNA levels or levels of prDNA under therapy. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that the level of HIV-1 usRNA in PBMC, measured in cART-treated patients with undetectable plasma viremia, is a strong predictive marker for the outcome of therapy."

Here we report the three-dimensional structure of full-length rat TRPV4 purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Hexahistidine-tagged rat TRPV4 (His-rTRPV4) was solubilized with detergent and purified through affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Chemical cross-linking analysis revealed that detergent-solubilized His-rTRPV4 was a tetramer. The 3.5-nm structure of rat TRPV4 was determined by cryoelectron microscopy using single-particle reconstruction from Zernike phase-contrast images. The overall structure comprises two distinct regions; a larger dense component, likely corresponding to the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions, and a smaller component corresponding to the transmembrane region."

UL146 and UL147 in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) genome encode the two CXC chemokines vCXCL1 and vCXCL2. In this study, vCXCL1 was probed against a panel of the 18 classified human chemokine receptors. In calcium mobilization assays vCXCL1 acted as an agonist on both CXCR1 and CXCR2 but did not activate or block any of the other 16 chemokine receptors. vCXCL1 was characterized and compared with CXCL1/GROα, CXCL2/GROβ, CXCL3/GROγ, CXCL5/ENA-78, CXCL6/GCP-2, CXCL7/NAP-2 and CXCL8/IL-8 in competition binding, calcium mobilization, inositol triphosphate turnover, and chemotaxis assays using CXCR1- and CXCR2-expressing Chinese hamster ovary, 300.19, COS7, and L1.2 cells. The affinities of vCXCL1 for the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors were 44 and 5.6 nm, respectively, as determined in competition binding against radioactively labeled CXCL8. In calcium mobilization, phosphatidylinositol turnover, and chemotaxis assays, vCXCL1 acted as a highly efficacious activator of both receptors, with a rather low potency for the CXCR1 receptor but comparable with CXCL5 and CXCL7. It is suggested that CMV uses the UL146 gene product expressed in infected endothelial cells to attract neutrophils by activating their CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors, whereby neutrophils can act as carriers of the virus to uninfected endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2124237895,"Decision making often entails longshot risks involving a small chance of receiving a substantial outcome. People tend to be risk preferring (averse) when facing longshot risks involving significant gains (losses). This differentiation towards longshot risks underpins the markets for lottery as well as for insurance. Both lottery and insurance have emerged since ancient times and continue to play a useful role in the modern economy. In this study, we observe subjects' incentivized choices in a controlled laboratory setting, and investigate their association with a widely studied, promoter-region repeat functional polymorphism in monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA). We find that subjects with the high activity (4-repeat) allele are characterized by a preference for the longshot lottery and also less insurance purchasing than subjects with the low activity (3-repeat) allele. This is the first result to link attitude towards longshot risks to a specific gene. It complements recent findings on the neurobiological basis of economic risk taking."
https://openalex.org/W2089159125,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is thought to arise in part from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE); however, the molecular events underlying this transformation are poorly understood. Germline mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene result in a significantly increased risk of developing EOC and a large proportion of sporadic EOCs display some sort of BRCA1 dysfunction. To generate a model in which Brca1-mediated transformation can be studied, we previously inactivated Brca1 alone in murine OSE, which resulted in an increased accumulation of premalignant changes, but no tumor formation. In this study, we examined tumor formation in mice with conditionally expressed alleles of Brca1, p53 and Rb, alone or in combination. Intrabursal injection of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase to inactivate p53 resulted in tumors in 100% of mice. Tumor progression was accelerated in mice with concomitant inactivation of Brca1 and p53, but not Rb and p53. Immunohistologic analyses classified the tumors as leiomyosarcomas that may be arising from the ovarian bursa. Brca1 inactivation in primary cultures of murine OSE cells led to a suppression of proliferation that could be rescued by concomitant inactivation of p53 and/or Rb. Brca1-deficient OSE cells displayed an increased sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent cisplatin, and this effect could be modulated by inactivation of p53 and/or Rb. These results indicate that Brca1 deficiency can accelerate tumor development and alter the sensitivity of OSE cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Intrabursal delivery of adenovirus intended to alter gene expression in the ovarian surface epithelium may, in some strains of mice, result in more rapid transformation of adjacent cells, resulting in leiomyosarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2156571897,"In vivo and in vitro studies give a paradoxical picture of the actions of the key regulatory factor TGF-beta1 in epidermal wound healing with it stimulating migration of keratinocytes but also inhibiting their proliferation. To try to reconcile these into an easily visualized 3D model of wound healing amenable for experimentation by cell biologists, a multiscale model of the formation of a 3D skin epithelium was established with TGF-beta1 literature-derived rule sets and equations embedded within it. At the cellular level, an agent-based bottom-up model that focuses on individual interacting units (keratinocytes) was used. This was based on literature-derived rules governing keratinocyte behavior and keratinocyte/ECM interactions. The selection of these rule sets is described in detail in this paper. The agent-based model was then linked with a subcellular model of TGF-beta1 production and its action on keratinocytes simulated with a complex pathway simulator. This multiscale model can be run at a cellular level only or at a combined cellular/subcellular level. It was then initially challenged (by wounding) to investigate the behavior of keratinocytes in wound healing at the cellular level. To investigate the possible actions of TGF-beta1, several hypotheses were then explored by deliberately manipulating some of these rule sets at subcellular levels. This exercise readily eliminated some hypotheses and identified a sequence of spatial-temporal actions of TGF-beta1 for normal successful wound healing in an easy-to-follow 3D model. We suggest this multiscale model offers a valuable, easy-to-visualize aid to our understanding of the actions of this key regulator in wound healing, and provides a model that can now be used to explore pathologies of wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2017664010,"EpCAM (CD326) is encoded by the tacstd1 gene and expressed by a variety of normal and malignant epithelial cells and some leukocytes. Results of previous in vitro experiments suggested that EpCAM is an intercellular adhesion molecule. EpCAM has been extensively studied as a potential tumor marker and immunotherapy target, and more recent studies suggest that EpCAM expression may be characteristic of cancer stem cells.To gain insights into EpCAM function in vivo, we generated EpCAM -/- mice utilizing an embryonic stem cell line with a tacstd1 allele that had been disrupted. Gene trapping resulted in a protein comprised of the N-terminus of EpCAM encoded by 2 exons of the tacstd1 gene fused in frame to betageo. EpCAM +/- mice were viable and fertile and exhibited no obvious abnormalities. Examination of EpCAM +/- embryos revealed that betageo was expressed in several epithelial structures including developing ears (otocysts), eyes, branchial arches, gut, apical ectodermal ridges, lungs, pancreas, hair follicles and others. All EpCAM -/- mice died in utero by E12.5, and were small, developmentally delayed, and displayed prominent placental abnormalities. In developing placentas, EpCAM was expressed throughout the labyrinthine layer and by spongiotrophoblasts as well. Placentas of EpCAM -/- embryos were compact, with thin labyrinthine layers lacking prominent vascularity. Parietal trophoblast giant cells were also dramatically reduced in EpCAM -/- placentas.EpCAM was required for differentiation or survival of parietal trophoblast giant cells, normal development of the placental labyrinth and establishment of a competent maternal-fetal circulation. The findings in EpCAM-reporter mice suggest involvement of this molecule in development of vital organs including the gut, kidneys, pancreas, lungs, eyes, and limbs."
https://openalex.org/W2034201397,"Nickel (Ni) compounds have been found to cause cancer in humans and animal models and to transform cells in culture. At least part of this effect is mediated by stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1a) and activating its downstream signaling. Recent studies reported that hypoxia signaling might either antagonize or enhance c-myc activity depending on cell context. We investigated the effect of nickel on c-myc levels, and demonstrated that nickel, hypoxia, and other hypoxia mimetics degraded c-myc protein in a number of cancer cells (A549, MCF-7, MDA-453, and BT-474). The degradation of the c-Myc protein was mediated by the 26S proteosome. Interestingly, knockdown of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α attenuated c-Myc degradation induced by Nickel and hypoxia, suggesting the functional HIF-1α and HIF-2α was required for c-myc degradation. Further studies revealed two potential pathways mediated nickel and hypoxia induced c-myc degradation. Phosphorylation of c-myc at T58 was significantly increased in cells exposed to nickel or hypoxia, leading to increased ubiquitination through Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase. In addition, nickel and hypoxia exposure decreased USP28, a c-myc de-ubiquitinating enzyme, contributing to a higher steady state level of c-myc ubiquitination and promoting c-myc degradation. Furthermore, the reduction of USP28 protein by hypoxia signaling is due to both protein degradation and transcriptional repression. Nickel and hypoxia exposure significantly increased the levels of dimethylated H3 lysine 9 at the USP28 promoter and repressed its expression. Our study demonstrated that Nickel and hypoxia exposure increased c-myc T58 phosphorylation and decreased USP28 protein levels in cancer cells, which both lead to enhanced c-myc ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2067185327,"Calreticulin (CRT), a chaperone and Ca2+ regulator, enhances wound healing, and its expression correlates with fibrosis in animal models, suggesting that CRT regulates production of the extracellular matrix. However, direct regulation of collagen matrix by CRT has not been previously demonstrated. We investigated the role of CRT in the regulation of fibrillar collagen expression, secretion, processing, and deposition in the extracellular matrix by fibroblasts. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in CRT (CRT−/− MEFs) have reduced transcript levels of fibrillar collagen I and III and less soluble collagen as compared with wild type MEFs. Correspondingly, fibroblasts engineered to overexpress CRT have increased collagen type I transcript and protein. Collagen expression appears to be regulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium levels and intracellular CRT, because thapsigargin treatment reduced collagen expression, whereas addition of exogenous recombinant CRT had no effect. CRT−/− MEFs exhibited increased ER retention of collagen, and collagen and CRT were co-immunoprecipitated from isolated cell lysates, suggesting that CRT is important for trafficking of collagen through the ER. CRT−/− MEFs also have reduced type I procollagen processing and deposition into the extracellular matrix. The reduced collagen matrix deposition is partly a consequence of reduced fibronectin matrix formation in the CRT-deficient cells. Together, these data show that CRT complexes with collagen in cells and that CRT plays critical roles at multiple stages of collagen expression and processing. These data identify CRT as an important regulator of collagen and suggest that intracellular CRT signaling plays an important role in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Calreticulin (CRT), a chaperone and Ca2+ regulator, enhances wound healing, and its expression correlates with fibrosis in animal models, suggesting that CRT regulates production of the extracellular matrix. However, direct regulation of collagen matrix by CRT has not been previously demonstrated. We investigated the role of CRT in the regulation of fibrillar collagen expression, secretion, processing, and deposition in the extracellular matrix by fibroblasts. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in CRT (CRT−/− MEFs) have reduced transcript levels of fibrillar collagen I and III and less soluble collagen as compared with wild type MEFs. Correspondingly, fibroblasts engineered to overexpress CRT have increased collagen type I transcript and protein. Collagen expression appears to be regulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium levels and intracellular CRT, because thapsigargin treatment reduced collagen expression, whereas addition of exogenous recombinant CRT had no effect. CRT−/− MEFs exhibited increased ER retention of collagen, and collagen and CRT were co-immunoprecipitated from isolated cell lysates, suggesting that CRT is important for trafficking of collagen through the ER. CRT−/− MEFs also have reduced type I procollagen processing and deposition into the extracellular matrix. The reduced collagen matrix deposition is partly a consequence of reduced fibronectin matrix formation in the CRT-deficient cells. Together, these data show that CRT complexes with collagen in cells and that CRT plays critical roles at multiple stages of collagen expression and processing. These data identify CRT as an important regulator of collagen and suggest that intracellular CRT signaling plays an important role in tissue remodeling and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2116335283,"The cause of autoimmunity, which is unknown, is investigated from a different angle, i.e., the defect in immune 'system', to explain the cause of autoimmunity.Repeated immunization with antigen causes systemic autoimmunity in mice otherwise not prone to spontaneous autoimmune diseases. Overstimulation of CD4(+) T cells led to the development of autoantibody-inducing CD4(+) T (aiCD4(+) T) cell which had undergone T cell receptor (TCR) revision and was capable of inducing autoantibodies. The aiCD4(+) T cell was induced by de novo TCR revision but not by cross-reaction, and subsequently overstimulated CD8(+) T cells, driving them to become antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These CTLs could be further matured by antigen cross-presentation, after which they caused autoimmune tissue injury akin to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Systemic autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of over-stimulating the host's immune 'system' by repeated immunization with antigen, to the levels that surpass system's self-organized criticality."
https://openalex.org/W2090390893,"Approximately one out of every ten cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is inherited. The majority of inherited cases of EOC result from mutations in the breast cancer associated gene 1 (BRCA1). In addition to mutation of BRCA1, mutation of the p53 gene is often found in patients with inherited breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.We investigated the role of loss of function of BRCA1 and p53 in ovarian cancer development using mouse models with conditionally expressed alleles of Brca1 and/or p53. Our results show that ovary-specific Cre-recombinase-mediated conditional inactivation of both Brca1(LoxP/LoxP) and p53(LoxP/LoxP) resulted in ovarian or reproductive tract tumor formation in 54% of mice, whereas conditional inactivation of either allele alone infrequently resulted in tumors (< or =5% of mice). In mice with conditionally inactivated Brca1(LoxP/LoxP) and p53(LoxP/LoxP), ovarian tumors arose after long latency with the majority exhibiting histological features consistent with high grade leiomyosarcomas lacking expression of epithelial, follicular or lymphocyte markers. In addition, tumors with conditional inactivation of both Brca1(LoxP/LoxP) and p53(LoxP/LoxP) exhibited greater genomic instability compared to an ovarian tumor with inactivation of only p53(LoxP/LoxP).Although conditional inactivation of both Brca1 and p53 results in ovarian tumorigenesis, our results suggest that additional genetic alterations or alternative methods for targeting epithelial cells of the ovary or fallopian tube for conditional inactivation of Brca1 and p53 are required for the development of a mouse model of Brca1-associated inherited EOC."
https://openalex.org/W2147648541,"Avicins, a family of triterpene electrophiles originally identified as potent inhibitors of tumor cell growth, have been shown to be pleiotropic compounds that also possess antioxidant, anti-mutagenic, and anti-inflammatory activities. We previously showed that Jurkat cells, which express a high level of Fas, are very sensitive to treatment with avicins. Thus, we hypothesized that avicins may induce cell apoptosis by activation of the Fas pathway. By using a series of cell lines deficient in cell death receptors, we demonstrated that upon avicin D treatment, Fas translocates to the cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts. In the lipid rafts, Fas interacts with Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and Caspase-8 to form death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and thus mediates cell apoptosis. Interfering with lipid raft organization by using a cholesterol-depleting compound, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, not only prevents the clustering of Fas and its DISC complex but also reduces the sensitivity of the cells to avicin D. Avicin D activates Fas pathways independent of the association between extracellular Fas ligands and Fas receptors. A deficiency in Fas and its downstream signaling molecules leads to the resistance of the cells to avicin D treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that avicin D triggers the redistribution of Fas in the membrane lipid rafts, where Fas activates receptor-mediated cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1999770652,"Pulsars are known to power winds of relativistic particles that can produce bright nebulae by interacting with the surrounding medium. These pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are observed in the radio, optical, x-rays and, in some cases, also at TeV energies, but the lack of information in the gamma-ray band prevents from drawing a comprehensive multiwavelength picture of their phenomenology and emission mechanisms. Using data from the AGILE satellite, we detected the Vela pulsar wind nebula in the energy range from 100 MeV to 3 GeV. This result constrains the particle population responsible for the GeV emission, probing multivavelength PWN models, and establishes a class of gamma-ray emitters that could account for a fraction of the unidentified Galactic gamma-ray sources."
https://openalex.org/W2046075803,"Background In the post genome era, a major goal of biology is the identification of specific roles for individual genes. We report a new genomic tool for gene characterization, the UCLA Gene Expression Tool (UGET). Results Celsius, the largest co-normalized microarray dataset of Affymetrix based gene expression, was used to calculate the correlation between all possible gene pairs on all platforms, and generate stored indexes in a web searchable format. The size of Celsius makes UGET a powerful gene characterization tool. Using a small seed list of known cartilage-selective genes, UGET extended the list of known genes by identifying 32 new highly cartilage-selective genes. Of these, 7 of 10 tested were validated by qPCR including the novel cartilage-specific genes SDK2 and FLJ41170. In addition, we retrospectively tested UGET and other gene expression based prioritization tools to identify disease-causing genes within known linkage intervals. We first demonstrated this utility with UGET using genetically heterogeneous disorders such as Joubert syndrome, microcephaly, neuropsychiatric disorders and type 2 limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2) and then compared UGET to other gene expression based prioritization programs which use small but discrete and well annotated datasets. Finally, we observed a significantly higher gene correlation shared between genes in disease networks associated with similar complex or Mendelian disorders. Discussion UGET is an invaluable resource for a geneticist that permits the rapid inclusion of expression criteria from one to hundreds of genes in genomic intervals linked to disease. By using thousands of arrays UGET annotates and prioritizes genes better than other tools especially with rare tissue disorders or complex multi-tissue biological processes. This information can be critical in prioritization of candidate genes for sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1992702243,"Extensive angiogenesis, formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, is an important feature of malignant glioma. Several antiangiogenic drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or its receptors are currently in clinical trials as therapy for high-grade glioma and bevacizumab was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. However, the modest efficacy of these drugs and emerging problems with anti-VEGF treatment resistance welcome the development of alternative antiangiogenic therapies. One potential candidate is histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), a plasma protein with antiangiogenic properties that can inhibit endothelial cell adhesion and migration. We have used the RCAS/TV-A mouse model for gliomas to investigate the effect of HRG on brain tumor development. Tumors were induced with platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), in the presence or absence of HRG. We found that HRG had little effect on tumor incidence but could significantly inhibit the development of malignant glioma and completely prevent the occurrence of grade IV tumors (glioblastoma)."
https://openalex.org/W1999623959,"Recent advances in molecular evolution technology enabled us to identify peptides and antibodies with affinity for inorganic materials. In the field of nanotechnology, the use of the functional peptides and antibodies should aid the construction of interface molecules designed to spontaneously link different nanomaterials; however, few material-binding antibodies, which have much higher affinity than short peptides, have been identified. Here, we generated high affinity antibodies from material-binding peptides by integrating peptide-grafting and phage-display techniques. A material-binding peptide sequence was first grafted into an appropriate loop of the complementarity determining region (CDR) of a camel-type single variable antibody fragment to create a low affinity material-binding antibody. Application of a combinatorial library approach to another CDR loop in the low affinity antibody then clearly and steadily promoted affinity for a specific material surface. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that the enthalpy synergistic effect from grafted and selected CDR loops drastically increased the affinity for material surface, indicating the potential of antibody scaffold for creating high affinity small interface units. We show the availability of the construction of antibodies by integrating graft and evolution technology for various inorganic materials and the potential of high affinity material-binding antibodies in biointerface applications."
https://openalex.org/W2031684991,"Mouse models of human disease are invaluable for determining the differentiation ability and functional capacity of stem cells. The best example is bone marrow transplants for studies of hematopoietic stem cells. For organ studies, the interpretation of the data can be difficult as transdifferentiation, cell fusion or surface antigen transfer (trogocytosis) can be misinterpreted as differentiation. These events have not been investigated in hematopoietic stem cell transplant models.In this study we investigated fusion and trogocytosis involving blood cells during bone marrow transplantation using a xenograft model. We report that using a standard SCID repopulating assay almost 100% of the human donor cells appear as hybrid blood cells containing both mouse and human surface antigens.Hybrid cells are not the result of cell-cell fusion events but appear to be due to efficient surface antigen transfer, a process referred to as trogocytosis. Antigen transfer appears to be non-random and includes all donor cells regardless of sub-type. We also demonstrate that irradiation preconditioning enhances the frequency of hybrid cells and that trogocytosis is evident in non-blood cells in chimera mice."
https://openalex.org/W2053615296,"Background Heidenreich et al. (Risk Anal 1997 17 391–399) considered parameter identifiability in the context of the two-mutation cancer model and demonstrated that combinations of all but two of the model parameters are identifiable. We consider the problem of identifiability in the recently developed carcinogenesis models of Little and Wright (Math Biosci 2003 183 111–134) and Little et al. (J Theoret Biol 2008 254 229–238). These models, which incorporate genomic instability, generalize a large number of other quasi-biological cancer models, in particular those of Armitage and Doll (Br J Cancer 1954 8 1–12), the two-mutation model (Moolgavkar et al. Math Biosci 1979 47 55–77), the generalized multistage model of Little (Biometrics 1995 51 1278–1291), and a recently developed cancer model of Nowak et al. (PNAS 2002 99 16226–16231). Methodology/Principal Findings We show that in the simpler model proposed by Little and Wright (Math Biosci 2003 183 111–134) the number of identifiable combinations of parameters is at most two less than the number of biological parameters, thereby generalizing previous results of Heidenreich et al. (Risk Anal 1997 17 391–399) for the two-mutation model. For the more general model of Little et al. (J Theoret Biol 2008 254 229–238) the number of identifiable combinations of parameters is at most less than the number of biological parameters, where is the number of destabilization types, thereby also generalizing all these results. Numerical evaluations suggest that these bounds are sharp. We also identify particular combinations of identifiable parameters. Conclusions/Significance We have shown that the previous results on parameter identifiability can be generalized to much larger classes of quasi-biological carcinogenesis model, and also identify particular combinations of identifiable parameters. These results are of theoretical interest, but also of practical significance to anyone attempting to estimate parameters for this large class of cancer models."

Exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to IGF-1 rapidly and transiently induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). This was paralleled by Akt/protein kinase B and protein kinase C-ζ phosphorylation, at Thr308 and Thr410, respectively. IGF-1 treatment also enhanced PDK1 interaction with IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in intact MCF-7 cells. Pulldown assays revealed that PDK1 bound IGF-1R in vitro and that the region encompassing amino acids 51–359 of PDK1 was necessary for the interaction. Synthetic peptides corresponding to IGF-1R C terminus amino acids 1295–1337 (C43) and to PDK1 amino acids 114–141 reduced in vitro IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. Loading of fluoresceinated-C43 (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-C43) into MCF-7 cells significantly reduced IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction and phosphorylation of PDK1 substrates. Moreover, FITC-C43 intracellular loading reverted the protective effect of IGF-1 on growth factor deprivation-induced cell death. Finally, the inhibition of IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction and signaling by FITC-C43 was accompanied by 2-fold enhanced killing capacity of cetuximab in human GEO colon adenocarcinoma cells and was sufficient to restore cell death in cetuximab-resistant cell clones. Thus, disruption of PDK1 interaction with IGF-1R reduces IGF-1 survival effects in cancer cells and may enhance cell death by anticancer agents.

Yakar S. LeRoith D. Brodt P. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 20-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) has been identified as a regulator of cellular transformation and controls the acquisition of the tumorigenic phenotype by regulating multiple cellular functions that impact on the invasive/metastatic potential of cancer cells. These include cell survival, motility, invasion, growth potential in secondary organ sites, and the induction of angiogenesis (2.Samani A.A. Brodt P. Surg. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 10: 289-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also several lines of evidence that dysregulation of the IGF-1 system is involved in resistance to certain anticancer therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal agents, biological therapies, and radiation (3.Ryan P.D. Goss P.E. Oncologist. 2008; 13: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The link between cancer and IGF signaling is also consistent with recent epidemiological studies showing an increased relative risk for the development of colon, prostate, breast, lung, and bladder cancers in individuals with circulating IGF-1 levels in the upper tertile of the normal range (4.LeRoith D. Helman L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 201-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings were confirmed in animal models, where reduced circulating IGF-1 levels result in significant reductions in cancer development, growth, and metastases, whereas increased circulating IGF-1 levels are associated with enhanced tumor growth (5.Wu Y.

Pathol. 2003; 34: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). IGF-1R is normally activated by binding of the secreted growth factor ligand to the extracellular domain. This, in turn, triggers a number of cellular signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, the main mechanism by which IGF-1R protects cells from apoptosis (8.Pollak M.

Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 6364-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) plays a crucial role in mediating signal transduction downstream of PI3K (10.Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). PDK1 is a 64-kDa protein, of 556 amino acids, comprised of a serine/threonine kinase domain near the N terminus, a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and an ATP-binding site located between the two domains (11.Biondi R.M.

On the small lobe of the protein, a hydrophobic pocket, close to but distinct from the catalytic site, has been identified and characterized (12.Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Binding on this pocket of phosphorylated C-terminal motifs from other kinases allows allosteric regulation of PDK1 activity (13.Hindie V. Stroba A. Zhang H. Lopez-Garcia L.A. Idrissova L. Zeuzem S.

PDK1 phosphorylates several protein kinases, including Akt/PKB and PKCs, at the activation loop phosphorylation sites (11.Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M.

Phosphorylation of Ser241 at its own activation loop may be mediated by an intermolecular mechanism suggesting that dimerization and trans-phosphorylation may regulate PDK1 activity in cells (10.Mora A.

There is also evidence that PDK1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to several growth factors. Studies with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate and insulin indicate that full activation of PDK1 requires phosphorylation at Tyr373/376 (17.Grillo S. Grémeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R.

Consistent with its role in transformation, PDK1 is highly expressed in a large number of invasive human breast cancer cell lines and in ovarian cancers (20.Xie Z. Zeng X. Waldman T. Glazer R.I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5370-5375PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ahmed N. Riley C. Quinn M.A. Br. J. Cancer. 2008; 98: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Collectively, a large body of evidence identifies the IGF-1R/PDK1 system as a target for molecular therapy with potential benefits for a wide spectrum of human malignancies (3.Ryan P.D. Goss P.E. Oncologist. 2008; 13: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4.LeRoith D. Helman L.

Various strategies have been used to target components of this system in established cancer cell lines and animal models, and some of these strategies may be advancing to clinical use. Among them, down-regulation of IGF-1R by antisense oligonucleotides, antisense RNA, small interfering RNA, single chain antibody, full humanized anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies, and specific kinase inhibitors have been attempted (8.Pollak M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8 (Correction (2009) Nat. Rev. Cancer. 9, 224): 915-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 23.Riedemann J. Macaulay V.M. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: S33-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Some of these molecular strategies to target the IGF-1 system, however, have failed for the magnitude of toxicity, due, at least in part, to the cross-reactivity with the insulin system. Here, we show that IGF-1R directly interacts with and activates PDK1. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the IGF-1R C terminus and to the PDK1 hydrophobic pocket selectively displace the interaction in vitro. Peptide loading into human cancer cell lines inhibits IGF-1 signaling via PDK1 and prevents IGF-1 prosurvival effects, thereby facilitating cell killing by anticancer agents.

Cells were solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 140 mm NaCl) containing 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the indicated antibodies. Detection of blotted proteins was performed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (28.Formisano P. Oriente F.

Densitometric analysis was performed using a Scion image analyzer. All the data were expressed as mean ± S.D. IGF-1Rs were partially purified by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. Confluent monolayers of NIH-3T3IGF-1R cells (corresponding to 6–8 × 107 cells) were solubilized in lysis buffer. The insoluble material was separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with HNT buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton) and the protease inhibitors described above. The column was extensively washed using the same buffer, and bound glycoproteins were eluted in the same buffer containing 0.3 mN-acetylglucosamine (29.Formisano P. Sohn K.J. Miele C. Di Finizio B.

PDK1-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated as described (24.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified IGF-1R (50 μg of protein extract) was incubated in the presence of Sepharose-bound GST-PDK1 (2 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with HNT buffer and then resuspended in loading buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 3 min. Supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Purified IGF-1R (50 μg of protein extract) was incubated in the presence of IGF-1 (100 ng/ml). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 2 mm CTP, 2 μm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.02% Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, 7 mm MgCl2 (final concentrations) and prolonged for 30 min at 22 °C. Recombinant PDK1 was added for 15 min. The reaction was stopped on ice, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies. Solid-phase peptide syntheses were carried out on a fully automated peptide synthesizer 433A (Applied Biosystems). Preparative reverse-phase-HPLC purifications were carried out on a Shimadzu LC-8A instrument equipped with a SPD-M10 AV detector and using a Phenomenex Luna-COMBI C18 column (50 × 22-mm inner diameter; 10 μm). LC-MS analyses were carried out on an LCQ DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Milan, Italy) LC-MS columns were from ThermoElectron. Peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis following standard Fmoc/t-butyl protocols (30.Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). To monitor cell delivery, N-terminal fluorescein labeling was achieved by on-resin treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Peptide purity and identity were confirmed by LC-MS. All the peptides (including FITC-conjugated peptides) were delivered onto semiconfluent MCF-7 cells by using the ProVectin protein delivery reagents method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the dry film of ProVectin reagent found in a glass vial was dissolved with 250 μl of methanol and vortexed for 10-20 s. The manufacturer recommended 20 μl of ProVectin reagent for each 60-mm-diameter dish. The total amount of ProVectin needed was pipetted into an Eppendorf tube and left under a laminar flow hood to evaporate the solvent for at least 2 h at room temperature and then hydrated with PBS. Peptides, diluted in PBS, were added to the ProVectin reagent at different concentrations and let stand at room temperature for 5 min. The ProVectin/peptide complexes were added directly onto the cells cultured in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. Loading efficiency was about 65% for all peptides. For detecting apoptosis, the cells were kept in the presence or in the absence of serum or incubated with 10 mm synthetic peptides, as indicated in the description of the individual experiments. Apoptosis was then assayed using the apoptosis ELISAPlus kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions or by cytometric analysis. For cytometry, cells were harvested and suspended in 0.3 ml of PBS. After adding 0.7 ml of cold absolute ethanol, cells were fixed and stored for at least 2 h at −20 °C. For analysis, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, and incubated in dark for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were kept on ice, and the analysis was performed using FACS CyAn cytometer (Dako Cytomation). A minimum of 30,000 events was collected for each sample. Sub-G1 phase cells were identified using the Summit version 4.3 software (Dako). Cells, loaded with FITC-peptides, were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole diluted 1: 1000 in TBS. All slides were then washed three times with TBS 0.1% Tween and kept in dark until examined under a fluorescence microscope. The measurement of 2-deoxy-d-[14C]glucose uptake was taken as a readout of glucose uptake by muscle cells, as described previously (31.Klip A. Logan W.J. Li G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 687: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 18 h in the presence or absence of C43 or scrambled peptide (SP) 10 μm. Cells were incubated in glucose-free 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 (HEPES buffer) and exposed or not to 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells with 0.15 mm 2-deoxy-d-[14C]glucose (0.5 μCi/assay) for 15 min in HEPES buffer. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μm cytochalasin B, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold isotonic saline solution prior to lysis in 1 m NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Data were analyzed with Statview software (Abacusconcepts) by one-factor analysis of variance. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 in response to IGF-1 in human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were incubated with serum-free medium and treated with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) for 5 and 30 min. Western blot analysis with antibodies specifically recognizing pTyr373/376-PDK1 revealed that IGF-1 rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous PDK1 as compared with the control cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation returned close to the basal levels after 30 min, with no change in the total PDK1 levels (Fig. 1A). To gain further insights into the molecular mechanism of PDK1 phosphorylation, we tested the ability of IGF-1R to interact with PDK1. To this aim, MCF-7 cells were stimulated with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml), and cell lysates were precipitated with IGF-1R antibodies followed by blotting with PDK1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, an interaction between IGF-1R and PDK1 occurred after 5 min of IGF-1 exposure and was poorly detectable after 30 min, as in the case of tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies also revealed that IGF-1R-associated PDK1 was phosphorylated at Ser241 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, stimulation of MCF-7 cells with IGF-1 increased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and PKCζ at the PDK1 consensus sites, indicating the induction of PDK1 activity. Phosphorylation of both Akt/PKB and PKCζ remained well detectable up to 30 min, suggesting the existence of either a prolonged activation of PDK1 or a delayed activation of specific phosphatases in response to IGF-1. Control detection with Akt/PKB and PKCζ antibodies revealed no difference in the total levels (Fig. 1C). To determine the PDK1 portion involved in the interaction with IGF-1R, recombinant GST fused with full-length PDK1 protein (residues 1–556), two PDK1 mutants lacking the PH domain (corresponding to residues 1–359 and 51–359, respectively), and the PH domain alone (residues 408–556) were used in pulldown experiments with purified IGF-1R. IGF-1R was detectable in GST pulldown experiments with the full-length PDK1. The interaction was also well detectable for PDK1-(51–359) and PDK1-(1–359), whereas it was almost completely absent with PDK1-(408–556) (Fig. 2A). It has been previously reported (19.Fiory F. Alberobello A.T. Miele C. Oriente F. Esposito I. Corbo V. Ruvo M. Tizzano B. Rasmussen T.E. Gammeltoft S. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10803-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that the region corresponding to the insulin receptor (IR) C terminus is critical for the interaction with PDK1. With this background, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal residues 1295–1337 of IGF-1R (C43), 1316–1337 (C22), and similar peptides featuring tyrosine replacement with phenylalanine (C43F and C22F) were synthesized (Fig. 2B). In pulldown assays (Fig. 2C), C43 peptide displayed the highest ability to reduce IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction (ED50 = 80 nm). At variance, C43F (ED50 = 1 μm), C22 (ED50 >1 μm), and C22F (ED50 >1 μm) were significantly less effective (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the IR C terminus (C-IR) and an SP did not significantly impair IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction (Fig. 2C). Similarly, co-incubation with C43 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 by activated IGF-1R in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). PDK1 shares with other kinases from the AGC (c-AMP-dependent, c-GMP-dependent, protein kinase C) family, a mechanism of regulation mediated by interaction with C-terminal hydrophobic motifs of substrate kinases. Binding on PDK1 of these motifs occurs on its hydrophobic pocket comprising α-helix 1B, α-helix 2C, and the β-strand 5, close to the catalytic site (13.Hindie V. Stroba A. Zhang H. Lopez-Garcia L.A. Idrissova L. Zeuzem S. Hirschberg D. Schaeffer F. J⊘rgensen T.J. Engel M. Alzari P.M. Biondi R.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have therefore hypothesized that a similar mechanism of recognition takes place between the IGF-1R C-terminal tail and PDK1. Based on PDK1 crystallographic structure (PDB code 3hrf), peptides corresponding to α-helix 1B (pep1, residues 114–123), to α-helix 2C (pep2, residues 123–141), and to β-strand 5 (pep3, residues 153–161) were produced and used in competition assays between PDK1 and IGF-1R (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, pep1 efficiently reduced GST-PDK1 interaction with IGF-1R (ED50 = 100 nm), suggesting that it could directly bind IGF-1R C terminus. Much lower efficiency was displayed by pep2 (ED50 = 1 μm) and pep3 (ED50 >1 μm). Also, an additional unrelated peptide containing four copies of the tetrapeptide Arg-Thr-Tyr (pep0), was used as a control in the binding competition experiment and displayed no significant variations (Fig. 2E). To evaluate the ability to reduce IGF-1R/PDK1 interaction in intact cells, C43 was conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-C43) and loaded into MCF-7 cells at different concentrations (range: 100 nm–10 μm). Peptide loading was confirmed by FACS analysis (Fig. 3A) and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). Next, MCF-7 cells were loaded with 10 μm FITC-C43 and stimulated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml IGF-1. As shown in Fig. 4A, peptide loading decreased IGF-1R/PDK1 co-precipitation in response to IGF-1 as compared with a scrambled peptide (FITC-SP). Consistently, FITC-C43 loading was paralleled by reduced Akt/PKB and PKCζ phosphorylation in response to IGF-1 (Fig. 4, B and C). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was preserved instead.FIGURE 4Effect of C43 on IGF-1 signaling in intact MCF-7cells.A, MCF-7 cells, treated with FITC-SP or with FITC-C43, were starved for 16 h and stimulated for the indicated times with 100 ng/ml IGF-1. Cell lysates (200 μg/sample) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-1R (α-sub) antibody, and then immunoprecipitated proteins (IP) were separated on SDS-PAGE, and Western blot (WB) analysis was performed with anti-PDK1 and anti-IGF-1R α-subunit antibodies. Blots were revealed by ECL and autoradiography. B, MCF-7 cells, loaded with FITC-SP or FITC-C43, were incubated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml IGF-1. Total cell lysates (50 μg of protein/sample) were blotted with pThr308-Akt/PKB, pThr410-PKCζ, or phospho-threonine 202/tyrosine 204 ERK1/2 (pERK) antibodies and then reblotted with Akt/PKB, PKCζ, or ERK1/2 antibodies. Membranes were revealed by ECL and autoradiography. The autoradiographs shown are representative of four independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2076673020,"Three functional c-ras genes, known as c-H-ras, c-K-ras, and c-N-ras, have been largely studied in mammalian cells with important insights into normal and tumorigenic cellular signal transduction events. Two K-Ras mRNAs are obtained from the same pre-mRNA by alternative splicing. H-Ras pre-mRNA can also be alternatively spliced in the IDX and 4A terminal exons, yielding the p19 and p21 proteins, respectively. However, despite the Ras gene family's established role in tumorigenic cellular signal transduction events, little is known about p19 function. Previous results showed that p19 did not interact with two known p21 effectors, Raf1 and Rin1, but was shown to interact with RACK1, a scaffolding protein that promotes multi-protein complexes in different signaling pathways (Cancer Res 2003, 63 p5178). This observation suggests that p19 and p21 play differential and complementary roles in the cell.We found that p19 regulates telomerase activity through its interaction with p73alpha/beta proteins. We also found that p19 overexpression induces G1/S phase delay; an observation that correlates with hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p70SK6. Similarly, we also observed that FOXO1 is upregulated when p19 is overexpressed. The three observations of (1) hypophosphorylation of Akt, (2) G1/S phase delay and (3) upregulation of FOXO1 lead us to conclude that p19 induces G1/S phase delay, thereby maintaining cells in a reversible quiescence state and preventing entry into apoptosis. We then assessed the effect of p19 RNAi on HeLa cell growth and found that p19 RNAi increases cell growth, thereby having the opposite effect of arrest of the G1/S phase or producing a cellular quiescence state.Interestingly, p19 induces FOXO1 that in combination with the G1/S phase delay and hypophosphorylation of both Akt and p70SK6 leads to maintenance of a reversible cellular quiescence state, thereby preventing entry into apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2039959442,"Polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (trxG) proteins play important roles in establishing lineage-specific genetic programs through induction of chromatin modifications that lead to gene silencing or activation. Previously, we described an association between the MLL/SET1 complexes and a highly restricted, gene-specific DNA-binding protein Ap2δ that is required for recruitment of the MLL/SET1 complex to target Hoxc8 specifically. Here, we reduced levels of Ap2δ and Ash2l in the neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A, and analyzed their gene expression profiles using whole-genome mouse cDNA microarrays. This analysis yielded 42 genes that are potentially co-regulated by Ap2δ and Ash2l, and we have identified evolutionarily conserved Ap2-binding sites in 20 of them. To determine whether some of these were direct targets of the Ap2δ-Ash2l complex, we analyzed several promoters for the presence of Ap2δ and Ash2l by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Among the targets we screened, we identified Fgfr3 as a direct transcriptional target of the Ap2δ-Ash2l complex. Additionally, we found that Ap2δ is necessary for the recruitment of Ash2l-containing complexes to this promoter and that this recruitment leads to trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Thus, we have identified several candidate targets of complexes containing Ap2δ and Ash2l that can be used to further elucidate their roles during development and showed that Fgfr3 is a novel direct target of these complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1967466432,"For many viruses, the ability to infect eukaryotic cells depends on their transport through the cytoplasm and across the nuclear membrane of the host cell. During this journey, viral contents are biochemically processed into complexes capable of both nuclear penetration and genomic integration. We develop a stochastic model of viral entry that incorporates all relevant aspects of transport, including convection along microtubules, biochemical conversion, degradation, and nuclear entry. Analysis of the nuclear infection probabilities in terms of the transport velocity, degradation, and biochemical conversion rates shows how certain values of key parameters can maximize the nuclear entry probability of the viral material. The existence of such ""optimal"" infection scenarios depends on the details of the biochemical conversion process and implies potentially counterintuitive effects in viral infection, suggesting new avenues for antiviral treatment. Such optimal parameter values provide a plausible transport-based explanation of the action of restriction factors and of experimentally observed optimal capsid stability. Finally, we propose a new interpretation of how genetic mutations unrelated to the mechanism of drug action may nonetheless confer novel types of overall drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2144512912,"A safe and efficacious cancer medicine is necessary due to the increasing population of cancer patients whose particular diseases cannot be cured by the currently available treatment. Adenoviral (Ad) vectors represent a promising therapeutic medicine for human cancer therapy. However, several improvements are needed in order for Ad vectors to be effective cancer therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to, improvement of cellular uptake, enhanced cancer cell killing activity, and the capability of vector visualization and tracking once injected into the patients. To this end, we attempted to develop an Ad as a multifunctional platform incorporating targeting, imaging, and therapeutic motifs. In this study, we explored the utility of this proposed platform by generating an Ad vector containing the poly-lysine (pK), the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase (TK), and the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) as targeting, tumor cell killing, and imaging motifs, respectively. Our study herein demonstrates the generation of the triple mosaic Ad vector with pK, HSV-1 TK, and mRFP1 at the carboxyl termini of Ad minor capsid protein IX (pIX). In addition, the functionalities of pK, HSV-1 TK, and mRFP1 proteins on the Ad vector were retained as confirmed by corresponding functional assays, indicating the potential multifunctional application of this new Ad vector for cancer gene therapy. The validation of the triple mosaic Ad vectors also argues for the ability of pIX modification as a base for the development of multifunctional Ad vectors."

The majority of malignancies were distributed equally between T and B cell neoplasms and included lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma (LTCL), lymphoblastic B cell lymphoma (LBCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the histiocyte/T cell rich variant of DLBCL (DLBCL-HA/T cell rich DLBCL), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), follicular B cell lymphoma (FBL) and plasmacytoma (PCT). Most of these neoplasms were highly similar to human diseases. Also, some non-lymphoid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and histiocytic sarcoma were found. Interestingly, composite lymphomas, including Hodgkin-like lymphomas, were also detected that had CD30+ Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (H/RS)-like cells, representing a tumor type not previously described in mice. Analysis of microdissected H/RS-like cells revealed their origin as germinal center B cells bearing somatic hypermutations and, in some instances, crippled mutations, as described for human Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Transgene integration in an oncogene was excluded as an exclusive driving force of tumorigenesis and age-related lymphoma development suggests a multi-step process.

Physician HF practice patterns and confidence levels, as well as socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, were also assessed.Sixty-nine of 101 physicians (68%) completed the survey examining self-reported prescribing of beta-blockers. Physicians who served as inpatient ward attendings self-reported significantly higher rates of beta-blocker prescribing among their HF patients when compared with physicians who did not attend (78% vs. 58%; p = 0.002), as did physicians who were very confident in managing HF patients when compared with physicians who were not (82% vs. 68%; p = 0.009). Fifty-one of these 69 surveyed physicians (74%) were successfully matched to 287 HF patients for whom beta-blocker prescribing data was available. Physicians with greater self-reported rates of prescribing beta-blockers were significantly more likely to actually prescribe beta-blockers (p = 0.02); however, no other physician characteristics were significantly associated with actual prescribing of beta-blockers among HF patients.Physician teaching responsibilities and confidence levels were associated with self-reported beta-blocker prescribing among their HF patients. Educational efforts focused on improving confidence levels in HF care and increasing exposure to teaching may improve beta-blocker presciption in HF patients managed in primary care."
https://openalex.org/W2005511149,"Background Wheezing disorders in childhood vary widely in clinical presentation and disease course. During the last years, several ways to classify wheezing children into different disease phenotypes have been proposed and are increasingly used for clinical guidance, but validation of these hypothetical entities is difficult. Methodology/Principal Findings The aim of this study was to develop a testable disease model which reflects the full spectrum of wheezing illness in preschool children. We performed a qualitative study among a panel of 7 experienced clinicians from 4 European countries working in primary, secondary and tertiary paediatric care. In a series of questionnaire surveys and structured discussions, we found a general consensus that preschool wheezing disorders consist of several phenotypes, with a great heterogeneity of specific disease concepts between clinicians. Initially, 24 disease entities were described among the 7 physicians. In structured discussions, these could be narrowed down to three entities which were linked to proposed mechanisms: a) allergic wheeze, b) non-allergic wheeze due to structural airway narrowing and c) non-allergic wheeze due to increased immune response to viral infections. This disease model will serve to create an artificial dataset that allows the validation of data-driven multidimensional methods, such as cluster analysis, which have been proposed for identification of wheezing phenotypes in children. Conclusions/Significance While there appears to be wide agreement among clinicians that wheezing disorders consist of several diseases, there is less agreement regarding their number and nature. A great diversity of disease concepts exist but a unified phenotype classification reflecting underlying disease mechanisms is lacking. We propose a disease model which may help guide future research so that proposed mechanisms are measured at the right time and their role in disease heterogeneity can be studied."
