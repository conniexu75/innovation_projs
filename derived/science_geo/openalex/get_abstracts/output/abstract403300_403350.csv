https://openalex.org/W2005455824,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) persist in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain. Location within this germinal region determines the type of neuronal progeny NSCs generate, but the mechanism of adult NSC positional specification remains unknown. We show that sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, resulting in high gli1 levels, occurs in the ventral SVZ and is associated with the genesis of specific neuronal progeny. Shh is selectively produced by a small group of ventral forebrain neurons. Ablation of Shh decreases production of ventrally derived neuron types, while ectopic activation of this pathway in dorsal NSCs respecifies their progeny to deep granule interneurons and calbindin-positive periglomerular cells. These results show that Shh is necessary and sufficient for the specification of adult ventral NSCs."

Shank3 is a large scaffold postsynaptic density protein implicated in dendritic spines and synapse formation; however, its specific functions have not been clearly demonstrated. We have used RNAi to knockdown Shank3 expression in neuronal cultures and showed that this treatment specifically reduced the synaptic expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), but did not affect the expression of other major synaptic proteins. The functional consequence of Shank3 RNAi knockdown was impaired signaling via mGluR5, as shown by reduction in ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation induced by stimulation with (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) as the agonist of mGluR5 receptors, impaired mGluR5-dependent synaptic plasticity (DHPG-induced long-term depression), and impaired mGluR5-dependent modulation of neural network activity. We also found morphological abnormalities in the structure of synapses (spine number, width, and length) and impaired glutamatergic synaptic transmission, as shown by reduction in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC). Notably, pharmacological augmentation of mGluR5 activity using 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-benzamide as the positive allosteric modulator of these receptors restored mGluR5-dependent signaling (DHPG-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2) and normalized the frequency of mEPSCs in Shank3-knocked down neurons. These data demonstrate that a deficit in mGluR5-mediated intracellular signaling in Shank3 knockdown neurons can be compensated by 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-benzamide; this raises the possibility that pharmacological augmentation of mGluR5 activity represents a possible new therapeutic approach for patients with Shank3 mutations.

The three genes, SHANK1, SHANK2, and SHANK3, encode large scaffold proteins that contain an ankyrin repeat near the N terminus followed by an Src homology domain 3 domain, a PDZ domain, a long proline-rich region, and a sterile α motif domain at the C terminus (10Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins molecularly link the two glutamate receptor subtypes, NMDA receptors and type-I metabotropic GluRs (mGluRs). The Shank PDZ domain binds to the C terminus of GKAP, which binds to the PSD-95·NMDA receptor complex. Homer interaction with the proline-rich domain ensures the association of Shank with type I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J.

Overexpression of Shank1 in rat hippocampal neurons accelerates the maturation of filopodia-like protrusions in mature spines and promotes the enlargement of mature spines (14Sala C. Piëch V.

Shank3 overexpression in rat cerebellar granule cells induces dendritic spine and synapse formation, whereas Shank3 knockdown in hippocampal neurons reduces the number of dendritic spines (1Roussignol G.

Several splice variants have been described for all three genes, in particular six intragenic promoters generating multiple splicing variants have been identified for SHANK3 (20Maunakea A.K.

The functional role for all these splice variants remains to be determined; however, one can postulate that, depending on the introduced mutations, the resulting truncated proteins might have different functional consequences, such as gain or loss of specific functions. This might explain the contradictory results recently published on Shank3 partial-KO mice. Wang et al. (21Wang X. McCoy P.A. Rodriguiz R.M. Pan Y. Je H.S. Roberts A.C. Kim C.J. Berrios J. Colvin J.S.

Finally Bangash et al. (23Bangash M.A. Park J.M. Melnikova T. Wang D. Jeon S.K. Lee D. Syeda S. Kim J. Kouser M. Schwartz J. Cui Y. Zhao X. Speed H.E. Kee S.E. Tu J.C. Hu J.H. Petralia R.S.

With the aim of understanding the function of Shank3 and its isoform(s) in the overall neuronal network toward the identification of therapeutic target(s), for patients affected with MR and autism due to SHANK3 mutations, we have studied the synaptic molecular pathways in cultured murine Shank3 knockdown neurons. Rather than using Shank partial knockout mice, we knocked down the expression of all the major Shank3 splice variants in neuronal cultures through RNA interference (RNAi). Our data show that knockdown of Shank3 expression in rat and/or mouse hippocampal cell cultures induces a specific reduction in expression of mGluR5 receptors, as well as a reduction in (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (a group I mGluR agonist)-induced ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation and in mGluR5-dependent synaptic plasticity and modulation of neural network activity. Notably, pharmacological augmentation of mGluR5 activity using 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-benzamide (CDPPB) as a positive allosteric modulator potentiated mGluR5-dependent signaling (DHPG-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2) and restored synaptic physiology in neurons knocked down for Shank3. Thus, unlike Shank1, which in association with Homer acts as a structural framework at synapses (19Hayashi M.K. Tang C. Verpelli C. Narayanan R. Stearns M.H. Xu R.M. Li H. Sala C. Hayashi Y. Cell. 2009; 137: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), Shank3 could act as a signaling scaffold platform at synapses. Rat hippocampal or cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from 18- to 19-day-old rat embryos (pregnant female rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories). Neurons were plated at high density (750–1000 cells/mm2) and medium density (150–200 cells/mm2) and grown as described (24Romorini S. Piccoli G. Jiang M. Grossano P. Tonna N. Passafaro M. Zhang M. Sala C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9391-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using B27 prepared in the laboratory. Neurons were plated onto 6-well plastic tissue culture plates (Iwaki, Bibby Sterilin), or 18-mm diameter coverslips and grown on 12-well plastic tissue culture plates (Iwaki, Bibby Sterilin). Primary mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously (25Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Schachner M. Neuron. 2000; 26: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Hippocampi from 1- to 3-day-old C57BL6/J mouse pups were dissected at 4 °C, and plated at a density of 300/mm2 in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 2% B27 supplement and 25 μg/ml of FGF2 (both from Invitrogen) on 18-mm diameter round glass coverslips (Menzel-Glaser) coated overnight with 100 μg/ml of poly-l-lysine and 40 μg/ml of laminin (both from Sigma). From culture day 3, the medium was supplemented with 0.5 μm AraC (Sigma) to prevent glial cell proliferation. Neurons were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as per the protocol described by Sala et al. (14Sala C. Piëch V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Cultures were infected with lentivirus expressing shRNA specific for luciferase (shCtrl) or Shank3 (shShank3) on day 7 in vitro (DIV) and used for experiments on 13–15 DIV. Cells were stimulated with 100 μm DHPG, 100 μm NMDA, or 50 mm KCl at 15 DIV for 30 min. To reduce endogenous synaptic activity, 2 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX) was added to cultures 12 h before stimulation. For the biochemical experiments with CDPPB (Calbiochem), neurons were treated for 12 h with 100 nm or 1 μm CDPPB before DHPG stimulation. For plasmid-based RNA inhibition, Shank3 and luciferase (26Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6583-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the HindIII/BglII sites of the pLVTHM vector for lentivirus production of the shRNA. We used the following siRNA sequence that targets exon 21 of the rat and mouse SHANK3 gene (GenBankTM accession number NM_021676 and NM_021423.3): 5′-GGAAGTCACCAGAGGACAAGA-3′. The Shank3 rescue (Shank3r), R87C (Shank3R87Cr), and InsG (Shank3InsGr) constructs resistant to interference by siRNA were generated by changing six nucleotides of the siRNA target site, without changing the amino acid sequence of the resultant protein. Shank3 R87C and InsG mutants have been described elsewhere (6Durand C.M. Betancur C. Boeckers T.M. Bockmann J. Chaste P. Fauchereau F. Nygren G. Rastam M. Gillberg I.C. Anckarsäter H. Sponheim E.

Total mRNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from DNase I-treated RNA using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen,) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA transcripts were quantified by TaqMan Q-PCR 3 (Applied Biosystems) on a Prism 7900 thermal cycler and sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). All primers and probes were from Applied Biosystems. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Average Δ-Ct values normalized to GAPDH or cyclophilin A (housekeeping genes) were used to calculate gene-fold induction in treated samples, relative to control set to 1. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Shank3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-160); guinea pig anti-Shank3 (27Beri S. Tonna N. Menozzi G. Bonaglia M.C. Sala C. Giorda R. J.

Western blotting was performed as described in Ref. 28Verpelli C. Piccoli G. Zanchi A. Gardoni F. Huang K. Brambilla D. Di Luca M. Battaglioli E. Sala C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5830-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar. The signal was detected using an ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity of the bands was measured with ImageJ software. Signals of the detected proteins were normalized according to signals for actin or tubulin; the intensity of phosphospecific ERK1/2 and CREB immunoreactivity was normalized to the total ERK1/2 and CREB signal in the same lane. Changes in protein levels and in ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation were compared with those of untreated samples and were expressed as fold-increase or decrease. The results are shown as mean ± S.E. Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose at room temperature or in 100% methanol at −20 °C. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in GDB buffer (30 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.8 m NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. To study ERK1/2 phosphorylation, neurons were transfected with the pEGFP, Shank3r, Shank3R87Cr, or Shank3InsGr vectors alone or in combination with Shank3 shRNA at a ratio of 1:2. Confocal images were acquired as described below. Cell bodies were manually traced using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) on the GFP channel. The average intensity of the fluorescent signal obtained with antibody against pERK1/2 in the transfected neurons was divided by the average intensity of the pERK1/2 signal in adjacent untransfected neurons. To estimate cell surface expression of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors and its down-regulation by DHPG (29Moult P.R. Gladding C.M. Sanderson T.M. Fitzjohn S.M. Bashir Z.I. Molnar E. Collingridge G.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), untreated or DHPG-treated cultures were briefly washed with PBS and incubated with antibody against an extracellular epitope of the GluR1 subunit (Alomone Labs, agc-004, 16 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. For treatment, either 100 μm DHPG + 50 μm 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) or 50 μm APV alone were added to the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. Following incubation with anti-GluR1 antibody, cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Anti-rabbit Alexa 546-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) was applied under nonpermeabilizing conditions for 1 h at RT. All images were collected using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope and ×60 oil immersion objective at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. The quantitative analysis was performed using a Z-series projection of five images taken at 0.8-μm depth intervals. All analyses were performed using NIH ImageJ software. The threshold for detection of GluR1-positive fluorescent clusters was fixed at twice the level of background fluorescence obtained from a region of diffuse fluorescence within the dendritic shaft. Only clusters lying along secondary dendritic branches were counted; regions in which the identification of neuronal processes was ambiguous were excluded from the quantification. We quantified the number of GluR1 immunoreactive clusters per 100-μm dendritic length within a given field. Neurons were cotransfected with a shRNA vectors and DsRed at a ratio of 2:1 (7.5 μg of total DNA/well in 12-well plates) on 7 DIV and fixed on 18 DIV. Labeled transfected neurons were randomly chosen for quantification in at least four independent experiments for each construct. Confocal images of 1024 × 1024 pixels were obtained with a LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, a gift from Fondazione Monzino) and a ×63 objective with sequential acquisition settings. Each image was a Z-series projection of 7–15 images, each averaged two to four times, and taken at 0.4–0.7-μm depth intervals. Morphometric measurements were made using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Individual dendrites were selected randomly and their spines were traced manually. The maximum length and head width of each spine were measured and archived automatically (30Piccoli G. Verpelli C. Tonna N. Romorini S. Alessio M. Nairn A.C. Bachi A. Sala C. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3203-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were used for electrophysiological recordings 3–4 days after transfection. For rescue experiments, the infected neurons were transfected on 11 DIV with pcDNA3 (Mock) or Shank3 resistant to shShank3 (Shank3r) cloned in pcDNA3. A vector expressing a red fluorescent protein tdTomato (31Cancedda L. Fiumelli H. Chen K. Poo M.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5224-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) was co-transfected in these experiments to allow the identification of transfected neurons. For pharmacological rescue of frequency of mEPSCs, the allosteric modulator of mGluR5 (CDPPB, 1 μm, dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) was applied overnight on 13 DIV and during recordings of mEPSCs on 14 DIV. As a vehicle control, 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide was used. Whole cell recordings from pyramidal-like neurons were obtained as previously described (29Moult P.R. Gladding C.M. Sanderson T.M. Fitzjohn S.M. Bashir Z.I. Molnar E. Collingridge G.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Electrodes with a resistance in the range of 3–6 megohms were filled with a solution that contained 130 mm CsMeSO4, 8 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgATP, 0.3 mm NaGTP, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.25. Cells were perfused continuously with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) of the following composition: 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 33 mm d-glucose, 0.5 μm TTX citrate (Tocris), and 0.05 mm picrotoxin (Tocris), pH 7.35. The osmolarity of HBS was adjusted to that of the culture medium on the day of recording. The osmolarity of the electrode solution was 10 mosmol less than that of HBS. When used, DHPG (100 μm, Tocris) was added to HBS. To prevent any contribution of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and thus elicit pure mGluR-dependent LTD, 50 μm APV (Sigma) was co-applied with DHPG or applied alone as a control. Data were digitized at 10 kHz. Continuous recording of mEPSCs was made using an EPC10 USB patch clamp amplifier and PATCHMASTER software (HEKA Elektronik). Detection and measurements of mEPSCs, which were collected over a 3-min period, were performed using MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ) after filtering traces at 1 kHz and using a detection threshold of 6 pA (i.e. above 4 times the standard deviation of baseline noise) and visual verification of all detected events. Only cells with a holding current less than −100 pA were analyzed. Microelectrode arrays (Multichannel Systems, MCS, Reutlingen, Germany) consisted of 60 TiN/SiN planar round electrodes (30 μm diameter, 200-μm center to center interelectrode distance) arranged in an 8 × 8 square grid excluding corners. Dissociated neurons from C57BL6/J mice at postnatal day 1 were infected on 8–10 DIV as described above. The activity of all cultures was recorded using the MEA60 System (MCS). After ×1200 amplification, signals were sampled at 10 kHz and acquired through the data acquisition card and MC_Rack software (MCS). To reduce thermal stress to the cells during the experiment, MEAs were kept at 37 °C by means of a controlled thermostat (MCS) and covered by flexible polydimethylsiloxane lids (32Blau A. Neumann T. Ziegler C. Benfenati F. J. Biosci. 2009; 34: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), to avoid evaporation and prevent changes in osmolarity. There was one recording session per culture; the session included 30 min of baseline recordings in the absence of DHPG and three consecutive 30-min recordings in the presence of 1, 10, and 100 μm DHPG. Only the last 20 min of each episode were analyzed to exclude the initial part of recordings, during which neuronal activity may have been influenced by the mechanical disturbances evoked by injection of the drug. Only cultures in which more than 70% Shank3 expression was knocked out were included in the analysis. Data analysis was performed off-line using custom software, SPYCODE, developed in MATLAB® (The Mathworks) (33Bologna L.L. Nieus T. Tedesco M. Chiappalone M. Benfenati F. Martinoia S. Neuroscience. 2010; 165: 692-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); this software collects a series of tools for processing of multichannel neural recordings. Data were imported into MATLAB from mcd files (MCS format), and spikes were detected using the precise timing spike detection algorithm (34Maccione A. Gandolfo M. Massobrio P. Novellino A. Martinoia S. Chiappalone M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 177: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Spike trains were analyzed using a custom burst detection method (35Pasquale V. Martinoia S. Chiappalone M. J. Comput. Neurosci. 2010; 29: 213-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the parameters of which are directly estimated from the inter-spike interval distribution of each channel. Following the burst detection procedure, several measures describing spike and burst statistics were extracted; these included mean firing rate, mean bursting rate, mean burst duration, mean frequency intra burst (spikes/sec), and percentage and frequency of out-burst spikes (i.e. spikes not included in bursts over the total). Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Holm-Sidak pairwise comparison of groups was used for statistical evaluation of the DHPG and shShank3 effects. To understand the role of Shank3 in synapse formation and function, we knocked down Shank3 using RNA interference. Expressed via a lentiviral vector, Shank3 shRNA (shShank3) strongly reduced the levels of endogenous Shank3 mRNA and protein, but not those of other Shank family members, in murine hippocampal cultures; a control shRNA (shCtrl) had no such effect (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). Interestingly, Shank3 shRNA knocked down all four major Shank3 isoforms in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). We used two different antibodies in our immunoblotting analysis, one against the N-terminal domain and one against the C-terminal domain (see supplemental Fig. 1A). Although the antibodies gave a different pattern in both cases all the major bands were knocked down except for three minor bands revealed with the N-terminal antibody (see supplemental"
https://openalex.org/W1980638845,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown to be key players in both extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration during cancer metastasis. MMP-14, a membrane-anchored MMP, in particular, is closely associated with these processes. The hemopexin (PEX) domain of MMP-14 has been proposed as the modulating region involved in the molecular cross-talk that initiates cell migration through homodimerization of MMP-14 as well as heterodimerization with the cell surface adhesion molecule CD44. In this study, minimal regions required for function within the PEX domain were investigated through a series of substitution mutations. Blades I and IV were found to be involved in cell migration. We found that blade IV is necessary for MMP-14 homodimerization and that blade I is required for CD44 MMP-14 heterodimerization. Cross-talk between MMP-14 and CD44 results in phosphorylation of EGF receptor and downstream activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways involved in cell migration. Based on these mutagenesis analyses, peptides mimicking the essential outermost strand motifs within the PEX domain of MMP-14 were designed. These synthetic peptides inhibit MMP-14-enhanced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner but have no effect on the function of other MMPs. Furthermore, these peptides interfere with cancer metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. Thus, targeting the MMP-14 hemopexin domain represents a novel approach to inhibit MMP-14-mediated cancer dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2136997924,"An interocular conflict arises when different images are presented to each eye at the same spatial location. The visual system resolves this conflict through binocular rivalry: observers consciously perceive spontaneous alternations between the two images. Visual attention is generally important for resolving competition between neural representations. However, given the seemingly spontaneous and automatic nature of binocular rivalry, the role of attention in resolving interocular competition remains unclear. Here we test whether visual attention is necessary to produce rivalry. Using an EEG frequency-tagging method to track cortical representations of the conflicting images, we show that when attention was diverted away, rivalry stopped. The EEG data further suggested that the neural representations of the dichoptic images combined without attention. Thus, attention is necessary for dichoptic images to be engaged in sustained rivalry and may be generally required for resolving conflicting, potentially ambiguous input and giving a single interpretation access to consciousness."

Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar) has provided an indispensable framework for understanding the neural substrates of learning and decision making (Niv, 2009Niv Y.

However, to date, ideas from RL have been applied mainly in very simple task settings, leaving it unclear whether related principles might pertain in cases of more complex behavior (for a discussion, see Daw and Frank, 2009Daw N.D.

Reinforcement learning: the good, the bad and the ugly.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Hierarchically structured behavior provides a particularly interesting test case, not only because hierarchy plays an important role in human action (Cooper and Shallice, 2000Cooper R. Shallice T.

The problem of serial order in behavior.in: Jeffress L.A. Cerebral Mechanisms in Behavior: The Hixon Symposium. Wiley, New York1951: 112-136Google Scholar), but also because there exist RL algorithms specifically designed to operate in a hierarchical context (Barto and Mahadevan, 2003Barto A.G. Mahadevan S.

Several researchers have proposed that such hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithms may be relevant to understanding brain function, and a number of intriguing parallels to existing neuroscientific findings have been noted (Botvinick, 2008Botvinick M.M.

Heterarchical reinforcement-learning model for integration of multiple cortico-striatal loops: fMRI examination in stimulus-action-reward association learning.Neural Netw. 2006; 19: 1242-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of HRL to neural function stands in need of empirical test. In traditional RL (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar), the agent selects among a set of elemental actions, typically interpreted as relatively simple motor behaviors. The key innovation in HRL is to expand the set of available actions so that the agent may now opt to perform not only elemental actions, but also multiaction subroutines, containing sequences of lower-level actions, as illustrated in Figure 1 (for a fuller description, see Experimental Procedures and Botvinick et al., 2009Botvinick M.M. Niv Y. Barto A.C. Hierarchically organized behavior and its neural foundations: a reinforcement learning perspective.Cognition. 2009; 113: 262-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Learning in HRL occurs at two levels. At a global level, the agent learns to select actions and subroutines so as to efficiently accomplish overall task goals. A fundamental assumption of RL is that goals are defined by their association with reward, and thus, the objective at this level is to discover behavior that maximizes long-term cumulative reward. Progress toward this objective is driven by temporal-difference (TD) procedures drawn directly from ordinary RL: following each action or subroutine, a reward prediction error (RPE) is generated, indicating whether the behavior yielded an outcome better or worse than initially predicted (see Figure 1 and Experimental Procedures), and this prediction error signal is used to update the behavioral policy. Importantly, outcomes of actions are evaluated with respect to the global goal of maximizing long-term reward. At a second level, the problem is to learn the subroutines themselves. Intuitively, useful subroutines are designed to accomplish internally defined subgoals (Singh et al., 2005Singh S. Barto A.G. Chentanez N. Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning.in: Saul L.K. Weiss Y. Bottou L. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 17: Proceedings of the 2004 Conference. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2005: 1281-1288Google Scholar). For example, in the task of making coffee, one sensible subroutine would aim at adding cream. HRL makes the important assumption that the attainment of such subgoals is associated with a special form of reward, labeled pseudo-reward to distinguish it from “external” or primary reward. The distinction is critical because subgoals may not themselves be associated with primary reward. For example, adding cream to coffee may bring one closer to that rewarding first sip, but is not itself immediately rewarding. In an HRL context, accomplishment of this subgoal would yield pseudo-reward, but not primary reward. Once the HRL agent enters a subroutine, prediction error signals indicate the degree to which each action has carried the agent toward the currently relevant subgoal and its associated pseudo-reward (see Figure 1 and Experimental Procedures). Note that these subroutine-specific prediction errors are unique to HRL. In what follows, we refer to them as pseudo-reward prediction errors (PPEs), reserving “reward prediction error” for prediction errors relating to primary reward. In order to make these points concrete, consider the video game illustrated in Figure 2, which is based on a benchmark task from the computational HRL literature (Dietterich, 1998Dietterich T.G. The MAXQ method for hierarchical reinforcement learning.in: Shavlik J.W. Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Machine Learning. Morgan Kaufman, San Francisco1998: 118-126Google Scholar). Only the colored elements in the figure appear in the task display. The overall objective of the game is to complete a “delivery” as quickly as possible, using joystick movements to guide the truck first to the package and from there to the house. It is self-evident how this task might be represented hierarchically, with delivery serving as the (externally rewarded) top-level goal and acquisition of the package as an obvious subgoal. For an HRL agent, delivery would be associated with primary reward and acquisition of the package with pseudo-reward. (This observation is not meant to suggest that the task must be represented hierarchically. Indeed, it is an established point in the HRL literature that any hierarchical policy has an equivalent nonhierarchical or flat policy, as long as the underlying decision problem satisfies the Markov property.) Our neuroimaging experiments proceeded on the assumption that participants would represent the delivery task hierarchically. However, as we discuss later, the neuroimaging results themselves, together with results from a behavioral experiment, provided convergent evidence for the validity of this assumption. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures, available online, for further discussion. Consider now a version of the task in which the package sometimes unexpectedly jumps to a new location before the truck reaches it. According to RL, a jump to point A in the figure, or any location within the ellipse shown, should trigger a positive RPE because the total distance that must be covered in order to deliver the package has decreased. (Note that we assume temporal discounting, which implies that attaining the goal faster is more rewarding. We also assume that current subgoal and goal distances are always immediately known, as they were for our experimental participants from the task display.) By the same token, a jump to point B or any other exterior point should trigger a negative RPE. Cases C, D, and E are quite different. Here, there is no change in the overall distance to the goal, and so no RPE should be triggered, either in standard RL or in HRL. However, in case C the distance to the subgoal has decreased. Thus, according to HRL, a jump to this location should trigger a positive PPE. Similarly, a jump to location D should trigger a negative PPE (note that location E is special, being the only location that should trigger neither an RPE nor a PPE). These points are illustrated in Figure 2 (right), which shows RPE and PPE time courses from simulations of the delivery task based on standard RL and HRL (for simulation methods, see Experimental Procedures). These points translate directly into neuroscientific predictions. Previous research has revealed neural correlates of the RPE in numerous structures (Breiter et al., 2001Breiter H.C. Aharon I.

HRL predicts that neural correlates should also exist for the PPE. To test this, we had neurologically normal participants perform the delivery task from Figure 2 while undergoing EEG and, in two further experiments, fMRI. The EEG experiment included 9 participants, who performed the delivery task for a total of 60 min (190 delivery trials on average per participant). One-third of trials involved a jump event of type D from Figure 2; these events were intended to elicit a negative PPE. Earlier EEG research indicates that ordinary negative RPEs trigger a midline negativity typically centered on lead Cz, sometimes referred to as the feedback-related negativity or FRN (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G.H. The neural basis of human error processing: reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar, Holroyd et al., 2003Holroyd C.B. Nieuwenhuis S. Yeung N. Cohen J.D.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Based on HRL, we predicted that a similar negativity would occur following the critical jumps (type D) in our task. To provide a baseline for comparison, another third of the trials involved jump events of type E. Stimulus-aligned EEG averages indicated that class D-jump events triggered a phasic negativity in the EEG (p < 0.01 at Cz; Figure 3, left), relative to the E-jump control condition. (Like the ERP obtained in this study, the FRN sometimes takes the form of a relative negativity occupying the positive voltage domain, rather than absolute negativity. For germane examples, see Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005Nieuwenhuis S. Slagter H.A. von Geusau N.J.A. Heslenfeld D.J. Holroyd C.B.

Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3161-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Yeung et al., 2005Yeung N. Holroyd C.B. Cohen J.D. ERP correlates of feedback and reward processing in the presence and absence of response choice.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar.) Like the FRN, this negativity was largest in the fronto-central midline leads (including Cz, see Figure 3, right), and although the observed negativity peaked later than the typical FRN, its timing is consistent with studies of equivalent complexity of feedback (Baker and Holroyd, 2011Baker T.E. Holroyd C.B. Dissociated roles of the anterior cingulate cortex in reward and conflict processing as revealed by the feedback error-related negativity and N200.Biol. Psychol. 2011; 87: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In our first fMRI experiment, a group of 30 new participants performed a slightly different version of the delivery task, again designed to elicit negative PPEs. As in the EEG experiment, one-third of trials included a jump of type D (as in Figure 2), and another third included a jump of type E. Type D jumps, by increasing the distance to the subgoal, were again intended to trigger a PPE. However, in the fMRI version of the task, unlike the EEG version, the exact increase in subgoal distance varied across trials. Therefore, type D jumps were intended to induce PPEs that varied in magnitude (Figure 2). Our analyses took a model-based approach (O'Doherty et al., 2007O'Doherty J.P. Hampton A. Kim H. Model-based fMRI and its application to reward learning and decision making.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1104: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), testing for regions that showed phasic activation correlating positively with predicted PPE size. A whole-brain general linear model analysis, thresholded at p < 0.01 (cluster-size thresholded to correct for multiple comparisons), revealed such a correlation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Figure 4). This region has been proposed to contain the generator of the FRN (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G.H. The neural basis of human error processing: reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar, although see Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005Nieuwenhuis S. Slagter H.A. von Geusau N.J.A. Heslenfeld D.J. Holroyd C.B. Knowing good from bad: differential activation of human cortical areas by positive and negative outcomes.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3161-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and Discussion below). In this regard the fMRI result is consistent with the result of our EEG experiment. The same parametric fMRI effect was also observed bilaterally in the anterior insula, a region often coactivated with the ACC in the setting of unanticipated negative events (Phan et al., 2004Phan K.L. Wager T.D. Taylor S.F. Liberzon I. Functional neuroimaging studies of human emotions.CNS Spectr. 2004; 9: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The effect was also detected in right supramarginal gyrus, the medial part of lingual gyrus, and, with a negative coefficient, in the left inferior frontal gyrus. However, in a follow-up analysis we controlled for subgoal displacement (e.g., the distance between the original package location and point D in Figure 2), a nuisance variable moderately correlated, across trials, with the change in distance to subgoal. Within this analysis only the ACC (p < 0.01), bilateral anterior insula (p < 0.01 left, p < 0.05 right), and right lingual gyrus (p < 0.01) continued to show significant correlations with the PPE. In a series of region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, we focused in on additional neural structures that, like the ACC, have been previously proposed to encode negative RPEs: the habenular complex (Salas et al., 2010Salas R. Baldwin P. de Biasi M. Montague P.R. BOLD responses to negative reward prediction errors in human habenula.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 36PubMed Google Scholar, Ullsperger and von Cramon, 2003Ullsperger M. von Cramon D.Y. Error monitoring using external feedback: specific roles of the habenular complex, the reward system, and the cingulate motor area revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging.J.

Differential encoding of losses and gains in the human striatum.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and amygdala (Breiter et al., 2001Breiter H.C. Aharon I.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9530-9537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). (These analyses were intended to bring greater statistical power to bear on these regions, in part because their small size may have undermined our ability to detect activation in them in our whole-brain analysis, where a cluster-size threshold was employed.) The habenular complex was found to display greater activity following type D than type E jumps (p < 0.05), consistent with the idea that this structure is also engaged by negative PPEs. A comparable effect was also observed in the right, though not left, amygdala (p < 0.05). In the NAcc, where some studies have observed deactivation accompanying negative RPEs (Knutson et al., 2005Knutson B. Taylor J. Kaufman M. Peterson R. Glover G. Distributed neural representation of expected value.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4806-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), no significant PPE effect was observed. However, it should be noted that NAcc deactivation with negative RPEs has been an inconsistent finding in previous work (for example, see Cooper and Knutson, 2008Cooper J.C. Knutson B.

Temporal difference models describe higher-order learning in humans.Nature. 2004; 429: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To test this directly, we ran a second, smaller fMRI study designed to elicit positive PPEs, specifically looking for activation within a NAcc ROI. A total of 14 participants performed the delivery task, with jumps of type C (in Figure 2) occurring on one-third of trials and jumps of type E on another third. As described earlier, a positive PPE is predicted to occur in association with type C jumps, and in this setting significant activation (p < 0.05) was observed in the right (though not left) NAcc, scaling with predicted PPE magnitude. We have characterized the results from our EEG and fMRI experiments as displaying a “signature” of HRL, in the sense that the PPE signal is predicted by HRL but not by standard RL algorithms (Figure 2). However, there is an important caveat that we now consider. In our neuroimaging experiments we assumed that reaching the goal (the house) would be associated with primary reward. (The same points hold if “primary reward” is replaced with “secondary” or “conditioned reinforcement.”) We also assumed that reaching the subgoal (the package) was not associated with primary reward but only with pseudo-reward. However, what if participants did attach primary reward to the subgoal? If this were the case, it would present a difficulty for the interpretation of our neuroimaging results because it would lead standard RL to predict an RPE in association with events that change only subgoal distance (including C and D jumps in our neuroimaging task). In view of these points, it was necessary to establish whether participants performing the delivery task did or did not attach primary reward to subgoal attainment. In order to evaluate this, we devised a modified version of the task. Here, 22 participants delivered packages as before, though without jump events. However, at the beginning of each delivery trial, two packages were presented in the display, which defined paths that could differ both in terms of their subgoal distance and the overall distance to the goal (Figure 5, left). Participants indicated with a key press which package they preferred to deliver. We reasoned that if goal attainment were associated with primary reward, then (assuming ordinary temporal discounting) the overall goal distance associated with each of the two packages should influence choice. More importantly, if we were correct in our assumption that subgoal attainment carried no primary reward, then choice should not be influenced by subgoal distance, i.e., the distance from the truck to each of the two packages. Participants' choices strongly supported both of these predictions. Logistic regression analyses indicated that goal distance had a strong influence on package choice (M = −7.6, p < 0.001; Figure 5, right; larger negative coefficients indicate a larger penalty on distances). However, subgoal distance exerted no appreciable influence on choice (p = 0.43), and the average regression coefficient was near zero (−0.16). The latter observation held even in a subset of trials where the two delivery options were closely matched in terms of overall distance (with ratios of overall goal distance between 0.8 and 1.2). These behavioral results strongly favor our HRL account of delivery task, over a standard RL account. (The behavioral data are consistent with a standard RL model that attaches no reward to subgoal attainment, but as noted earlier, such a model offers no explanation for our neuroimaging results.) To further establish the point, we fit two computational models to individual subjects' choice data: (1) an HRL model, and (2) a standard RL model in which primary reward was attached to the subgoal (see Experimental Procedures). The mean Bayes factor across subjects—with values greater than one favoring the HRL model—was 4.31, and values across subjects differed significantly from one (two-tailed t test, p < 0.001; see Figure 5, right). We predicted, based on HRL, that neural structures previously proposed to encode TD RPEs should also respond to PPEs—prediction errors tied to behavioral subgoals. Across three experiments using a task designed to elicit PPEs, without eliciting RPEs, we observed evidence consistent with this prediction. Negative PPEs were found to engage three structures previously reported to show activation with negative RPEs: ACC, habenula, and amygdala; and activation scaling with positive PPEs was observed in right NAcc, a location frequently reported to be engaged by positive RPEs. Of course the association of these neural responses with the relevant task events does not uniquely support an interpretation in terms of HRL (see Poldrack, 2006Poldrack R.A. Can cognitive processes be inferred from neuroimaging data?.Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.). 2006; 10: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). However, aspects of either the task or the experimental results do militate against the most tempting alternative interpretations. Our behavioral study provided evidence against primary reward at subgoal attainment, closing off an interpretation of the neuroimaging data in terms of standard RL. Given previous findin"

However, lack of potent selective pharmacological inhibitors for TRPC channels has limited delineation of the roles of these channels in physiological systems. Here we report the identification and characterization of ML204 as a novel, potent, and selective TRPC4 channel inhibitor. A high throughput fluorescent screen of 305,000 compounds of the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository was performed for inhibitors that blocked intracellular Ca(2+) rise in response to stimulation of mouse TRPC4β by μ-opioid receptors. ML204 inhibited TRPC4β-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) rise with an IC(50) value of 0.96 μm and exhibited 19-fold selectivity against muscarinic receptor-coupled TRPC6 channel activation. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings, ML204 blocked TRPC4β currents activated through either μ-opioid receptor stimulation or intracellular dialysis of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), suggesting a direct interaction of ML204 with TRPC4 channels rather than any interference with the signal transduction pathways. Selectivity studies showed no appreciable block by 10-20 μm ML204 of TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPA1, and TRPM8, as well as KCNQ2 and native voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels in mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. In isolated guinea pig ileal myocytes, ML204 blocked muscarinic cation currents activated by bath application of carbachol or intracellular infusion of GTPγS, demonstrating its effectiveness on native TRPC4 currents. Therefore, ML204 represents an excellent novel tool for investigation of TRPC4 channel function and may facilitate the development of therapeutics targeted to TRPC4."

Here, we demonstrate that already in neonatal rats, patterns of discontinuous oscillatory activity precisely entrain the firing of prefrontal neurons and have distinct spatial and temporal organization over cingulate and prelimbic cortices. Moreover, we show that hippocampal theta bursts drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations by phase-locking the neuronal firing via axonal pathways. Consequently, functional impairment of the hippocampus reduces the prefrontal activity. With ongoing maturation continuous theta-gamma oscillations emerge and mutually entrain the prejuvenile prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Thus, theta-modulated communication within developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks may be relevant for circuitry refinement and maturation of functional units underlying information storage at adulthood.

Extracellular recordings in vivo in the developing rat PFC and hippocampus Discontinuous oscillations differentially organize the neonatal prefrontal areas Hippocampal theta bursts drive neonatal prelimbic oscillations and firing Mutual interactions within prejuvenile prefrontal-hippocampal networks Brain processing during executive and mnemonic tasks relies on interactions within complex neuronal networks (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G.

Generally, information processing within local networks is globally integrated (Buzsáki, 2006Buzsáki G. Rhythms of the Brain. Oxford University Press, Oxford2006Crossref Scopus (3355) Google Scholar), yet the maturation and the underlying mechanisms of this efficient cortical computation are still poorly elucidated. The relevance of information integration between neuronal networks for higher cognitive abilities is exemplary illustrated in the case of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Hipp). The PFC is involved in gating of memory, attention, and decision making (Miller, 2000Miller E.K. The prefrontal cortex and cognitive control.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, Vertes, 2006Vertes R.P.

It receives strong monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from the CA1 area and subiculum of the Hipp (Swanson, 1981Swanson L.W.

Simultaneous recordings from the PFC and Hipp demonstrated that hippocampal theta oscillations modulate the firing of prefrontal neurons, thereby delivering the temporal coordination of both oscillating neuronal networks and enabling information transfer and storage (Siapas and Wilson, 1998Siapas A.G.

Consequently, the prefrontal-hippocampal oscillatory coactivation may provide the mechanisms for organizing and consolidating memory traces (Euston et al., 2007Euston D.R. Tatsuno M. McNaughton B.L.

However, the highly discontinuous and fragmented temporal organization of the activity patterns in immature networks remarkably differs from the adult one (Dreyfus-Brisac, 1962Dreyfus-Brisac C.

These bursts of activity alternating with “silent” interburst intervals have been characterized in primary sensory cortices (visual cortex, barrel cortex). In these areas they synchronize and integrate inter- and intracortical networks and seem to act as an early functional template of later emerging cortical topography (Hanganu et al., 2006Hanganu I.L.

Correlated bursts of activity have been identified also in the neonatal Hipp, where diverse patterns of activity (sharp waves, theta and gamma oscillations, ripples) start to emerge during the first postnatal week (Lahtinen et al., 2002Lahtinen H. Palva J.M. Sumanen S. Voipio J. Kaila K. Taira T. Postnatal development of rat hippocampal gamma rhythm in vivo.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3438-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these immature hippocampal patterns of activity are a prerequisite for the maturation of hippocampal circuitry (Mohns and Blumberg, 2008Mohns E.J. Blumberg M.S. Synchronous bursts of neuronal activity in the developing hippocampus: modulation by active sleep and association with emerging gamma and theta rhythms.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10134-10144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Despite recent significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of prefrontal-hippocampal coactivation that underlies information transfer and storage in the adult brain, key questions concerning the maturation of functional communication between these two areas and its anatomical substrate remain open. When and how do patterns of oscillatory activity start to synchronize the developing prefrontal networks? Anatomical studies revealed that the PFC reaches the adult cytoarchitecture and connectivity not before adolescence, corresponding to the delayed maturation of executive and mnemonic abilities when compared to sensory and motor skills (Van Eden and Uylings, 1985Van Eden C.G. Uylings H.B. Cytoarchitectonic development of the prefrontal cortex in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 241: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Is the emergence of coordinated patterns of activity in the PFC consequently delayed? Does the early emerging hippocampal activity contribute to the generation of prefrontal oscillations and how do the interactions between these two areas evolve during postnatal development to enable adequate information processing and storage at adulthood? To address these questions, we recorded unit activity and local field potentials from the PFC and Hipp in neonatal and prejuvenile rats in vivo. We characterize here for the first time the oscillatory coupling and the spike-timing relationships between the PFC and Hipp throughout early postnatal development. We examined the activity patterns in the medial PFC by performing extracellular recordings of the local field potential (FP) and multiple unit activity (MUA) in neonatal and prejuvenile (postnatal day [P] 0–14) urethane-anesthetized rats (n = 104 pups) in vivo (Figure 1; see Table S1 available online). In contrast to the rat primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices (Khazipov et al., 2004Khazipov R. Sirota A. Leinekugel X. Holmes G.L. Ben-Ari Y. Buzsáki G. Early motor activity drives spindle bursts in the developing somatosensory cortex.Nature. 2004; 432: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, Hanganu et al., 2006Hanganu I.L. Ben-Ari Y.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9011-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) expressing discontinuous patterns of oscillatory activity already at birth, the PFC develops such patterns starting with P3 and no coordinated activity was present in P0–2 pups (n = 11) (Figure S1). These initial intermittent spindle-shaped field oscillations (Figures 1B and Ci) showed similar properties with the previously described spindle bursts (SB) in the V1 and S1 of neonatal rats. When recorded from multiple recording sites covering the entire PFC, SB had a relative short duration (1.86 ± 0.02 s, n = 4717 bursts from 27 pups) and small amplitude (123.56 ± 1.19 μV). In contrast to the V1 and S1 activity, the prefrontal SB occurred rarely (1.11 ± 0.14 bursts/min) and their main frequency was slower, ranging within theta frequency band (7.8 ± 0.05 Hz). Starting with P5 short episodes (0.2 ± 0.003 s, n = 1951 events from 19 pups) of low gamma-band (37.08 ± 0.15 Hz) oscillations overlaid spindle-shaped oscillations with main frequency of 9.2 ± 0.11 Hz and large amplitudes (251.61 ± 2.82 μV). Due to the tight connection between the superimposed gamma oscillations and the slow theta-alpha bursts, we defined this pattern of prefrontal activity as nested gamma spindle bursts (NG) (Figures 1B, 1Cii, and 1Ciii). They occurred at a frequency of 0.67 ± 0.09 bursts/min, lasted 2.12 ± 0.03 s and were accompanied (Figure 1Ciii) or not (Figure 1Cii) by MUA. Although the main difference between SB and NG was the presence of superimposed gamma episodes, the two patterns of prefrontal activity have also distinct properties (Figure S2). Similar to early urethane-independent oscillations in the primary sensory cortices prefrontal SB and NG were marginally modified by progressive reduction of the urethane dose from 1 to 0.125 g/kg body weight (n = 16 pups). Their occurrence and main frequency remained constant, whereas their amplitude decreased from 145 ± 7 μV to 107.7 ± 5.8 μV for SB and from 277.7 ± 10.1 μV to 160 ± 8 μV for NG. With ongoing maturation the properties of SB and NG modified significantly. Their occurrence, duration, amplitude, and dominant frequency gradually increased with age (Figure 1E). Around P10–11 the PFC switched from discontinuous SB and NG to continuous oscillatory rhythms (Figures 1D and S4), suggesting that the neuronal networks generating oscillatory patterns underwent a substantial process of reorganization. The continuous rhythm with main frequency in theta-band (6.11 ± 0.03 Hz, n = 19 pups) and amplitudes ranging from 56 to 544 μV expressed superimposed short episodes of gamma activity (Figure 1D). The amplitude and the dominant frequency of continuous oscillatory activity in the PFC were relatively stable during the second postnatal week (Figure 1E). These results indicate that corresponding to the previously reported delayed anatomical maturation of the PFC, network activity emerges here later than in the V1 or S1 of age-matched rat pups. The presence of discontinuous and later of continuous theta-gamma rhythms mirrors early complex intra- and intercortical interactions. To gain a first insight into the network interactions leading to the generation of oscillatory patterns in the neonatal PFC we analyzed the relationship between neuronal discharge and SB/NG (Figure 2A ). The mean firing rate during the whole recording was very low (0.67 ± 0.11 Hz, n = 7 pups), MUA predominantly accompanying the prefrontal oscillations. Only a low fraction of oscillation-associated spikes (15.7% ± 2.1%, n = 2479 spikes from 6 pups) was organized in bursts. When calculating separately the firing rate for SB and NG, a significantly (p < 0.001) higher spike discharge was associated with NG (14.77 ± 1 Hz, n = 7 pups) than with SB (3.5 ± 0.42 Hz, n = 7 pups) and was mainly confined to their gamma episodes (42.29 ± 1.83 Hz) (Figure 2B). However, the majority (77% ± 17%) of nested gamma episodes were not associated with MUA discharge (Figure 1Cii versus 1Ciii). When occurring together, gamma episodes and MUA were tightly coupled and a prominent peak in their cross-correlogram emerged 30 to 50 ms after the onset of gamma episodes (Figure 2C). The prominent increase in the firing rate during gamma episodes was preceded by an ∼50 ms long period of low MUA, during which the occurrence probability of gamma episodes was also very low. Examination of spike-gamma phase relationship showed that 12 out of 13 prefrontal neurons (n = 10 pups) fired shortly after the trough of gamma cycle (Figure 2D). This gamma phase-locking of prefrontal neurons suggests that the gamma episodes time the firing of the neonatal PFC. Moreover, the entrainment of local networks in gamma rhythms occurred not randomly, but timed by the underlying slow rhythm of NG (NG cycle). The gamma episodes occur with the highest probability shortly before the trough of the NG cycle (Figure 2E). These results indicate that complex mechanisms control the neuronal firing in the neonatal PFC. The prefrontal neurons fire phase-locked to the nested gamma episodes that are, in turn, clocked by the underlying slow rhythm of NG. According to their location and cytoarchitecture several subareas can be functionally distinguished within the PFC as early as P6 (Van Eden and Uylings, 1985Van Eden C.G. Uylings H.B. Cytoarchitectonic development of the prefrontal cortex in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 241: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Multielectrode recordings were performed simultaneously in the dorsally located anterior cingulate cortex (Cg) as well as in the subjacent prelimbic cortex (PL) to characterize the spatial organization of the network activity over the developing PFC. Although SB and NG were present in both regions, their occurrence significantly differed between the Cg and PL (Figure 3A ; Table S2). In the Cg, SB represented the dominant pattern of activity, very few NG being present in this area. In contrast, NG are the dominant pattern of prelimbic activity. Moreover, the duration, main frequency, power, and frequency distribution of SB as well as the amplitude and power of NG showed significant differences in the Cg and PL (Table S2). Beside different properties, SB and NG showed also distinct current generators over the Cg and PL as indicated by the current source density (CSD) analysis performed on 38 SB and 69 NG from 5 pups (Figure 3B). The most common CSD profile for SB present in 43.05% ± 11.7% of events was a narrow source-sink pair confined to the upper cingulate area. In contrast, the majority of NG (72.03% ± 7.34%) showed a prominent sink within the PL. In the majority of recordings, neither SB nor NG were restricted to one channel but rather occurred simultaneously at several neighboring recording sites of the 4x4 array electrode (Figures 3C and 3D). To estimate the spatial organization of SB and NG over the Cg and PL, the cross-correlation and coherence at dominant frequency were assessed for all recording sites in relationship to one reference channel (n = 9 pups) (Figure 3C). The majority of cingulate SB appeared widely synchronized, whereas the relative low occurrence of NG precluded a consistent analysis of their coupling over the Cg. In the PL, most of SB (720 out of 1200) were also widely synchronized, while the majority of prelimbic NG (768 out of 1472) synchronized the upper layers and the cortical plate (CP) (Figure 3D). The distinct spatial organization, current generators, and synchronization patterns of SB and NG argue for different oscillatory entrainment of cingulate and prelimbic networks during neonatal development. This distinction persisted also at prejuvenile age, since the amplitude and main frequency of continuous theta-gamma rhythms in P10–14 rats (n = 19) differed significantly between the Cg and PL. Moreover, the power of superimposed gamma episodes was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the PL (2737 ± 109 μV2/Hz, n = 19 pups) than in the Cg (2646 ± 110 μV2/Hz). The distinct properties of discontinuous versus continuous prefrontal oscillations suggest that the networks entrained for their generation are subject of intense refinement and reorganization during postnatal development. In the light of the recently demonstrated function of hippocampal theta to temporally coordinate the prefrontal activity at adulthood (Siapas et al., 2005Siapas A.G. Lubenov E.V. Wilson M.A. Prefrontal phase locking to hippocampal theta oscillations.Neuron. 2005; 46: 141-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, Sirota et al., 2008Sirota A.

Entrainment of neocortical neurons and gamma oscillations by the hippocampal theta rhythm.Neuron. 2008; 60: 683-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) the question arises, when during development the hippocampal control over the PFC emerges. The premise for addressing this question was to characterize in neonatal and prejuvenile rats (n = 33) the activity of the CA1 area of the intermediate Hipp, which at adulthood is known to densely project to the PFC (Hoover and Vertes, 2007Hoover W.B. Vertes R.P. Anatomical analysis of afferent projections to the medial prefrontal cortex in the rat.Brain Struct. Funct. 2007; 212: 149-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Already at birth prominent sharp-waves (SPWs) (Table S3; Figure S3A), which reversed across the pyramidal layer (Str pyr) and were accompanied by strong MUA discharge (13.07 ± 3.51 Hz, n = 10 pups), were present in the CA1 area. From P1 on, discontinuous oscillations with main frequency in theta band (7.03 ± 0.15 Hz, n = 398 events from 15 pups) were additionally present (Table S3; Figure S3B). They represent the dominant pattern of slow oscillatory activity in the neonatal Hipp. Since their mechanisms of generation are still unknown and might differ from those of the adult theta rhythms, we defined these events as hippocampal theta bursts. About one-third of the theta bursts (136 out of 398 events) were accompanied by SPWs. Their duration and maximal amplitude were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than of the theta bursts without superimposed SPWs (Table S3). As previously reported (Palva et al., 2000Palva J.M. Lamsa K. Lauri S.E. Rauvala H. Kaila K. Taira T. Fast network oscillations in the newborn rat hippocampus in vitro.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1170-1178PubMed Google Scholar, Lahtinen et al., 2002Lahtinen H.

Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 1469-1474PubMed Google Scholar), gamma oscillations and ripples developed toward the end of the first postnatal week and appeared superimposed on theta bursts and SPWs, respectively. The gamma episodes appeared almost exclusively confined to the theta bursts (Figure S3Bii) and very few of them (16.35%, n = 104 events) were theta independent. In contrast to the prefrontal NG, the phase coupling between hippocampal theta and gamma is absent at this age (Figure S3Bii). As for the adult Hipp (Buzsáki et al., 1992Buzsáki G. Horváth Z.

Similar to neocortical areas, hippocampal activity switched from discontinuous bursts to continuous theta rhythms during early postnatal development (n = 6 pups) (Figure S3D; Table S3). However, this transition occurred 1–2 days earlier in the Hipp than in the PFC (Figure S4) and may reflect the differences in the maturation of cytoarchitecture and connectivity (Angevine, 1975Angevine J.B. Development of the hippocampal formation.in: Isaacson R.L. Pribram K.H. The hippocampus. Plenum Press, New York1975: 61-90Crossref Google Scholar). Several approaches were used to characterize the interactions between prefrontal and hippocampal activity during the first two postnatal weeks. First, we examined the temporal correspondence of discontinuous oscillations across the PFC and CA1 area of the intermediate Hipp in simultaneous recordings from both areas. The majority of hippocampal theta bursts occurred within a narrow time window (<3 s) with SB or NG in the Cg (87.7%, n = 203 events from 6 pups) or PL (93.6%, n = 296 events from 9 pups) (Figure 4A ), their onset either preceding (Cg: 20.7% of events, delay 0.5 ± 0.006 s, PL: 13.9% of events, delay 1 ± 0.14 s), succeeding (Cg: 3.9% of events, delay 0.14 ± 0.05 s, PL: 3.4% of events, delay 0.63 ± 0.24 s) or matching (Cg: 63.1% of events, PL: 73.4% of events) the onset of prefrontal events. Second, the temporal synchrony between hippocampal and prefrontal activity was assessed by spectral coherence analysis (Figures 4B and S5A). Due to the predominance of distinct activity patterns with different spatial organization in the Cg and PL, we separately analyzed the cingulate-hippocampal and the prelimbic-hippocampal synchronization. Coherence coefficients for simultaneously occurring oscillations in the Cg and Hipp (0.52 ± 0.02, n = 59 events from 6 pups) as well as in the PL and Hipp (0.53 ± 0.02, n = 90 events from 9 pups) were relatively high. To decide whether the strong prefrontal-hippocampal coupling was restricted to simultaneously occurring oscillatory events, the coherence analysis was performed also for oscillations at shuffled time windows. The resulting coherence coefficients (Cg: 0.39 ± 0.02, n = 59 events from 6 pups, PL: 0.47 ± 0.002, n = 90 events from 9 pups) were significantly lower than for original time windows of oscillatory activity. To verify that this high level of coherence was a genuine feature of the prefrontal-hippocampal interactions, we additionally assessed the synchronization between the Hipp and V1 as well as between different neocortical areas. The level of coherence for oscillatory events in the CA1 area and V1 was significantly (p < 0.01) lower (0.37 ± 0.02, n = 48 events from 3 pups) than for the prefrontal-hippocampal interactions (Figure S5B). Different levels of synchronization were observed over distinct neocortical areas. While the oscillations recorded at two adjacent sites in the PFC showed very high coherence coefficients (Cg: 0.98 ± 0.002, n = 59 events from 6 rats; PL: 0.96 ± 0.004, n = 90 from 9 pups) (Figures 4B and S5A), the prefrontal activity was not synchronized with the SB in the V1 or S1, since the calculated coherence coefficients were significantly (p < 0.001) smaller (Figure S5B). Therefore, nonspecific synchrony does not contribute to the prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization. A second artifactual source of high coherence between field oscillations of two areas may represent the conduction synchrony (Lachaux et al., 1999Lachaux J.P. Rodriguez E. Martinerie J. Varela F.J. Measuring phase synchrony in brain signals.Hum. Brain Mapp. 1999; 8: 194-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Its contribution seems, however, to be very limited, since the coherence between prefrontal FP and hippocampal spikes, a measure of “true synchrony” due to neural coupling (Soteropoulos and Baker, 2006Soteropoulos D.S. Baker S.N. Corticocerebellar coherence during a precision grip task in the monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 1194-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than for shuffled data. To investigate the dynamics of hippocampal-prefrontal coupling by oscillatory rhythms, we performed sliding window cross-correlation analysis of prefrontal SB/NG and hippocampal theta bursts (Figures 4Ci and S5Ci). The first peak of individual cross-correlation (∼0 s lag) fluctuated systematically and periodically for both Cg-Hipp and PL-Hipp oscillations as sign of transient coupling and decoupling of the prefrontal and hippocampal regions. Remarkably, the coupling of the PL and Hipp in oscillatory bursts seems to be more stable than the coupling between the Cg and Hipp, since constantly high prefrontal-hippocampal cross-correlation during the entire burst was calculated for 25.2% of the prelimbic oscillations, but for only 9.5% of the cingulate bursts. The synchronization of oscillatory rhythms in the PFC and Hipp persisted with ongoing maturation. Toward the end of the second postnatal week, the coherence coefficients calculated for continuous oscillatory discharge Cg-CA1 and PL-CA1 were similar to the values detected for discontinuous oscillations one week before (Cg: coherence 0.48 ± 0.02, n = 60 events from 6 pups; PL: coherence 0.46 ± 0.02, n = 70 events from 7 pups) (Figures 4B and S5A). However, the dynamics of prefrontal-hippocampal synchronization changed with age and only short lasting (∼0.5 s) coupling followed by decoupling dominated the interactions between the Cg or PL and Hipp (Figures 4Cii and S5Cii). Taken together, these results indicate that the prefrontal and hippocampal networks are coactivated in discontinuous or continuous oscillatory rhythms throughout early postnatal development. Due to the symmetric interdependence of cross-correlation and coherence, they do not offer reliable insights into the direction of information flow between two brain areas. Therefore, the demonstrated temporary oscillatory coupling of the PL with the Hipp and to a lower extent of the Cg with the Hipp is a relationship missing directionality. To estimate the causal strength of prefrontal-hippocampal interactions and its dynamics during development, Granger causality analysis, a powerful method for studying directed interactions between brain areas (Ding et al., 2000Ding M.

To understand its neural basis, we simultaneously recorded from multiple electrodes in lateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, two interconnected brain structures critical for learning. Each day, monkeys learned to associate novel abstract, dot-based categories with a right versus left saccade. Early on, when they could acquire specific stimulus-response associations, striatum activity was an earlier predictor of the corresponding saccade. However, as the number of exemplars increased and monkeys had to learn to classify them, PFC activity began to predict the saccade associated with each category before the striatum. While monkeys were categorizing novel exemplars at a high rate, PFC activity was a strong predictor of their corresponding saccade early in the trial before the striatal neurons. These results suggest that striatum plays a greater role in stimulus-response association and PFC in abstraction of categories."

Strength through diversity.Neuron. 2008; 60: 477-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent processes are clearly associated with synaptic scaling and long-term changes in synaptic strength that enhance or suppress the ability of particular synaptic inputs to trigger postsynaptic APs, with many of these mechanisms (such as LTP and LTD) underlying learning and memory (Morris et al., 2003Morris R.G.

Neuronal excitability is determined by the expression, location, and activity of voltage-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane. Na+ and Ca2+ channels dominate AP generation, but the crucial regulators of excitability are voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels. There are over 40 α subunit K+ channel genes (Coetzee et al., 1999Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A.

A native channel requires four α subunits (usually from within the same family) with heterogeneity providing a spectrum of channel kinetics. They set resting membrane potentials, neuronal excitability, AP waveform, firing threshold, and firing rates. Here, we focus on two broadly expressed families: Kv2 (Du et al., 2000Du J. Haak L.L.

Physiol. 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (14532) Google Scholar) throughout the nervous system. Both Kv2 and Kv3 are “high voltage-activated channels (HVAs),” requiring depolarization to the relatively positive voltages achieved during an AP, with half-activation voltages around 0 mV (±20 mV, dependent on subunit composition, accessory subunits, and phosphorylation). Kv2 channels have a broader activation range and slower kinetics than Kv3, so that Kv2 starts to activate close to AP threshold and is slower to deactivate (and slower to inactivate). The subcellular localization of Kv2 and Kv3 channels differs substantially; Kv2 channels are often clustered or “corralled” (Misonou et al., 2004Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D.

Kv3.1 channels can be found in postsynaptic soma and AIS and are sometimes located at nodes of Ranvier (Devaux et al., 2003Devaux J. Alcaraz G. Grinspan J. Bennett V. Joho R. Crest M. Scherer S.S.

Nitric oxide (NO) is associated with signaling across many physiological systems, including cardiovascular, immune, and enteric and central nervous systems, and related to disease and pathological states (Garthwaite, 2008Garthwaite J.

Recent evidence from the auditory brain stem demonstrates that Kv3.1 channels are a target for cGMP/NO-signaling pathways following synaptic activity (Steinert et al., 2008Steinert J.R.

Developmental expression of potassium-channel subunit Kv3.2 within subpopulations of mouse hippocampal inhibitory interneurons.Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study nitrergic signaling was activated by sustained excitatory synaptic activity (10 Hz) for around 1 hr, modulating excitability of principal neurons in the MNTB and CA3 pyramidal neurons by suppression of Kv3 conductances and dramatic enhancement of Kv2 currents. This switched the drive for AP repolarization to Kv2 channels, raising firing threshold and altering AP responses in both brain regions. The nitrergic facilitation of Kv2 implies that this conductance is more dominant in vivo than previously suspected because recording within minutes of animal sacrifice shows vastly enhanced Kv2 currents. Throughout this study, we used whole-cell patch recording in an unpaired fashion: control data were recorded from one population of neurons, then conditioning stimulation was applied to the synaptic pathways, followed by test recordings from another population of neurons; this avoided dialysis inherent in long-term recording from the same neuron. The objective was to test if sustained excitatory synaptic input to a target neuron changed its intrinsic excitability. This is distinct from short-term depression of synaptic responses observed following short periods of conditioning spontaneous activity (Hennig et al., 2008Hennig M.H. Postlethwaite M. Forsythe I.D.

The conditioning synaptic stimulation lasted 1 hr and consisted of evoked EPSPs at a mean frequency of 10 Hz (with interstimulus intervals [ISIs] generated by a Poisson process, giving a total of 34,875 stimuli/1 hr). We stimulated the trapezoid body calyceal projection to the MNTB or mossy fiber/commissural projections (which were DCG-IV insensitive; see Figure S1C available online) to CA3 pyramidal neurons. Stimulation at 10 Hz induces neither LTP nor LTD (Dudek and Bear, 1992Dudek S.M. Bear M.F.

Excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory hippocampal synapses work synergistically as an adaptive filter of natural spike trains.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e207Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In naive slices under current clamp recording, evoked EPSP trains at moderate frequencies securely triggered APs in principal neurons of the MNTB (<400 Hz). The illustrated example in Figure 1 shows single AP responses to each presynaptic stimulus at a frequency of 100 Hz (Figure 1A, Naive, upper black). But transmission failure occurred rapidly at 800 Hz or above (Figure 1A, Naive, lower black), consistent with previous reports (Taschenberger and von Gersdorff, 2000Taschenberger H. von Gersdorff H. Fine-tuning an auditory synapse for speed and fidelity: developmental changes in presynaptic waveform, EPSC kinetics, and synaptic plasticity.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9162-9173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After synaptic conditioning (post-conditioning, PC: 1 hr stimuli), the response of MNTB neurons to moderate frequency stimuli was robust and unchanged (Figure 1A, upper red trace; 100 Hz, PC), but high-frequency stimuli now triggered APs with greater reliability (Figure 1A, PC, lower red trace; 800 Hz). The conditioning reduced evoked synaptic currents (Figure S1B), consistent with nitrergic suppression of AMPARs reported previously (Steinert et al., 2008Steinert J.R. Kopp-Scheinpflug C. Baker C. Challiss R.A. Mistry R. Haustein M.D. Griffin S.J. Tong H. Graham B.P. Forsythe I.D. Nitric oxide is a volume transmitter regulating postsynaptic excitability at a glutamatergic synapse.Neuron. 2008; 60: 642-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Comparison of the mean output (MNTB APs) to input (at 100, 800, or 1000 Hz) for naive (Figure 1B, black bars) and PC slices (red bars) showed increased reliability of transmission for high-frequency stimulation after conditioning. The synaptic conditioning also increased AP threshold (Figure 1C), consistent with reduced postsynaptic excitability. AMPAR and NMDAR antagonists (50 μM AP-5, 10 μM MK801, 10 μM CNQX applied for the 1 hr conditioning period) blocked these changes, whereas perfusion of NO donors (NO: sodium nitroprusside, SNP or PapaNONOate, each 100 μM for 1 hr) mimicked the threshold increase (Figure 1D). Analogous changes in excitability also occurred in the hippocampus, where naive CA3 pyramidal neurons (CA3 neurons) responded with AP bursts to stimulation of the mossy fiber/commissural synaptic inputs (Brown and Randall, 2009Brown J.T. Randall A.D. Activity-dependent depression of the spike after-depolarization generates long-lasting intrinsic plasticity in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 1265-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) across the range of 10–50 Hz (Shao and Dudek, 2009Shao L.R. Dudek F.E. Both synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms underlie the different properties of population bursts in the hippocampal CA3 area of immature versus adult rats.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 5907-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A , Naive, black). The same conditioning paradigm reduced CA3 neuron excitability so that each EPSP triggered a maximum of one AP (Figure 2A, PC, red), and output/input ratios became close to 1:1 (Figure 2B). The conditioning induced no change in evoked synaptic currents (Figure S1C), demonstrating that this 10 Hz stimulation paradigm did not significantly influence synaptic strength (Dudek and Bear, 1992Dudek S.M. Bear M.F. Homosynaptic long-term depression in area CA1 of hippocampus and effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The postsynaptic locus of this excitability change was again confirmed by testing excitability with injection of current steps: naive CA3 neurons fired multiple APs, increasing in numbers proportionally with depolarizing current injection (Figure 2C, Naive, black), but following synaptic conditioning, the current threshold for AP generation was raised (Figure 2C, PC, red) from 100 to over 300 pA. The PC-induced threshold rise was blocked by NMDAR antagonists (50 μM AP-5, 10 μM MK801 applied for the 1 hr conditioning) and mimicked by perfusion of NO donors (Figure 2D), consistent with a nitrergic decrease in excitability. These results gave two general insights into the control of neuronal excitability: glutamatergic synaptic activity reduced excitability of the target neurons in the MNTB and CA3, and this was mediated by NO signaling. We next explored the mechanism of this postsynaptic excitability change using whole-cell voltage clamp. Under voltage clamp, MNTB neurons exhibited a mean outward current of 23 ± 1 nA at +50 mV (Figure 3A , Ctrl, n = 10), of which one-third was blocked by the Kv3 antagonist TEA (1 mM), confirming Kv3 contribution (Figure 3A, TEA, n = 7) and consistent with previous reports (Macica and Kaczmarek, 2001Macica C.M. Kaczmarek L.K. Casein kinase 2 determines the voltage dependence of the Kv3.1 channel in auditory neurons and transfected cells.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following synaptic conditioning, the outward current increased to 59 ± 4 nA (Figure 3B, PC, n = 17; p < 0.0001, unpaired data). This large increase in conductance was blocked by antagonism of both NMDARs and AMPARs during the conditioning period (Figure 3B, PC+AP5/MK+CNQX, n = 6). Likewise, voltage clamp of CA3 neurons showed control outward currents of 21 ± 2 nA (Figure 3E, n = 10, at +50 mV) that increased to 38 ± 2 nA after conditioning (Figure 3F, n = 6; p = 0.0005, unpaired data). NMDAR inhibition during conditioning also blocked the K+ current potentiation in the CA3 neurons (Figure 3F, n = 6). In both the MNTB and CA3 neurons, inhibition of nNOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI, 10 μM) during conditioning also blocked the K+ current potentiation (Figures 3C and 3G). Under control naive conditions, CA3 HVA currents of 21 ± 2 nA were sensitive to 1 mM TEA (Figure 3E, 12 ± 1 nA, 43% reduction at +50 mV). Iberiotoxin (Ibtx; 100 nM) block of BK channels caused only minor suppression of whole-cell currents (Figure 3E, 18 ± 1 nA, 14% reduction at +50 mV), whereas subsequent application of 1 mM TEA substantially reduced outward currents to 11 ± 1 nA (not shown, n = 5), consistent with Kv3 contributing approximately 29% of total outward current.

NMDA receptors are obligate heteromers formed by coassembly of two or three divergent gene families. While some AMPA and kainate receptors can form functional homomeric ion channels, the KA1 and KA2 subunits are obligate heteromers which function only in combination with GluR5–7. The mechanisms controlling glutamate receptor assembly involve an initial step in which the amino terminal domains (ATD) assemble as dimers. Here, we establish by sedimentation velocity that the ATDs of GluR6 and KA2 coassemble as a heterodimer of Kd 11 nM, 32,000-fold lower than the Kd for homodimer formation by KA2; we solve crystal structures for the GluR6/KA2 ATD heterodimer and heterotetramer assemblies. Using these structures as a guide, we perform a mutant cycle analysis to probe the energetics of assembly and show that high-affinity ATD interactions are required for biosynthesis of functional heteromeric receptors.

Control of glutamate receptor assembly by selective formation of ATD heterodimers Ultrahigh affinity for ATD heterodimer generates an extremely stable assembly Crystal structures of heteromeric kainate receptor tetramers Widely distributed contacts on both lobes of the ATD mediate heteromer assembly During biogenesis most ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors undergo regulated assembly prior to insertion into the plasma membrane. In prokaryotes many ion channels function as homo-oligomers, which for individual subtypes range in size from dimers to hexamers, while in eukaryotes, as a consequence of gene duplication, appropriate members of a diverse subunit pool must be selected to form hetero-oligomeric assemblies of restricted stoichiometry and composition. The glutamate receptor ion channels (iGluRs) which mediate excitatory synaptic transmission are important examples of the biological diversity which arose from gene duplication, and these receptors play key roles in brain development, synaptic plasticity, motor function, information processing, and memory formation. In mammals, the diverse functional roles of iGluRs are mediated by a family of 18 genes, several of which undergo alternative splicing and mRNA editing (Traynelis et al., 2010Traynelis S.F. Wollmuth L.P. McBain C.J. Menniti F.S. Vance K.M. Ogden K.K. Hansen K.B. Yuan H. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Glutamate receptor ion channels: structure, regulation, and function.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 405-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). Genetic, biochemical, and functional studies have established that individual iGluR subunits will coassemble with members of the same functional family, but not with other subtypes, to generate the large and diverse receptor population required for normal brain activity (Ayalon et al., 2005Ayalon G.

A fundamental problem in biology is to understand the mechanisms controlling this selective assembly. The major families of iGluRs were identified by classical pre-genetic techniques, using selective ligands and functional assays, leading to identification of AMPA, kainate and NMDA receptor subtypes (Watkins and Evans, 1981Watkins J.C. Evans R.H. Excitatory amino acid transmitters.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1981; 21: 165-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). For kainate and NMDA receptors, the native receptor assemblies in vivo contain subunits encoded by two or three different gene families, several of which do not generate functional ion channels when expressed as homomeric proteins. For example, GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 (also called GluK1, GluK2, and GluK3) can form functional homomeric ion channels in heterologous expression systems (Egebjerg et al., 1991Egebjerg J. Bettler B.

For NMDA receptors, the principles are similar, with the GluN1subunit, which encodes the binding site for glycine or D-serine, forming obligate heteromeric assemblies with GluN2 subunits which bind glutamate (Furukawa et al., 2005Furukawa H.

By contrast, AMPA receptors are formed by coassembly of the GluA1–GluA4 subunits, each of which can form functional homomeric receptors (Hollmann et al., 1989Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A.

However, the mechanisms which control the assembly of heteromeric glutamate receptors assembled from two or three different gene families are largely unknown but likely to involve multiple stages of regulation before transport comes into play. In particular, dimer assembly by the 380 residue amino terminal domain, which emerges from the ribosome before the ligand binding domain and its associated membrane embedded ion channel segments plays a key role in determining how subunits coassemble during the early stages of biogenesis. Recent studies on AMPA and NMDA receptors provide compelling evidence for such a role and highlight the complex mechanisms regulating iGluR assembly (Farina et al., 2011Farina A.N. Blain K.Y. Maruo T. Kwiatkowski W. Choe S. Nakagawa T. Separation of domain contacts is required for heterotetrameric assembly of functional NMDA receptors.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2728-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the role of the ATD in assembly of heteromeric kainate receptors assembled from the GluR6 and KA2 subunits, which form the most abundant kainate receptor subtype in the brain (Petralia et al., 1994Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J. Histological and ultrastructural localization of the kainate receptor subunits, KA2 and GluR6/7, in the rat nervous system using selective antipeptide antibodies.J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 349: 85-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We address the issue of whether there exists a unique assembly pattern; define the mechanisms which underlie its formation and which exclude alternative assemblies; and probe the energetics of assembly for heteromeric glutamate receptors. Glutamate receptor ion channels are tetrameric assemblies in which both the ATD and ligand binding domains assemble as a dimer of dimers (Sobolevsky et al., 2009Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. X-ray structure, symmetry and mechanism of an AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor.Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Because the iGluR ATD dimer of dimers assembly lacks 4-fold rotational symmetry, a receptor generated by coassembly of GluR6 and KA2 subunits could be formed by pairs of homodimers or pairs of heterodimers, and in the latter case, the dimer of dimers interface could be formed by either the GluR6 or KA2 subunits (Figure 1A ). To address the issue of whether the initial assembly is formed by homodimers or heterodimers, we used analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled with refractive index and multiangle light scattering detectors (SEC-UV/RI/MALS), combined with analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), to measure interactions between the GluR6 and KA2 subunit ATDs; we then solved crystal structures of the dimeric and tetrameric ATD assemblies; performed a mutant cycle analysis of intersubunit contacts in the dimer assemblies; we used chemical cross linking to establish the assembly pattern in full length receptors; and determined that high-affinity interactions between the GluR6 and KA2 ATDs are necessary for biosynthesis of heteromeric kainate receptors in vivo. We expressed the GluR6 and KA2 ATDs as soluble glycoproteins in HEK293 cells and purified them to homogeneity by affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. Analytical size exclusion chromatography revealed a broad and asymmetric elution profile for the GluR6 ATD at physiological pH, with a peak mass of 192 kDa that we initially interpreted as resulting from a monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium (see Figure S1A available online). However, sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments at loading concentrations of 2–33 μM revealed a reversible, concentration dependent formation of much larger oligomeric species (Figure S1B). In prior work, we found that this behavior was suppressed at pH 5 (Kumar et al., 2009Kumar J. Schuck P. Jin R. Mayer M.L. The N-terminal domain of GluR6-subtype glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which was an acceptable compromise for our initial structural studies on iGluR ATDs, but inappropriate for an analysis of assembly mechanisms, since the pH in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus is close to neutral. In order to circumvent GluR6 aggregation at physiological pH, we resorted to protein engineering, capitalizing on prior structural knowledge of iGluR ATD assembly (Clayton et al., 2009Clayton A. Siebold C. Gilbert R.J. Sutton G.C. Harlos K. McIlhinney R.A. Jones E.Y. Aricescu A.R.

Mayer M.L. The N-terminal domain of GluR6-subtype glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ATDs of iGluRs have a clam-shell-like structure for which the upper and lower lobes have been named domain R1 and R2 (Karakas et al., 2009Karakas E. Simorowski N. Furukawa H. Structure of the zinc-bound amino-terminal domain of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3910-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Kumar et al., 2009Kumar J. Schuck P. Jin R. Mayer M.L. The N-terminal domain of GluR6-subtype glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In prior work, we noted that in GluR6 ATD crystal structures the dimer assemblies pack via the lateral edges of domain R2 to generate spiral arrays of tetramers (Figure S1C), suggesting a possible mechanism involving domain R2 in the aggregation observed in SV experiments (Figure S1D). An N-linked glycan introduced into this interface would be expected to abolish aggregation of the GluR6 ATD in solution (Figure S1E), without interfering with dimer assembly. We verified this by making two glycan wedge mutants, GluR6Δ1 (A213N/G215S) and GluR6Δ2 (G215N/M217T), both of which showed chromatographic and sedimentation behavior consistent with formation of high affinity homodimers in the complete absence of higher MW species (Figures 1B, S2A, and 3C. The X-ray crystal structure of the GluR6Δ1 mutant revealed an essentially identical dimer assembly as found for wild-type GluR6 (RMSD 0.53 Å for 649 Cα atoms), but packed in a different space group with the glycan wedge facing solvent channels in the crystal lattice (Figure S1F). Although insertion of a glycan at the ATD dimer of dimers interface would likely disrupt assembly of an intact GluR6 tetramer, this modification allowed us to quantitatively analyze GluR6 ATD dimer assembly in isolation of higher order oligomers. For the KA2 ATD, SEC-UV/RI/MALS analysis revealed essentially monomeric behavior at a loading concentration of 2.0 mg/ml in striking contrast to dimer formation for the GluR6 ATD (Figure 1B). Notably, when approximately equal concentrations of the GluR6Δ1 or GluR6Δ2 ATDs were mixed with the KA2 ATD at a 1:1 ratio prior to injection, the amplitude of the monomer peak decreased by 77% while that for the dimer increased by 71%, indicating preferential formation of GluR6/KA2 heterodimers (Figures 1C and S2B). Because the GluR6Δ1 and GluR6Δ2 glycan wedge mutants had indistinguishable behavior assayed by SEC-UV/RI/MALS, in the majority of subsequent biochemical experiments we used GluR6Δ2, while for crystallization of heteromeric assemblies we continued to work with GluR6Δ1. For mixtures of self associating systems with components of similar molecular weight, like the GluR6 and KA2 ATDs, measurement of the Kds for monomer, dimer, and tetramer equilibria by sedimentation analysis is technically challenging. The present study was greatly facilitated by the large difference in Kd for self-association of the GluR6 and KA2 ATDs, and, as shown later, by mutants which preferentially disrupt homodimer versus heterodimer assemblies. To quantify the strength of the association between the GluR6 and KA2 ATDs we carried out sedimentation equilibrium (SE) experiments in an analytical ultracentrifuge at 10°C using multiple protein concentrations and rotor speeds. Experiments were performed for GluR6Δ2, KA2, and an approximately equimolar mix of the two proteins. In each case, the data was best fit to a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium model (Figure 2A ). The GluR6Δ2 ATD formed homodimers with a Kd of 0.35 μM (95% confidence interval; 0.30 μM – 0.41 μM), compared to a Kd of 11 μM at pH 5 (Kumar et al., 2009Kumar J. Schuck P. Jin R. Mayer M.L. The N-terminal domain of GluR6-subtype glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicating that the ATD dimer assembly is a potential site of proton modulation. On the other hand, the KA2 ATD showed very weak association, with a best-fit binding constant of Kd 410 μM (95% confidence interval 380 μM–440 μM). The Kd for heterodimer formation was 0.076 μM (95% confidence interval; 0.02 μM–0.141 μM), with the heterodimer forming the major species when KA2 was in slight excess. Comparable Kd values of 0.25 μM (0.20–0.30 μM) for GluR6Δ2, 350 μM (380–650 μM) for KA2, and 0.011 μM (0.006–0.017 μM) for the heterodimer were obtained from sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments at 20°C, which in addition established the absence of any species of size larger than a dimer. The Kd value for GluR6Δ2/KA2 heterodimer formation from SV analysis is 32,000-fold lower than that for homodimer formation by KA2 and 23-fold lower than the Kd for homodimer formation by GluR6Δ2, establishing that the GluR6Δ2 and KA2 ATDs preferentially assemble as heterodimers. We also carried out SEC, SV, and SE analysis for a mixture of the wild-type GluR6 and KA2 ATDs at pH 7.4. The SEC elution profile shows a pronounced rightward shift compared to that obtained for GluR6 in the absence of KA2, but a left shift compared to the profile for GluR6Δ2 mixed with KA2 (Figure S3A). In the SV analysis, the c(s) distributions show a significantly extended reaction boundary compared to the GluR6Δ2 profile, consistent with a system in rapid equilibrium consisting of monomers, dimers, and higher-order oligomers, most likely tetramers (Figure S3B). Strikingly, there was no formation of larger complexes like that observed for wt GluR6 at a similar concentration (Figure S1B), suggesting that GluR6/KA2 heterodimer formation is competitive with the assembly-pathway for high-order GluR6 oligomers, and that the GluR6/KA2 heterodimer does not aggregate. With a small excess of the KA2 ATD, SE analysis for the wt GluR6/KA2 mixture could be well fit with a model for monomer-homodimer and monomer-heterodimer-heterotetramer equilibria, in which the monomer-homodimer and monomer-heterodimer Kds were constrained to values estimated in independent experiments, as described above; a global fit to nine data sets from multiple rotor speeds and loading concentrations gave an apparent Kd of 3.5 μM for tetramer formation by assembly of heterodimers (Figure S3C). A similar apparent Kd of 6.2 μM for tetramer formation was obtained from SV analysis. However, because the sedimentation mixture contains multiple species, including free GluR6, we cannot exclude other models in which the tetramer species is a mixture of both GluR6/KA2 tetramer assemblies and high order GluR6 oligomers. Thus, although the Kd for tetramer formation by kainate receptor ATDs remains uncertain, the interaction is several orders of magnitude weaker than for dimer formation. To define the molecular mechanisms controlling ATD assembly we solved crystal structures for both the GluR6Δ1/KA2 heterodimer (Figure 2B), and as a control the GluR6Δ1 homodimer (Figure S1F), both at 2.9 Å resolution (Table 1). The conformation and arrangement of subunits closely resembles that observed previously for wild-type GluR6 and GluR7 homodimers, with RMSDs of 1.55 Å (563 Cα atoms) and 0.53 Å (649 Cα atoms) for superposition on the wt GluR6 ATD dimer (PDB 3H6H). By contrast, there is a substantial difference in packing for the GluR6Δ1/KA2 heterodimer assembly compared to the KA2 ATD homodimer assembly solved previously, RMSD 3.56 Å for 428 Cα atoms (PDB 3OM0; Kumar and Mayer, 2010Kumar J. Mayer M.L. Crystal structures of the glutamate receptor ion channel GluK3 and GluK5 amino-terminal domains.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 404: 680-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The most substantial difference from the KA2 homodimer structure is due to a change in orientation in the upper lobes of the two protomers in the GluR6Δ1/KA2 heterodimer assembly (Figures 2B and 2C). After superposition using domain R2 coordinates, measurement of the angles between vectors drawn through alpha helix B and its dimer partner, gave values of 97° and 101° for the GluR6 homodimer and heterodimer assemblies, while for the KA2 homodimer assembly the angle increases to 123°, reflecting a large separation of the upper lobes (Figure 2C). Rotation by 90° parallel to the plane of quasi 2-fold symmetry between the subunits in the dimer assemblies reveals that in the KA2 homodimer assembly domain R2 has also rotated by 16° relative to the heterodimer assembly (Figure 2C). In combination, these movements bring the R1 domains of the GluR6 and KA2 subunits close together in the heterodimer assembly, and as a result the distance between the Cα positions of Ile90 in α-helix C, and Phe58 or Tyr 57 in α-helix B of GluR6 and KA2, respectively, decreases to 6.7 Å and 5.5 Å (Figure 3A ); this close apposition is similar to that found in homomeric dimer assemblies for the GluR6, GluR6Δ1, and GluR7 ATDs, for which the corresponding Cα positions are separated by 5.5, 5.8 and 5.6 Å, while for the KA2 homodimer assembly these residues are separated by 10.7 Å. In addition to this movement, analysis of the extent of domain closure indicates that the KA2 clam shell in the heterodimer is closed by 4.5°–7.5° compared to KA2 subunits in homodimer crystal structures, while the GluR6 subunit is closed by 4.2°–6.5° when compared to GluR6 homodimer structures. Solvent accessible surface analysis of the GluR6/KA2 heterodimer interface reveals a total buried area of 2953 Å2 with the KA2 protomer contributing 1496 Å2, a gain of 536 Å2 compared to the KA2 homodimer assembly (Figure 2D). For the GluR6 subunit, although there is little change in buried surface area in the homodimer and heterodimer assemblies, local rearrangements produce key changes in intersubunit contacts.Table 1Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsData SetGluR6Δ1GluR6Δ1/KA2GluR6wt/KA2Data CollectionSpace groupI4P212121C2Unit cell a, b, c (Å)191.8, 191.8, 47.065.6, 139.5, 195.4365.9, 109.0, 155.0Resolution range (Å) aValues in parenthesis indicate the low-resolution limit for the highest-resolution shell of data.50.00 – 2.98 (3.1)30.00 – 2.90 (3.0)50.00 – 3.95 (4.1)Observations65,539164,845719,425Unique reflections17,78340,23254,061Completeness (%) bValues in parenthesis indicate statistics for the highest-resolution shell of data.99.9 (99.4)99.1 (97.2)100 (100)RmergebValues in parenthesis indicate statistics for the highest-resolution shell of data., cRmerge = = (Σ| II − < II > |)/ΣI |II|, where < II > is the mean II over symmetry – equivalent reflections.0.078 (0.706)0.114 (0.450)0.139 (0.895)I/σ(I)bValues in parenthesis indicate statistics for the highest-resolution shell of data.16.0 (2.0)11.6 (2.9)18.6 (2.8)Structure RefinementResolution range (Å)47.95 – 2.9829.97 – 2.9049.0 – 3.95Reflections used16,77539,76150,913Protein / glycan atoms5,886 / 8411,771 / 22429,645 / 0Rwork / Rfree (%)24.2 / 29.319.7 / 25.626.4 / 28.0Rms DeviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0030.0060.005Bond angles (°)0.6080.9180.593a Values in parenthesis indicate the low-resolution limit for the highest-resolution shell of data.b Values in parenthesis indicate statistics for the highest-resolution shell of data.c Rmerge = = (Σ| II − < II > |)/ΣI |II|, where < II > is the mean II over symmetry – equivalent reflections. Open table in a new tab The R1 interface in both the GluR6/KA2 heterodimer and in the GluR6 homodimer is formed primarily by a close apposition of α helices B and C from each protomer. For both subunits, loop 3, which has been proposed to be a major determinant of subtype-specific assembly mediated by iGluR ATDs (Jin et al., 2009Jin R. Singh S.K. Gu S. Furukawa H. Sobolevsky A.I. Zhou J. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Crystal structure and association behaviour of the GluR2 amino-terminal domain.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1812-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), projects into the heterodimer interface and is anchored by intramolecular disulfide bonds between Cys65 or Cys64 on α-helix B, and Cys316 or Cys315, for GluR6 and KA2, respectively (Figures 3, S4A, and S4B). Of note, we observe novel intersubunit interactions in the heterodimer assembly, which are absent in GluR6 and KA2 homodimer structures, and which involve loop 3. Due to formation of a hydrogen bond between the KA2 Tyr57 OH group and the GluR6 main chain nitrogen of Asn317, the tip of loop 3 in the GluR6 subunit undergoes a conformational change in the heterodimer assembly (Figure 3A). This results in a 5Å movement of the Asn317 side chain, which dips down into the heterodimer interface and becomes trapped between the Asp61 and Tyr57 side chains near the base of α-helix B in the KA2 subunit. Due to replacement of Tyr57 by Phe58, in the GluR6 homodimer this hydrogen bond is absent. Additional interactions made by the KA2 protomer at the R1 interface, which are unique to the heterodimer structure, result from movement of α helices B and C toward the central axis of dimer formation, generating a series of contacts with the GluR6 protomer that are absent in KA2 homodimers. In particular, Tyr57 is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket formed by residue"

Both transport purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and are distinguished functionally by a difference in sensitivity to inhibition by nanomolar concentrations of nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR), hENT1 being NBMPR-sensitive. Previously, we used heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes to demonstrate that recombinant hENT2 and its rat ortholog rENT2 also transport purine and pyrimidine bases, h/rENT2 representing the first identified mammalian nucleobase transporter proteins (Yao, S. Y., Ng, A. M., Vickers, M. F., Sundaram, M., Cass, C. E., Baldwin, S. A., and Young, J. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24938-24948). The same study also revealed lower, but significant, transport of hypoxanthine by h/rENT1. In the present investigation, we have used the enhanced Xenopus oocyte expression vector pGEMHE to demonstrate that hENT1 additionally transports thymine and adenine and, to a lesser extent, uracil and guanine. Fluxes of hypoxanthine, thymine, and adenine by hENT1 were saturable and inhibited by NBMPR. Ratios of V(max) (pmol/oocyte · min(-1)):K(m) (mm), a measure of transport efficiency, were 86, 177, and 120 for hypoxantine, thymine, and adenine, respectively, compared with 265 for uridine. Hypoxanthine influx was competitively inhibited by uridine, indicating common or overlapping nucleobase and nucleoside permeant binding pockets, and the anticancer nucleobase drugs 5-fluorouracil and 6-mercaptopurine were also transported. Nucleobase transport activity was absent from an engineered cysteine-less version hENT1 (hENT1C-) in which all 10 endogenous cysteine residues were mutated to serine. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Cys-414 in transmembrane helix 10 of hENT1 as the residue conferring nucleobase transport activity to the wild-type transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1986709128,"LJM11, an abundant salivary protein from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, belongs to the insect ""yellow"" family of proteins. In this study, we immunized mice with 17 plasmids encoding L. longiplapis salivary proteins and demonstrated that LJM11 confers protective immunity against Leishmania major infection. This protection correlates with a strong induction of a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response following exposure to L. longipalpis saliva. Additionally, splenocytes of exposed mice produce IFN-γ upon stimulation with LJM11, demonstrating the systemic induction of Th1 immunity by this protein. In contrast to LJM11, LJM111, another yellow protein from L. longipalpis saliva, does not produce a DTH response in these mice, suggesting that structural or functional features specific to LJM11 are important for the induction of a robust DTH response. To examine these features, we used calorimetric analysis to probe a possible ligand binding function for the salivary yellow proteins. LJM11, LJM111, and LJM17 all acted as high affinity binders of prohemostatic and proinflammatory biogenic amines, particularly serotonin, catecholamines, and histamine. We also determined the crystal structure of LJM11, revealing a six-bladed β-propeller fold with a single ligand binding pocket located in the central part of the propeller structure on one face of the molecule. A hypothetical model of LJM11 suggests a positive electrostatic potential on the face containing entry to the ligand binding pocket, whereas LJM111 is negative to neutral over its entire surface. This may be the reason for differences in antigenicity between the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2117691468,"The pks genomic island of Escherichia coli encodes polyketide (PK) and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) synthases that allow assembly of a putative hybrid PK-NRP compound named colibactin that induces DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells. The pks-encoded machinery harbors an atypical essential protein, ClbP. ClbP crystal structure and mutagenesis experiments revealed a serine-active site and original structural features compatible with peptidase activity, which was detected by biochemical assays. Ten ClbP homologs were identified in silico in NRP genomic islands of closely and distantly related bacterial species. All tested ClbP homologs were able to complement a clbP-deficient E. coli mutant. ClbP is therefore a prototype of a new subfamily of extracytoplasmic peptidases probably involved in the maturation of NRP compounds. Such peptidases will be powerful tools for the manipulation of NRP biosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1975206065,"Defective coupling between sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria during control of intracellular Ca2+ signaling has been implicated in the progression of neuromuscular diseases. Our previous study showed that skeletal muscles derived from an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model displayed segmental loss of mitochondrial function that was coupled with elevated and uncontrolled sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release activity. The localized mitochondrial defect in the ALS muscle allows for examination of the mitochondrial contribution to Ca2+ removal during excitation-contraction coupling by comparing Ca2+ transients in regions with normal and defective mitochondria in the same muscle fiber. Here we show that Ca2+ transients elicited by membrane depolarization in fiber segments with defective mitochondria display an ∼10% increased amplitude. These regional differences in Ca2+ transients were abolished by the application of 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, a fast Ca2+ chelator that reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Using a mitochondria-targeted Ca2+ biosensor (mt11-YC3.6) expressed in ALS muscle fibers, we monitored the dynamic change of mitochondrial Ca2+ levels during voltage-induced Ca2+ release and detected a reduced Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria in the fiber segment with defective mitochondria, which mirrored the elevated Ca2+ transients in the cytosol. Our study constitutes a direct demonstration of the importance of mitochondria in shaping the cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in skeletal muscle during excitation-contraction coupling and establishes that malfunction of this mechanism may contribute to neuromuscular degeneration in ALS."

Molecular determinants of β-scorpion toxin (CssIV) binding and action on rat brain sodium channels are located in the S1-S2 (IIS1-S2) and S3-S4 (IIS3-S4) extracellular linkers of the voltage-sensing module in domain II. In IIS1-S2, mutations of two amino acid residues (Glu779 and Pro782) significantly altered the toxin effect by reducing binding affinity. In IIS3-S4, six positions surrounding the key binding determinant, Gly845, define a hot spot of high-impact residues. Two of these substitutions (A841N and L846A) reduced voltage sensor trapping. The other three substitutions (N842R, V843A, and E844N) increased voltage sensor trapping. These bidirectional effects suggest that the IIS3-S4 loop plays a primary role in determining both toxin affinity and efficacy.

Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3 Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). The pore-forming α subunit of eukaryotic Nav channels has four homologous domains (I-IV), with each domain containing six transmembrane segments, S1-S6 (2Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). The S1-S4 segments form the voltage-sensing module, whereas the S5 and S6 segments and the P loop between them form the pore module (2Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). The S4 segments, which contain 4–7 conserved positively charged arginine or lysine residues separated by 2 hydrophobic residues, have been postulated to be the voltage sensors of the channels (2Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). In response to depolarization, the S4 segments are thought to move outward across the cell membrane, and this movement exerts a force on the S4-S5 linker, pulls S5 segments away from each other, and bends the S6 segment to open the pore (3Yarov-Yarovoy V.

However, a strong priming depolarizing prepulse is required for the toxin to have its functional effect (8Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). According to the model, the toxin binds to its receptor site in the extracellular loops connecting transmembrane segments S1-S2 and S3-S4 in homologous domain II (IIS1-S2 and IIS3-S4) in the resting state of the voltage sensor in a concentration-dependent, bimolecular reaction to form the initial toxin-channel complex. Upon strong depolarization, the IIS4 segment moves outward and rotates, and the toxin binds to newly accessible amino acid residues on the IIS1-S2 and IIS3-S4 loops and the extracellular end of the IIS4 segment in a unimolecular, concentration-independent reaction. In this activated position, the voltage sensor is tightly bound to the rigid toxin and is trapped in its activated conformation. Upon repolarization of the cell membrane, the trapped IIS4 voltage sensors remain activated; therefore, subsequent depolarizations activate the channels at more negative membrane potentials because one of the four voltage sensors is already activated (8Cestèle S.

In the present experiments, we have refined the molecular map of the amino acid residues in these two extracellular linkers that are required for CssIV binding and voltage sensor trapping, and we have discovered a hot spot for toxin action where single mutations in adjacent amino acid residues can either enhance or impair toxin action substantially. Our results enable a detailed structural and mechanistic model for CssIV interaction with its receptor site in the voltage sensor of domain II of rNav1.2a channels and provide further support for the voltage sensor-trapping model of scorpion toxin action and the sliding helix model of voltage sensor function.

Hydrophobic amino acid residues, serine, cysteine, and threonine were substituted with alanine to prevent toxin-binding interactions with their side chains. Glutamine was substituted for the larger charged residues arginine, lysine, and glutamic acid, whereas asparagine was substituted for aspartic acid residues.

Briefly, cDNAs encoding wild-type (WT) and mutant rNav1.2a channels were transiently expressed in tsA-201 cells by calcium-phosphate transfection. pEBO-pCD8-leu2 was co-transfected into tsA-201 cells, and the cell surface CD8 marker was identified by incubation with polystyrene microspheres pre-coated with anti-CD8 antibody. The expressed CD8 protein was used to identify cells that express rNav1.2a channels. Transfected cells were subcloned 12–18 h after transfection. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 18–72 h after transfection.

To assess the extent of negative shift of the voltage dependence of activation caused by CssIVE15A, the tsA-201 cells were held at −100 mV and test depolarizations were applied to potentials from −100 to +20 mV in 5-mV increments. Current-voltage (I-V) plots were generated from peak currents elicited by each depolarization. Each test depolarization was either applied alone or preceded by a 1-ms prepulse to +50 mV followed by a 60-ms interval at the holding potential. We tested the functional properties of each mutant rNav1.2a construct in the absence of toxin to examine the effect of the mutant residue, followed by recordings in the presence of CssIVE15A. The voltage dependence and kinetics of each mutant channel were initially screened with 500 nm CssIVE15A to detect differences from WT. If a mutant channel did have significant differences in function from WT, further tests were performed to investigate the phenotype of mutant channels in detail. All the data were analyzed with Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Normalized I-V curves were fit with a function including a single Boltzmann component of the form: (V − Vrev) × Gmax/{1 + exp[(V½ − V)/k]}, where V½ is the half-activation voltage in mV, and k is a slope factor in mV. In analyses of the rates of development and reversal of voltage sensor trapping, currents were normalized to the maximal peak current of a preceding I-V plot. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Homology and de novo modeling of the voltage sensor in domain II of rat Nav1.2a channels was performed using the Rosetta-Membrane method (3Yarov-Yarovoy V. Baker D. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The alignment of the IIS4 segments was manually adjusted to align the first arginine in the IIS4 of rNav1.2 with Gln290 in Kv1.2-Kv2.1 chimera channels, which corresponds to the conserved R0 position in most Kv channels (supplemental Fig. S1). 5,000 models of the voltage sensor were generated, and the lowest scoring model was selected as the best model. Modeling of CssIV toxin was performed using the Rosetta method for modeling of soluble proteins (15Rohl C.A. Strauss C.E. Misura K.M. Baker D.

Docking simulations of CssIV binding to the voltage sensor in domain II of the rNav1.2a channel were performed using the Rosetta docking method (16Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O.

Backbone flexibility of the extracellular part of the voltage sensor (residues Cys768-Gly800 and Ser832-Arg856) was allowed during simulations and Tyr40 and Tyr42 residues of the β-scorpion CssIV toxin were required to be at the voltage sensor-toxin interface. 10,000 models were generated and the best model was chosen among 20 lowest scoring models as the model that fit the majority of available experimental data on key residues contributing to interaction of the CssIV toxin with voltage-sensing domain II of rat Nav1.2a channels (8Cestèle S.

These functional effects required a strong depolarizing prepulse to activate the channels (8Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the present study we used a high-affinity recombinant derivative of CssIV, CssIVE15A (19Karbat I. Ilan N. Zhang J.Z. Cohen L. Kahn R. Benveniste M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol.

We first verified the requirement of a prepulse to observe the functional effects of CssIVE15A on WT rNav1.2a channels. Without a prepulse, current-voltage (I-V) relationships obtained from rNav1.2a channels using 15-ms depolarizations to potentials from −100 to +20 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV were similar whether or not 500 nm CssIVE15A was present. Under these conditions, no Na+ current was activated at test potentials more negative than −60 mV (Fig. 1). Even in the presence of CssIVE15A, little inward current was activated by a test pulse to −60 mV (Fig. 1B). In contrast, when a 1-ms prepulse to +50 mV was applied 60 ms before each test pulse, marked Na+ current was observed at −60 mV (Fig. 1B), and a substantial component of the Na+ current activated with a negatively shifted voltage dependence (Fig. 1C). These effects were not observed in the absence of CssIVE15A. This negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation reflects voltage sensor trapping by bound CssIV (8Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). At 500 nm CssIVE15A, a mean of 11.9% of the peak Na+ current activated at this negative membrane potential for WT rNav1.2a channels (Fig. 1 and Table 3). We used this negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation to assay the effects of mutations in IIS1-S2 and IIS3-S4 on CssIV binding and action, and we have termed the additional current observed at a test pulse to −60 mV following a prepulse “IVST,” as an abbreviation for voltage sensor-trapping current. To conserve channel function, site-directed mutations of single amino acid residues were designed to reduce the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of amino acid side chains by conversion to Ala, to reduce the charge of amino acid side chains while retaining their hydrophilicity by conversion of Arg, Lys, Glu, and Asp to Asn, Gln, or Cys, or to substitute single amino acid residues from homologous NaV channels having different responses to β-scorpion toxins. The functional properties of several representative mutants are described first, followed by presentation of a molecular map and high-resolution structural model of the toxin-receptor interaction.TABLE 3IVST and KD of WT and mutant channels in the presence of CssIVE15AChannelConcentrationIVST (−Pre)IVST (+Pre)nKDnmnmWT500011.9 ± 2.3%51130A841N50002.8 ± 0.7%5NAaNA, not applicable.100005.3 ± 1.1%4L846A50000.1 ± 0.3%4NA100000.1 ± 0.3%3N842R2005.1 ± 0.7%26.0 ± 3.2%7NA5009.0 ± 1.5%53.0 ± 4.5%610008.9 ± 0.9%55.0 ± 4.0%8V843A2004.0 ± 1.0%426350010.4 ± 2.0%7100019.1 ± 3.5%5200029.9 ± 2.4%7500056.0 ± 5.0%51000049.2 ± 3.9%5E844N2002.9 ± 0.9%44255008.4 ± 1.9%3200026.3 ± 3.1%5300038.8 ± 13.7%3400050.3 ± 7.2%4500050.3 ± 6.5%5a NA, not applicable.

In the present work, we used recombinant CssIVE15A to identify individual amino acid residues that are important for toxin action by mutagenesis and characterization of their functional effects by electrophysiological analysis. We found that two mutants (A841N and L846A) in IIS3-S4 greatly reduced the voltage sensor-trapping activity of CssIVE15A. In the absence of toxin, mutation A841N did not affect the I-V relationship compared with WT (Fig. 2A, Table 1), indicating that this mutation does not alter the voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels. As for WT channels, CssIVE15A (500 nm) did not induce significant Na+ current when cells expressing A841N channels were depolarized to −60 mV without a depolarizing prepulse (Fig. 2B, Table 2). However the I-V relationship of A841N was altered only slightly by a +50-mV, 1-ms depolarizing prepulse in the presence of the toxin (Fig. 2B), and IVST was only 2.8% at 500 nm and increased to 5.3% at 1 μm (Table 3). These results suggest that mutant A841N has reduced affinity for CssIV and possibly also reduced efficacy in voltage sensor trapping.TABLE 1Voltage dependence of activationChannelV0.5SlopenmVWT−24.1 ± 1.0−5.5 ± 0.64A841N−26.3 ± 2.4−5.2 ± 0.83N842R−26.6 ± 0.6−6.0 ± 0.46V843A−31.9 ± 0.8−4.4 ± 0.24E844N−21.8 ± 0.3−5.8 ± 0.55L846A−40.8 ± 2.7−5.6 ± 0.64 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Voltage dependence of activation with CssIVE15AChannelV0.5SlopenmVWT−29.6 ± 1.1−5.9 ± 0.35A841N−27.8 ± 1.2−5.5 ± 0.25N842RNAaNA, not applicable because IVST was present without a prepulse.NANAV843A−20.3 ± 1.6−7.9 ± 0.45E844N−23.0 ± 0.4−7.3 ± 0.25L846A−38.5 ± 1.4−5.6 ± 0.44a NA, not applicable because IVST was present without a prepulse. Open table in a new tab The nearby mutation L846A also impaired voltage sensor trapping by CssIVE15A, but its effect was even greater. It caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation under control conditions (Fig. 2C, Table 1). However, voltage sensor trapping by CssIVE15A was completely abolished for L846A (Fig. 2D, Table 3). Thus, mutation L846A had two functional effects. First, the mutation itself enhanced activation of the channel, either by stabilizing the IIS4 voltage sensor in the activated conformation, destabilizing the resting conformation, or both. Second, the L846A mutation completely blocked voltage sensor trapping by the toxin, either by complete loss of binding of CssIVE15A to the mutant channel in resting state or by complete loss of voltage sensor trapping efficacy by CssIVE15A in the activated state, or a combination of these effects. To examine the functional properties of mutant N842R, we first tested its voltage-dependent activation in the absence of toxin. We observed that the I-V relationship of the N842R channel was similar to WT (Fig. 3A, Table 1). However, unlike the WT channel, treatment with 500 nm CssIVE15A induced a significant Na+ current during test pulses to −60 mV without a depolarizing prepulse (Fig. 3, B and C, Table 3), and the I-V relationship revealed a significant component of IVST (Fig. 3C, Table 3). Global fits to the I-V curves indicated that ∼9% of the current activated with the negative voltage dependence without a prepulse. Approximately 55% of the Na+ current activated with negative voltage dependence after a prepulse, about 6-fold more than without the prepulse (Fig. 3C, Table 3). This negatively shifted component of the Na+ current is 4.45-fold greater than that observed for WT (Figs. 1B and 3C, and Table 3). Therefore, the mutation N842R greatly enhanced voltage sensor trapping by CssIVE15A. We hypothesized that the IVST that we observed without a prepulse might be caused by voltage sensor trapping at the holding potential of −100 mV and might be reversed by a stronger hyperpolarization. In fact, the IVST observed with this mutant channel was eliminated by a 10-s hyperpolarization to −150 mV (Fig. 3, D and E). Evidently, CssIVE15A trapped a significant fraction of the IIS4 voltage sensors of N842R channels in an activated state at the resting membrane potential. We measured the voltage sensor trapping activity of CssIVE15A with N842R channels at three different concentrations of CssIVE15A (Fig. 3F). Values of IVST as a function of concentration were fit with first-order Hill equations (Fig. 3F, Table 3). IVST reached a maximum of 53 ± 4.5% of total Na+ current with an EC50 of 170 nm. Without a prepulse, IVST increased over a similar concentration range to reach a maximum of 9.0 ± 1.5% (Fig. 3F). Our previous work demonstrated that the rate of voltage sensor trapping by CssIV during the strong depolarizing prepulse is concentration-independent, suggesting that this process does not involve binding of toxin (9Cestèle S. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Qu Y. Sampieri F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21332-21344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To compare the rate and extent of voltage sensor trapping upon depolarization by CssIVE15A in WT and N842R channels, we applied depolarizations of variable duration (0–5 ms) to +50 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV. Trapping was assayed 60 ms later by a test pulse to −60 mV (Fig. 4A, inset). The peak test pulse current at −60 mV increased as a function of prepulse duration (Fig. 4, A and B). The time courses were fit with single exponential functions to yield the maximum amount of trapping (Fig. 4C, top) and the rate of trapping (Fig. 4C, bottom) as a function of concentration. For WT, higher concentrations of CssIVE15A resulted in greater IVST after a 5-ms depolarization, whereas IVST was maximal for N842R at all three concentrations of CssIVE15A (Fig. 4C, top). These results indicate that voltage sensor trapping by CssIVE15A in N842R channels is saturated at 200 nm. In contrast to our results for the extent of voltage sensor trapping, the time constants for the development of voltage sensor trapping were concentration-independent for both WT and N842R (Fig. 4C, bottom). These results are consistent with the three-step model for voltage sensor trapping: concentration-dependent binding, voltage-dependent channel activation, and finally concentration-independent voltage sensor trapping (8Cestèle S.

To measure the rates of reversal, cells were depolarized to +50 mV for 1 ms to activate and trap a population of channels. They were then repolarized to −100 mV for variable times followed by a test depolarization to −60 mV to assay the loss of trapping (Fig. 4D, inset). IVST decayed exponentially with recovery time for both WT and N842R channels (Fig. 4D). However, the rate of decay was ∼6.8-fold slower for N842R compared with WT channels (Fig. 4, D and E), as quantified by the time constants of single exponential fits to these data (Fig. 4F). Mutations V843A and E844N also increased voltage sensor trapping following a prepulse (Fig. 5), but the effects were less complex than for mutation N842R. In the absence of CssIVE15A, mutation V843A shifted the voltage dependence of activation ∼7 mV to more negative potentials (Fig. 5A, Table 1), suggesting that the mutation stabilized the activated state of the domain II voltage sensor. In the presence of 500 nm CssIVE15A but without a prepulse, the voltage-dependent activation of V843A was shifted 11.4 mV in the positive direction (Fig. 5B, TABLE 1, TABLE 2). This is consistent with the idea that toxin binding stabilizes the voltage sensor in its resting conformation. No IVST was detectable at −60 mV with V843A channels (Fig. 5B, inset). However, following a prepulse to +50 mV in the presence of 500 nm CssIVE15A, IVST was increased to 56 ± 5% of the maximal peak current for V843A (Fig. 5B), which was 4.7-fold greater than WT. In contrast to V843A, the voltage dependence of activation of E844N was similar to WT (Fig. 5C, Table 1). However, following a prepulse to +50 mV in the presence of 500 nm CssIVE15A, IVST was increased to 50.3 ± 6.5% of the maximal peak current for E844N (Fig. 5D), 4.2-fold greater than WT. Thus, both mutations V843A and"

Cleavage of APP by the β-secretase BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ. We have reported previously that the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) inhibited the action of BACE1 toward human wild type APP (APP(WT)) in cellular models and that the levels of endogenous murine Aβ were significantly increased in PrP(C)-null mouse brain. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this observation. PrP(C) interacted directly with the prodomain of the immature Golgi-localized form of BACE1. This interaction decreased BACE1 at the cell surface and in endosomes where it preferentially cleaves APP(WT) but increased it in the Golgi where it preferentially cleaves APP with the Swedish mutation (APP(Swe)). In transgenic mice expressing human APP with the Swedish and Indiana familial mutations (APP(Swe,Ind)), PrP(C) deletion had no influence on APP proteolytic processing, Aβ plaque deposition, or levels of soluble Aβ or Aβ oligomers. In cells, although PrP(C) inhibited the action of BACE1 on APP(WT), it did not inhibit BACE1 activity toward APP(Swe). The differential subcellular location of the BACE1 cleavage of APP(Swe) relative to APP(WT) provides an explanation for the failure of PrP(C) deletion to affect Aβ accumulation in APP(Swe,Ind) mice. Thus, although PrP(C) exerts no control on cleavage of APP(Swe) by BACE1, it has a profound influence on the cleavage of APP(WT), suggesting that PrP(C) may be a key protective player against sporadic Alzheimer disease."

However, in general, they do not show the functional excitation-contraction coupling or the striated sarcomere arrangement typical of mature myofibers. Epigenetic modifications have been shown to play a key role in regulating the progressional changes in transcription necessary for muscle differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of murine C2C12 mesenchymal progenitor cells with 10 μM of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5AC) promotes myogenesis, resulting in myotubes with enhanced maturity as compared to untreated myotubes. Specifically, 5AC treatment resulted in the up-regulation of muscle genes at the myoblast stage, while at later stages nearly 50% of the 5AC-treated myotubes displayed a mature, well-defined sarcomere organization, as well as spontaneous contractions that coincided with action potentials and intracellular calcium transients. Both the percentage of striated myotubes and their contractile activity could be inhibited by 20 nM TTX, 10 μM ryanodine, and 100 μM nifedipine, suggesting that action potential-induced calcium transients are responsible for these characteristics. Our data suggest that genomic demethylation induced by 5AC overcomes an epigenetic barrier that prevents untreated C2C12 myotubes from reaching full maturity.—Hupkes, M., Jonsson, M. K.

https://openalex.org/W2047879184,"Hyaluronan, a high molecular mass polysaccharide on the vertebrate cell surface and extracellular matrix, is produced at the plasma membrane by hyaluronan synthases using UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA as substrates. The availability of these UDP-sugar substrates can limit the synthesis rate of hyaluronan. In this study, we show that the cellular level of UDP-HexNAc also controls hyaluronan synthesis by modulating the expression of HAS2 (hyaluronan synthase 2). Increasing UDP-HexNAc in HaCaT keratinocytes by adding glucosamine down-regulated HAS2 gene expression, whereas a decrease in UDP-HexNAc, realized by mannose treatment or siRNA for GFAT1 (glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1), enhanced expression of the gene. Tracing the UDP-HexNAc-initiated signal to the HAS2 promoter revealed no change in the binding of STAT3, NF-κB, and cAMP response element-binding protein, shown previously to mediate growth factor and cytokine signals on HAS2 expression. Instead, altered binding of SP1 and YY1 to the promoter correlated with cellular UDP-HexNAc content and inhibition of HAS2 expression. siRNA silencing of YY1 and SP1 confirmed their inhibitory effects on HAS2 expression. Reduced and increased levels of O-GlcNAc-modified SP1 and YY1 proteins were associated with stimulation or inhibition of HAS2 expression, respectively. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that, by regulating the level of protein O-GlcNAc modifications, cellular UDP-HexNAc content controls HAS2 transcription and decreases the effects on hyaluronan synthesis that would result from cellular fluctuations of this substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2081303352,"Recent studies indicate that oxidative stress mediates salt-sensitive hypertension. To test the hypothesis that the renal epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a target of oxidative stress, patch clamp techniques were used to determine whether ENaC in A6 distal nephron cells is regulated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the cell-attached configuration, H2O2 significantly increased ENaC open probability (Po) and single-channel current amplitude but not the unit conductance. High concentrations of exogenous H2O2 are required to elevate intracellular H2O2, probably because catalase, the enzyme that promotes the decomposition of H2O2 to H2O and O2, is highly expressed in A6 cells. The effect of H2O2 on ENaC Po was enhanced by 3-aminotriazole, a catalase inhibitor, and abolished by overexpression of catalase, indicating that intracellular H2O2 levels are critical to produce the effect. However, H2O2 did not directly activate ENaC in inside-out patches. The effects of H2O2 on ENaC Po and amiloride-sensitive Na+ current were abolished by inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Confocal microscopy data showed that H2O2 elevated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) in the apical membrane by stimulating PI3K.

However, it is still unknown whether H2O2, a product of O2⨪, also stimulates ENaC. epithelial sodium channel open probability phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate reactive oxygen species enhanced green fluorescent protein pleckstrin homology. H2O2 may be more important than other reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension. There are two lines of evidence that support a role for H2O2 in salt-sensitive hypertension. First, transgenic mice overexpressing the human catalase gene are found to be less sensitive to hypertension-inducing agents, such as norepinephrine and angiotension II (11Zhang Y. Griendling K.K. Dikalova A. Owens G.K. Taylor W.R. Hypertension. 2005; 46: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Second, among ROS, H2O2 is a relatively stable and mild oxidant, suggesting that it may have a longer effect than O2⨪. In this context, H2O2 acts as an intracellular messenger that modulates the function of several types of transmembrane proteins (12Veal E.A. Day A.M. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), including ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels (13Avshalumov M.V. Rice M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11729-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Intracellular H2O2 concentrations are balanced between the rate of production determined by NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated production of O2⨪ and the rate of degradation determined by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (14Rhee S.G. Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Chang T.S. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). ROS, including H2O2, stimulate the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src (15Giannoni E. Buricchi F. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6391-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). c-Src is known to be directly associated with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K (16Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J.

These studies indicate that ROS may stimulate PI3K and consequently promote the synthesis of PI(3,4,5)P3. We (18Zhang Z.R. Chou C.F. Wang J. Liang Y.Y. Ma H.P.

Physiol. 2007; 580: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have previously shown that PI(3,4,5)P3 stimulates ENaC. Taken together, these studies suggest that H2O2 may stimulate ENaC by elevating PI(3,4,5)P3 through activation of PI3K. In the present study, using patch clamp techniques combined with confocal microscopy analysis of apical PI(3,4,5)P3 levels, we show that H2O2 stimulates ENaC in A6 distal nephron cells via PI3K-dependent elevation of PI(3,4,5)P3 in the apical membrane. Xenopus A6 distal nephron cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Under previously used culture conditions, basal activity of ENaC in A6 cells is relatively high (23Bao H.F. Zhang Z.R. Liang Y.Y. Ma J.J. Eaton D.C. Ma H.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1178-F1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is difficult to see and analyze any stimulatory effect when basal ENaC activity is high. Therefore, in the present study, we modified the culture medium to reduce basal ENaC activity. The medium contained 2 parts of DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium (Invitrogen), 1 part of H2O, 15 mm NaHCO3 (total Na+ = 101 mm, which is ideal for amphibian A6 cells), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 units/ml streptomycin. A6 cells were cultured in plastic flasks in the presence of 1 μm aldosterone at 26 °C and 4% CO2. After the cells became 70% confluent in plastic flasks, A6 cells were plated on the polyester membrane of either Snapwell inserts (Corning Costar Co.) for patch clamp experiments) or Transwell inserts (Corning Costar Co.) for confocal microscopy experiments and measurement of amiloride-sensitive Na+ current). The cells were cultured for 3–4 weeks to allow them to be fully polarized before each experiment. Both cell-attached and inside-out recordings of ENaC single-channel currents from A6 distal nephron cells were carried out using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). As described previously (24Wang J. Zhang Z.R. Chou C.F. Liang Y.Y. Gu Y. Ma H.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F284-F290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), prior to the experiments, A6 cells cultured on the polyester membrane of Snapwell inserts were thoroughly washed with NaCl solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The glass micropipette was filled with NaCl solution (the pipette resistance is 7–10 megaohms). In cell-attached experiments, NaCl solution was used for both the luminal and basolateral bath. For experiments using the inside-out patch clamp configuration, KCl solution was used for the cytoplasmic bath, which contained 100 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (50 nm free Ca2+ after titration with 1 mm EGTA); pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Single-channel currents were obtained with applied pipette potentials of either 0 mV for cell-attached recordings or +60 mV for inside-out recordings, filtered at 1 kHz, and sampled every 50 μs with Clampex 8.0 software. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. The total numbers of functional channels in the patch were estimated by observing the number of peaks detected on the current amplitude histograms during an at least 20-min recording period including the period after application of H2O2. Each experiment was started after the first 2-min recordings when the ENaC activity had stabilized. The open probability (Po) of ENaC before (−3–0 min) and after each experimental manipulation (every 3-min period) was calculated using Clampfit 9.0. After they were cultured on the polyester membrane of Transwell inserts for 3–4 weeks, A6 cells were fully polarized and formed a cell monolayer. The voltage (V) and resistance (R) across the cell monolayer were measured with electrodes connected to a volt ohm meter, the EVOM (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The transepithelial current (I) was calculated according to Ohm's law (I = V/R) and corrected for the surface area of the polyester membrane. Because H2O2 could alter the membrane potential by stimulating iberiotoxin-sensitive K+ channels (data not shown), we used the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) rather than the transepithelial current to analyze ENaC activity. To calculate the amiloride-sensitive INa, the total transepithelial current was subtracted with the current after blockade of ENaC with 1 μm amiloride. In this set of experiments, A6 cells were plated on the polyester membrane of Transwell inserts at a high density to allow the cells to be confluent within 3 days. To facilitate transfection of confluent A6 cells, we treated confluent A6 cells with Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free PBS (Invitrogen). The PBS was modified with H2O (3 parts of PBS with 1 part of H2O) to match the osmolarity of amphibian cells. After treatment with the modified PBS for 20 min (to break the tight junctions), cells were incubated with transfection reagent containing EGFP-PH-Akt DNA construct and Lipofectamin 2000 for 6 h and then incubated with regular culture medium for 2 days before performing the confocal microscopy experiments. To detect PI(3,4,5)P3 levels in A6 cells, A6 cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-PH-Akt. To detect the levels of intracellular ROS, A6 cells were stained with a membrane-permeable, ROS-sensitive, fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Prior to the confocal miscroscopy experiments, cells were washed twice with NaCl solution. Immediately following each experimental manipulation, the polyester membrane that supports the A6 cell monolayer was quickly excised and mounted on a glass slide with a drop of NaCl solution to keep the cells alive. Confocal microscopy xy or xz scanning of A6 cells was accomplished within 5 min. xy optical sections were performed to provide a flat view of the cells near the apical membrane, across the lateral membrane, or near the basal membrane. xz optical sections were also performed to provide a lateral view of the cells. In each set of experiments, images were taken using the same parameter settings. It has been suggested that aquaporins are required for H2O2 to move across the cell membrane (25Bienert G.P. M⊘ller A.L. Kristiansen K.A. Schulz A. M⊘ller I.M. Schjoerring J.K. Jahn T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1183-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). After the cells were challenged with exogenous H2O2, the levels of intracellular H2O2 remained unknown. Therefore, H2O2 concentrations in A6 cells after treatment with exogenous H2O2 were measured. After treatment with H2O2 at different concentrations for 10 min, cells were washed five times in ice-cold NaCl solution. Cells were then bathed in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS for 15 min and treated with trypsin for 1–2 min. Cells were collected by centrifuging at 600 × g for 5 min, washed twice with NaCl solution, and then suspended in 350 μl of NaCl solution. H2O2 concentrations in live A6 cells were measured using the Amplite fluorimetric hydrogen peroxide assay kit (ABD Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, a 50-μl cell suspension was incubated with an equal volume mixture of Amplite Red peroxidase substrate and horseradish peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature. The signal at 570 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate was detected and recorded by a microplate reader. Cell number was counted and used to calculate intracellular H2O2 according to the standard curve. A6 cells were cultured as described above. Cell lysates (100 μg) were loaded and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 60–90 min. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes for 1.5 h at 50 V. After 1 h of blocking with 5% BSA-PBST buffer, PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) of rabbit monoclonal antibody to catalase (Abcam; ab76024) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; GE Healthcare) for 1 h after four vigorous washes. Finally, blots were visualized with chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. H2O2 was purchased from Fisher. H2O2 was diluted with NaCl solution before it was added to either luminal or basolateral bath. All of the solutions were either premade and stored in a −20 °C freezer or freshly made before the experiments. All of the concentrations listed in this study represent the final concentrations. Data are reported as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaPlot and SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific). Paired t test was used for comparisons between pre- and post-treatment activities. Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons among various treatment groups or at different time points of one treatment group. Results were considered significant if p was <0.01. Recent studies suggest that elevation of H2O2 in the kidney participates in salt-sensitive hypertension (6Taylor N.E. Cowley Jr., A.W. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2005; 289: R1573-R1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Chen Y.F. Cowley Jr., A.W. Zou A.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 285: R827-R833Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), implying that the activity of sodium transporters might be increased by H2O2. In the present study, cell-attached patch clamp experiments were performed to determine whether H2O2 would stimulate ENaC. Because ENaC in A6 distal nephron cells is well characterized, we used the A6 cell line as a model for sodium-transporting epithelial cells. We intended to determine the role of intracellular rather than extracellular H2O2 in regulating ENaC. Therefore, H2O2 was applied outside the patch pipette to the cells rather than to inside the pipette with the expectation that high concentrations of extracellular H2O2 would drive H2O2 to move across the cell membrane and increase intracellular H2O2. Our results show that the addition of 3 mm H2O2 to the basolateral bath significantly increased both ENaC open probability (Po) and single-channel current amplitude with a latency of about 12 min (Fig. 1). In contrast, the addition of saline (NaCl solution, used for making up H2O2 stock solution) to the basolateral bath did not affect ENaC activity. These data show that H2O2 stimulates ENaC from the basolateral side in distal nephron cells but with a long latency. In the above experiments, H2O2 was applied to the basolateral bath. If H2O2 stimulates ENaC by causing intracellular oxidative stress, it must pass through the basolateral membrane in order to reach the apical membrane where ENaC is located. Therefore, we examined the effects of H2O2 applied in the luminal bath on ENaC. Compared with basolateral H2O2, luminal H2O2 at the same concentration of 3 mm also significantly increased both ENaC Po and single-channel current amplitude but with a shorter latency of about 6 min (Fig. 2, A, C, and D). The current-voltage relationship showed that H2O2 did not alter ENaC unit conductance (Fig. 2E). In contrast, the addition of 0.3 mm H2O2 to the luminal bath had no effect on ENaC Po and only slightly increased ENaC single-channel current amplitude (Fig. 2, B, C, and D). It has been reported that high concentrations of H2O2 are required to produce significant acute effects in some types of cells (27Lin M.J. Yang X.R. Cao Y.N. Sham J.S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2007; 292: L1598-L1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Zhang W. Tong Q. Conrad K. Wozney J. Cheung J.Y. Miller B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1746-C1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether high concentrations of extracellular H2O2 are necessary to elevate intracellular H2O2 and produce significant oxidative stress. Therefore, the relationship between exogenous H2O2 load and intracellular oxidative stress was determined. The data show that exogenous H2O2 does not significantly elevate intracellular ROS until the concentration of exogenous H2O2 was in the millimolar range (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the oxidative stress is due to elevation of intracellular H2O2, intracellular H2O2 was measured using the AmpliteTM hydrogen peroxide assay kit. Luminal exposure of A6 cells to relatively high concentrations of H2O2 does increase intracellular H2O2 from 3.5 ± 0.2 (control; n = 9) to 5.1 ± 0.4 nm (0.3 mm H2O2 for 10 min; n = 9; p < 0.05) or 12.2 ± 0.7 nm (3 mm H2O2 for 10 min; n = 9; p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). This small but significant change suggests that either the permeability of the cell membranes to H2O2 is low or the rate of H2O2 degradation is high. Because the level of intracellular H2O2 is tightly controlled by catalase, we performed Western blot experiments and found that catalase is highly expressed in A6 cells (Fig. 3B, inset). These data suggest that a high concentration of exogenous H2O2 is required to elevate intracellular H2O2 because catalase rapidly breaks down H2O2 that entered the cells. If exogenously added H2O2 stimulates ENaC by elevating intracellular H2O2, but the intracellular concentration of H2O2 is kept low by the action of catalase, then inhibition of catalase should facilitate the effect of exogenous H2O2 on ENaC activity. To test this hypothesis, A6 cells were exposed to 1 mm H2O2 in the absence (control) and presence of 20 mm 3-aminotriazole, a catalase inhibitor. Under control conditions, 1 mm H2O2 tended to elevate ENaC Po but not in a statistically significant manner. In contrast, after inhibition of catalase with 3-aminotriazole, the effect of 1 mm H2O2 on ENaC Po became statistically significant (Fig. 4). Inhibition of catalase did not alter the effect of 1 mm H2O2 on ENaC single-channel current amplitude, indicating that H2O2 may elevate ENaC current amplitude through another pathway that is very sensitive and already saturated by 1 mm H2O2 alone. 3-Aminotriazole alone did not acutely affect the basal activity of ENaC in A6 cells. This lack of effect is probably due to low basal H2O2 production when A6 cells were in the patch chamber and bathed with glucose-free saline at room temperature. These data suggest that H2O2 regulates ENaC via an intracellular mechanism. The data described above support the hypothesis that highly expressed catalase may account for the resistance of A6 cells to H2O2. To determine whether exogenous H2O2 stimulates ENaC by elevating intracellular H2O2, we overexpressed catalase in A6 cells. To monitor the expression of this enzyme, we subcloned mitochondrial catalase into pEYFP-C1 vector to form the pEYFP-C1-mito-Cat construct. A6 cells were then transiently transfected with this construct. The cells expressing this exogenous catalase were identified by yellow fluorescence. In an A6 cell that was under transfecting conditions but did not express this catalase, the addition of 3 mm H2O2 to the luminal bath elevated both ENaC Po and single-channel current amplitude (Fig. 5A) but failed to produce an effect on ENaC in an A6 cell that expressed the exogenous catalase (the cell with the fluorescence; Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the effect of exogenous H2O2 on ENaC activity is highly dependent on the levels of intracellular H2O2. Previously reported studies suggested that H2O2 stimulates voltage-gated K+ channels of the Kv7 family by directly oxidizing cysteine residues of this channel protein (29Gamper N. Zaika O. Li Y. Martin P. Hernandez C.C. Perez M.R. Wang A.Y. Jaffe D.B. Shapiro M.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we originally hypothesized that H2O2 might stimulate ENaC by oxidizing intracellular cysteine residues of ENaC. However, using the inside-out configuration, the cytosolic surface of ENaC was exposed to either 1 or 3 mm H2O2. We found that H2O2 did not alter either ENaC PO (Fig. 6, A and C) or ENaC single-channel current amplitude (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that H2O2 stimulates ENaC probably not by directly oxidizing ENaC but rather via activation of signal transduction pathways. To determine whether PI3K mediates the effects of H2O2 on ENaC activity, prior to the addition of 3 mm H2O2 to the luminal bath, A6 cells were pretreated with 5 μm LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, for 5 min. Previous studies suggested that PI(3,4,5)P3 is produced in the inner leaflet of the basolateral membrane and can freely diffuse in the inner leaflet to reach the apical membrane (30Blazer-Yost B.L. Vahle J.C. Byars J.M. Bacallao R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1569-C1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PI3K inhibitor was added to the basolateral bath. We found that after the pretreatment, H2O2 no longer elevated ENaC Po but still increased ENaC single-channel current amplitude (Fig. 7, A–D). In contrast, LY294002 alone only slightly reduced ENaC Po when basal ENaC Po was low and had no effect on ENaC single-channel current amplitude. These data suggest that the effect of H2O2 on ENaC Po, but not on ENaC single-channel current amplitude, is mediated by a PI3K-dependent pathway. To confirm the results from single-channel recordings, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) was measured. As shown in Fig. 7E, under control conditions when A6 cells were cultured with our modified culture medium, base-line INa was 2.1 ± 0.1 μA/cm2 (n = 10). After the A6 cell monolayer was apically treated with 3 mm H2O2 for 15 min, INa was increased to 6.5 ± 0.2 μA/cm2 (n = 10, p < 0.001). However, H2O2 failed to increase INa (2.3 ± 0.1 μA/cm2, n = 10) in A6 cells pretreated with 5 μm LY294002 for 5 min. Treatment of the cells with 5 μm LY294002 alone for 15 min did not alter INa, probably because PI3K is inactive in A6 cells under basal conditions. These results are consistent with the data from patch clamp single-channel recordings. Because our previous studies have shown that PI(3,4,5)P3, one of the PI3K products, stimulates ENaC (18Zhang Z.R. Chou C.F. Wang J. Liang Y.Y. Ma H.P. Pflugers Arch. 2010; 459: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ma H.P. Chou C.F. Wei S.P. Eaton D.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7641-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), H2O2 may stimulate ENaC via a PI3K-dependent elevation of PI(3,4,5)P3 in the apical membrane. To test this hypothesis, a previously established method (31Martin-Belmonte F. Gassama A. Datta A. Yu W. Rescher U. Gerke V. Mostov K. Cell. 2007; 128: 383-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was used to track PI(3,4,5)P3 in living A6 cells. The cells were transiently transfected with the EGFP-PH-Akt construct in which the PH domain could selectively bind to PI(3,4,5)P3. Consistent with previous studies (31Martin-Belmonte F. Gassama A. Datta A. Yu W. Rescher U. Gerke V. Mostov K. Cell. 2007; 128: 383-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), the data showed that under basal conditions, PI(3,4,5)P3 was undetectable in the apical membrane of A6 cells but was mainly located in the lateral and basal membranes. Treatment of the cells with 3 mm H2O2 for 15 min induced the appearance of PI(3,4,5)P3 in the apical membrane. In contrast, when the cells were pretreated with 5 μm LY294002 for 5 min to inhibit PI3K, H2O2 failed to induce apical PI(3,4,5)P3 production (Fig. 8). Because our patch clamp data showed that inhibition of PI3K abolished the effect of H2O2 on ENaC Po, these confocal microscopy data suggest that apical PI(3,4,5)P3 production mediates H2O2 stimulation of ENaC. The present study shows that H2O2 increases both ENaC activity and apical PI(3,4,5)P3 via a PI3K-dependent pathway. Because we previously showed that PI(3,4,5)P3 stimulates ENaC in A6 cells (18Zhang Z.R. Chou C.F. Wang J. Liang Y.Y. Ma H.P. Pflugers Arch. 2010; 459: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ma H.P. Chou C.F. Wei S.P. Eaton D.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7641-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), H2O2 probably stimulates ENaC by causing a PI3K-dependent elevation of PI(3,4,5)P3 in the apical membrane. However, PI(3,4,5)P3 should first be produced in the inner leaflet of the basolateral membrane and then diffused in the inner leaflet to the apical membrane because the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was added to the basolateral bath. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies, which showed that PI(3,4,5)P3 can laterally diffuse in the inner leaflet of epithelial cell membranes from the basolateral membrane domain, where it is generated, to the apical membrane domain (30Blazer-Yost B.L. Vahle J.C. Byars J.M. Bacallao R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1569-C1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Theoretically, the apical PI(3,4,5)P3 would be rapidly degraded because the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is located in the apical membrane (31Martin-Belmonte F. Gassama A. Datta A. Yu W. Rescher U. Gerke V. Mostov K. Cell. 2007; 128: 383-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). However, a sustained elevation of apical PI(3,4,5)P3 was observed after treatment of the cells with H2O2. This is not surprising because H2O2 not only activates PI3K but also inactivates PTEN by oxidizing its cysteine residues (32Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Jeong W. Chang T.S. Yang K.S. Woo H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Because the cytosolic domains of ENaC also contain cysteine residues, we reasoned that H2O2 may stimulate ENaC by oxidizing these residues. However, results from experiments using the inside-out or excised patch configuration show that H2O2 is unable to affect ENaC activity. The results suggest that H2O2 does not directly regulate ENaC but rather alters ENaC activity via a PI3K-dependent pathway. In the present study, exogenous H2O2 was used as a tool to manipulate the levels of intracellular H2O2. In A6 cells, a high exogenous concentration of H2O2 is required to counteract the efficient catalase present in these cells, elevate intracellular H2O2, and regulate ENaC. However, H2O2, even at 10 mm, did not result in either cell lysis or apoptosis of A6 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Based on these data, the concentrations of H2O2 used for the current study (up to 3 mm) should not result in any nonspecific effects due to cellular damage. Therefore, such high concentrations of H2O2 can be used as a tool to manipulate the levels of intracellular H2O2 in A6 cells. This argument is probably also true for neurons because in the hippocampus, the IC50 for extracellular H2O2 to affect postsynaptic potentials is nearly 6 mm (33Nisticò R. Piccirilli S. Cucchiaroni M.L. Armogida M. Guatteo E. Giampà C. Fusco F.R. Bernardi G. Nisticò G. Mercuri N.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 1022-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because, in the present study, H2O2 was applied outside the patch pipette (not to ENaC in the patch), it remains to be determined whether extracellular H2O2 could also directly regulate ENaC by oxidizing cysteine and/or histidine residues in the extracellular loops of ENaC subunits. Compared with previously published studies from us and others (23Bao H.F. Zhang Z.R. Liang Y.Y. Ma J.J. Eaton D.C. Ma H.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1178-F1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Yu L. Helms M.N. Yue Q. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1519-F1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), ENaC mean Po presented in this study is relatively low. In previous reports, ENaC mean Po was calculated according to the number of active channels in the patch estimated under resting conditions. This estimation excluded any silent channels present in the patch. The mean Po reflects only the value of active channels. In the present study, we found that the number of active channels was elevated after treatment with H2O2. This elevation is due to activation of silent channels rather than insertion of new channels in the patch because previous work also with A6 cells suggests that insertion of new channels never occurred in a patch that had already been formed (35Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the elevated number of channels after H2O2 was used to calculate base-line ENaC Po. This Po reflects the mean Po value of both active and silent channels. Therefore, the Po value reported here is much lower than those published previously. However, the open time of each active channel is still several s (see the zoom-in single-channel traces in each figure). In order to clearly see the stimulatory effect of H2O2 on ENaC activity, we modified culture medium to reduce basal ENaC activity (see “Methods and Materials”). Compared with the culture medium we used previously (23Bao H.F. Zhang Z.R. Liang Y.Y. Ma J.J. Eaton D.C. Ma H.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1178-F1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the modified culture medium contained less NaHCO3 (15 mm versus 25 mm). Because recent studies have shown that HCO3− stimulates ENaC (36Pech V. Pham T.D. Hong S. Weinstein A.M. Spencer K.B. Duke B.J. Walp E. Kim Y.H. Sutliff R.L. Bao H.F. Eaton D.C. Wall S.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 1928-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), less HCO3− in culture medium may account, at least in part, for low basal ENaC activity observed in the present study. We noticed that inhibition of PI3K did not reduce basal ENaC Po and amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. Because our confocal microscopy data showed that PI(3,4,5)P3 was undetectable in the apical membrane of A6 cells under basal conditions, we argue that lack of PI(3,4,5)P3 might account for both the low basal ENaC activity and the insensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. However, it remains unknown whether our modified culture conditions could affect the levels of apical PI(3,4,5)P3. Our data showed that H2O2 increased ENaC single-channel current amplitude. Because H2O2 did not alter ENaC single-channel conductance, the increased current amplitude is probably caused by elevation of the driving force for Na+ influx. First, the electrical driving force (the membrane potential) may be elevated because H2O2 stimulates both KATP channels (13Avshalumov M.V. Rice M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11729-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and large conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels (37Barlow R.S. El-Mowafy A.M. White R.E. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H475-H483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the chemical driving force (Na+ concentration gradient) may also be elevated because H2O2 also stimulates Na+,K+-ATPase (38Bełtowski J. Wójcicka G. Trzeciak J. Marciniak A. Peptides. 2006; 27: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which could decrease intracellular Na+. Investigation of the underlying mechanism will be the direction of our future studies. We noticed that the effect of H2O2 on single-channel amplitude in the control experiment shown in Fig. 5 was less significant than those observed in any other experiments. Because fully polarized epithelial cells are difficult to transfect, poorly polarized cells were used in the experiments shown in Fig. 5. In addition, prior to the transfection, the cells were serum-deprived for 24 h. Therefore, we argue that poor polarization and serum deprivation may minimize the effect of H2O2 on ENaC single-channel current amplitude, presumably by reducing functional KATP, BK, and/or Na+,K+-ATPase in the plasma membrane. In summary, the present study provides the first evidence that H2O2 not only enhances ENaC Po by elevating PI(3,4,5)P3 in the apical membrane via activation of PI3K but also increases ENaC single-channel current amplitude via a PI3K-independent pathway. Because H2O2 in the kidney is elevated in salt-sensitive rats on a high salt diet (6Taylor N.E. Cowley Jr., A.W. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2005; 289: R1573-R1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), our in vitro data presented here imply a possible role of ENaC in salt-sensitive hypertension.

https://openalex.org/W1983687743,"It is a long-standing question how developing motor and sensory neuron projections cooperatively form a common principal grid of peripheral nerve pathways relaying behavioral outputs and somatosensory inputs. Here, we explored this issue through targeted cell lineage and gene manipulation in mouse, combined with in vitro live axon imaging. In the absence of motor projections, dorsal (epaxial) and ventral (hypaxial) sensory projections form in a randomized manner, while removal of EphA3/4 receptor tyrosine kinases expressed by epaxial motor axons triggers selective failure to form epaxial sensory projections. EphA3/4 act non-cell-autonomously by inducing sensory axons to track along preformed epaxial motor projections. This involves cognate ephrin-A proteins on sensory axons but is independent from EphA3/4 signaling in motor axons proper. Assembly of peripheral nerve pathways thus involves motor axon subtype-specific signals that couple sensory projections to discrete motor pathways."

At the molecular level, we have recently shown that Sema3E acts on Plexin-D1 expressed in endothelial cells, thus initiating a novel antiangiogenic signaling pathway that results in the retraction of filopodia in endothelial tip cells. Sema3E induces the rapid disassembly of integrin-mediated adhesive structures, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.

Here we show that GEP100 (guanine nucleotide exchange protein 100)/Brag2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf6, mediates Sema3E-induced Arf6 activation in endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2134036551,"A hallmark of mammalian neural circuit development is the refinement of initially imprecise connections by competitive activity-dependent processes. In the developing visual system retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from the two eyes undergo activity-dependent competition for territory in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The direct contributions of synaptic transmission to this process, however, remain unclear. We used a genetic approach to reduce glutamate release selectively from ipsilateral-projecting RGCs and found that their release-deficient axons failed to exclude competing axons from the ipsilateral eye territory in the dLGN. Nevertheless, the release-deficient axons consolidated and maintained their normal amount of dLGN territory, even in the face of fully active competing axons. These results show that during visual circuit refinement glutamatergic transmission plays a direct role in excluding competing axons from inappropriate target regions, but they argue that consolidation and maintenance of axonal territory are largely insensitive to alterations in synaptic activity levels."

Identifying specific CUL4B substrates will help to better understand the physiological functions of CUL4B. Here, we report the identification of peroxiredoxin III (PrxIII) as a novel substrate of the CUL4B ubiquitin ligase complex. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry showed that PrxIII was among the proteins up-regulated in cells after RNAi-mediated CUL4B depletion. The impaired degradation of PrxIII observed in CUL4B knockdown cells was confirmed by Western blot. We further demonstrated that DDB1 and ROC1 in the DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 complex are also indispensable for the proteolysis of PrxIII. In addition, the degradation of PrxIII is independent of CUL4A, a cullin family member closely related to CUL4B. In vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays revealed that CUL4B promoted the polyubiquitination of PrxIII. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CUL4B-silenced cells, which was associated with increased resistance to hypoxia and H2O2-induced apoptosis. These findings are discussed with regard to the known function of PrxIII as a ROS scavenger and the high endogenous ROS levels required for neural stem cell proliferation.

Rather, intrinsic and network mechanisms interact to drive action potential firing, even in the absence of external stimuli. For example, multiple classes of inhibitory interneuron exhibit spontaneous spiking behavior in vivo (Gentet et al., 2010Gentet L.J. Avermann M. Matyas F. Staiger J.F. Petersen C.C.

Postsynaptic targets of inhibitory neurons are therefore subject to constantly fluctuating inhibitory synaptic conductances which do not necessarily correspond to stimulus-evoked activity (Alger and Nicoll, 1980Alger B.E.

This background input may impose a tonic inhibition that shapes neuronal integration (Mitchell and Silver, 2003Mitchell S.J. Silver R.A.

Rieke F. Noise correlations improve response fidelity and stimulus encoding.Nature. 2010; 468: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, numerous studies have also highlighted the importance of stimulus-driven inhibition in controlling the output of target neurons. For example, the precise temporal relationship between afferent-evoked excitation and inhibition imposed by feed-forward inhibitory circuits can strongly regulate spike timing in postsynaptic cells (Mittmann et al., 2005Mittmann W. Koch U. Häusser M. Feed-forward inhibition shapes the spike output of cerebellar Purkinje cells.J.

Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Despite the prevalence of spontaneous activity in interneurons, few studies have addressed whether background spontaneous firing affects how stimulus-evoked signals are conveyed by inhibitory cells. By altering neuronal excitability and/or synaptic transmission, engagement of neuromodulatory systems may provide a general way to adjust the relationship between spontaneous and evoked signals according to environmental and physiological context (Hurley et al., 2004Hurley L.M.

Within the molecular layer of the DCN, parallel fiber axons originating from DCN granule cells convey excitatory input from multiple sensory modalities to cartwheel cells as well as to fusiform cells (Oertel and Young, 2004Oertel D. Young E.D. What's a cerebellar circuit doing in the auditory system?.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This shared input between cartwheel and principal cells forms the basis for a feed-forward inhibitory network (Roberts and Trussell, 2010Roberts M.T. Trussell L.O. Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that powerfully filters the acoustic responses of principal neurons (Davis et al., 1996Davis K.A. Miller R.L. Young E.D.

Multisensory integration in the dorsal cochlear nucleus: unit responses to acoustic and trigeminal ganglion stimulation.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3334-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We found that NA enhanced inhibition elicited by parallel fiber stimulation while simultaneously reducing spontaneous inhibitory input to fusiform cells. This dual effect resulted in a large increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of parallel fiber-evoked feed-forward inhibition. Remarkably, the opposing effects of NA upon spontaneous and evoked inhibition were both due to noradrenergic elimination of cartwheel cell spontaneous spiking. Under control conditions, cartwheel synapses were tonically depressed by background spiking activity. By shutting off spontaneous spiking, NA relieved cartwheel synapses from depression and thereby enhanced glycine release in response to parallel fiber stimulation. This mechanism for neuromodulation, in which synaptic output is indirectly controlled through modulation of spontaneous activity, may have distinct advantages over direct regulation of presynaptic release probability in spontaneously firing cells. We examined whether NA affects integration of excitatory and inhibitory signals conveyed through the molecular layer circuitry of the DCN. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were acquired from fusiform cells in acute slices of mouse brainstem and synaptic currents were recorded in response to activation of parallel fibers by an extracellular stimulating electrode positioned in the DCN molecular layer (Figure 1A ). Single stimuli typically elicited weak excitatory currents and small or undetectable inhibitory currents (see first stimulus; Figure 1B, top). Because parallel fibers exhibit strong short-term facilitation (Roberts and Trussell, 2010Roberts M.T. Trussell L.O. Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Tzounopoulos et al., 2004Tzounopoulos T. Kim Y. Oertel D. Trussell L.O. Cell-specific, spike timing-dependent plasticities in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), brief stimulus trains (three stimuli at 20 Hz) were applied to recruit robust parallel fiber activity. When fusiform cells were clamped at −60 mV, intermediate to the reversal potentials for Cl− conductances (−84 mV) and excitatory conductances (∼0 mV), each stimulus elicited a sequence of inward current followed closely by outward current (Figure 1B), characteristic of direct activation of excitatory fibers followed by feed-forward recruitment of inhibitory inputs (Mittmann et al., 2005Mittmann W.

Physiol. 2005; 563: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F. Scanziani M. Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Both inward and outward components of the responses were larger for the second and third parallel fiber stimuli due to facilitation of excitatory inputs onto both fusiform and cartwheel cells (Roberts and Trussell, 2010Roberts M.T. Trussell L.O. Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with activation of disynaptic inhibition, inward and outward components of the evoked responses were largely abolished by application of NBQX (Figure 1C). When identical stimulus trains were applied in the presence of 10 μM NA, we observed a significant enhancement of the outward components of evoked currents in response to the second and third stimuli (Figures 1B, middle, and 1D; measured as total outward charge, see Experimental Procedures; stim 2 control: 701 ± 246 pA∗ms, NA: 1809 ± 561 pA∗ms, p < 0.05, n = 6; stim 3 control: 596 ± 203 pA∗ms, NA: 1680 ± 286 pA∗ms; p < 0.01, n = 6). This effect could be clearly visualized by subtracting average control responses from average currents recorded in NA (Figure 1B, bottom). Quantification of total charge in such subtracted records demonstrated a large net increase in the charge following the second and third stimuli (Figure 1E; stim 2 1158 ± 421 pA∗ms; stim 3 1271 ± 261 pA∗ms, p < 0.05 and < 0.005, respectively, one sample t test comparison to 0 pA∗ms). On average a small reduction in the total charge was observed following the first stimulus (Figure 1E; −216 ± 47 pA∗ms, p < 0.05, one sample t test comparison to 0 pA∗ms). The enhancement of net outward synaptic current by NA could reflect an increase in inhibitory conductance and/or a decrease in excitatory conductance. NA did not have any effect on the peak amplitude (EPSC1 control: −203 ± 39 pA, NA: −195 ± 31 pA, p = 0.40, n = 5) or short-term facilitation (EPSC2/1 control: 1.73 ± 0.27, NA: 1.69 ± 0.28; p = 0.59; EPSC3/1 control 1.92 ± 0.77, NA: 1.93 ± 0.38, p = 0.93, n = 5) of evoked parallel fiber EPSCs recorded from fusiform cells (inhibitory transmission blocked with 10 μM gabazine, 0.5 μM strychnine) (see Figure S1 available online). Thus, NA specifically altered inhibitory input to fusiform cells. In addition to the enhancement of stimulus-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), we also observed that NA sharply reduced spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) recorded in fusiform cells (Figure 2A ). Application of NA (10 μM) significantly decreased both frequency (Figure 2B; mean frequency control: 93.0 ± 8.2 Hz, NA: 15.3 ± 3.9 Hz; p < 0.001, paired t test, n = 6) and peak amplitude (Figure 2C; control 78.9 ± 6.5 pA, NA 46.6 ± 4.3 pA; p < 0.01, paired t test, n = 6) of spontaneous events in all cells tested. The opposing effects of NA upon spontaneous and parallel fiber stimulation-evoked IPSCs led to a dramatic shift in the balance between these two modes of inhibitory input. In control, sIPSCs occurred frequently and often had amplitudes similar to those evoked by parallel fiber stimulation (Figure 3A , top). In the presence of NA, the near elimination of spontaneous IPSCs together with the enhancement of stimulus-evoked IPSCs resulted in a marked difference between stimulus-driven versus background currents (Figure 3A, bottom). To quantify the change in background input produced by NA, we measured root-mean-square (rms) values of individual current sweeps over a 250 ms period just prior to parallel fiber stimulation (left side of Figure 3A). NA (10 μM) significantly reduced the rms of background currents (Figure 3B; control: 33.06 ± 4.45 pA, NA: 13.79 ± 1.23 pA, p < 0.005, n = 6). We quantified the change in relative amplitudes between evoked and spontaneous currents by dividing evoked IPSC peak amplitudes by the rms of background currents (signal-to-noise ratio). Signal-to-noise of the first parallel fiber stimulus was not significantly changed between control and NA (1.36 ± 0.50 and 2.83 ± 1.36, respectively; p = 0.16), but NA application resulted in a 7-8-fold change in signal-to-noise ratios for the second and third stimuli in a train (stim 2 control: 3.3 ± 1.3, NA: 23.2 ± 6.9, p < 0.02; stim 3 control 2.8 ± 0.7, NA: 22.1 ± 3.9, p < 0.005; n = 6; Figure 3C). These results indicate that in the presence of NA, feed-forward inhibition evoked by parallel-fiber activity dominates over spontaneous inputs. DCN principal neurons receive inhibitory inputs from several subtypes of interneuron (Oertel and Young, 2004Oertel D. Young E.D. What's a cerebellar circuit doing in the auditory system?.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the noradrenergic elimination of fusiform cell sIPSCs is probably due to effects of NA on the spontaneous firing of presynaptic cartwheel cells. First, cartwheels are the most numerous molecular layer interneuron type (Lorente de No, 1981Lorente de No R. The Primary Acoustic Nuclei. Raven Press, New York1981Google Scholar) and have a high probability of forming strong synaptic connections onto nearby fusiform cells (Mancilla and Manis, 2009Mancilla J.G. Manis P.B.

Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, >75% of cartwheel cells fire spontaneously under similar recording conditions to those used here (Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O. Ion channels generating complex spikes in cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1705-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, cartwheel cells are distinguished from other DCN neurons by their ability to fire high-frequency (∼200 Hz) bursts of action potentials termed complex spikes (Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O. Ion channels generating complex spikes in cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J.

Cartwheel and superficial stellate cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus of mice: intracellular recordings in slices.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 1384-1397PubMed Google Scholar) and complex spike-like bursts of spontaneous IPSCs were frequently observed in all cells (Golding and Oertel, 1997Golding N.L. Oertel D. Physiological identification of the targets of cartwheel cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 248-260PubMed Google Scholar, Roberts and Trussell, 2010Roberts M.T. Trussell L.O. Molecular layer inhibitory interneurons provide feedforward and lateral inhibition in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether NA affects cartwheel cell spontaneous behavior using extracellular loose cell-attached recordings. Consistent with previous results (Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O. Ion channels generating complex spikes in cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1705-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 72.4% (63/87 cells) of cartwheel cells fired APs spontaneously in control conditions. Also in agreement with previous work (Golding and Oertel, 1997Golding N.L. Oertel D. Physiological identification of the targets of cartwheel cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 248-260PubMed Google Scholar, Kim and Trussell, 2007Kim Y. Trussell L.O. Ion channels generating complex spikes in cartwheel cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 1705-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), control spontaneous spiking was not regular but instead was characterized by brief periods of spiking activity separated by periods of quiescence, each of which could last from ∼0.5 s up to several seconds (Figure 4A ). Spiking periods consisted primarily of simple spikes occurring at a frequency of ∼20–30 Hz (Figures 4B and 4C) and in 6/11 cells included one or two high-frequency (∼200 Hz) complex spike bursts per spiking period (“complex spiking”; Figures 4B and 4C). The mean firing rate in control was 13.6 ± 2.0 Hz (range 4.5 to 25.9 Hz, n = 11). NA application (10 μM) resulted in almost complete elimination of spontaneous spiking in all cartwheel cells tested (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4D–4F; spike rate reduced to 4.8% ± 3.0% of control, n = 6). This effect was reversed by the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist idazoxan (1 μM; Figures 4E and 4F; 101.9% ± 7.3% control spike rate in NA + idazoxan, n = 5; not significantly different than 100% control rate, p = 0.80, one-sample t test) and was mimicked by the α2 agonists UK14304 (1 μM; 19.8% ± 10.4% control rate, n = 8) and clonidine (5 μM; 14.8% ± 13.0% control rate, n = 4) (Figure 4F). In contrast, NA was equally effective at eliminating cartwheel spiking when applied alone, or in the presence of the α1 antagonist prazosin (0.1 μM) or the β receptor antagonist propranolol (20 μM) (Figure 4F; NA reduced spike rate to 8.2% ± 7.3%, n = 4, and 0.8% ± 0.8%, n = 6, of control, respectively). Thus, NA silences cartwheel cell spontaneous spiking and this effect is mediated solely by α2 adrenergic receptors. NA could affect parallel fiber-evoked inhibition of fusiform cells through several potential mechanisms. NA is known to directly alter neurotransmitter release from multiple cell types by activating adrenergic receptors located on or near presynaptic axon terminals (Kondo and Marty, 1997Kondo S. Marty A. Protein kinase A-mediated enhancement of miniature IPSC frequency by noradrenaline in rat cerebellar stellate cells.J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Leão and Von Gersdorff, 2002Leão R.M. Von Gersdorff H. Noradrenaline increases high-frequency firing at the calyx of held synapse during development by inhibiting glutamate release.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether direct enhancement of glutamate release from parallel fibers onto cartwheel cells and/or glycine release from cartwheel cell terminals could account for the observed increase in parallel fiber-evoked feed-forward inhibition of fusiform cells induced by NA. To determine whether noradrenergic strengthening of parallel fiber inputs could contribute to enhanced recruitment of cartwheel cell activity, we made whole-cell recordings from cartwheel cells and measured EPSCs in response to parallel fiber stimulation (inhibitory currents blocked with 10 μM gabazine, 0.5 μM strychnine; Figures 5A and 5B ). NA did not alter the peak amplitude (Figure 5C; EPSC1 in control: −382 ± 105 pA, NA: −336 ± 85 pA, p = 0.30, n = 6) or short-term facilitation (Figure 5D; EPSC2/EPSC1 control: 2.25 ± 0.12, NA: 2.14 ± 0.11, p = 0.39, n = 6; EPSC3/EPSC1 control: 2.96 ± 0.23, NA: 2.75 ± 0.14, p = 0.19, n = 6) of parallel fiber EPSCs. Thus, the increase in feed-forward inhibition of fusiform cells was not due to a change in excitatory input to cartwheel cells. To test whether NA could act directly on cartwheel cell axon terminals to modulate glycine release, we acquired simultaneous whole-cell recordings from synaptically connected pairs of cartwheel and fusiform cells. Three simple spikes at 20 ms intervals were elicited by brief depolarizing current injections into presynaptic cartwheel cells held in current clamp and the resulting unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) were recorded in postsynaptic fusiform cells held in voltage clamp (Figure 5E). NA application did not alter the peak amplitude (Figure 5F; uIPSC1 in control: 557 ± 176 pA, NA: 552 ± 187 pA, p = 0.89, n = 6 pairs) or short-term depression (Figure 5G; uIPSC2/uIPSC1 control: 0.55 ± 0.02, NA: 0.59 ± 0.01, p = 0.10, n = 6 pairs; uIPSC3/uIPSC1 control: 0.40 ± 0.01, NA: 0.42 ± 0.01, p = 0.31, n = 6 pairs) of uIPSCs. Thus, NA does not change spontaneous or evoked cartwheel cell-mediated inhibition of fusiform neurons by directly affecting release from cartwheel synapses. Taken together with the lack of effect on EPSCs, it appears that NA regulates inhibitory transmission through a mechanism completely independent of conventional presynaptic modulation. Subthreshold changes in somatic membrane potential (Vm) can alter synaptic transmission (Alle and Geiger, 2006Alle H. Geiger J.R. Combined analog and action potential coding in hippocampal mossy fibers.Science. 2006; 311: 1290-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2006Shu Y. Hasenstaub A. Duque A. Yu Y. McCormick D.A. Modulation of intracortical synaptic potentials by presynaptic somatic membrane potential.Nature. 2006; 441: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Because NA likely exerted its effects on spontaneous spiking by hyperpolarizing cartwheel cells, we examined cartwheel synaptic output in three additional connected cartwheel and fusiform cell pairs while holding the presynaptic cartwheel Vm at either −79.4 ± 0.9 mV (Vrest) or −89.6 ± 0.6 mV (Vhyperpol) using bias current injection in current-clamp (not shown). Both potentials were below threshold for spontaneous firing. Hyperpolarization of Vm did not affect uIPSC peak amplitude (uIPSC1 Vrest 834 ± 346 pA, Vhyperpol 802 ± 332, p = 0.39; uIPSC1 Vhyperpol/Vrest 0.97 ± 0.02) or short-term depression in response to trains of presynaptic action potentials (3 APs at 50 Hz) (uIPSC2/1 Vrest 0.57 ± 0.02, Vhyperpol 0.53 ± 0.03, p = 0.35; uIPSC3/1 Vrest 0.43 ± 0.06, Vhyperpol 0.44 ± 0.03, p = 0.79). We wondered whether elimination of spontaneous cartwheel spiking might somehow contribute to the enhancement of feed-forward inhibition by NA. Because silencing of cartwheel cell spontaneous spiking was dependent on α2-adrenergic receptors (Figures 4E and 4F), we tested whether α2-receptors were similarly required for the noradrenergic enhancement of feed-forward inhibition. Current responses to parallel fiber train stimulation were recorded in fusiform cells in control conditions, then in NA (10 μM), followed by NA (10 μM) and idazoxan ("

https://openalex.org/W2125751506,"The fibrillation of amyloidogenic proteins is a critical step in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. There is major interest in the therapeutic intervention on such aberrant aggregation phenomena, and the utilization of polyaromatic scaffolds has lately received considerable attention. In this regard, the molecular and structural basis of the anti-amyloidogenicity of polyaromatic compounds, required to evolve this molecular scaffold toward therapeutic drugs, is not known in detail. We present here biophysical and biochemical studies that have enabled us to characterize the interaction of metal-substituted, tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines (PcTS) with α-synuclein (AS), the major protein component of amyloid-like deposits in Parkinson disease. The inhibitory activity of the assayed compounds on AS amyloid fibril formation decreases in the order PcTS[Ni(II)] ~ PcTS > PcTS[Zn(II)] >> PcTS[Al(III)] ≈ 0. Using NMR and electronic absorption spectroscopies we demonstrated conclusively that the differences in binding capacity and anti-amyloid activity of phthalocyanines on AS are attributed to their relative ability to self-stack through π-π interactions, modulated by the nature of the metal ion bound at the molecule. Low order stacked aggregates of phthalocyanines were identified as the active amyloid inhibitory species, whose effects are mediated by residue specific interactions. Such sequence-specific anti-amyloid behavior of self-stacked phthalocyanines contrasts strongly with promiscuous amyloid inhibitors with self-association capabilities that act via nonspecific sequestration of AS molecules. The new findings reported here constitute an important contribution for future drug discovery efforts targeting amyloid formation."

In contrast, ET1 recruits and activates PKD that remains predominantly sarcolemmal.

https://openalex.org/W2106359500,"Caveolin-1 plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis, which is mainly attributed to its effects on low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) transcytosis. However, caveolin-1 has also been implicated in the regulation of inflammation. We investigated the effects of caveolin-1 deficiency in atherosclerosis with its accompanying changes in plaque- and lymphoid-related immunology and inflammation. Cav1-/- Apoe-/- mice exhibited a 15-fold reduction in plaque size with plaques containing fewer macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils. Intravital microscopy revealed 83% less leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall in Cav1-/- Apoe-/- mice, which could be attributed to reduced endothelial chemokine li-gand-2 (CCL-2/MCP-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression. Caveolin-1 deficiency resulted in a 57% increase in regulatory T cells and a 4% decrease in CD4+ effector T cells in lymphoid organs. Bone marrow transplantations revealed that Cav1-/-Apoe-/- mice receiving Cav1+/+Apoe-/- or Cav1-/- Apoe-/- bone marrow presented 4- to 4.5-fold smaller plaques with no additional phenotypic changes. In contrast, atherosclerosis was not affected in Cav1+/+ Apoe-/- recipients receiving Cav1-/- Apoe-/- or Cav1+/+ Apoe-/- bone marrow. However, the presence of Cav1-/- Apoe-/- bone marrow was associated with an anti-inflammatory T-cell profile. Our study reveals that nonhematopoietic caveolin-1 determines plaque size, whereas hematopoietic caveolin-1 regulates lymphoid immune-modulation.

However, the role of WWP1 in cellular senescence is still unknown. Here, we show that the expression patterns of p27(Kip1) and WWP1 are inversely correlated during cellular senescence. Moreover, the overexpression of WWP1 delayed senescence, whereas the knockdown of WWP1 led to premature senescence in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WWP1 repressed endogenous p27(Kip1) expression through ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Additionally, WWP1 had a strong preference for catalyzing the Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of p27(Kip1) in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that WWP1 markedly inhibited the replicative senescence induced by p27(Kip1) by promoting p27(Kip1) degradation. Therefore, our study provides a new molecular mechanism for the regulation of cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1997980682,"Deregulation of the mitotic spindle has been implicated in genomic instability, an important aspect of tumorigenesis and malignant transformation. To ensure the fidelity of chromosome transmission, the mitotic spindle is assembled by exquisite mechanisms and orchestrated by centrosomes in animal cells. Centrosomal proteins especially are thought to act coordinately to ensure accurate spindle formation, but the molecular details remain to be investigated. In this study, we report the molecular characterization and functional analysis of a novel centrosomal protein, Cep70. Our data show that Cep70 localizes to the centrosome throughout the cell cycle and binds to the key centrosomal component, γ-tubulin, through the peptide fragments that contain the coiled-coil domains. Our data further reveal that the centrosomal localization pattern of Cep70 is dependent on its interaction with γ-tubulin. Strikingly, Cep70 plays a significant role in the organization of both preexisting and nascent microtubules in interphase cells. In addition, Cep70 is necessary for the organization and orientation of the bipolar spindle during mitosis. These results thus report for the first time the identification of Cep70 as an important centrosomal protein that interacts with γ-tubulin and underscore its critical role in the regulation of mitotic spindle assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2019222394,"Termination of signaling of activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis. It is well established that β-arrestin redistributes to phosphorylated GPCRs and thereby facilitates desensitization of classical G protein-dependent signaling. β-Arrestin in turn serves as a scaffold to initiate a second wave of signaling. Here, we report a molecular mechanism that regulates the termination of unconventional β-arrestin-dependent GPCR signaling. We identify protein phosphatase 1β (PP1β) as a phosphatase for the cluster of phosphorylated threonines ((353)TTETQRT(359)) within the sst(2A) somatostatin receptor carboxyl terminus that mediates β-arrestin binding using siRNA knock-down screening. We show that PP1β-mediated sst(2A) dephosphorylation is initiated directly after receptor activation at or near the plasma membrane. As a functional consequence of diminished PP1β activity, we find that somatostatin- and substance P-induced but not epidermal growth factor-induced ERK activation was aberrantly enhanced and prolonged. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for fine tuning unconventional β-arrestin-dependent GPCR signaling in that recruitment of PP1β to activated GPCRs facilitates GPCR dephosphorylation and, hence, leads to disruption of the β-arrestin-GPCR complex."
https://openalex.org/W2130001850,"Helicobacter pylori induces cytokine mediated changes in gastroduodenal pathophysiology, wherein, the activated macrophages at the sub-mucosal space play a central role in mounting innate immune response against the antigens. The bacterium gains niche through persistent inflammation and local immune-suppression causing peptic ulcer disease or chronic gastritis; the latter being a significant risk factor for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. What favors persistence of H. pylori in the gastric niches is not clearly understood. We report detailed characterization of a functionally unknown gene (HP986), which was detected in patient isolates associated with peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma. Expression and purification of recombinant HP986 (rHP986) revealed a novel, ∼29 kDa protein in biologically active form which associates with significant levels of humoral immune responses in diseased individuals (p<0.001). Also, it induced significant levels of TNF-α and Interleukin-8 in cultured human macrophages concurrent to the translocation of nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB). Further, the rHP986 induced apoptosis of cultured macrophages through a Fas mediated pathway. Dissection of the underlying signaling mechanism revealed that rHP986 induces both TNFR1 and Fas expression to lead to apoptosis. We further demonstrated interaction of HP986 with TNFR1 through computational and experimental approaches. Independent proinflammatory and apoptotic responses triggered by rHP986 as shown in this study point to its role, possibly as a survival strategy to gain niche through inflammation and to counter the activated macrophages to avoid clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2116854122,"Neural encoding of sensory signals involves both linear and nonlinear processes. Determining which nonlinear operations are implemented by neural systems is crucial to understanding sensory processing. Here, we ask if demodulation, the process used to decode AM radio signals, describes how Y cells in the cat LGN nonlinearly encode the visual scene. In response to visual AM signals across a wide range of carrier frequencies, Y cells were found to transmit a demodulated signal, with the firing rate of single-units fluctuating at the envelope frequency but not the carrier frequency. A comparison of temporal frequency tuning properties between LGN Y cells and neurons in two primary cortical areas suggests that Y cells initiate a distinct pathway that carries a demodulated representation of the visual scene to cortex. The nonlinear signal processing carried out by the Y cell pathway simplifies the neural representation of complex visual features and allows high spatiotemporal frequencies to drive cortical responses."
https://openalex.org/W2037092478,"Tumor suppressor protein p53, our most critical defense against tumorigenesis, can be made powerless by mechanisms such as mutations and inhibitors. Fortilin, a 172-amino acid polypeptide with potent anti-apoptotic activity, is up-regulated in many human malignancies. However, the exact mechanism by which fortilin exerts its anti-apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here we present significant insight. Fortilin binds specifically to the sequence-specific DNA binding domain of p53. The interaction of fortilin with p53 blocks p53-induced transcriptional activation of Bax. In addition, fortilin, but not a double point mutant of fortilin lacking p53 binding, inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, cells with wild-type p53 and fortilin, but not cells with wild-type p53 and the double point mutant of fortilin lacking p53 binding, fail to induce Bax gene and apoptosis, leading to the formation of large tumor in athymic mice. Our results suggest that fortilin is a novel p53-interacting molecule and p53 inhibitor and that it is a logical molecular target in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2028700559,"Collagen deposition by fibroblasts contributes to scarring in fibrotic diseases. Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by cAMP represents a pivotal brake on fibroblast activation, and the lipid mediator prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) exerts its well known anti-fibrotic actions through cAMP signaling. However, fibrotic fibroblasts from the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or of mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis, are resistant to the normal collagen-inhibiting action of PGE(2). In this study, we demonstrate that plasminogen activation to plasmin restores PGE(2) sensitivity in fibrotic lung fibroblasts from human and mouse. This involves amplified PKA signaling resulting from the promotion of new interactions between AKAP9 and PKA regulatory subunit II in the perinuclear region as well as from the inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A. This is the first report to show that an extracellular mediator can dramatically reorganize and amplify the intracellular PKA-A-kinase anchoring protein signaling network and suggests a new strategy to control collagen deposition by fibrotic fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1993473011,"The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) consists of several transmembrane and intracellular scaffolding elements that have been implicated in maintaining the structure and morphology of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Genetic linkage analysis has identified loss-of-function mutations in DAPC genes that give rise to degenerative muscular dystrophies. Although much is known about the involvement of the DAPC in maintaining muscle integrity, less is known about the precise contribution of the DAPC in cell signaling events. To better characterize the functional role of the DAPC at the NMJ, we used electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescent labeling to directly assess cholinergic synaptic transmission, ion channel localization, and muscle excitability in loss-of-function (lf) mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans DAPC homologues. We found that all DAPC mutants consistently display mislocalization of the Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channel, SLO-1, in muscle cells, while ionotropic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) expression and localization at the NMJ remained unaltered. Synaptic cholinergic signaling was also not significantly impacted across DAPC(lf) mutants. Consistent with these findings and the postsynaptic mislocalization of SLO-1, we observed an increase in muscle excitability downstream of cholinergic signaling. Based on our results, we conclude that the DAPC is not involved in regulating AChR architecture at the NMJ, but rather functions to control muscle excitability, in an activity-dependent manner, through the proper localization of SLO-1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2090343162,"Neurotransmitter release by catecholaminergic cells is negatively regulated by prohormone cleavage products formed from plasmin-mediated proteolysis. Here, we investigated the expression and subcellular localization of Plg-RKT, a novel plasminogen receptor, and its role in catecholaminergic cell plasminogen activation and regulation of catecholamine release. Prominent staining with anti-Plg-RKT mAb was observed in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells in murine and human tissue. In Western blotting, Plg-RKT was highly expressed in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells, human pheochromocytoma tissue, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, and murine hippocampus. Expression of Plg-RKT fused in-frame to GFP resulted in targeting of the GFP signal to the cell membrane. Phase partitioning, co-immunoprecipitation with urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and FACS analysis with antibody directed against the C terminus of Plg-RKT were consistent with Plg-RKT being an integral plasma membrane protein on the surface of catecholaminergic cells. Cells stably overexpressing Plg-RKT exhibited substantial enhancement of plasminogen activation, and antibody blockade of non-transfected PC12 cells suppressed plasminogen activation. In functional secretion assays, nicotine-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release from cells overexpressing Plg-RKT was markedly decreased (by 51 ± 2%, p < 0.001) when compared with control transfected cells, and antibody blockade increased [3H]norepinephrine release from non-transfected PC12 cells. In summary, Plg-RKT is present on the surface of catecholaminergic cells and functions to stimulate plasminogen activation and modulate catecholamine release. Plg-RKT thus represents a new mechanism and novel control point for regulating the interface between plasminogen activation and neurosecretory cell function.

Plg-RKT thus represents a new mechanism and novel control point for regulating the interface between plasminogen activation and neurosecretory cell function. Plasmin, a broad spectrum serine protease, is the major enzyme responsible for dissolving fibrin clots. Plasmin is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the circulating zymogen, plasminogen, by either of the plasminogen activators, tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) 2The abbreviations used are: t-PAtissue plasminogen activatorPlg-RKTplasminogen receptorKTPIpropidium iodideu-PAurokinaseuPARurokinase type plasminogen activator receptorWGAwheat germ agglutininpNAp-nitroanilide. or urokinase. Studies conducted in the past decade have revealed key non-fibrinolytic functions of these proteins that include major interactions between catecholaminergic and plasminogen activation pathways that may substantially influence catecholamine release. Specifically, prohormones, secreted by cells within the sympathoadrenal system, are processed by plasmin into bioactive peptides that locally modulate (inhibit) sympathoadrenal catecholamine release to provide an autocrine, homeostatic (negative feedback) mechanism to modify the function of the local neurosecretory cells and regulate catecholamine release during stress (1Parmer R.J.

In addition, t-PA is co-stored and co-released with catecholamines and prohormones from catecholamine storage vesicles within catecholaminergic cells of the sympathoadrenal system, including chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and sympathetic neurons (4Gualandris A.

Furthermore, catecholaminergic cells have a high binding capacity for plasminogen and, therefore, plasminogen activation and local prohormone processing are markedly enhanced when plasminogen is bound to the surface of these cells (1Parmer R.J.

Carboxypeptidase B treatment decreases cell-dependent plasminogen activation by ∼90%, suggesting that the binding of plasminogen to proteins exposing C-terminal basic residues on the cell surface is required to promote plasminogen activation (8Miles L.A.

The Plg-RKT protein includes 147 amino acids with a molecular mass of 17,261 Da. Plg-RKT is synthesized with and exposes a C-terminal basic residue (lysine) on the cell surface, in an orientation to promote cell-dependent plasminogen activation. Furthermore, Plg-RKT is highly conserved with high interspecies homology (e.g. human versus mouse = 94% similarity), high identity, and no gaps in the sequence among the 20 mammalian orthologs for which sequence information is available (9Andronicos N.M.

In the present study, we have examined catecholaminergic cells and tissues for expression of Plg-RKT and investigated the subcellular localization and function of Plg-RKT in catecholaminergic cells. The results of our study suggest that Plg-RKT is a key regulator of catecholaminergic cell plasminogen activation and of neurotransmitter release.

Single-chain recombinant human t-PA was from EMD Chemicals (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-Plg-RKT antibodies were raised in rabbits and monoclonal anti-Plg-RKT antibodies were raised in mice against the synthetic peptide, CEQSKFFSDK (corresponding to the nine C-terminal amino acids of rat Plg-RKT with an amino-terminal cysteine added for coupling), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were selected for direct binding to immobilized CEQSKFFSDK coupled to bovine serum albumin and for the ability to inhibit specific plasminogen binding to CEQSKFFSDK. Anti-Plg-RKT mAb was pan-specific, reacting with the C-terminal nonapeptides of mouse, rat, and human Plg-RKT with equivalent affinity.

We subcloned the full-length 443-bp Plg-RKT cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pAcGFP1-C1 (Clontech) using BglII and SalI cloning sites to produce the pAcGFP-Plg-RKT construct (encoding the GFP-Plg-RKT fusion protein with Plg-RKT fused in-frame at the C terminus). We also subcloned the full-length 443-bp Plg-RKT cDNA into the mammalian expression vector, pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI), driven by the CMV promoter, to produce the construct, pCIneo-Plg-RKT. Constructs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Promega). Normal human and mouse adrenal samples were on tissue microarrays (Imgenex array IMH-372) (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) or histological slides. After dewaxing, tissue microarrays or histological slides were incubated with anti-Plg-RKT mAb followed by secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody and developed using the Envision Plus HRP system (DakoCytomation and diaminobenzidine-based detection method) in an automated Dako Autostainer universal staining system (15Krajewska M.

The slides were scanned on a ScanScope CM-1 scanner (Aperio Technology, Vista, CA). Tissues were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Subcellular fractionation was carried out by Dounce homogenization followed by centrifugation steps as used previously in our laboratory (9Andronicos N.M. Chen E.I. Baik N. Bai H. Parmer C.M.

Proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 4–20% gradient gels under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with anti-Plg-RKT antibodies. The membranes were incubated with an anti-mouse antibody-HRP conjugate, developed using an ECL substrate (Pierce), and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film (Fisher). Harvesting of mouse tissue was performed under an experimental protocol approved by The Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Confocal images were captured using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope running the latest Zen 2009 Zeiss software suite (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). All images were then imported and further analyzed for quantitative colocalization using two independent software packages: LSM examiner (Zeiss) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Colocalization between fluorescently labeled Plg-RKT with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was quantified by obtaining the threshold range of real over background signal and then using the average real threshold range to calculate the correlation coefficients (M values) of at least 40 cells in three separate experiments. To define the number and size of each fluorescently labeled aggregate, images were imported into Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda MD) where each cell was outlined and a similar threshold range (as described above) was used to define a real signal within each cell. Once this range was defined, the software then automatically extracted parameters, such as area, perimeter total number, and average fluorescence intensity of the fluorescently labeled proteins per cell. Cells were preincubated with 2.7 μm Glu-plasminogen at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 20 nm t-PA was added. Plasmin activity (expressed as optical density at 405 nm) was measured after 3 min by diluting the reaction mixture 1:10 into d-VLK-pNA (DiaPharma Group Inc., Franklin, OH) to a final concentration of 1 mm and monitoring absorbance at 405 nm as described (16Félez J.

Subconfluent, adherent PC12 cells that had been cultured for 48 h without a change of medium were harvested by rinsing flasks twice with PBS at 4 °C and then detached with 5 mm EDTA/PBS at 37 °C for 5 min.

Briefly, for the detection of cell surface Plg-RKT on viable PC12 cells, indirect immunofluorescence staining and dual-color FACS analyses were performed. Cells (2 × 105 cells) were incubated with 40 μg/ml anti-Plg-RKT mAb IgG or isotype control IgG for 30 min in binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA) at 4 °C. The cells were washed once with 200 μl of binding buffer and incubated with FITC-labeled secondary IgG for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. The cells were washed again, resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer containing the non-vital dye, propidium iodide (PI), at 5 μg/ml, and the cells were immediately analyzed by dual-color FACS as described (8Miles L.A.

Briefly, PC12 cells were labeled for 2 h with [3H]norepinephrine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 1 μCi/ml in cell culture medium, washed twice with release buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in release buffer in either the presence or the absence of 60 μm nicotine. After aspirating the release buffer, the cells were harvested and lysed in release buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. [3H]Norepinephrine content of release buffer and cell lysates was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of release was calculated as the percentage of secretion (amount released/(amount released + amount in cell lysate)), and results were expressed as net release (percentage of secretagogue-stimulated release minus percentage of basal release). In control studies, the density of secretory vesicles was assessed and compared in transfected PC12 cells. Electron micrographs were obtained using methods similar to those we have used previously to evaluate transfected PC12 cells (12Parmer R.J. Xi X.P. Wu H.J. Helman L.J. Petz L.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1042-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate with 3 mm calcium chloride, washed twice with 0.2 m sodium cacodylate, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate. The cells were enrobed with 2% agarose, cut into 1-mm cubes, and stained en bloc with 4% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol. A graded ethanol series was used for dehydration, and propylene oxide was used as a transitional solvent. Cell cubes were embedded in Embed 812 and polymerized in a 60 °C oven. Semithin sections of 1 μm were cut on a Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and stained with toluidine blue. Thin sections were cut at 70 nm, collected on 200 mesh copper grids, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Grids were imaged at 80 kV using a Zeiss EM 10C transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan ES1000W digital camera. Secretory vesicle density was determined in random electron micrographs, evaluating cytoplasmic area within 1 μm of the plasma membrane surface, using Image-Pro Plus software version 6.3, Media Cybernetics, Inc. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Results were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. In our previous analysis of catecholaminergic cell plasminogen receptors, a major unknown carboxypeptidase B-sensitive protein migrating with an Mrapp of 17.2 × 103 was detected in plasminogen-ligand blotting of two-dimensional gels of PC12 membrane preparations, in addition to actin (8Miles L.A. Andronicos N.M. Baik N. Parmer R.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13017-13024Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated expression of Plg-RKT, a novel, structurally unique plasminogen receptor (Mrapp = 17.2 × 103) (9Andronicos N.M. Chen E.I. Baik N. Bai H. Parmer C.M. Kiosses W.B. Kamps M.P. Yates 3rd, J.R. Parmer R.J. Miles L.A. Blood. 2010; 115: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), in human and murine adrenal tissues. Prominent staining with anti-Plg-RKT mAb was observed in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells in both human (Fig. 1A) and murine (Fig. 1C) adrenal tissue samples. In specificity controls, no immunostaining was detected in cells preincubated with the peptide used for immunization, CEQSKFFSDK (corresponding to the nine C-terminal amino acids of rat Plg-RKT with an amino-terminal cysteine added for coupling) (Fig. 1, B and D). Expression of Plg-RKT was also detected in Western blotting of catecholaminergic cells and tissues (Fig. 2). Plg-RKT was detected as a specific immunoreactive band migrating with an Mrapp of 17.2 × 103 in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. The Plg-RKT protein was also prominently expressed in human pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-producing tumor of the adrenal medulla, and hence, a source of human chromaffin cells, and PC12 cells (a well established chromaffin cell line with abundant catecholamine storage vesicles, derived from rat pheochromocytoma (11Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar)). Plg-RKT was also highly expressed in murine hippocampus, representing a non-adrenal source of catecholaminergic cells. The bands migrated with the same Mrapp as the protein expressed by M-CSF-differentiated Hoxa9-ER4 cells, from which Plg-RKT was initially isolated (Fig. 2). In additional specificity controls, minimal expression of Plg-RKT was detected in membranes of undifferentiated progenitor Hox9-ER4 cells as described (9Andronicos N.M. Chen E.I. Baik N. Bai H. Parmer C.M. Kiosses W.B. Kamps M.P. Yates 3rd, J.R. Parmer R.J. Miles L.A. Blood. 2010; 115: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and no reactivity was detected with isotype control (not shown). These results demonstrate prominent expression of the Plg-RKT protein in catecholaminergic cells and tissues. To assess subcellular localization of Plg-RKT and to determine whether the Plg-RKT protein contains a dominant plasma membrane trafficking signal, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with pAcGFP-Plg-RKT (in which the Plg-RKT cDNA was inserted in-frame for expression of a GFP-Plg-RKT fusion protein, with Plg-RKT at the C terminus) or with the pAcGFP empty vector. Cell lysates were Western blotted with anti-Plg-RKT polyclonal IgG (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) or anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). In cells transfected with pAcGFP-Plg-RKT, an immunoreactive band migrating with an Mrapp of ∼40 × 103 was detected with both anti-Plg-RKT and anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4), consistent with expression of the GFP-Plg-RKT fusion protein. In cells transfected with the pAcGFP empty vector, a band with an Mrapp of 23 × 103 was detected using the anti-GFP antibody, corresponding to GFP expressed by the vector without insert (Fig. 3A, lane 3). A band migrating with an Mrapp of 17.2 × 103, corresponding to the endogenous Plg-RKT protein, was also detected with the anti-Plg-RKT antibody in cells transfected with pAcGFP-Plg-RKT or transfected with the pAcGFP empty vector control (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In controls, no bands were detected with preimmune IgG (data not shown). Confocal microscopy was performed to examine the subcellular localization and expression of the GFP-Plg-RKT fusion protein. Cells expressing GFP-Plg-RKT showed membrane localization that was highly colocalized (79 ± 5%) with WGA, a well established cell surface marker on non-permeabilized fixed cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the GFP fluorescent signal in cells transfected with vector alone was diffuse and cytoplasmic and did not significantly colocalize (9 ± 5%) with WGA. Thus, fusion of GFP to Plg-RKT resulted in trafficking of GFP to the plasma membrane. We also tested whether endogenously expressed (native) Plg-RKT behaved as an integral membrane protein in catecholaminergic cells. Non-transfected PC12 cells were subjected to phase separation in Triton X-114 as described (18Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Estreicher A. Wohlwend A. Belin D. Schleuning W.D. Vassalli J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this technique, integral membrane proteins are recovered in the detergent phase, whereas hydrophilic proteins remain in the aqueous phase. An immunoreactive band corresponding to Plg-RKT was detected in the detergent phase, but was not detected in the aqueous phase (Fig. 4A). In controls for the method, when the cell lysates were spiked with BSA and subjected to phase partitioning, BSA was detected in the aqueous, but not the detergent, phase. To further assess the plasma membrane localization of endogenous Plg-RKT, we assessed the physical association of Plg-RKT with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface receptor (20Blasi F. Sidenius N. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In co-immunoprecipitation studies, anti-Plg-RKT antibody immunoprecipitated both Plg-RKT and uPAR from membrane fractions of non-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 4B). To evaluate the cell surface expression of the C terminus of endogenous Plg-RKT, PC12 cells were subjected to FACS analysis with anti-Plg-RKT mAb, raised against the C-terminal peptide of Plg-RKT. Prominent binding of anti-Plg-RKT mAb to the cell surface was observed (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with Plg-RKT behaving as an integral plasma membrane protein on the surface of catecholaminergic cells. Plasminogen activation is enhanced when plasminogen is bound to catecholaminergic cells (1Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Gong Y. Mahata S.K. Jiang Q. O'Connor D.T. Xi X.P. Miles L.A. J. Clin.

Andronicos N.M. Baik N. Parmer R.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13017-13024Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of Plg-RKT in plasminogen activation. We subcloned the full-length 443-bp Plg-RKT cDNA into the mammalian expression vector, pCIneo, for constitutive overexpression of full-length Plg-RKT driven by the CMV promoter. Transfection of PC12 cells with pCIneo-Plg-RKT resulted in prominent enhanced expression of Plg-RKT on the cell surface (Fig. 5A) that was substantially greater than the surface expression of endogenous Plg-RKT by cells stably expressing the control pCIneo vector without insert (Fig. 5B). We compared plasminogen activation on cells stably overexpressing Plg-RKT with plasminogen activation on control cells stably expressing the pCIneo empty vector. Cells stably transfected with the pCIneo empty vector stimulated plasminogen activation in a cell concentration-dependent fashion, consistent with our previously published results (1Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Gong Y. Mahata S.K. Jiang Q. O'Connor D.T. Xi X.P. Miles L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Miles L.A. Hawley S.B. Parmer R.J. Ann. N.Y.

With cells stably overexpressing Plg-RKT, stimulation of plasminogen activation was markedly enhanced when compared with stimulation with cells transfected with empty vector (p < 0.001 at all cell concentrations tested) (Fig. 5C). These results support a prominent role of Plg-RKT in cell surface plasminogen activation. Localization of plasminogen on catecholaminergic"
https://openalex.org/W2132116103,"Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are receptors believed to be important for regulation of cellular activation and inflammation. Several pathogenic microbes bind specific Siglecs via sialic acid-containing structures at the microbial surface, interactions that may result in modulation of host responses. Recently, it was shown that the group B Streptococcus (GBS) binds to human Siglec-5 (hSiglec-5), an inhibitory receptor expressed on macrophages and neutrophils, via the IgA-binding surface β protein, providing the first example of a protein/protein interaction between a pathogenic microbe and a Siglec. Here we show that the hSiglec-5-binding part of β resides in the N-terminal half of the protein, which also harbors the previously determined IgA-binding region. We constructed bacterial mutants expressing variants of the β protein with non-overlapping deletions in the N-terminal half of the protein. Using these mutants and recombinant β fragments, we showed that the hSiglec-5-binding site is located in the most N-terminal part of β (B6N region; amino acids 1-152) and that the hSiglec-5- and IgA-binding domains in β are completely separate. We showed with BIAcore(TM) analysis that tandem variants of the hSiglec-5- and IgA-binding domains bind to their respective ligands with high affinity. Finally, we showed that the B6N region, but not the IgA-binding region of β, triggers recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to hSiglec-5 in U937 monocytes. Taken together, we have identified and isolated the first microbial non-sialic acid Siglec-binding region that can be used as a tool in studies of the β/hSiglec-5 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2018249555,"Background The use of RNAi in both basic and translational research often requires expression of multiple siRNAs from the same vector. Methods/Principal Findings We have developed a novel chicken miR126-based artificial miRNA expression system that can express one, two or three miRNAs from a single cassette in a lentiviral vector. We show that each of the miRNAs expressed from the same lentiviral vector is capable of potent inhibition of reporter gene expression in transient transfection and stable integration assays in chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells. Transduction of Vero cells with lentivirus expressing two or three different anti-influenza miRNAs leads to inhibition of influenza virus production. In addition, the chicken miR126-based expression system effectively inhibits reporter gene expression in human, monkey, dog and mouse cells. These results demonstrate that the flanking regions of a single primary miRNA can support processing of three different stem-loops in a single vector. Conclusions/Significance This novel design expands the means to express multiple miRNAs from the same vector for potent and effective silencing of target genes and influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W2078868489,"It is now widely accepted that at an early stage in the evolution of life an RNA world arose, in which RNAs both served as the genetic material and catalyzed diverse biochemical reactions. Then, proteins have gradually replaced RNAs because of their superior catalytic properties in catalysis over time. Therefore, it is important to investigate how primitive functional proteins emerged from RNA world, which can shed light on the evolutionary pathway of life from RNA world to the modern world. In this work, we proposed that the emergence of most primitive functional proteins are assisted by the early primitive nucleotide cofactors, while only a minority are induced directly by RNAs based on the analysis of RNA-protein complexes. Furthermore, the present findings have significant implication for exploring the composition of primitive RNA, i.e., adenine base as principal building blocks."
https://openalex.org/W1984914498,"The androgen receptor (AR) cofactor p44/WDR77, which regulates expression of a set of androgen target genes, is required for differentiation of prostate epithelium. Aberrant localization of p44/WDR77 in the cytoplasm is associated with prostate tumorigenesis. Here, we describe studies that used the mouse prostate and human prostate cancer cells as model systems to investigate signals that control subcellular localization of p44/WDR77. We observed distinct subcellular location of p44/WDR77 during prostate development. p44/WDR77 localizes in the cytoplasm at the early stage of prostate development, when prostate epithelial cells are rapidly proliferating, and in the nucleus in adult prostate, when epithelial cells are fully differentiated. Subcellular localization assays designed to span the entire open-reading frame of p44/WDR77 protein revealed the presence of two nuclear exclusion signal (NES) and three nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences in the p44/WDR77 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues within an NLS led to loss of nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of p44/WDR77, suggesting that nuclear localization of p44/WDR77 is essential for its function as a transcriptional cofactor for AR. Three identified NLS were not functional in AR-positive prostate cancer (LNCaP and 22RV1) cells, which led to localization of p44/WDR77 in cytoplasm. The function of NLS in LNCaP cells could be restored by factor(s) from Cos 7 or PC3 cells. Mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF/TOF) analysis identified proteins associated with an NLS and an NES in prostate cancer cells. These results provide a basis for understanding subcellular transport of p44/WDR77 during prostate development and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048948395,"Despite sharing the name and the ability to mediate mannose-sensitive adhesion, the type 1 fimbrial FimH adhesins of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli share only 15% sequence identity. In the present study, we demonstrate that even with this limited identity in primary sequence, these two proteins share remarkable similarity of complex receptor binding and structural properties. In silico simulations suggest that, like E. coli FimH, Salmonella FimH has a two-domain tertiary structure topology, with a mannose-binding pocket located on the apex of a lectin domain. Structural analysis of mutations that enhance S. Typhimurium FimH binding to eukaryotic cells and mannose-BSA demonstrated that they are not located proximal to the predicted mannose-binding pocket but rather occur in the vicinity of the predicted interface between the lectin and pilin domains of the adhesin. This implies that the functional effect of such mutations is indirect and probably allosteric in nature. By analogy with E. coli FimH, we suggest that Salmonella FimH functions as an allosteric catch bond adhesin, where shear-induced separation of the lectin and pilin domains results in a shift from a low affinity to a high affinity binding conformation of the lectin domain. Indeed, we observed shear-enhanced binding of whole bacteria expressing S. Typhimurium type 1 fimbriae. In addition, we observed that anti-FimH antibodies activate rather than inhibit S. Typhimurium FimH mannose binding, consistent with the allosteric catch bond properties of this adhesin."

Here, we report a novel technique allowing quantitative measurement of polyclonal antibody response in vivo. This involves expression of a combinatorial library of target proteins from a candidate pathogen on the surface of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After mixing with serum/plasma from infected or immunized subjects, positive yeast clones were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using this technique, we have studied mouse immunized serum with recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein from a human influenza H5N1 strain (A/Anhui/1/2005) and convalescent plasma from an infected human in China. Our technique has identified novel antigenic domains targeted by serum/plasma and allowed calculation of the relative proportion of the antibody response against each domain. We believe such systematic measurement of an antibody response is unprecedented, and applying this method to different pathogens will improve understanding of protective immunity and guide development of vaccines and therapeutics.

We believe such systematic measurement of an antibody response is unprecedented, and applying this method to different pathogens will improve understanding of protective immunity and guide development of vaccines and therapeutics. A major component of adaptive immunity is the antibody response (1Janeway Jr., C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Murphy M.K. Travers P. Immunobiology. Garland Science, New York2001Google Scholar). Polyclonal by nature, the antibody response in vivo mobilizes a dynamic and complex mixture of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting various antigenic domains on the proteins of the pathogen. Although it is known that different antigenic domains trigger fundamentally different polyclonal antibody responses, existing methods have been inadequate in specifying which antigenic domains are recognized and in measuring what proportion of the overall response is attributable to each antigenic domain (1Janeway Jr., C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Murphy M.K. Travers P. Immunobiology. Garland Science, New York2001Google Scholar, 2Burton D.R. Nat. Rev.

In many cases, disease status or vaccine efficacy can be predicted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or neutralization assays (1Janeway Jr., C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Murphy M.K. Travers P. Immunobiology. Garland Science, New York2001Google Scholar). ELISA usually measures the concentration of binding antibodies against pathogen proteins, whereas neutralizing assays measure the capability of antibodies in suppressing pathogen replication (1Janeway Jr., C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Murphy M.K. Travers P. Immunobiology. Garland Science, New York2001Google Scholar).

Nature. 2009; 458: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It is possible that antigens used to isolate these mAbs did not adequately approximate the native structure of the pathogen of interest or that the proportions of pooled antibodies were not equivalent to those in the serum. Regardless, this suggests that the polyclonal antibody response in vivo is far more complicated than simple addition of monoclonal antibodies and is beyond what the peripheral memory B cells can be accounted for in the blood. Attempts have also been made to use either peptide fragments or whole functional domains of antigens to probe polyclonal response in vivo (5Scheid J.F. Mouquet H. Feldhahn N. Seaman M.S. Velinzon K.

However, as peptide fragments are too short and the functional domains are too long, neither of these approaches has provided comprehensive results. Thus, as routine or elegant as they are, these available measures remain inadequate. Here, we report a novel technique that provides both qualitative and quantitative measurements of polyclonal antibody response in vivo. This approach involves the construction and expression of a combinatorial library of target proteins from the pathogen of interest on the surface of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Boder E.T.

Serum/plasma from infected or immunized subjects is mixed with yeast expressing these libraries. Positive yeast clones reactive to the polyclonal serum/plasma are isolated using FACS. Sequence analysis of a sufficient number of sorted single yeast clones using algorithms for sequence scanning and clustering, the antigenic domains recognized, as well as the relative proportion of the polyclonal serum reactive to those domains, can be calculated. The plasmid pCTCON2 for yeast surface display was kindly provided by Dr. K. Dane Wittrup, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (12Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat.

Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Yeast clone S. cerevisiae EBY100 was from Invitrogen (catalog no. C839-00). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) AVFluigG03 recognizing a conformational epitope within the H5N1 HA region was kindly provided by Dr. Minfang Liang, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (15Sun L. Lu X. Li C. Wang M. Liu Q. Li Z. Hu X. Li J. Liu F. Li Q. Belser J.A. Hancock K. Shu Y. Katz J.M. Liang M. Li D. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The recombinant HA was produced in insect cells using pAcGP67B baculovirus transfer vector (BD Biosciences), and peptides were synthesized at proteomic center of the Rockefeller University, New York. BALB/c mice were primed on day 0 and then boosted on day 14 and 28 intramuscularly with either peptides (ATGLRNSPLRERR-OVA, KVNSIIDKMN-KLH, and YNAELLVLMENERTLDFHD-OVA) or the ecto-domain of HA of highly pathogenic human influenza H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) identified in China (16Shu Y. Yu H. Li D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 1421-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For recombinant HA, adjuvant oil in water (Sigma adjuvant system S6322) was used throughout the immunization procedure. Approximately 20 μg/mouse was used for priming, and 10 μg/mouse was used for subsequent boosting. The serum samples were collected before and throughout the immunization procedure and stored at −80 °C until use. All procedures for animal use and care were approved by the Institutional Committee on Laboratory Animals at Tsinghua University. Convalescent plasma from H5N1 in the infected patient was obtained with informed consent (17Zhou B. Zhong N. Guan Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 1450-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The study was approved by the institution's ethics committee at Shenzhen Donghu Hospital, Shenzhen, China. The yeast surface display vector pCTCON2 was modified with additional T-overhang (pCTCON2-T) for the construction and expression of the combinatorial antigen library directly from the PCR-reassembled fragments (see below). The full-length HA gene from a human H5N1 virus in China (A/Anhui/1/2005) was PCR-amplified, purified, and then digested with DNase I to obtain fragments about 50 bp in length. These relatively small fragments were reassembled to larger 100–800-bp fragments using PCR as described previously (18Lin Z. Li S. Chen Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 515: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The reassembled products were A-tailed and ligated to the pCTCON2-T. The ligation products were transformed to the competent yeast cell line EBY100 using electroporation. Transformed cells were partially spread on SDCAA Amp plates and incubated overnight at 30 °C. The number of colonies was counted to estimate the library size. Conditions for yeast growing and induction of surface antigen expression in solution have been described previously (12Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In brief, yeasts were first grown in SDCAA media containing 20 g of dextrose, 6.7 g of Difco yeast nitrogen base, 13.6 g of Bacto casamino acids, 5.4 g of Na2HPO4·12H2O, and 8.56 g of NaH2PO4·H2O in 1 liter of deionized and sterilized H2O at 30 °C for 48 h. At the exponential growth phase, yeasts were then transferred to SGCAA media (prepared as for SDCAA, but using 20 g of galactose instead of dextrose) for induction of antigen expression at 20 °C for 36 h (12Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Induced yeast cells (106–107) were collected by centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 1 min), washed with PBS, and incubated with 50 μl of mouse sera (1:100–200 dilution), mAb AVFluIgG03, or human plasma (1:50 dilution) on ice for about 1 h with occasional agitation. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then incubated with fluorescently labeled anti-mouse or anti-human IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) on ice for another hour with occasional agitation. Finally, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and analyzed by FACS using Aria II (Biosciences). Sorted positive yeast clones were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Olympus, Japan). The sorted yeast cells were transferred to SDCAA media and grown for 24 h at 30 °C before plasmids were extracted using Omega Spin Plasmid kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc.). Isolated plasmids were sequenced and analyzed using software Sequencher 4.9 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). To analyze potential antigenic domains based on the overlapping fragment sequences, we have developed a novel computer algorithm. Obtained fragment sequences were first translated into amino acid sequences and aligned against the full-length H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) HA amino acid sequence. A sliding window of 10 amino acids was used to scan across the entire alignment from the N to C terminus one residue at a time, although the size of the window and scanning steps can be adjusted. When a window found fragment sequences containing at least five amino acid residues or was ≥50% identical to those in the full-length sequence, the position of the given window was scored based on the number of fragment sequences identified. The window containing the highest number of fragment sequences was classified as the first antigenic domain, which was then plotted based on the frequency of amino acid residues along their corresponding positions in the full-length HA sequence. The scanning process continued again from the beginning until the entire fragment sequences had been assigned to appropriate antigenic domains. For clarity, all the antigenic domains were colored and kept consistent in all of our figures and tables. The H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/05) HA structure was modeled based on the crystal structure of the highly related H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/04) HA (PDB code 2IBX). The seven antigenic domains (D1 to D7) and the stretch of 6–23 residues at the peak of each antigenic domain (P1 to P7) as well as the previously identified antigenic domains were superimposed onto the model structure. The structure figures were made with program PyMol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Fig. 1 illustrates the process. It starts with selection and PCR amplification of a target gene followed by DNase I treatment (Fig. 1, step 1) to generate the library of random fragments. The lengths of the fragments are critical in preserving the linear as well as conformational epitopes of the target protein. We achieve the desired lengths of random fragments through PCR-mediated reassembly of digested products as described previously (18Lin Z. Li S. Chen Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 515: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Once purified and provided with a 3′-A overhang, the PCR products are ligated directly (Fig. 1, step 2) to a modified yeast surface display plasmid pCTCON2-T containing a 3′-T overhang. The ligated products are then introduced into the yeast host by electroporation (Fig. 1, step 3). After mixing with serum/plasma from either infected and immunized subjects, the positive yeast clones are analyzed and sorted by FACS (Fig. 1, step 4) and then plated on agarose (Fig. 1, step 5). Single yeast clones are selected and confirmed by FACS again (Fig. 1, step 6) before they are subjected to sequencing (Fig. 1, step 7) and finally sequence and structural analysis (Fig. 1, step 8). It must be stressed why the yeast was chosen over other display systems. First, its protein expression relies on a eukaryotic host capable of post-translational modification such as glycosylation or extensive disulfide isomerization, both absent in prokaryotes. Second, it permits rapid and quantitative library screening and sorting by FACS without the need for soluble expression and purification of each individual clone. Third, it maintains the genotype-phenotype linkage allowing direct genetic characterization and manipulation of displayed proteins (12Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 14Hoogenboom H.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Using the above technique, we constructed a combinatorial library of HA protein from a human influenza H5N1 strain (A/Anhui/1/2005) in China (16Shu Y. Yu H. Li D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 1421-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A demonstrates the PCR-amplified full-length HA gene (lane 1), DNase I-digested and purified fragments (lane 2), and reassembled library fragments through 10 (lane 3) or 15 (lane 4) cycles of PCR amplification. Two PCR products were combined to generate the library with diverse yet overlapping fragments largely ranging from 100 to 800 bases. This length range has been shown to preserve conformational as well as linear antigenic domains (18Lin Z. Li S. Chen Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 515: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Based on this range, the theoretical size of the yeast library would need to be on the order of 106 to sufficiently represent the entire HA protein. In fact, this falls nicely within the capacity of the yeast surface display system (12Boder E.T. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 14Hoogenboom H.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the sorted yeast clones under the confocal microscope after mixing with serum from mice immunized with recombinant H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) HA. All sorted clones have bright and evenly distributed green fluorescence on their surface indicating that protein fragments expressed on the surface are recognizable by the antibodies in the polyclonal serum. There is, however, some variation in the size and fluorescence intensity of the different yeast clones. The former may reflect the natural changes during yeast replication, and the latter may indicate the level of protein expressed and/or preferential recognition by the serum. Differences in fluorescence intensity among different yeast clones are further confirmed by analyzing sorted single yeast clones as shown in Fig. 2C. All positive clones were then sequenced. To verify the robustness and specificity of the process, we used mouse serum immunized with three different HA peptides or a mAb (AVFluIgG03) with known epitope specificity to the H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) HA protein (15Sun L. Lu X. Li C. Wang M. Liu Q. Li Z. Hu X. Li J. Liu F. Li Q. Belser J.A. Hancock K. Shu Y. Katz J.M. Liang M. Li D. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fig. 2D demonstrates the overlapping nucleotide sequences of the positive yeast clones and their positions relative to the original full-length HA sequence used for the construction of combinatorial yeast library. The fragments selected from the peptide-immunized serum are shorter (<100 residues) compared with those selected by the mAb (≥100 residues), which recognizes a conformational rather than a linear epitope (15Sun L. Lu X. Li C. Wang M. Liu Q. Li Z. Hu X. Li J. Liu F. Li Q. Belser J.A. Hancock K. Shu Y. Katz J.M. Liang M. Li D. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We used a computer algorithm to scan the selected sequences for the most frequently recognized stretches of amino acid residues (Fig. 2E). The peptide-immunized sera yielded high frequency residues that, upon close examination, are known peptide immunogens. In contrast, the high frequency residues yielded by the mAb include a much broader range, because of its more complex structural recognition (15Sun L. Lu X. Li C. Wang M. Liu Q. Li Z. Hu X. Li J. Liu F. Li Q. Belser J.A. Hancock K. Shu Y. Katz J.M. Liang M. Li D. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results reinforced the validity and accuracy of our approach in identifying both conformational as well as linear antigenic domains. It also verified that antibodies recognizing long fragments (≥100 residues) select conformational domains, whereas those recognizing short fragments (<100 residues) select linear domains. We have therefore used 100 residues as an arbitrary standard to distinguish linear or conformational domains selected by the polyclonal serum/plasma (see below). In our study, three separate mouse serum samples were used. One was a serum mix (sM) from five immunized mice, with equal contribution from each animal. The other two (sA and sB) were part of the five but unmixed. A total of 89, 55, and 78 positive yeast clones were selected and sequenced from the sM, sA, and sB samples, respectively. Fig. 3A demonstrates the overlapping nucleotide sequences obtained from the positive yeast clones and their positions along the H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005) HA sequence. These fragment sequences were found to represent the entire HA sequence but with clear variations among the three samples and bias toward certain regions within each. In all these samples, however, more of the fragment sequences identified were from the HA1 region than the HA2 region, suggesting more polyclonal antibody responses were against HA1 region in these animals. This finding is in complete agreement with earlier reports in which different adult BALB/C and CBA/Ca mice express distinct antibody repertoires to the same HA protein (19Smith C.A. Barnett B.C. Thomas D.B. Temoltzin-Palacios F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Staudt L.M. Gerhard W. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 687-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further characterize the polyclonal antibody responses against HA1 and HA2, we translated all nucleotide sequences into amino acids (Fig. 3B). In each of the three samples, the number of amino acids recognized by the serum is greater in the HA1 region than in the HA2 region, reflected by the area under the curve (AUC) 2The abbreviation used is: AUCarea under the curve. (Fig. 3B). In sM, for example, it is estimated that 74% of AUC corresponds to HA1 and the remaining 26% to HA2. In other words, HA1 is about three times more recognizable by the serum than HA2. Similarly, the ratios of AUC between HA1 and HA2 in sA and sB were 84:16% and 60:40%, respectively (Fig. 3B). Such biased recognition is unlikely the result of HA1 merely being longer than HA2, as the ratio of AUC for each sample is significantly different from the statistically expected value of 1.8 (329 versus 186 residues). area under the curve. We next analyzed the linear versus conformational antigenic domains within HA1 and HA2 based on the length of the fragments selected. The deduced amino acid sequences were separated into short (<100 residues) and the long (≥100 residues) fragments (Fig. 3, C and D) as they are likely selected out by the polyclonal antibodies recognizing either the linear or conformational epitopes, as shown above (Fig. 2, D and E). Short fragments corresponding to several discrete antigenic domains within HA1 and HA2 were identified by computer algorithm for sequence scanning and clustering (Fig. 3C). Domains 2, 5, and 7 are shared among the three samples, and domains 1, 4, and 6 are shared between sM and sA. Domain 3 was only identified in sM. This is expected as sM is the mixture, including sA and sB. In contrast, no discrete antigenic domains could be identified among long fragments, although some regions within the HA1 and HA2 are preferentially recognized (Fig. 3D). We further analyzed potential linear and conformational antigenic domains recognized by the convalescent plasma from a H5N1 (A/Anhui/1/2005)-infected human. A total of 81 positive yeast clones were selected and sequenced. The top panel in Fig. 4 demonstrates the nucleotide and amino acid data. To our surprise, significantly more fragments were identified in HA2 (80% AUC) than in HA1 (20% AUC). The deduced amino acid sequences were separated into short (<100 residues) and long (≥100 residues) fragments and subjected to sequence scanning and clustering algorithms (Fig. 4, middle panel). Within the short fragments, domain 7 was exceedingly dominant (Fig. 4, middle left panel). This dominance was partially mirrored within the long fragments, as the AUC for HA1 and HA2 regions are 38 and 62%, respectively (Fig. 4, middle right panel). Finally, we compared our results with those reported by Khurana et al. (11Khurana S. Suguitan Jr., A.L. Rivera Y. Simmons C.P. Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Manischewitz J. King L.R. Subbarao K. Golding H. PLoS Med. 2009; 6: e1000049Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) where the antigenic fragments of a different H5N1 strain (A/Vietna"
https://openalex.org/W2089963361,"Production of reactive species in neutrophils exposed to hyperoxia causes S-nitrosylation of β-actin, which increases formation of short actin filaments, leading to alterations in the cytoskeletal network that inhibit β(2) integrin-dependent adherence (Thom, S. R., Bhopale, V. M., Mancini, D. J., and Milovanova, T. N. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 10822-10834). In this study, we found that vasodilator-stimulated protein (VASP) exhibits high affinity for S-nitrosylated short filamentous actin, which increases actin polymerization. VASP bundles Rac1, Rac2, cyclic AMP-dependent, and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases in close proximity to short actin filaments, and subsequent Rac activation increases actin free barbed end formation. Using specific chemical inhibitors or reducing cell concentrations of any of these proteins with small inhibitory RNA abrogates enhanced free barbed end formation, increased actin polymerization, and β(2) integrin inhibition by hyperoxia. Alternatively, incubating neutrophils with formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine or 8-bromo-cyclic GMP activates either cyclic AMP-dependent or cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively, outside of the short F-actin pool and phosphorylates VASP on serine 153. Phosphorylated VASP abrogates the augmented polymerization normally observed with S-nitrosylated actin, VASP binding to actin, elevated Rac activity, and elevated formation of actin free barbed ends, thus restoring normal β(2) integrin function."
https://openalex.org/W2127185316,"The epithelial Ca(2+) channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) constitutes the apical entry site for active Ca(2+) reabsorption in the kidney. The TRPV5 channel is a member of the TRP family of cation channels, which are composed of four subunits together forming a central pore. Regulation of channel activity is tightly controlled by the intracellular N and C termini. The TRPV5 C terminus regulates channel activity by various mechanisms, but knowledge regarding the role of the N terminus remains scarce. To study the role of the N terminus in TRPV5 regulation, we generated different N-terminal deletion constructs. We found that deletion of the first 32 residues did not affect TRPV5-mediated (45)Ca(2+) uptake, whereas deletion up to residue 34 and 75 abolished channel function. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that these mutant channels were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and in contrast to wild-type TRPV5 did not reach the Golgi apparatus, explaining the lack of complex glycosylation of the mutants. A limited amount of mutant channels escaped the endoplasmic reticulum and reached the plasma membrane, as shown by cell surface biotinylation. These channels did not internalize, explaining the reduced but significant amount of these mutant channels at the plasma membrane. Wild-type TRPV5 channels, despite significant plasma membrane internalization, showed higher plasma membrane levels compared with the mutant channels. The assembly into tetramers was not affected by the N-terminal deletions. Thus, the N-terminal residues 34-75 are critical in the formation of a functional TRPV5 channel because the deletion mutants were present at the plasma membrane as tetramers, but lacked channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2157196385,"Immature Purkinje neurons are particularly vulnerable cells. They survive in cerebellar slice cultures under treatment by the synthetic steroid mifepristone (RU486) that depolarizes them at this age. The present study aims at understanding the mechanism underlying this neuroprotective effect. In the developing cerebellum, the role of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neuron survival is unknown. In 3-d-old mouse cerebellar slice cultures, we show that GABA(A) receptor activation is depolarizing and excitatory. Antagonists of GABA(A) receptors rescue Purkinje neurons, demonstrating that GABA is endogenously released in this preparation and is toxic. Mifepristone likely protects these neurons by reversing GABA(A) receptor-mediated chloride fluxes and reducing their driving force. Neuroprotection by mifepristone is dose-dependently decreased by the agonist of GABA(A) receptors muscimol and by caffeine, an agonist of internal calcium store release. Moreover, the survival induced by neomycin, an inhibitor of calcium release, is partially reversed by muscimol. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB239063 also rescues Purkinje neurons. In summary, we propose that when GABA is depolarizing, mifepristone protects Purkinje neurons by shunting GABA responses and probably chloride fluxes, by inhibiting p38 MAPK activity and likely internal calcium store release. A new and nonhormonal effect of mifepristone is thus revealed."
https://openalex.org/W1974047868,"In this work, we set out to identify and characterize the calcium occluded intermediate(s) of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) to study the mechanism of calcium transport. To this end, we developed a procedure for measuring the occlusion of Ca(2+) in microsomes containing PMCA. This involves a system for overexpression of the PMCA and the use of a rapid mixing device combined with a filtration chamber, allowing the isolation of the enzyme and quantification of retained calcium. Measurements of retained calcium as a function of the Ca(2+) concentration in steady state showed a hyperbolic dependence with an apparent dissociation constant of 12 ± 2.2 μM, which agrees with the value found through measurements of PMCA activity in the absence of calmodulin. When enzyme phosphorylation and the retained calcium were studied as a function of time in the presence of La(III) (inducing accumulation of phosphoenzyme in the E(1)P state), we obtained apparent rate constants not significantly different from each other. Quantification of EP and retained calcium in steady state yield a stoichiometry of one mole of occluded calcium per mole of phosphoenzyme. These results demonstrate for the first time that one calcium ion becomes occluded in the E(1)P-phosphorylated intermediate of the PMCA."
